0	as a stag venue you couldn ’ t really ask for more and if you put your faith in party_krakow you won ’ t be disappointed .
2	service , and delivery , ever so fast .

2	i bought a chromed corner fitment for bath toiletries and it is beautiful .
0	quick delivery .
2	i would definitely_use this company again and have no_hesitation in recommending them .
2	regular flyers know that this is because they always exaggerate the length of the flight time !
2	the block did turn_up a few mins later , i pointed_out there a white paint on my seat , he said oh perhaps it '_s was already there .
2	phone_calls no reply , even left messages , until he decided to pickup the phone on 0th mar .

2	we needed an angle grinder to cut_off seized bolts and intuition that was not in the instructions to build the doors and door frames .
2	?.
0	most of the purchases track , but its easy to raise a claim if they don ' t .
2	several days of parcel0go telling_me that " myhermes would not respond within 00_hours " ensued .
2	if i have one small grumble it is the cost of delivery - £ 0 +_vat = £ 0 . 00 for two small lightweight products .
2	they have no customer service techniques which is very disapointing .
2	i find the fact i purchased my mobile and they didnt give me my cashback i should have earnt they are obviously very decietful they promise something and give you nothing and before they try to say i didnt buy the phone i have the reciept for £_00 . 00 and the phone i will not be using this company again and will be advising friends and family against it

2	i also was given the wrong_size washing powder .
2	ordering online in the early hours of the morning after a late - night terminal breakdown of my washing_machine i was able to go to sleep reassured that i would have one two days_later , having chosen free delivery .

2	the day after i put my details online i received posting instructions .
2	a couple of weeks_later re - sent the letter as an attachment to the complaints form on their web - site , but still received no reply .
0	i have purchased from china before and i do always expect a long shipping time , from purchase to receiving my item was over two_weeks ( in business days ) this was fine but it is slightly annoying that the company make promises they do not fulfil .
2	i '_ve also used their returns_procedure and had good service from them with my e_- mail query quickly responded to and my account being credited promptly .
2	again , it felt a little less_than warm . great website and great products and ( though they have no_idea ) i have been a customer of this business for over ten_years .
0	!
2	small item , posted very quickly and great communication .
0	i recieced email_updates_throughout the process and was kept up to date with when they were dispatched and delivered .
0	i then came home half a hour later to realise there was only 0 boxes not 0 and the mirror was missing .
2	customer_focused supplier that delivers !
2	i ordered a canon_000d camera body from simplyelectronics on the tuesday_evening .
0	i wouldn ' t recommend buying anything from this company .
0	after complaint i am now getting ads with " dear occupier ." instead of my details .
2	great that they have exactly_what you need and they really do deliver quickly , but to charge £ 0 . 00 for a plastic moulded part that at most cost £ 0 . 00 to make is crazy , and leaves you feeling you have been the object of highway robbery .
0	it ' s not simply a percentage off the full price but nearly half the cost .
0	how did i receive a confirmation_email from crytsal travel if my payment didnt go through ?
2	their service over the last few orders has_been poor .

2	good selection of music fast delivery just what i was looking for .
0	the ct 000h f sport surpassed my expectations altogether - considering it ' s top fuel economy , it had a very surprising high performance drive too !
0	i decided to get the loss insurance as an added extra , despite my being a student and therefore unbelievably poor .
0	the instructions say you must confirm your booking with merchant a minimum of a week prior to the event , however it is impossible to reach the merchant as they never answer or return calls left on their machine and their email addresses don ' t work .
2	this is important to buyers !
0	i was offered a 00_% reduction , which i laughed at , then 00 %, which i laughed harder at .
2	the company has over promised and under delivered on just about everything .
2	now it '_s ultra sophisticated , with signatures required , text_messages indicating time of delivery ( academic to me , as i ' m out working anyway ) and opt - outs to leave the bags ( which they can '_t do first time )
0	if that comes through then fair_enough but still not good enough .
0	item arrived the day after i ordered them .
2	bought 0 strip lights via_ebay , the photo showed 0 tubes inside the lights , the description referred to " tubes " plural , therefore its acceptable and perfectly reasonable for me to rely_on the phot & description - which i duly did .
0	i ordered 0 corsair 000d cases for me and my little bros build , after ordering it and reading the reviews i was really afraid if it would happen to me and after that i was trying to get a refund they said they were gonna dispatch it already they said i can refuse delivery and get a refund i said nvm ill keep the item .
0	if i could give less_than 0 star , i would have .
2	city_link asked me to contact them after_reading this review ,
2	very easy product to use with excellent results .
0	my experence with pixmania was excellent .
2	i for one will never use them again . goodbye sereneta , go and ruin someone_else '_s day !
2	at first they said i could get varifocal_lenses , however this was later changed to single_vision lenses due to my right eye .
0	i love this website !
2	the choice of viewing offered on the instant service is very poor indeed , netflix , although new to the uk , has more current offerings than lovefilm instant ( that i would want to watch ).
2	another new bottle of which the cap was also at great risk of exploding .
2	we needed currency at short_notice , and i went to my local post_office to buy it , having first checked their rates online .
2	this is the first time i have ever been given such a precise 0 hour delivery schedule and it was bang on time .
0	i think eventually , another store will come up and replace this one if the bulk buying doesn ' t stop .
2	handled things ago as it it was more completed then usual hade to chnge equity company .
2	good communication .
2	you do have to wait for some items , as they are being made for you , but it is always well_worth the wait !
2	), blase scripted responses to enquiries , complete disregard for the cost to the customer of phone_calls and time off work , and complete_lack of anyone with balls making interventions to put right what they have done wrong .
0	?
2	yes for bicycles , camping equipment etc .
2	i will absolutely buy my next camera from them , too !
0	but beware as you ' ll soon discover the limited scope of what ' s available .
2	!
2	other_firms offer the day before gauranteed odds as ladbrokes used too .
0	obviously some dirty tactics to extort customers rather_than provide a good service for them .
2	the next_day we looked outside what a " f *** ing mess .
2	the response links you send do not work on email only on an iphone .
2	great convenience and value .
0	i just want a non automated straight answer , which from these other reviews is looking like i ' m out of luck .
2	somehow i don_'_t think this reflects the original vision and passion with which martha lane fox established the company and i ' m_sure she would be mortified if she knew how they treat their customers today .
0	groupon then refused to compensate use for their error and even accept any responsibility - it took use almost a month to get our money back .
2	very good prices , delivery on the slow side , stated delivery 0 - 0 working_days , ordered am on tuesday phoned on friday they say delivery next monday , we shall see
0	0 .- the guarantee terms are not clear or transparent , dont say nothing about some third_party software of comon use like malwarebytes free , and dont say nothing about the people who dont live on usa
0	i declined as i wanted to look_into this myself , and when i got home discovered that you do indeed get a ( slightly retricted ) version of ms office whith word and excel - more_than enough for my mum .
2	that is what it should say on their checkout basket .
0	i had two problems with a single order .
2	ok i have only used it once , but i was given a tracking_number as i dropped the parcel off .
2	the radio was shown as ' in stock ' ( in two places on the website ) and it was stated that it would be dispatched via courier if the order was placed before 00 . 00 .
2	why for 0 weeks did the tracking of my order status state left base out for delivery .
0	however , my disgust has only increased after finally seeing the flowers which were delivered to my friend yesterday .
2	!
2	great products , i always really enjoy looking through the myprotein site and choosing different supplements !!
0	i will not rest until they accept_responsibility .
0	the website is really easy to use and they send the envelops for you really quick !
2	!
2	on the basic package there is only 0 hours online viewing allowed per_month , not much is available online , and the " we have every dvd " pledge is fiction .
0	on a motorway that would take a car about an_hour and a half .
2	they lure you in with a low price then make you view add on after add on until the price is 00 times what you expect .
0	but they never really impress me with anything , no do they disappoint .
0	right off to screwfix i go to get the item i was after !
0	i would recommend them to anyone !
2	flowers were a little disappointing as the lilies were not in bloom so they looked less substantial than a supermarket bouquet for less_than half the price .
2	i have no_idea how companies like this stay in business .
0	very surprised how fast my order was delivered .
2	i felt i did not have time provided for me to ask any questions or go off process , if you get my drift .
0	you suck opodo . never using you ever again .

2	she - ' no , they must have put you through '.
2	they took the cost out of my bank_account and when i complained they refused to refund the full_amount and charged me £_00 . 00 as a cancellation_fee despite the fact that i had been kept waiting for almost 0 hours and i did not cancel my booking - enterprise wanted more money than i had agreed to pay .
0	looking back on it i wished i had just spent a little extra money and made this build myself knowing that everything will work as it should .
2	t - mobile do have a pretty good technical team , and over the past 0 years they have responded very well to most of my questions .
2	no_complaints from customers .
2	do have to call an engineer you will have to jump_through many hoops ,
2	all to no_avail .
0	original review :
2	very pleased with the work tops .
2	had to call to ask . apparently one item out of stock , so order withheld ?
0	i ' m not sure what database or system they use but like other customers have said , nothing seems to be recorded so everyone i get passed to , i have to explain the whole situation again from start to finish . how frustrating !!
2	i have nothing bad to say at all about mazuma , quite the opposite they provide an excellent service which is first_class .
0	service from infrun was also top_notch , very prompt delivery and easy to use website .
0	sent this parcel using them , it all broken and damage , asked for pictures and everything and finally they refused the claim for reason that parcel had glass on it !!!!!

0	simple and fuss free , great !
2	i am still_waiting for that phone_call .
2	they started telling_me that i needed to photocopy bank statements to prove it .
0	amazingly speedy !
0	all in all i will consider ordering again from them in the future but they need to work on the areas i have mentioned
0	i ordered some bouquets on mothers_day itself and requested them by phone to do same day delivery .
0	took me 0 hours to remove it .
0	we were asked to go to the hertz_desk there for pick_up .
0	it should never have left the depot given it was walking out of the boxes it was " packed " in .
0	no full pre_- payment .
2	!
0	long_story short : he sends them back . i have to refund the buyer . i lose $_000 in shipping cost !. and so does he !
2	i don_'_t find tesco an enjoyable shopping_experience - large hangar like store with a muddled layout .
0	i havent decided whether to use them yet , still_awaiting a couple more samples .
0	very good flights fast and cheap this service is advised especially going to gran_canaria
2	honesly , i got great insurance at a great price .
2	i ' d prefer the rental company to deal direct with the insurance company with proof of cover being provided on vehicle pick - up so the renter would never be out of pocket .
2	despatched 0st may , actually got delivered 0th_may - not good these days .
0	people , go to airbnb who offer the same service but cheaper and far more professional or top of the range , vrbo . com and homeaway . com who are light years ahead of this shambolic outfit .
0	i received an_email_confirming delivery would be today .
2	i heartily_recommend them an i will_definitely be using them again soon .
2	side by side there is nothing to choose between the £_000 pair from the high_street i recently got , and my £_00 pair from glasses0you .
0	i placed two orders on the 00th of june with ccl .
0	my only reason for not giving more stars is their after - sales support .
2	very pleased with the quality and price of these products and delivery too .
0	but did they then only ask me to send a picture so they could send the correct leg ( why was i not asked this a week before when i called ) it then arrived 0 days_later ( waiting int total for 00 days without using a table ) to which when the leg arrived it was the wrong_colour and wrong_size .
2	i have since got computers from a well - known on - line and high - street retailer for a lot of friends and friends on my recommendation have gone there instead of g0 and they have all been more than happy and believe it or not they are cheaper as well .
2	placed an order for over £_00 on 00th_october wasn_'_t dispatched until the 00nd .
2	you should return my money with paypal and stop messing me around .

2	!
0	but when it arrived , it didn ' t arrive with the free_shaker it was promised with .
2	!
0	they did not send complimentary gifts what they boast about while charging for shipping .
0	couple that with the customer_service i ' ve been through and well . you ' re reading this now , aren ' t you ?
2	i was very happy with the lowest quote and the courier it was from had very good feedback from other customers .
2	prices are now at the best so so , the staff seem to think of customers as a burden to be shrugged off at the earliest_opportunity and returns are made to be very difficult even_though they often replace the item you have ordered with a ' similar ' item the brand_name of which you have never_heard .
2	not sure if i will order from them again due to this .
0	whats even better is all of the free_merchandise and discounted items they have !
0	i then get told by hayley it would be paid in my bank as soon as finance guy ( kumar ) comes in to the office , at 0 . 00pm , still no refund .
2	very good delivery considering how far it came , and i could track it all the way .
2	gumtree is a jungle which is not helped by their own systems which are inadequate .
0	just_eat is an innovative concept that helps take_aways work better and to keep the customer satisfied , never has a take away been judge only by word of mouth , with just_eat you can look at reviews of other customers and decide yourself if its worth paying for .
0	i have been here a few_times and thought it was good value for some product but not others .
2	have had no_problems with the goods or purchase process from this company and previous purchases have arrived_safely .
0	but form your own opinions , just going on my personal experiences there .
2	i ' m off after yet another failed collection .
0	he agreed .
0	i have ordered from allfancydress in the past and been really pleased with my order .
0	it can be slow , a lot of the time .
2	prepayment gets you into the lt car_park ; the barrier opens ok and you get an entry ticket .
0	i have been with orange for many years and have high usage .
0	i even spoke to them before the weekend but they said rest_assured they will arrive in time .

0	avoid
2	after ordering received email some 0 days_later to inform me of paypal refund . no explaination as to why ?
2	i had an extremely distasteful first - time experience with viagogo when buying e_- tickets for a concert .
0	i needed to return an item , but didn ' t have my delivery note as i had already returned an item from that order .
2	new laptop arrived exactly when advised and the communication from the delivery company was very organised .
2	!
2	i had a word with the manager at congleton cheshire store he was rude so i complained , my complaint was dealt_with quickly i received a letter to explain that they would look into it , but i must_say the manager can '_t have improved his ways with the staff they seem to stand about more than ever , talking or talking to each other whilst serving and what really annoys_me when the staff slow down the conveyor belts to serve slower and create longer queues in the aisle .
2	thank_you .
0	would ' nt give them half star either .
0	it ' s one of the few companies out there that absolutely do everything right .
2	they did honour the guarantee and 0 weeks_later i was posted a new ssd . but is was a re - manufactured one and was covered in a glue like substance .
0	they then charged me a early termination_fee .
0	ordered a dunoon mug for my mum overseas , package arrived in fantastic packaging ( i was nervous with it being breakable ) but was very satisfied and arrived within 0 days which was perfect .
0	i don ' t usually bother writing reviews of companies , but in this instance felt_compelled to share my experience with others .
2	sometimes a little_slow in supply me withmupdates .
2	the price is right
2	just to update you all these_clowns have just refunded me in full
2	in my opinion they have purchased a consignment of brackets , a00blk which they are unable to sell due to the inherent design faults of only having 0 hole wall - fixings , vertically spaced , with a narrow seating area .
2	i ordered an item on the friday_afternoon and it was delivered on the saturday_morning , what a fast service that was and i will most definately recommend you to every one i know .
2	thank_you for your company . so much_better_than traipsing around the shops .
2	why dont you try iflorist ?
2	after promising immediate delivery nothing has_been heard of from them in the last three_weeks .
0	if i had been shown an example of what is involved in getting my glasses i would have felt sooo much_better .
2	we have had several chairs from this company .
0	i simply cannot_fault the service provided .
0	i called their customer_service and was told that the line was ceased due to a ' system error ' while broadband due to severe weather_conditions , which i obviously knew was an utter_rubbish .
2	stop ?
0	had to cancel train tickets and hotel stay in london of the friday as travelling from newcastle so i could pick_up tickets the next_day .
0	thanks dino_pc , i will reuse your service in the future and recommend you to all of my friends when they decide to upgrade !
2	i placed an order on saturday for 0xbasin taps !
2	the deal ended that day so although i couldn_'_t really afford it until the following week i paid for it .
0	i would recommend that online shoppers do not touch this company with a bargepole as my experience with them has taught me this .
2	eventually i called the phone , spoke to the proprietor and he couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
2	firstly , icuk are a bt reseller .
2	probably the fault of the supplier rather_than discountedheating , but better communication between all parties may have helped .
2	the person can only deal with sales enquiries , not technical , goodbye , thanks for calling .
2	. at skulle rate en service man ikke kender eller har brugt for at kunne deltage i en konkurrence
2	it broke within 0 weeks - complained through amazon , which took me a few_days how to work it all out as so complicated and got the response from the company after they took 0 days to reply - that as i ' d had bed for 00 days i wasn_'_t entitled to a refund !
0	they haven ' t respected the customer ' s information , tell the third_party anything whether it ' s private or not .
0	vervolgens hebben we gewacht , we zijn aan het lijntje gehouden .
0	i maybe being a tad rude here but it ' s a cross between a mmo , ' services ', site and a online store .
2	sent and faxed more security confirmation information than requested and still opodo couldn_'_t deliver .
2	the tyre_fitting went well .
2	indigo thomas jacket arrived very quickly .
2	we are so angry about this we will take it up with customer_services and complaints_dept tomorrow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	steve mcglynn
2	the owner made every effort to ensure that everything_ran smoothly for our stay .
0	my complaints began about 00months ago with emails i sent not being received and no bounce backs ( this caused a lot of trouble and i lost business as a result ).
2	i was very impressed both with her and with the table and chairs in their showroom .
2	on line site was easy to navigate from finding the item i required to paying for it , kept me informed all the way to actual delivery by tracking my item what a great combination the two companies have for pleasing their customers from start to finish .
0	recently flew with ryanair and to be on the safe side opted for a baggage_allowance so not to be stung with added fees at the airport .
0	i called first thing in the morning yesterday ( wednesday ( to ask where the tickets are and when i would receive them and asked them to call me back the same day for an update .
2	i ordered my glasses and received them in 0 separate lots .
0	has been with me many years .
2	i have completely given up dealing_with maplin .
0	shipping is very fast .
0	i have since read on the internet that this company has stolen money from lots of people and yet they are promoted through wowcher ?
0	i did inform him of my slight dissatisfaction when he cleared our plates and he was very apologetic so we decided to stay for dessert and further drinks .
0	bought 0 items , motherboard , ddr0 ram and i0 cpu processor .
0	how embarrassing , not so much for me ( i ' m just a little furious ) but certainly embarrassing for her .
0	i ' m giving them 0_stars as the customer_service team were always very quick to reply though not always being_able to provide the information i requested .
0	unfortunately due to the nature of our business we can sometimes be delayed and miss or be late for an_appointment , however out of over 00 000 jobs a year that we carry out , this happens with less_than 0 %.
2	i cannot possibly tell the sender how awful the flowers were .
2	david_: in the end its yodels loss , i will write lots of reviews and post them , you will lose my business and many others for the incompetence yodel has shown .
0	so why three stars ?
0	the delivery was quick and the price was slightly_cheaper_than what i pay from my opticians
2	so would i buy again or recommend park_cameras , possibly .
2	all in all a total disgrace , would never use them again .
0	never had any_issues with payment , delivery or any other part of the service .
2	great hairpiece i can just put my own hair up in a ponytail then clip on ponytail attachment , hair looks great !
2	can you please confirm the customers full name ?
2	when constructing found that 0 piece had been incorrectly drilled and was unable to continue .
0	i ' m sure offcom will be absoloutly thrilled to look_into yet another one of your complaints that are going to go legal .
0	will be giving them a call monday to voice my concerns because a £_000_+ graphics_card not screwed to the case and not seated correctly is something they need to speak to the engineer about .
0	if its not the cheapest place to find your supplement_needs , they will match your price .
0	shopto quickly send a new copy of the game out , however did not credit my postage back , so am a bit annoyed about that !
2	ideal if your a chav . tacky stuff
0	i have booked quite far in_advance and as such i will need more time to fully review this company and will update accordingly further down the line .
0	also , while booking i was required to provide a phone number -- i rarely have a phone available while travelling .
2	delivered very quickly too .
0	other_companies that i have used can take up to two_weeks to assess the phone and issue the voucher , i had this voucher two days after posting my phone .
2	however it is heavy and as we are now retired it may not get turned as often as suggested , although we will probably be able to rotate it for some years yet .
2	highly_recommended .
2	my full name appears with this review and i am more than happy to share my experience with this dreadful company .
0	i ' ve been using quidco for a few_years now but have really started to use it more intensely recently .
2	very easy to use .
0	special thanks to ms . gill .

2	excellant sevice all_round . i have used viovet for around 00 months now , their service either by phone or internet is second to none . the viovet team are always helpful .
2	i am glad it was only a short trip though , as they do squeeze a lot of seats on one plane , so it was a tight fit .
2	they were delivered the next_day
0	great booking experience !
2	a company that seems to spend most of its time defending itself from negative_feedback has more problems that it cares to admit to in public .
0	it has occurred to me that the choice not to make tickets available for collection until the very last moment may be to enable them to resell the seats to someone_else at a higher price , and then give me a refund so they can make a profit leaving me none the wiser .
2	but in general the computer looks great , performs great and i am very
0	my order was paid for , for express delivery and according to yodels website , was due to be delivered on 00 . 0 . 00 .

2	thanks for nothing . dont trust this lot .£ 0000 up in smoke , can '_t began to tell you how bad i feel , just put it down to experience .
0	however one of the faces from the front looks quite warped and ugly compared to the photo .
2	they even lied and said they ' d been to the address and that the item had been collected !!!
0	i trust on comodo like product and ideology , but , i think must improve in that cuestions .
2	well_done .
2	after sending questions to giffgaf over many days , they asked me to supply them my emei number from the phone which they still have not un - barred my phone after 0 month .
2	august_0000 .
0	when i placed the order i was informed they would be ready for collection from my local_store the next_day .
2	so because they wanted to save £ 0 , i needed to find about £_000 until their refund worked its way back and someone felt the urge to send me a cheque which of course would take a further 0 days to clear and mean i had to travel 00 miles to a bank to pay it in .
0	finally , after 0 weeks , address was changed . hoping the tickets come through .
0	!
0	they have the full range of products and are the same price that i paid in the supermarket .
2	i have complained twice and am still_awaiting a response from customer service .
0	sticking with evans next time as they will match any wiggle price anyway .
2	and fitted in more of the other_places we missed going .
2	emailed again - still no reply !

2	each time i fill in the on line sell form , the return envelope is on my doormat the day after .
2	i have been a registered lindy client for ages and lindy know my home address so i can '_t understand_why i wasn_'_t informed as i attempted to complete the transaction .
2	thought we could find a cheap , quick & easy way to unlock , however this is sadly not the case with ee .
2	i am waiting now , this is quite frustrating as i know how this works as i do refunds myself for online customers and know that this kind of communication is simply unacceptable .
0	good ill bay again
0	perfect in every way .
2	when my fingers won_'_t work , the easy push button wheels are easy to get on or off or to change from city to off road rough terrain .
2	same answer !
2	this company have wrecked my home .
2	webtog '_s website was clear and intuitively laid_out .
0	change that and it will be 0_stars !
2	i am pretty sure i will only be using this company from now on .
0	i booked through booking . com because it worked out £ 0 per_person cheaper however i was not aware that they do not take they full payment straight_away so i am now out of pocket and i will not be booking through booking . com again .

0	i ring up ( 00p a minute !)
2	local parcelfarce depot has a little man with a big chip on the shoulder as depot manager and every delivery from them is a problem - the deliveries are made , but with the most awful attitude , with the driver being as unpleasant as possible and intimidating to my partner , an older woman , who has_been upset by their yobbish behaviour a few_times now .
2	was charged over double what the tickets actually cost ,
0	they seem to be more of a promoter now than a seller , most items i look at are sold by third parties , if i wanted that , i ' d be on ebay .
0	upon phoning the shop the gentleman was very friendly and managed to find my package and promised to get a tracking_number sent to me that worked .
2	i cannot_praise this company highly_enough .
0	they ' v got a life long customer in me .

0	i wrote to them at_least ten times and all they said was " tough " well tough on you tiscali , here ' s my review of you
0	i was expecting my parcel to be damaged or not arrive at all .
0	i ' ve still got about 00 months on my contract with them , but i ' m more_than tempted to fork_out how ever many hundreds of pounds it ' ll cost to be rid of them for good .
2	i use it all the time to send books all over the world and have never had cause to complain .
0	i found the phone support to be fairly good , explaining everything i wanted to know about their new services .
2	eventually we took it and arrived to find stipulated single beds in all rooms was not what was there .
0	of course plenty of good businesses are run from homes but it was a point of concern since i could find out very little else about them .
0	too quality firm .
0	i ' m lucky in a sense as this phones contract is up next month but i will be keeping an eye out for any marketing / sms sign_up texts in the next month .
2	efficient order and despatch notification process .
2	a bit strange since one of the items i was missing was details of an extended_warranty that i was looking to take out with them .
2	00th_november received text saying panel will be delivered tomorrow between 0000 and 0000hrs - do they assume we are just sitting at home waiting at their beck and call ?
2	the administrative contact has also changed to @ domainbox . net by the way is a company that
0	to top it off they are sending a cheque , resulting in a trip to the bank .
2	i ordered some items at short_notice for our royal wedding street party and my order arrived the day before , perfect timing !
0	the quality of the materials , fabrics are so low , they looked great on the model , but what i received was so badly tailored .
0	though my concern with their company is the shipping this is my second order through them simply because the price is cheaper , but tomorrow , in regards to my first order , will have been a week .
0	okay the failed delivery wasnt their fault that time and they did leave a valid referenced card - well_done .
2	a quick facebook message quoting my problem resulted_in a very quick reply from sam ( on a sunday ) and further messages on the bank_holiday monday .
0	and that is what my laptop is , using a lot of music software being_able to customise has improved , my overall productivity .
2	that has put me off now as i always read the reviews but it seems they only publish the good ones so you think the product is good but that may not be everybody '_s opinion .
2	i noticed that the dates had defaulted to the date i had made the booking .
0	now i wouldn ' t think_twice when looking to purchase any further photographic equipment .
2	there '_s no clear outside dining space unless you want to sit at the bottom of the garden and the barbecue area is the other side of the garden .
0	ordered a barca strip for my sons_birthday waited 0 days then checked online tracking and said it was delivered to my ' porch ' 0 days ago .
2	half turn valve tap .
2	when you have little time to shop for a number of animals , i found everything i needed in pet_supermarket .
0	after pointing_out it was their lack of fulfilment for next_day delivery and that i refused to pay the saturday surcharge , they agreed to cover this charge ) that was 0 weeks_ago .
2	on the whole i find the staff in the hull branch very friendly but yes i agree it can be a bit manic at the cash out if you ' re not speedy . fortunately i ' m not disabled ot very elderly , so i manage .
0	responded to one claiming that they can ' t see the print screens of the websites that i had to put in my email .
0	i booked tickets through 00tickets . com even_though i had not purchased any tickets before .
2	if you are not in a rush , might be worth the risk , but vb need to be more honest about their delivery status and stock_levels .
0	what other way would you suggest to trace and block fraudsters and spammers ?
2	i have spent a lot of money with this company over the past few_months , and have several orders still pending , and overall was quite happy with the goods and service .
0	booking . com contacted me on the day of the first night stay and asked why i had cancelled my reservation , i advised i hadn ’ t and the apartments didn ’ t accept my reservation because i am from a birmingham post code .
0	0 / 0_stars given .
2	did that but again no e_- mail response .
0	as i said we all had an amazing weekend and this in no way ruined it but i feel that hen_heaven should be much more transparent then they are .
0	very poor service .
2	i had a mix - up over postage_costs , and it was resolved immediately with zero hassle - a treat to deal with .
0	second time i was in the house the whole day , i was down stairs next to my drive window and no vans arrived yet tracker said consignee could not be reached !
2	yes , i complained and yes they investigated and apologised .
0	booking and payment was really easy but the sms service is totally pointless .
2	i have also purchased a laptop from their sister company save on laptops and had a similar experience .
0	if something happens to my order ( for better or for worse ), i will make_sure to make another review .
2	i bought an item which they showed as available .
2	all i want is what i paid for , which cost to me quite a lot of money and took some time to save i want new fault free good is this too much to ask .
0	the pricing is always competitive and their service always exceeds expectation .
0	lets_see how that goes then !

0	they are great !
0	i would never consider_using or recommending this company .
0	want to be given no support , even when the terminals are not working in the manner they were sold to you ?
2	no mention of other emails sent to them or any kind of definitive answer to the ongoing saga !
2	i was drawn to an_email which gave me a link to a short video on the pocket boom , a cool gadget which turns a flat surface into a speaker .
2	however the claims can often take up to 0 weeks to be released , preventing revenue generation occurring during what is often the video '_s most actively viewed time .
2	placed quite a large order in the evening and then realised in the morning that i had left off the vitally important curtain hooks .
0	the prices are fair and the stewards are exceptionally friendly .
2	dont wish any bad on some people but go_bust your rubbish .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	i found the website very informative and the ordering_process easy .
0	only then i would have been entitled to terminate the contract without paying termination charges .
0	order cam earlier_than_expected , everything was well_packaged and it great condition , not forgetting the little sweets they give you with every order made !
0	unfortunately for me , it did mean i had to spend three entire days at home waiting for a product .
2	i have used this service several_times and all my parcels have arrived on time so no_problems there .
0	talking for free with my 00 inclusive minutes feels great .
0	mazuma may pay less_than others but mazuma are honest and very quick with payment .

0	i have enjoyed my experience during my sage_line 00 training with e_- careers .
2	the car we got was in excellent working order , brand_new and very clean .
0	although , i wouldn ' t recommend buying anything of a product that is hard to manufacture cheap because you would usually find that vitacost products range somewhere in between very low - high_quality .

2	very pleased with purchase , service and delivery .
0	i then saw the same models of the items , that cash_converters made sure i missed out on due to their mess up , on their website again .
2	0 .

2	many_thanks for everything blackcircles .
2	do not part with any money .
0	shocking service - i now have to spend more time returning the item ( don ' t know how as i don ' t own a printer !)
2	goods very good , price a bit high when you add up the bits in the end solution , but their contracted dpd driver misdelivered resulting in a three day extra delay and if i had not tracked the item it might still be out there .
0	when we arrived however we were given a different menu with a choice of 0 pizzas and nothing else .
2	however , i was a bit_worried when i picked - up a facebook posting from a friend who had lost her phone before_christmas , who described both yourselves and t - mobile as " hopeless ".
0	i was fuming and rang customer_services who apologised and offered me a replacement phone , ( s0 or i phone 0 ), i opted for the s0 or even an s0 , ( but they are not made anymore ) so accepted the s0 and then went without my phone for a further 0 weeks .
0	there is good content in this website but finding anything on it is labour some and irritating .
2	and wishing your future continues in brightest success ,
0	i received no reply until 0 days_later when i received a ' reply ' completely ignoring my previous message and stating that the address was wrong .
2	they are quick to take your money ( despite the item not being available ) but are not prepared to do a refund very quickly .
2	!
2	the power button had completely jammed .
2	fitter called me early morning to confirm the time he would be here and arrived exactly as he said he would .
0	despite their booking process clearly not being automated ( our e_- ticket arrived the next_day ) and advising them straight_away , they claimed it would cost about £_000 -£_000 to correct .
0	their phone just claims there is no one to take your call .
2	so it was cheaper to buy , with fast delivery , but i get about half to 0 / 0 of the coffee .
0	they are prompt , professional , courteous and have always shown themselves to be reliable .
2	after this review i finally got a reply and a postal refund and eventually the watch which they posted to my invoice address and not my delivery address ,
0	i booked online and paid in_advance but on arrival at heathrow the driver said that i hadn ' t paid . he called the hq who said that i hadn ' t paid so needed to pay in cash ( a sum greater than the online cost ).
2	customer_services are jammed and everyone blames someone_else .
2	first_class service , third class prices , ditch the banks and save your cash
0	ive no_idea what theyre like now ,
2	so many late deliveries and surly customer service , but because it '_s not me that uses them directly that my only option is not to use amazon .
2	we booked a top of the range villa in costa blanca a while back .
0	i loved that programme and think it is a fab idea to put video clips on each page of the website - a real feel good factor .
2	so my advise wait_till midday , not sure what you do if you cannot phone from work .
0	items arrived quickly kept in contact with me so i knew what was happening with my item which i think is great .
0	hostel_bookers always finds the best quality cheap hostels and they are the only reviews i trust , wouldn ' t book anywhere_else .
0	i was dealing_with a bulk messaging company earlier but i started having problems with them regarding their rates as well as timings .

0	and on most days aside from mondays .
0	i have recommended pia to all family and friends .
2	another courier moan and groan from me , maybe i ' m just unlucky ?
0	but apart_from that the site is a good idea and i continue to use the site .
0	much later in the day i received an_email from her saying the same stuff with which she and her colleagues had tried to fob me off .
0	i spoke with claire , yet again and she was in disbelief this was still going on .
0	i also received update emails upon completion of each of the steps as well as one to inform me of the allocated slot .

0	a new battery had been sent to me with the phone .
0	i really recommend google apps for business to any sme .
2	had used parcelforce for many_years , but it '_s become expensive and the website is unreliable - along comes hermes where i can book parcels with ease and pop along to my one stop shop to drop them off , no waiting , no hangups .

2	arrived 0 days late .
0	currently using your conveyancing services for the house we ' re purchasing and very impressed so far !
0	i am a person who used to love the whole plane food where you got a meal on a tray , and dislike the fact this option is not available on the flight .
0	easy too use checkout system through paypal
2	:)
0	however , i was completely let_down .
0	easy to use website , great price and quick delivery .
0	each cash_generator store is run independently , meaning your level of service can vary dramatically depending_on which members of staff and managers deal with your order .
0	then , i spend some time looking at other_websites for their prices , to see if there are any lower .
0	talk_talk .

0	i was told by a boot fitter at the birmingham branch that i didn ' t know what i was on about ( when i said so far i ' ve strugged to find an adult ski boot that ' s comfortable ) so that whatever boot i bought wouldn ' t be up to me .
2	they bring in a secure key card and you have to use it or you get basic internet access .
0	so i ' ll echo what someone said about their order fulfillment system -- they do not necessarily have the stock shown on their website .
2	nice material with a rather casual feel which is good as i intend to use it as a jumper replacement .
0	thank_you
0	brought begining of feb . after the second outing with the wheelchair the bracket buckled .

2	she_loves it , especially the light :)

0	i then had to return the jacket as it was too big and wanted to exchange it , i called the customer_service number and it was so easy and the customer_service agent explained the process clearly and put my mind at rest that i would get my item back and within a short timeframe .
2	excellent service , before i new it it was here , fantastic , ill be back .
2	blackpool
2	i was told it would arrive later in the day , but as i was on a touring holiday i could not wait around .
2	the owners were very friendly and the cleaner was nice she cleaned the rooms every day and changed bedding and towels .
0	from the moment we first went to the shop the staff were very professional and helpful , we have visited since to have our fingers resized ect and everytime they were happy to help no matter how busy they was .
2	ice waterloo almost always beats this for changing currency - though not directly into a spanish bank_account .
0	they also suggest me to ask the agency to contact klm because the trade department of klm would only deal with agencies instead of individuals .
2	but that has all changed with their new pricing_structure , with " free " postage now making small , or even larger , purchase no better_than anyone_else .
2	our connecting flight from myrtle beach to newark , nj was delayed_due to a tropical storm in ny .

0	ordered 00 x 0 - 0oz steaks .
2	i asked for and idea of how long i would possibly wait for an_appointment once the part is in and he said " about 0 or 0 days " ( in other words how long is a piece of string .
2	they would not refund my payment .
0	my phone didn ' t have the that button and says " well it wouldn ' t work without that button !"
2	i will definatly shop_here in the future .
2	i realised the mistake as soon as i received my confirmation emauil , not the tickets , just a confirmation of payment .

2	i was really pleased with the quality of the mug and the speed in which it was delivered .
2	good luck with treating future customers this way .
0	on the 00 / 00 / 00 i ordered the karlsson crystal sunburst wall clock which was showing in stock on the h_& f website .
2	00 / 0 00 still no confirmation that they received it so i have changed rating back to 0_stars .
2	by then , he confirmed that the motor had been received but because it had been bolted on to the machine , but never used , they would not refund any money to me .
2	i was told that selectspecs have no responsibility once the hong_kong order has_been shipped so no way hose for a refund .
0	we complained immediately and it took 0 days to have it collected and then another 0 for a new one to be delivered .
0	they not only placed the sofa where we wanted , they also did the job arranging the stuff around .
0	it ' s also nearly always the cheapest place to find them as well , and since discovering this place for big name games , i can save myself a lot of cash .

0	when we arrived at tfs we found it difficult to find the correct desk .
0	because of the way the complaint was dealt_with by this representative , and the pro - active response from customer_services , i have changed my rating from a 0 star to a 0 star , and it has partially restored my confidence in e_- spares .
0	if you can even call them a that . no structure .
2	i '_ve bought stuff from honour and worn it on stage during gigs and have had umpteen comments about how fantastic i look .
0	it would be much_better if an area was reserved at the bars that we chose as the places on the list are all very busy .

2	you can buy the warranty
2	product really great .
2	no way of complaining to trainline without using premium_rate line .
0	they do seem to have chosen the right people when you contact home booster kit support .
0	a very competitive company to deal with .

0	:

2	however , the delivery service and customer service was far below that in standard .
2	after making a purchase the battery was delivered 0 days_later .
2	this company has restored my faith in human nature .
2	so in the end i saved quite a lot of money and got a rather nice nokia_lumia 000 phone with a uk charger .
2	my wife as pregnant at the time , so we wanted somewhere close to amenities and her portuguese school in ipanema .
2	i put on my old specs and guess_what i could see perfect and without glasses i get ghosting i also get wicked dry eye '_s i told this to the optomerist and he said thats just because he had been messing_around with my eye '_s .
0	without going into too much detail , they basically fudged up the upgrade and made me return the handset and said i had to go through the whole upgrade process again .
0	i have paid them £_000 , have repeatedly phoned , begging them to give me my correct final reading and i will immediately pay the balance .
0	after a lot of very frustrating phone_calls they finally_agreed to refund £_00 because they ' d stopped the notifications without actually telling_me they would .
0	my initial review was deleted .
2	a simple to use service which is reliable and reasonably_priced
2	i would use again and most_likely will when i tile my kitchen floor .
0	i have used this company in the past but i find it takes them forever to send items out that are listed on the site as in stock causing me to have to chase up as no communication was given .
2	price , s are lately more than shopping around myself or using another comparison_sites .
2	i was contacted yesterday by one of your colleagues who set an_appointment with dr george on 0h may and i can '_t wait to see him .
2	he then stated that the only additional driver allowed under the gold booking arrangement was my spouse .
0	this makes no sense .
2	you mentioned in your comment that you had written a number of emails without response .
0	i paid for express delivery for my holiday !!!).
0	you should not let her claim ?!!!!"
0	i would find where i wanted to sit on the arena plan and then look at the prices for the seats and work out if i wanted them .
2	shortly_after this call i received a call from orange ( who were and still are my provider ).
2	the glassess i ordered were fine but to be honest november order beginning of feb delivery was rubbish .
2	communication is the key !
2	but myhermes did not respond at all .
0	after a couple of months the smell was getting worse and the fridge started making very loud noises , so phoned through to currys .
0	ordered some pizzas recently with side orders and we waited 00_minutes for it to be delivered only to discover the driver forgot to bring the side orders !
0	then it was finally delievered the next_day and the only way i knew it was received was because i signed_up for sms alerts on the ups site .
0	good service and price .
2	if i could rate them with 0_stars , i would !
2	thanks
2	0 days on you still havent got it and they wont answer your emails , live_chat dont help you and you have lost your parcel to the theiving gits .
2	no issues with the trophy i bought , which was as advertised .
0	the other tescos are ok .
2	i even got a text from the courier company telling_me when to expect them , to with an_hour , which they then honoured .
2	ordered an o ' neill shortie on 00th_july .
0	first of all the good points my items did arrive quickly , the projector screen was on decent quality and thats where the good points end now its time for the bad .
0	this could be an amazing service that more people would use if they actually did what they said they were going to do .
0	its amazing how the ordering price and sales service can be amazing but the delivery procedure can let it down .
2	countertop magic cleaner was recommended by the fitter for our new worktops and he left behind a 000 ml bottle .

0	the resort rep was very friendly and helpful when we contacted her for some info .
0	i ' ve used coolshop before and i would reccomend to anyone , however with a recent_purchase of black_ops it hasn ' t managed to arrive on release day unlike many other online sites .
2	after 0 days nothing arrived ( had been checking status of order online which wasn_'_t changing - kept indicating pending , awaiting despatch )
2	the entertainment was aimed directly to please them .
2	unfortunately the sink was broken on delivery .
2	e_- mail said that further details would follow within 0 working_days .
2	i assume it means that by now i should have been refunded .
0	so i came_across this website and got the best price for what i wanted ( sun visor ).
2	well pleased .
2	i like the idea of trustpilot , but when i wrote a comprehensive review about f u , a lousy utility company , to warn_people to avoid them at all costs , your site made it very difficult for me , and i certainly wondered whose side you were on .
0	apparently no manned telephone_number due to ' over - demand '.
2	avoid at all cost .
0	sadly they continue to operate as management clearly don ' t care about the massive negative attitude of their staff , the loathing they have of customers , the immense negative image this company has .
0	!
0	which was a bonus !
2	i certainly would recommend .
0	nevada sorted a little mistake that the couriers had made super_quick , ill definitely use nevada again .
0	i did a lot of research before replacing a very dodgy cheap lamona dishwasher that had been unreliable for about a year .
0	you can pretty_much get stationery at the same price or cheaper from online and offiline retail_stores including poundland !
0	unfortunately on the mobile site it didn ' t offer the discount which was a bit_annoying as that ' s why i decided to order from here as it made it cheaper_than other online sites .
0	if i had i would ' ve used my home address .
0	snow and rock stores have a good range of products at reasonable prices , but i recommend getting product advice and fitting elsewhere .
2	this time , i again needed to contact someone because i could not access my training , which was again due to being given incorrect_information in an e_- mail .
2	if that includes warnings about ratings , legislation then so be it .
0	basically , a ruined valentine ’_s day all thanks to eflorist .
2	i have to say the quality is good on the products that i ordered but without being_able to change or send back then i would think_twice before placing orders with them .
2	i went for the diamond package and was very pleased with just how simple a potentially - stressful process turned_out to be .
0	however on contacting the merchant i realized that it was not suitable for me so i asked wowcher to refund ( within 0 days ).
0	at the end of week 0 , i emailed fv to ask where my order was as it was late and i ' d had no contact from them at all .
0	no word . 0 minute for a key . it wonderfull
0	).
2	all told job_done in about 00_minutes at a great price .
0	search_filters made choosing a lot_easier .
2	i cannot understand_why the company has never responded to my emails - and when i telephoned i got through to something like a call_centre who could not actually do anything .
0	easy - to - use website , great range of quality hostels , and cheaper_than the rest .
0	been shopping with amazon since they were formed , have brought lots of books from them and always received the products ordered on time .
2	anyone with any technical_knowledge would recognize that over time the forces acting on the cantilever arms will loosen the fixings and cause the tv to plummet to the floor .
0	i only usually leave reviews when i have a negative experience with a site ( like most people ) but after_reading some of the nonsensical negative_reviews here , i will break that habit .
0	very fast delivery service , the staff are also incredibly_helpful and knowledgeable .
0	when i emailed their cusomer service department to request a refund i am told that their terms and conditions state that they can change the flowers for another set of the higher or same value in the instance that they run out of the ordered bouquet .
0	half way through december_0000 , i wanted an early upgrade before i go on holiday so i went to see if i can upgrade early , and they said " yes " quite happily i upgraded then and there .
2	did what it said on the tin !
0	dear beautybay ,
0	i can ' t shake the feeling that their customer_service is either going to come at me at some point to bump up the review - or have it taken down .
0	ok , so i booked my flight from london to america in jan_0000 , flying out in aug using skyscanner . net , and realised it was booked with a company called travelup . never_heard of them before , so i proceded , but didnt get my eticket , or a confirmation straight_away like i had before ( used expedia then ) so i worried a little_bit , the confirmation and eticket arrived 0 days_later , unusual i thought , still , i was happy i had my flights booked , and the money had been taken from my account , i had a link to check my itinerary which i thought was good , then one day i couldnt log in to check so i panicked , i contacted travelup , but got no response , took 0 days before they got back to me , and advised there was just a schedule change , and i was then able to log in and check my itinerary .
0	i ' ve been buying from myprotein for the last 0 years but recently they stopped using parcelforce as their delivery company .
2	for the first time one product ( 00 x kinesiology tape pink 0 . 0cm x_0m ) was not good and i am trying to send it back but the responses i got from the enquiry site were confusing .
2	the instructions on the taps were scant and the victorian style shower_mixer leaks in the shower setting .
0	after all that , would i use them again ?
0	all it had was the store ' s name and address on it .
2	this is the second time we have used hotel direct , excellent service , really friendly .
0	then i found out about myprotein . com , and initially , i assumed for their prices they had to be either an incredibly well - made scam , or incredibly low quality .
2	b ) i sent a parcel to a company on an industrial estate in glasgow on 00th_may - i booked it online and dropped it off at a collectplus shop .
2	in every instance the order has arrived promptly without_any errors .
0	you do not need to do anything , we will contact you when your application has been processed .
0	0 ) once you place an order for a gamekey , through paypal , a message is sent to your email which you then follow prompts through to their site .
0	i ' ll let you know how it goes .
0	next_day delivery
2	!!!!
2	excellent value for money too .
0	i was on hold for 00_minutes before giving up .
0	i phoned them immediately only to be told that your transaction has been ' lost ' during a technical_error and we don ' t know when you ' ll receive it .
2	i asked how long it would take before i got my refund and he said between 0_0 working_days .
2	the plane itself is of course very basic , and leg - room is a joke - i ' m just over 0ft tall and even i found it a squash .
2	hilsen
0	for anyone_else considering using these people , please seriously consider whether its worth it .
0	turns_out we had to pay an extra fee of 00 € at the arrival !
2	i was told because this product had been so popular there had been a delay and in fact the order had been dispatched today and would be with me in a week as it was coming from holland .
0	from past experience , the feedback on the site accurately reflects the quality of the accommodation .
2	i had paid up front and he was upgrading me .
2	the order was placed , confirmation received and the money arrived a couple of days_later , thank_you .
0	however their prices and delivery speed make them a very attractive option still - giving them one more chance to redeem themselves by placing an order for a tablet from them today .
2	i now see my chairs are not due for delivery until march having received assurance they would arrive in january it will be nearly a full year since i placed my order and have had the delivery time changed 0 times this is unacceptable i have contacted the bank and my laywer there is no point valerie in contacting me unless you have a definite date for delivery or assurance of full_refund in the next week
2	“ bought my dining_set from your uddingston store .
2	this is the second time in a week of ordering something from this site so happy with the first item and how fast it came .
2	not worth returning by the time you pay postage . i e . mailed partyrama - no reply - as yet . !
2	thank_you for the excellent service and delivery too .
2	saving £_00 a month but losing the efficient widows service would be a step backwards for me , so we have stayed put to date .
0	so by all means , myprotein products are great . but order your stuff a month in_advance , or roll the dice with their stock / delivery promises
0	i was left without an important present .
2	i '_ve tried 0 times now and it doesn_'_t appear .

0	i received confirmation that my order had been accepted and the delivery day ( valentines_day ) confirmed .
2	i ordered items and paid next_day delivery charge , only to find that the items were sent on a standard delivery , i complained and did get a refund .
2	worst of all is the lack of communication before they went_ahead and put customers data at risk .
2	she obtained some good prices for us .
2	they repeated the assertion .
2	i got an_immediate_confirmation via e_- mail , explaining that the purchase had to be manually checked .
2	better_than any company i have dealt_with !
2	• if things go_wrong you will face a language barrier so keep communication short & simple .

2	the tea is absolutely_brilliant .
0	i also got sent a completely_different and much more limited menu .
2	i can never find direct flights using this website ., yet on the airline '_s own websites i can find direct flights no problem .
2	but suffice it to say that i have today spoken to trading_standards and they say i have a case .
2	this is not good enough .
2	for far too long have got away with ' blue - murder ' an out dated , over priced broadband service that is a disgrace for a once leader in communications .
2	any query was quickly answered
0	the 0d in the crystal looks impressive and it was sent in a nice black box .
2	i was really pleaased with the service from outdoor_world .
2	to say that i am fuming is putting it mildly !!
2	i settled for black but why wasn_'_t i informed there was no white casing in stock when they received the phone ?
0	consumer direct ect .
0	well , at_least luckily i didn ' t have that particular game , but overall there wasn ' t much of a choice presented .
0	ive bought tons from them and they never fail .
0	very fast service sent phone received money 0 days after by_far the fastest payment ive received from any mobile selling site
2	although there is no phone number to make contact with them ( this bothered me at first ) their customer_services is second to none , just leave a message on the site and they get to you real quick ,,,, very helpful too and personel , by this i mean , they seem to treat you as if you are a friend and not just a customer .
0	customer_service is rubbish when they get it wrong , keep telling you different stories and never give you an update .
0	while the concept of trust - pilot is a good one and has certainly helped_me chose to shop at ( or not ) a specific store , there are far better ways to try and eliminate fake_reviews than social_media .
0	with this i also only received 0 of 0 packs of pasta .
0	i chose to use bozowi this time because it offers the highest amount and claims the same level of service i have received before - do not be_fooled you will not receive this amount for your phone !

0	after repeatedly gurning the house down i now do not know how to get the e tickets sent to the correct address .

2	mr mathew dale
2	they gave us a date 00 days after delivery , however we were then called back and this was changed to a further 0 days after that .
2	if buying directly from them they do operate a free delivery service which overall is excellent - occasionally they didn_'_t get the packaging quite right - sometimes too big or small but they always ask for feedback to improve their services .
0	hostelbookers is an amazing site where you simply type in a destination and a list of hostels in that area pop - up by price , rating , location , etc !

2	0 times they sent me the wrong item ( twice they sent bath / shower_mixer taps , third time a pair of bath_taps which looked like basin taps ).
0	you work in an industry where customers should be the most_important part of everything you do !
2	how is this possible ?
2	so far the ' sellers ' from whom i have purchased have been excellent and i therefore would say the experience will invite me to browse and purchase via_ebay again .
0	well the service is really not the best .
2	delivery driver is always polite and friendly .
2	good price but as with any online ordering it '_s fine if you a company or working on a site where there are people to sign for the delivery all day but if you are a diyer then you may end up having to stay in all day for your delivery ( 0 :_00am to 00 :_00pm ).
2	i wouldn_'_t go with anyone_else now
0	all said i needed to wait 00 days for it to be processed .

0	but isn ' t it obvious 0 nudges didn ' t get them to prioritise my claim anyway !!!
2	as a regular cyprus commuter , the constant moan one hears is the bun fight for boarding .
0	if only i would of read reviews of talktalk before i decided to go into a contract with them .
0	at first i wasn ' t totally convinced how good a service i would get given that this company operates 000_% online , but after seeing how cheap their prices were i decided to make an enquiry and after_speaking with one of the team ( luke , who called within 00_minutes of the online enquiry ), i was comfortable in placing my order .
0	limited hotels etc too !
2	they used to leave the food bags in the porch .
0	nowhere in her call had she mentioned a monthly_fee for this - £ 0 . 00 per_month i think she said .

0	bad_experience do not use orange !!
2	there is entirely inadequate arrangements for the return of items , lack of communication by all concerned and incompetence on a level which is more or less prevalent wherever you go these days , but nonetheless unacceptable .
2	just another baby is an extremely good company to deal with .
0	steer_clear of this company .
0	save your money and go elsewhere .
2	it fits and seems to work fine .
2	we got eight nights bed and breakfast for two people at a total price of €_000 . 00
2	i will deffinetly be shopping here for future_purchases .
2	after about two_weeks i had received nothing and looked on the website for a phone number but there isn_'_t one which worried me .
0	i read on pixmania delivery info that the package should be opened and checked on delivery to see if it was damaged or defective , since accepting it or signing it without doing that would deem it was delievered in working condition and i wouldn ' t have much ground to return it or get a refund .
0	always received great service .
2	seller very helpful when questioned relating to product .
0	thanks , will_definitely buy again !
0	i ordered the indian man costume from allfancydress . com and it arrived very quickly .
2	must remember to check again nearer xmas .
2	all in i bought a tv_stand , lamp_table , sideboard , dining_table and 0 chairs and coffee_table all of which match and are for my lounge and dining_room so sending any back would spoil the look , so what options am i left with , having to accept repaired goods , to say i think this stinks is an_understatement and to say they are transparent by giving you a book in the store which explains this is a disgrace .
2	the kitchen units are now being delivered tomorrow and we were told we would recieve a call the day before to confirm a time .
0	looks great externally , but inside - very cheap finish .
0	they have the lowes price of anyone
0	i also paid to be able to track my delivery and there is no tracking_number .
0	plus , when i ' m drunk , they taste soooooo goooood ;- p
2	i did this after receipt of my second order , assuming ( i know this makes an ass out of you and me !)
0	absolutely pathetic service .
0	doubt i will ever get my parcel and reckon the yodel employee who was meant to deliver it went and saw his mates instead of delivering anything .
0	got an_email at 00 : 00 stating " we regret to inform you that delivery has not been possible on the date you selected !
2	error acknowledged and company undertook to resolve problem , which they did to their great credit when item arrived at required address within 00_hours of the call .
0	i would definitely_recommend them for service , product quality and value for money .
2	how about reducing some of those prices .
2	landlady and husband arrived at about 00 . 00 and were clearly very irritated that we were still there .
2	they have had use of my money for nearly 0 months .
2	logomojo is a talented company that will put your mind at ease and will deliver an excellent business tool .
2	week_later i went back , another staff_member admitted the phone was left out the back and only sent off a day ago .
2	for instance nachos which used to be 0 . 00 has crept up to 0 . 00 in a matter of weeks .

0	and 0 00th_july 0 weeks after they recieved the phone . no when i got through to a advisor i was told the manager was in a meeting then that he was on the phone i advised i wasnt getting off the phone until i had spoke to the manager so to get him out of his " meeting " or off the phone call he was on within 0mins i was speaking to the manager he blamed the slow service on technical_difficulties so i pointed_out all the review sites and reviews from a year_ago with the same kind of service - to which he told me i should take these review sites with a pinch of salt i work for appliances_online which has brilliant reviews on trust pillot so i advised this was utter_rubbish - ive demanded the money be in my account today but apparently there are a million other people in this que . to which i have told this manager to go and speak to the account department and fast track my payment - he is apparently calling me back tonight at 0pm - i very much doubt he will but guess_what il be calling back tommorrow !!
0	it would have been nice if they had apologized for the missing order or even asked if i had wanted a new record instead of just automatically refunding it , but it was more like filling out an insurance claim .
2	i will never go_elsewhere .
2	however , everytime i complained , it was given another job number , new instructions and was a nightmare .
2	this year was the first time i used easy jet .

2	they refused , even_though the replacement would have cost us £_000 more .
2	these new cards are useable but only just ( when i hand them out i feel i have to apologise for the quality ), and i will now have to find an_alternative provider that can use my material to produced the desired outcome .

0	they accepted paypal so i went_ahead and ordered .
0	the second game was available on download at xbox_live which i didnt know
0	there doesn ' t appear to be many listings in laos , but that might have to do with the fact there are pretty_much only private_rooms and twin_rooms here .

0	it is not only simple to set - up new customers but also has many tools at your disposable when you are looking to take payment which enables you to be very flexible with your cost structure .
0	i really wonder_why i bother even trying
0	i am sure that it is fine but i am concerned and wish to be reassured that my flowers are going to be delivered especially as i paid £_00 .
2	( see the negative_feedback from other users ).
2	our landlandy did mention building noise on the phone the previous week but we had no_idea of the extent of this - it didn_'_t worry us too much because we were out for most of each day when the work was going on but would have made life difficult for anyone with small children needing daytime naps , etc .
2	if in doubt go for the managed package , it '_s simply not worth slowing the process down with mistakes .
0	unfortunately i think this is basic , the possibility of change my address ( for billing or delivery ) and i will not buy at this shop until they change it .
2	my advice don_'_t go near !!!!
0	i phoned again and they told me they expect them in on the 00th , and that i could get them on the 00th .
0	topcashback is indeed terrible .
0	as_opposed to relying on this company who as far as they are concerned just don ' t care about what they do .
2	the items arrive the day after i ordered them , much_faster_than_expected
0	after 00_hours still no update on progress .
0	they will just provide generic reasons even when you contact their specific ' declined cashback team ', so don ' t bank on getting the cashback .
0	lexus stoke was quite close so i went to them .
0	the payment process is simple and easy too !
0	i love the way their site is set_up and how easy it is to use .
0	this is unbelievable – it ’_s got an awesome sound system and is really stylishly decked out .
0	nottingham itself is lively - which makes a change from our home town , and the atmosphere was awesome .
2	we had to send two of the chairs back as they were faulty but they were collected immediately and exchanged within a week .
0	ordered a bouquest of flowers for my mother for mothers_day 00 . 00 . 00 .
2	worldstores make even bt '_s customer support look professional and that '_s saying something !
2	every time since then parcels delivered to me by this company have taken a minimum of 0 weeks to arrive .
0	couple days ago i found that . from around 0 . 00p dropped to 0 . 00 . now i found some new prices like 0 . 00 or 0 . 00 . lots of 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 too .
2	had to waste an_hour collecting goods from courier '_s warehouse .
0	good services !
2	when i was transferred to talk - talk from tiscali things where not to good when you had a problem the talk - talk customer_services where useless .
0	every_single order has arrived the next_day without_fail .
0	ordered on a thursday_evening and it arrived on saturday .
0	we were offered all of our money back by returning the furniture or offered a gesture of goodwill .
2	very happy and would use again .
0	i hate this site it took me ages to choose my buy my groceries .
2	after waiting for about one month , i contacted them again as i still had not received a refund and was told that it would be done there and then .
2	bought 0 mother and child lamps a year_ago next month , one broke_down a few_months_ago litecraft sent a replacement within 0 week .
2	all the other shops wanted to make a charge to change the cartridge over .
0	took over a month for parts to arrive after 0 + telephone_calls .
0	they can ' t find my parcel when the status said they tried to deliver it the day before and i was home the hold day no ups , rang them i was promised 000_% my parcel will get delivered the next_day as i stressed it was important i received it .
2	when he came back he hadn_'_t found the right part but managed to cobble together enough parts to get the loo working again , eventually finishing at nearly mid - night - definitely above and beyond the call of duty , what a star !
2	this should be relevant to the cost of the item and not seriously loaded .
2	it '_s was disappointing that having paid good money to send flowers to our daughters mrs christina coldman that she happen to stumble upon them in the evening .
2	sufficient instructions ( btw very easy to install ).
0	since i live overseas this leads to the box getting smashed and the records getting warped or bent .
0	any of them !!!
0	very happy , thanks .
2	hi -_fi unit and speakers arrived as promised .
0	i ordered an item from very . co . uk this was delivered to the depot 0 days ago no problem thus_far i received an_email from yodel saying they were going to deliver monday however should this be inconvenient the reply 0 , 0 or 0 depending which day you wanted so as i was working monday i opted for today wednesday .
0	good value !
0	and delivery time is also very good , and that ' s even with the basic free delivery .
0	will_continue to use mazuma every time !
2	!
2	:(
0	talktalk just not being honest to its customers and do not really care about them .
2	seems like a decent business looking to provide excellent service .
2	the two to doncaster were perfect , great staff i got what i paid for .
2	the status of my tickets has_been showing as ' prepared for dispatch ' for about a week now .
0	interlink have failed to deliver twice , wont be getting a 0rd chance .
2	initial tap that we ordered and shown in stock was inspected before despatch - :) - and found to be damaged .
0	don ' t use this service , id recommend look at other bots .
2	the shower does not work , better_bathrooms customer service advisors will only tell you to call the supplier of the product , they will not replace any appliances that do not work !
2	still no reply , cant book a voucher , restaurant don_'_t want to know and refer you back to wowcher !!
2	normally im size 0 . 0 and all wellies i had in past were in size 0 with plenty of room for thick socks .
2	quick efficient company .
2	!
0	i got my order quicker_than stated and very good quality .
0	just such a quick and painless experience .
0	i was interested in a pair of cdj ' s so had been on the website a few_times to check prices etc and i wanted to know info about the bstock .
2	loved the rubber duck !
0	?
2	during very busy_periods you can even put your price up !
2	no one there to meet us .
0	used myprotein before and was happy with the choice of the quality of the supplier .
0	i phoned up , and said ' hey , so i know i used over 000mb , so you know i actually signed_up when it was ' unlimited ', oh , your t &_c say you ' re allowed to change the terms of the deal ?
0	ordered the audio_technica ath - m00 headphones on 00th_dec , received them the next morning .
2	so good luck to all you unlucky people who have come in contact with this comapny .
0	use it as a comparison engine only , buy directly from the insurer !
2	one of the other reviews said that ebuyer were ok until something went wrong - i now fully understand and support that view .
2	i upgraded to extra_legroom seats at the airport for no extra_cost than had i booked before hand online .
0	i hope that this is taken on board for purchases of this item or similar items in the future .
2	i was on two crutches due to an injury and tired from the flight and my wife was unhappy about completing paperwork again so we took the upgrade but were not happy with the unethical tactics .
0	twice , when filling in my details , i was taken right back to the " index " page of offers , and my progress lost .
2	• check minimum order – sometimes you must buy 000 or even 0 , 000 units
2	this way i can look into the matter in more detail and respond to your complaint as soon as possible .
0	i would give 0_stars if the review allowed it .
2	my order arrived even more quickly than they said it would and for no extra_charge .
2	i emailed a picture and suggested better ways of packaging , but did not want a refund ( needed the product ).
0	i am a security wilder i have various products in the last years always a paid suscription , i dont mencioned it but i tell the problems one of they skip files from program files folder who dont skip before an upgrade , the second stops and freezezz in a memory scan in full system scan , the third detects his own update files like viruses and ignore it .
2	to be honest i ' m probably just being picky , i think a lot of businesses could_learn a thing or two from how ao operate , i ' d certainly use them again and have no issues in recommending them , in fact i think it will be hard for a competitor to beat them .
0	have to say i was really disappointed with the delivery from myprotein this time around .
0	everytime is so happy with everything , ie , food , service , environment , cleanliness . all .
2	i think their prices may be lower too .
0	i was also given a 00 euro voucher as a gesture of goodwill .
2	i am deeply unhappy and wish i ' d never purchased a sofa there .
0	great if you want a pc without an os and useless bundled software .
2	the shape i chose is just right for a lounge and a snooze .
0	i have had many deliveries from dpd and to be honest i wish every company was dpd style .
2	even applying fees on postage which is absurd .
2	so be ware i guess of accepting first offers and own web_site testimonials , give people an honest value at the start and you will get the business is the moral , ps , i took there " improved offer as for the extra £ 0 i would have got from the high_street in the end i could not be bothered and i guess someone who has lots of gold would be so its all relevant
0	avoid and save your time and sanity .
2	i would recommend them to all my friends .
2	good prices & service but when calling customer service i get different answers each time i speak to a different operator .
0	i have ordered several things from musicstore . de and i have to say i have found them excellent in terms of being_able to deliver the goods on time and always intact .

0	i flew successfully from christchurch to sydney , but in sydney i was told by the airline company that my booking had been done but not confirmed by tripsta .
0	he could be a serialkiller for all we know and i am listed in the same category .
0	so after my last review , i have finally received an e_- mail , but a displeasing one .

2	but it is considered to be in violation .
2	i sometimes forget i ' m wearing them .
0	£_000 more_than another company which i discovered only 0 day after my initial query and they take the full_amount rather_than a deposit even_though they cannot guarantee you will get the plate .

2	very fast delivery , a great looking chair but the assembly was a nightmare .
0	was told my particular tires were hard to come by quickly ( by all companies ) but that swift would return my call in the morning .
2	we live less_than 00 miles from the inverness depot !
2	they never ever break anything and that my goods were never missing - nothing ever went wrong in his warehouse !
2	i have been with orange for a few_years now and i have only stayed with them because of the orange wednesdays but even that has lost its appeal .
2	good door , right price , delivered !
2	it is not worked into the price of the product .
0	thank_you for a great buying experience .
2	daft , so you will need to handle the blacks with caution .
0	i would not use this company again , nor would i recommend their services .
0	the council won ' t come out and check there dish and there telling_me to pay for a 0rd_party engineer to come and sort this out , it ' s an_absolute_joke , the customer_service is diabolical , no one wants to help you , they talk over you and just keep saying the same_thing as in there reading off a script , that ' s the overseas contact centre and the uk_based ones ,
2	it '_s the na that is the most annoying as you have to choose something that isn_'_t the norm .
0	i heard about identity through a friend nearly 0 years_ago now , and what a fantastic find it was !
0	i would have preferred a phone call as requested .
0	well , the price offered is competitive and is cheap .
0	did superb job again .
0	i love using the ba website and executive club .
0	it would be seriously annoying if you needed a dress or something for the next_day and it just didn ' t arrive .
0	my only concern is that we don ' t have enough wall space for all the art that we would like to purchase !
2	what followed was a nightmare not resolved by the website , telephone or on - line ' chat ', until literally hours of effort on my part .
2	back to second and third opinion .

0	my experience :
2	it is just a shame that a majority of the clothes are not modern enough .
2	i was instructed to use their freepost returns service which now they have charged me for .

2	really good to know that the flowers were on their way and then that they had been delivered .

2	the greeting cards look good and i was pleased with the result .
0	i was totally satisfied with my business on hq_hair .
2	once you '_ve paid (£_000 in my case ) then forget about contacting ' thelittlehousecompany '.

2	i bought a desire after being told it was the best . of a bad bunch
0	the response times were awful .
0	the concept is good , but only one company got back to me with a quote so i couldn ' t ' compare ' my move as i only have one quote to go on .
2	there is also extensive information available on a wide_variety of additional subjects which only adds to the overall performance of the website .
2	i am still struggling with them to get my money back - even if this wouldn_'_t make up the dissapointment they caused us by this spoiled holiday .
2	thank_you so much steve for making my dream purchase so real and your service so reliable .
0	i ' ve seen this happen on the corners of the bars before but this thing was ravaged .
0	also the bulk buying on the website has gotten out of control .

0	after_speaking to another policy - parroting zombie i was handed to a manager who first attempted to fob me off with the same nonsense about policy and then tried to suggest that it was there to prevent ticket fraud .
0	made a complaint and they did actually resolve it well and to my satisfaction .

2	the cs lady told me she will cancel the order within 00_hours and it should be a further 0 working_days for the bank to refund the money to my credit_card .
2	i ' m_sure simplyswim were not at fault but delivery depends on the royal_mail and they are the weak link .
2	it would be great if everyone took this attitude .

2	loved it .
0	i decided to make the switch from halogen to led x 00 bulbs and got all the advice i needed from rob to make the right decision with no sales nonsense , very much_appreciated .
2	when we dared to argue about what service we should offer they will argue with us and push us to keep lowering the price groupon are only interested in them selves not the partners and not the customers and the service they provide is disgusting .
2	they constantly blamed shires , who make them .
2	found alternatives , went down same process , same result .

0	great and quick support by david ( ec0000 )
2	i was told i had to pay £_000 for the repair and when i queried it i was told that it was cheaper_than a replacement .

2	well what a surprise , the next_day i received a reply , but it '_s not good news .
2	many_times i have used this web_site and even when i am unsure the speed of contact and quakity iof advise has_been first_class .

0	its a great service and i would recommend it to anybody who_wants cheep discounted cd_keys rather then paying retail prices .
0	i think it is really rude and unacceptable and it is surely my first and last time i did order something from the website .
2	we eventually took the packaging 00 miles to a recycling centre .

2	cr000 arrived today & the box was really battered i appreciate u guys dont have any control over the goons who deliver or process the orders once out of your hands but i feel if u was to protect the more fragile products with foam it would counteract the dumbasses the lid appears to be ok but the bag has a hole in it from what ever was squashing it in delivery !
2	regards shakey
2	after waiting 0 working_days i contacted buydirect0u via_email and got an_email back saying that there had been an issue with stock .
0	thanks .
2	when we arrived in florida to collect our car , they said that what we had paid for was a much smaller car and would not hold the luggage we had .
2	decent enough products and prices but always want to upsell you into something extra , then when you have had you order bombard you with e_- mails .
2	i counted 0 of them in one fruit aisle , and i queued to buy red onions while 0 pickers gossiped about football whilst completely blocking the whole side of the aisle with onions .
2	i have sent a recorded delivery letter to their wakefield address asking for the goods or my monies reimbursed , but still no response .
0	tracking shows it has been at my local_depot , 0 mile from the delivery address , since 0th_feb .
2	), they then changed the courier to tnt as they said they were more reliable than city_link ????
0	not only were they the best price by quite some margin , but they included free delivery and an after sales service to put larger companies very much to shame !
0	if i could kiss it i would
2	we use interparcel all the time , ups are brilliant , most of the time after booking they are at the front_door before i have had time to print label !!

0	he arrived right on time and was very professional .
0	not the next_day one hour_slot i was hoping for as this is now two days_later but never mind i ' ll just book a days annual_leave !
2	prices are keen , delivery is excellent ( next_day ).
2	update_: wifigear eventually got in touch and said they had not seen my email and it must have gone into a spam filter so progress !
2	delivered very quickly after ordering , and undamaged . i will buy again in the future .
0	booking was easy and we had few complaints at all about the overall holiday .
2	the containers for the whiskas items are very thin & weak & therefore should not be packed with an item weighing 0 . 0kg ( weight of a bozita cat_food case ), as anybody with common_sense would know that the whiskas containers would break & damage the contents .
2	divorce is at best an emotionally tempestuous time , even an incredibly straight_forward one as our own , so its really disappointing to find them so unhelpful despite paying for their best service package and being promised to be fully supported throughout the process .
2	the motor arrived within a few_days .
0	i find it odd that the person delivering was an elderly woman in normal clothes who was in a normal car and had lost the stylus pen in her car somewhere .
2	if they don_'_t arrive tomorrow , i will probably miss the last posting day - i will have to send 0st_class & hope they arrive in time for xmas subject to the cards actually arriving with me ,
0	ebay seem to represent buyers pretty well but when i won a pioneer tv cheap and the guy refused to let me buy it ebay couldn ' t do anything about it . makes a mockery of the site if you ask me because they didn ' t even ban the guy , but meh !
0	on speaking to them again it transpired the manager who tested the phone wasn ' t told what the fault was so didn ' t test the sound .
2	thank_you !!!!
2	i do think that amazons pricing is expensive in some areas - i picked_up an exercise machine that i saw on amazon for 00_% less for the exact_same item by going to an_alternative website .
2	simply beautiful artwork and photography .
0	the website said it could take up to 00 days so i waited ( a little longer_than that because of the christmas bank_holidays ) but still nothing .
2	then last_night three_weeks ofter the procedure i woke_up early in the morning with very painful , red and gritty left eye .
2	useless .
2	was expecting another grub screw to be sent , but another towel_rail arrived , this one having all the needed screws !
0	on the dowside , the hostel i booked later called me to inform that they did not have a room available .
0	they have also damaged the window seal on the car .

0	it was a class day .
2	ok everyone can make_mistakes so i e_- mailed their customer service address explaining what had happened expecting them to either send me the correct product or at_least refund the difference in cost .
0	not any more they are middle of the road .
0	ordered a north_face gillet and it came ahead of schedule on the free delivery service and was in perfect_condition .
0	this way privacy is kept for the customer reviewing a site and will also limit the number of fake_reviews as most people do not carry multiple mobile_phones .
2	you will not get a stock answer to a question you did not ask , or , even worse , ignored .
0	super_quick service - it was that fast that to get any faster you would need to print it before i even placed my order .
2	me - ' i have , your website says customer_care is open 0 - 0 '
2	our mobile_phone didn_'_t work so we couldn_'_t contact anyone .
2	you need to give more cash match bets .
2	our old fridge /_freezer was taken away and recycled ( extra_cost though ).
0	iniatial email exchanges were fast and a deal was struck and paid for within hours , the phone call to confirm delivery was a nice personal_touch .
2	i wouldn_'_t wish the stress and incompetence ( let_alone shoddy workmanship ) on my worst_enemy
0	phoned my account management team .
0	the site also has lots of photos and clearly lays out the different rooms and rates available .
2	so if you

2	we departed the bus on kensington high_street .
0	marj lopes at round the world experts was recommended to me by a good friend , and what a recommendation it was .
0	the bigboy bean_bag is a great accessory for any lounge !
2	please_please be aware of this disasterous company
0	also i found the support_team disinterested in the fact that my order was wrong .
2	the tkts were delivered on time , so why have i been waiting for 00days now to be paid ?
0	on board the thomas_cook plane we did have two seats in a two - seater section however there was no window , just the wall of the plane .
0	because of their suspectness .
2	the fact it costs me less now means i can charge my customers less , which can only be good for orders .
2	jo harris
0	i bought 00 pods from vanilla mart for less_than the price of two supermarket pods .
0	however , told me someone would call me to sort it tomorrow and only took a postcode to check this was in same catchment area .
2	having recorded the delivery and questioned them about having actually signed for package , they now claim they had received the package but the packet was empty ( no handset ).
2	when i queried this they asked me to send a photograph so the matter could be referred to the right ‘ department ’.
2	it is always nice to find a company that you can contact by telephone , especially a normal ( rate ) number .
2	the company would not agree to a full_refund and payment for the return postage .
2	i would not recommend this company !
2	the surprise now spoilt , she then had to go out and hunt around the house to see if she could find them .
2	it is shocking that companies such as this are entirely unaccountable to the general_public .
0	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
0	avoid like the plague
0	couldn ' t be more happy and will_definitely use again
2	i had another look at my review and could not see anything ' negative ' - just factual .
2	no time was on it so i used my phone and checked the tracking_details .
2	i said this is unacceptable .
2	i would not use this company again - will stick to [_external_reference_] or [_external_reference_].
2	i used to buy from river_island a lot .
2	the first was the purchase of a brand_new mackie mixer .
0	!
2	they arranged collection and said i would recieve a refund when they recieved goods . after two_weeks endless_calls and no refund it turned_out the item was lost . and sent to scotland .
2	probably won_'_t order again .
0	i ' d go there again , but if there was a choice , would try somewhere new .
0	sincerely ,
0	youtube was the best video sharing website when they started years_ago and they are still the best video platform on the internet !
0	final thoughts - go for it !
0	will be using them again
0	- highly_recommended .
0	this time , they call on the morning of the delivery and say that the item ( s ) are still unavailable , and that it is a short_notice cancellation because it only just showed up on the systems .
2	hurray we thought , but all we got was the bed side tables , still nothing to sleep on .
2	), including emailing to ask for the money back when they can clearly see the over - payments are in excess .

2	as it took so long to reply and i needed the seat , i glued the seat back together along the split , i ' m just waiting for the reply to my photos that says as i attempted a repair they aren_'_t prepared to do anything , still i might be pleasantly_surprised .
0	yes .
0	few_days_later , i ask them for renew the simcard due to the needed to contact for my business .
0	it is very unreliable and inefficient .
0	all companies should be like this .
0	i used the free courier service as they recommended at the time i did my order , its been 00 days and they are saying they have not received my things although i have a receipt from hermes collection service with a tracking_number that states they have received my things ?
2	there was no answer so i left a message requesting a delivery date .
2	the first time i had to contact someone to resolve an issue with enabling my account , i relayed that i ' d been given incorrect_information , and it was met with an ' oh well ' attitude .
2	have used transglobal_express at_least 0 times now usa and australia usually using the ups saver service and both i and the recipients are over the moon with the service received collect ballyclare thursday deliver los_angeles monday superb is the word for staff / service and results i wouldn_'_t dream of using any other delivery service and can only say very highly_recommended and thank_you again
0	" i appreciate that you are going to be on an exchange in that case the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off_peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
0	its useless !
0	so i joined on an 00 month_contract , mobile_broadband device / myfi , it ' s the dongle that lets you connect up 0 separate devices to it at any one time , around £_00 per_month including vat . sounds great right ?
2	best price ( that i could find anyway ) . item very quickly delivered as ordered .

0	craig
0	" customer_service deal with this issue , but we can ' t transfer you to them " " sit tight , someone will contact you " still no call , 0 days on .
2	se london
0	i do not agree all the staff i spoke to that day were rude and didn ' t care 0 women genuinely tried to help the situation but still after our conversation it was left unsolved .
2	the ticket arrived via_email showing economy status . i phoned to tell them of their ' mistake ' and was informed that i had only booked an economy ticket .
0	use this company if you want no hassle and top quality !
0	we cant get many brands in nz like you do overseas , was very much looking_forward to trying out what beautybay had to offer .
0	the ipad case was delivered quicker_than the website said and the case is fantastic .
0	i will never use them again !
0	there were no vip booth ' s or things like that , and in fact in 0 of the bars we went to , the bill came out and shocked the majority of us as to how much it was , it ' s looked like the 0 ' free ' drinks we got were actually added to the bill .
2	they would not let me lodge a complaint after 00_mins on the phone , and said they would call me every day until i agreed to close it , well i won_'_t .
0	free_stuff on every order too
0	would definitely_recommend lakeland furniture to my friends !
2	in a week this company has lost the plot , have angered many thousands of people .
2	excuses when you could get through were lots of orders for the same phone , however , stock level showed at 00 for most of the period .
2	either that or they did not understand because they are based in spain .
0	had to go in store and purchase another in the mean time .
2	they said they couldn_'_t find me and that the parcels were improperly addressed .
0	the substitution was the healthy option !
2	cheaper_than other_suppliers .
2	i emailed the customer service about this and received a preloaded email back saying it would be dealt_with .
0	sainsbury ' s prices are very reasonable , and their ' basics ' range has the same standards of quality as their normal products , but they have more relaxed rules on size and shape .
2	since_discovering pc_specialist ltd i have repeated my order when an old pc ( from another supplier ) crashed .
0	so if quality is mediocre , the only thing it has going for that price_tag is the fit and customisations : the former has been almost a joke in my case .
0	i recently ordered an xbox through tesco_direct with an estimated_delivery of 00 / 00 / 00 .
0	bought wifi for 00_hours and only got an_hour usage due to he wifi going down in just my room .
0	we do not have a letterbox and the package would have been far too big for any letterbox i have ever_seen .
0	pre_- ordered a game 0 months before it came out , at the ridiculously_cheap price of £_00 and it came the day before_release .
2	cheap isn_'_t always best !
2	fantastic after_sales care
0	at_least on other platforms they tell you the fees upfront .
2	excellent communication .
0	i couldn ' t even start .
2	some 00_minutes later the enterprise representative asked me for more money than i had agreed to on the telephone so i refused .
2	- hope that all the other customers who have been waiting for payment get the monies due in the near_future as well
0	i ' ve ordered from topshop no end of times and can_honestly say that i ' ve never been impressed .
0	so its a case of roulette as with most experiences .
2	on checking the email address they sent it to an e_- mail address that does not exist .
2	i didn_'_t think the product i received matched the proof i looked at online at the ordering stage and as a result some of the image has_been cut_off and spoils the result .
0	at 0pm i then rang eflorist , which took over 00_mins to get through to , to be told that flowers had been dispatched and will_definitely reach my wife by 0pm .
0	was very tired and back was aching with standing up for so long in departure lounge & check - in area as there was no seats available .
2	superb service , well priced and well_packed product .
2	for giffgaff technicains if you get this review and feel like helping me then my account is alexadams
0	some time during summer , the date was cancelled and not re - scheduled .
0	in summary , a beautiful villa , managed by a fantastic company , and outstanding value for money ( especially when booked last_minute !)
2	twice i have paid extra for a next_day delivery only to find out the companies used yodel - i hate them they have their own agenda .
0	we didn ’ t pay for “ all you can drink ” on the bus which we were glad about as ( after a boozy lunch ) we only got through 00 beers between the 00 of us .
2	had this over a year now , and it has performed perfectly .
0	the second rimless are of poor design , they fall off my face with any gesturing and when slightly knocked ; too loose fitting !
2	i chose optical_express specifically over the other_companies , as they were opening a new branch in eastbourne where i live .
2	i did not hear from anyone .
0	i find this rude , disrespectful and outright unacceptable for an online company .
2	an_hour later get a phone_call to say payment is declined because the card i was using was not secure enough . i was using an m & s mastercard , i have used this all around the world and for far larger purchases than the one i was trying to do with watchfinder . it turns_out they are unable to accept most credit_cards from third_party providors . m & s . a . a . amazon .( i use these cards because i get loyalty_points for their use ). wasted a load of time on something that should have been pointed_out at the checkout stage . not happy .
0	maybe .
0	i am leaving the country next thursday and want these for the trip .
2	purchased a ladies datejust for a 00st_birthday_present .
0	as mentioned in other reviews nabru address themselves as the company name , this does not fill you with confidence .
2	be careful - although the items may be in the sale they may not be 0000 saleable .
2	they are now owned by a company named cartrawler of dublin who '_s customer service department are experts at refusing to assist if any_problems are experienced , their stock reply is holiday_autos are only an introductory agent , your contract is with the rental company .
0	the item was not packaged properly , just thrown there as if it is not fragile .
0	however they sent me a revised_offer of just £_000 saying the home button didn ' t work properly , i considered the home button would have fell into the normal ' wear and tear ' condition as it was definitely still usable .
0	not only was this out of delivery hours , i feel was especially late for the fact that they were flowers sent in sympathy to a grieving family who had been at work all day and would have needed the evening to wind down .
2	i do have to add that after writing this update i heard immediately from sofia .
2	please_note that if you reply to their emails they get ignored .
0	with free shipping and friendly efficient service , what ' s not to like ?
0	otherwise perfect service .
2	just put your request on the site and watch the quotes come in .
0	but atleast i suppose was reasonable value
0	( i purchased my item a long time ago ) the estimated_delivery date was the 0th so i waited in all day , no parcel .
0	it was easy to book with this site .
0	don ' t get stung by the website claiming " receive no - obligation trade quotes on cheap car parts within minutes via_email , text or telephone absolutely free " because as soon as you reply their premium phone line cash registers are ringing up the profits !
0	from postage to payment , no_problems at all .
2	at 0 x the cost of generic quality which is excellent , and i suspect
0	the guide told us it was open till 0 . it was actually closed by 0pm !
2	00 / 00 / 00 00 : 00 if i could give ' no star ' i would .
2	!
2	order number : pl - pi0000000 [ 0000000 ]
0	in detail . read on !
0	they called me back a few minutes later for details meaning i didn ' t have to pay premium call rates .
2	my husbands barbour coat arrived next_day as promised and the free gift was not suitable when it arrived .

2	then dont hold your breath for a refund , as there refund policy is way over regulated every item has to be sent to a tech lab for testing 00 to 00 working_days_later you may get a refund , buyer_beware
2	would have preferred them to have received them first thing , as the flowers had been in the delivery van all day .
0	chris is a brilliant bloke , told him what was wrong with my console and he knew_exactly_what needed to be done .
2	packaged carefully , quickly delivered , and exactly as i had hoped - the one i had wanted after the first purchase was supplanted by a product that suited me even better .
2	telephone salesman was a true ' gent ' & certainly knew his product range , informing_me of the specifications , limitations & capabilities of my intended purchase .
2	and no resolution to the water leak either !
0	mick aumer
2	i buy off the internet all the time but i '_ve never had to do this before . very strange ??
2	well_done the wetsuit centre !
2	isold tkts for a concert which took place on 00th_sept and im still_waiting for my money .
2	wanted a round the world trip stopping at san francesco , fiji , auckland , christchurch , brisbane and hong_kong with hotels , phoned rtw and everything was finalised within 0 weeks excellent !
2	.
0	i was then
2	i would stay_clear of this company and will never use them again .
0	this is not my 0st problem with this company and im hoping it will be my last as i am going to ask that anyone but yodel deliver to me from now on .
0	following this i proceeded to send them a letter ( oldschool i know ) as couldn ' t get to a operator through their phone line and i am not one to wait for a hour ( as per their instructions - i had just moved_house and had no internet to do it online sadly ).
0	very poor website - constantly crashes , pages show up as " page not found ", company take payment info and then website goes down , promise a 0p sale , yet website would not work .
0	not really my idea of customer_service if i may say so myself .
0	neither time has any note been left to say that someone has come to deliver and i haven ' t been there .
0	she mentioned the 00 - hr helpline and a call - out service they offer if any_problems .
2	flights on time , good baggage_allowance and a professional service .
0	the product was exactly_what i was expecting and made my purchase very easy .
2	the pre delivery inspection wasn_'_t done properly so it was delivered without an english_manual , 0 other handbooks in 00 languages , and i don_'_t speak any of them !
2	unbeatable products at unbeatable prices accompanied by unbeatable service !!
0	either end of the transaction was fine , but the security faff in the middle was entirely unnecessary and felt very amateur .
2	total_waste of my time .
2	had a fantastic holiday , exactly as booked .
0	great service !
0	instead they phoned my mobile and left a message_saying i ' d been authorised to make changes to the contract , could i please phone them back .
0	plus it was also her_birthday yesterday .
2	their survey otions only covers on - time or late
0	?
2	i have 0 x_0gb dim0 ram - bought as pair .
2	these flowers were delivered to an actress friend who says they have really brightened up her dressing room .
0	0 .
0	very bad service !
2	[ edit ]
0	i was issued a tracking code which when you use on royal_mails website says " this item cannot be tracked untill its delivered " so that helps !!
2	on 0 august we received a call and it was arranged the delivery would take place on sunday august 00 .
2	it took many minutes for there to be any reply and eventually she spoke to a man who could find no trace of our order . after some time he decided to transfer us to the branch .
2	no safe , dirt all around , no en suit facilities - had to share communal bathroom .
2	with traffic and poor roads and people not in when they call etc it '_s amazing !
0	i highly_recommend !
2	not only that , i can '_t even log in to their system to view my booking !
0	i rented a car in gran_canaria which supposed to cost 00 £ roughly according to their website , i received emails quick witch confirmations etc .
0	perhaps people are unable to prevent themselves from stealing bedside_tables ?
2	to avoid a £ 0 delivery charge i opted to collect my order from my local superstore , and i received an_email_saying it would be there after 0 pm on monday .
2	yes i got angry with them but not without provocation .
0	i was very pleased with their prices , and it turns_out their worktops are very nice .
2	latest update 00 . 00pm sunday 00th_march .
0	i then phoned carphonewarehouse back and explained what customer_service at tmobile had said , the lady in cpwh store asked me to come in so i agreed , hoping that there was going to be a solution to this problem , after all , it just seemed like a simple error that needed correcting ( how mistaken was i )!
0	i ordered an iphone 0 online with this company back in september and had to pay £_00 deposit which would come off my 0th bill .
2	dispatch was quick and my daughter is very pleased with the helmet .
2	i would recommend viovet to everyone .
2	after a while i get an e_- mail from gumtree admitting a mistake with a reluctant apology .
2	well what do you know , i received not one , but two tripods on 0th_october a month after my order .
2	we had no alternative but to put all our_luggage into the boot and back seat and accept the vehicle .
0	the woman on the phone said their warehouse had a power outage and that they ' d be able to send things out monday ( 0 days_later ).
2	it was at a very good price and was a pink samsung .
0	ordering online is easy and getting the tyres_fitted at a time and place convenient for myself is vital .
0	there is no beating the convenience of being_able to view so many places by price , location and rating .

2	please can you sort this out for me as the iva team keep ringing me when i already told my advisor that i don_'_t want one , and asked him inform them .
0	very pleased with the service and will certainly use them again .
0	allows you to track your shipment and even cancel or amend a current order ; assuming it hasn ' t been shipped already .
0	their delivery time stated 0am - 0pm , the first delivery was at around 0 : 00 am so it was missed .
2	i asked them if they could make a provisional date now rady for when the part comes in and they said their system does not allow them to rechedule in that way .
2	please check them out it is so worth the time and little effort it will take as their web_site is friendly and easy to maneuver through .
2	it seems the manufactures don_'_t make the model any more , so why is it still listed as being ' in stock '.
2	i think they insist that sellers actually have the tix in their hands before allowing them to be listed - maybe wrong , but never had a pick_up to do when using them .
2	i called this into doubt as it was the same package , same address , same driver ( daniel ) and i live in a small village with nt many properties .
0	for service , personal responses etc yes i would , for cost / quality ?
0	there is almost never any downtime and few or no_problems in the 0 years i ' ve been using this company
2	i no_longer do my big shop at tesco , just a quick pop in and out asap if i have to .
0	( 0 ) it is an international parcel so you can either come to scotland pay documents hand over fees and clear the parcel yourself or
0	soon afterwards , they were dispatched , but only one arrived .
0	this is a ridiculous website .
0	trying to get a refund but it ' s a long , painful process and emails were ignored for weeks .
0	i started using them a few_years_ago , they are good but i have had some issues .
0	the information i found was extremely useful and helped_me not only decide on my purchase , but reassure me these people are passionate_about pens and aren ' t in it soley for the money .

2	i would really appreciate knowing why you are regularly failing to keep to your promises re rewards .
2	i have no issue with ebay except for feedback .
0	initially i was skeptical as they arent a household name like moneycorp or currencies direct .
2	i ordered this on a thursday and to keep the price down , used their 0 - 0 day delivery service and as this was an expensive monitor their checking service as well .
0	0 / 0 is generous .
2	i already have !
2	a first_class company to deal with .

0	i reviewed a protein drink in a constructive but critical manner .
2	unfortunately , i discovered on the following_monday , that nothing had been delivered .
0	the young polish waitress who was our host on the first visit was extremely lovely , courteous and very hard working and well deserving of the tip which i left .
2	they get one star purely because - 00 stars is not an option .
0	once again - shocking !
0	in this time we had 0 free drink and 0 free shot .
0	not the best coverage , sometimes poor in rural_areas but they offer value for money .
0	i found it all a bit haphazard and regular .
0	often reading text comes in and out of focus , and i have lost clarity / sharpness of my vision .
2	the coffee is fine , the capsules do not fit as well as the originals

2	well , my friend , what do you think of it so far ?
0	i emailed viagogo , asking for refund and explanation .
0	looking at all the other reviews on here , people have to accept that the cost of the items are incredibly cheap , and therefore there may be problems along the way .
0	would thoroughly_recommend the kensington tea company for any loose - leaf tea related purchase in the future !
2	i was then offered a new deal by a small local company for the same service for only £_00 so i gave notice to xln as required .

2	there is also some structural damage to the matress where it has probably been handled badly .
2	the flowers my mother received were definitely not worth the money i paid so i complained to iflorist who opened a ticket and advised they would check with the australian end for an explanation .

0	the shed arrived early in the day but i had no call , so it was lucky my wife was in .
0	ok site .
2	as discussed , the quality of the internet service was frequently extremely poor and we had consistent problems throughout our time with icuk , none of which were identified as issues with our hardware or anything our end .
2	this is not a problem as such , and the claims can be disputed .
0	great service , can ' t believe i have received such a pleased service , they are truely professional & at the same time very polite , helpful & humble people .
0	overall still pleased with my bottle and will_definately be ordering again soon .
2	good car , perfect for our needs .
2	next time we used car was to go into cape_town & that '_s when problem_arose .
0	i eventually received a text with my delivery time_slot at precisely 00 : 00 and by that time , my entire day had already been spoilt as the delivery was due for 0pm - whats the point of receiving a time_slot if you receive it so late !
2	surely once i have paid , and usually that is immediately , then i should be left excellent feedback rather_than the seller waiting to see what i leave for them .
0	i checked the delivery terms and it said you have to wait 00days before you can put in a complaint .
0	i ' ve been left flabbergasted at some of the lame excuses & responses i got from people who shouldn ' t work in customer support roles - they didn ' t have a clue !
2	was looking for some base_layer wind proof items , found the cold killer items .
0	it is almost_impossible to get through on the phones , i have been hung_up on twice , and each member of customer_service told me a different thing each time .
2	delivery was delayed through no fault of mytub but i was kept very well informed_throughout .
2	when i complained to economy_car rentals they investigated and then copied me in on a very rude email from their representatives sax car_rental suggesting that a renault clio was the same size as a ford_focus with the same boot capacity !
2	i ordered approx £_00 goods a week ago , i noted they do not dispatch items at weekends so assumed this would be sent on monday .
2	unfortunately , i found them to be very difficult to get used to , as i seemed to have to have them perched on the end of my nose to see distance .
2	virgin_media , the company that suddenly offeres cheap deals to people when i used to pay thru the roof for half bit 0mb bb service with no sky_tv channels .
2	i '_ve demanded a refund and will let everyone know how i get on with that .

0	they couldn ' t be bothered to get in touch .
0	they attempted delivery , didn ' t bother to call my mobile , didn ' t leave a card .
2	they have a lonng way to go to learn customer service off someone amazing like say 00 red or titan bingo and casino or butlers or dream and so on .
0	the way the furniture is packaged with the base of the wardrobe together with the main part means that the delivery staff cannot lift it due to the excess weight .
2	it seems unlikely that they ran_out in the few hours between my order and their first email . the price was good , so maybe it is trade - off .
2	first_class service .
0	full of bally games and all the popular igt games .
0	trying out this service to see if it will work .
0	website
2	sent from_pillar to post , the same check in dealing_with lots of different flights .
0	one order was lost in the post ( i never received it ) i told chaos_cards and under their idiotic rules i was banned .
0	i dunno if i ' m the minority who dislikes their service , or whether the people who like their service are actually less inclined to post positive_comments , but at the end of the day , if the serivce ain ' t up to standard , then you can ' t expect people to be in your favour .
0	firstly the two items i ordered were wrapped in one thin sheet of paper , with no invoice / dispatch note / pick note ( same as the first ) and held together by one thin piece of clear tape which was actually open at one end !
0	took 0 - 0 attempts for them to call me back .

0	[ placed order on 00th_november , well in time for christmas .
2	i would definitely recommend lightbulbs_direct , i '_ve never had any_issues with them .
2	all of a sudden 0st august , balance dropped to £ 0 , i contacted their online help agent who informed me that i dialled a premium number 000000 on 00 july at 00 : 00 & 00 seconds whilst i was in bed and the phone was downstairs with no other person having access to it , this call cost £ 0 .

2	i went_ahead with the booking .
2	i bought a sub_standard ben 00 camera for my son and when i realised how poor the quality was , i tried to return it .
0	we had a smooth day with timing and organisation and maps and plentiful champagne on the punt !
2	the element fitted last time by the argos engineer had only two electrical connectors on the element - so there engineer taped the earth cable to a live cable - to me a fire risk ?.
0	!
2	only got one of three items ordered after a delay
2	oh , and they send a treat in every package .
2	i have changed my rating from 0 to 0_stars now .
2	no refund so i have my credit_card co chasing for the money back .
2	i hope this is not due to being measured incorrectly by the surveyor , that subsequently had to be cut down to fit the existing hole !!
0	overall :
2	ordered 0 bottles of juice which arrived very promptly .
0	just couple of clicks and all done from your home and no bothering going to the bank or western_union or all this money transfer companies .
0	i have been a customer with o0 since march of this year .
0	and yet , all they have to do is respond to their criticism and listen to the customers .
0	would use again and highly_recommend
2	anyway i logged compliant with john_lewis got a form response of its been passed here there and around , and the hermes company have been informed big deal , not even a sorry you were not called back or were it was first sent to why it was opened and who did indeed sign for it and why did i not have to ??
0	so , i think its clear that wired0fire are not money grabbers , out to make a quick buck .
0	my nephew was bouncing round the house he was so happy .
0	you are recycling company not carphonewarehouse .
0	the system could perhaps be made a little easier but other than that it was great .

2	got very good deal probably would have cost more to do it myself .
0	i reccomend them to all my friends and family who wear lenses
2	i will think_twice about setting foot in a stratstone or evans halshaw dealership again .
0	0 .
2	ceo team
0	i suspect it has been returned to nespresso - dpd will no doubt charge for this and charge for nespresso to re - deliver .
2	we sat back as our mobile man fitted them on our drive .
0	i ' ve now stayed in 00 of their hostels throughout europe and am yet to be disappointed .
2	i was surprised that the items arrived in a plastic_bag as all the contents were battered , i would have expected them to be boxed like most other_retailers .
2	however , the website , page one , appears to have never been sense tested
0	did not need to pay upfront and the price was cheaper_than booking with the hostel itself .
2	outdoor_kit offered the best price and very competitive , next_day delivery .
0	well maybe they should .
2	!
2	cannot recommend this company high enough !
2	ordered the x box one with titanfall .
0	is it any surprise when they once considered locking discs to specific consoles ?
2	as instructed by a camerabox rep .
2	appalling fulfilment ruins this site and i potential_customers not to use it unless you want to wait weeks for your order to arrive and be fobbed_off endlessly by their ' customer service ' team telling you that " it will be there tomorrow ".
0	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0 months .
0	when i rebooked collection for the second attempt , i asked for the courier to be given my mobile number in case of any_problems .
2	the other item was 0 packs of socks and this morning a tiny package was put through my letterbox and inside was one pack .
2	unable to obtain refunds .
2	in the end as a gesture of goodwill i accepted their offer of a discount_voucher_code instead and purchased other goods in late february .
2	when it arrived there was a rip on the side of the cushion on the chair and a gap between the two sections of sofa as well as stitching out and loose staples underneath .

0	( at 0pm !!!)
0	customer_service is terrible .
0	the questions i had about the product before ordering was answered_quickly by their customer_services .
0	being a self - clearing fault it went but came back daily if the car was even driven slightly hard ( like dring an over - take as often is / was the case ).
2	sarah and linda ( cabin_crew ) were extremely attentive and did everything they could to make the journey as stress - free and relaxing as possible for my husband .
0	leaving me on the doorstep with 0 heavy items and nobody to help me .
2	would definitely recommend .
2	due to high level of customer_care i received i would consider_using world_stores again but not for this product .
0	total_con !

0	i will_definitely keep using this site !
2	ordered a pair of alpinestars joey waterproof shoe tarmac in suede , unfortunately shiny leather arrived .

0	expense of making no end of calls to customer_service , sending photographs , videos and writing letters .
2	he promised me that someone would get back to me yesterday , no one did .
2	first of all , i have my own problems , i don_'_t want to hear yours .
2	it has left me feeling frustrated and unlikely to use this website again because i want and expect delivery to my front_door .
0	" it goes on your account " they say .
0	the network is an_absolute waste of space .
2	part well_packed and works well .
2	buy with confidence !
2	the food actually tastes good which is a first for diet meals which normally taste awful .

2	!
2	sent it away and got it back 00_hours_later !
0	very cheap and reliable
0	i bought crysis 0 hunter edition from cdkeyhouse , reliable !!! safe !!
0	for the first 0 months the internet had to be reset atleast once a week , it just didn ' t work until you signed into the router an reset it .
2	it is in full working order but i was a bit surprised that in addition to the unlocking , it seemed to have wiped many of the phones settings / features etc during some reformatting - so in fact there were no_longer any nokia themes , wallpapers , tones etc left on the phone .
2	i have phoned 0 times and got through once to be commisserated with and told someone would contact me to tell me whats_happening . no contact .
2	what a complete_waste of time and energy .
0	would definitely_recommend .
0	but after a few_days and frequent posting on facebook for the slightest acknowledgement of my order they eventually managed to outsource enough copies to cover my order at_least , which was made last weekend .
2	these were manipulated by me and i continued to build the 0 bays .
0	i was always informed about the process , perfectly satisfied !

0	amazing !
2	thanks wheelspin ,
0	we weren ' t sure what to do as we had booked an_appointment without really being 000_% on what car to get .
0	walls and floors have a great selection of products to choose from , so there ' s no_quibble from me there .
2	price was also best of several websites .
2	would most certainly use their services again !
2	i decided that patience was called for , & even giving our beloved royal_mail the benefit of the doubt was still surprised when nothing had arrived by the 00 / 00 / 00 .
0	tv , fridge_freezer , oven , microwave , washing_machine , and phone .
2	have used o0 via my tesco phone for some years now .
0	all in all from the original viewing of the car , test_drive and finance meeting to picking it up it only took three days , would of been less if i had been able to get to the dealers earlier on in the days instead of 0 hour before closure .
0	we had a last_minute hiccup the day before the hen_do ( down to one of the bridesmaids ) and i left 0 voicemails requesting a return phone call and sent multiple email messages also requesting a phone call .
0	i will not be renewing my contract when it comes up for renewal - an awful company to be contractually tied to . i strongly_recommend against them .
2	i chose this company from a number found on the internet .
0	i ordered a game from simply_games that cost less_than the other big companies i was thinking of ordering with .
2	i did not receive what i ordered for a long time .
2	der mangler et sammenhæng mellem smag , fremstilling samt udseende .
0	avoid unless you enjoy hassle
2	ordered an xhose through wowcher ( my first time ) didn_'_t receive wowcher code through email so i couldn_'_t redeem item which has now expired . got in touch with wowcher and they offered to credit me 00_% of the cost of the hose , where else can a company just take your money and run putting all the blame on the buyer , will_definitely not be using them again and will be advising everyone_else against using them .
2	i have now sent a request into barclays to do a chargeback on the payment .
2	i sent the phones off in the free post packaging sent by envirofone , and hey_presto , money in the bank a few_days_later .
2	ultimate_appliances must be the worst internet based company i have ever had the misfortune to encounter .
0	delivery was quick and delivered on time .
2	i also had a slight_problem with my current glasses on distance viewing which were resolved as well , so all in all im very pleased with the service , specs and price .
2	i found the whole trip very relaxing .
2	!.
0	useful that i can pay by card or cash because most fast food places dont take card .
2	sh0t happens !.
2	i have subsequently hired a small car from them , and neither of these points was true .
2	my advice is for people to order small_quantities initially , to see if the quality is up to par , before placing a bigger order .
2	. on 0 separate_occasions ' after ' taking this delivery , we were rang up by
2	?
0	great , at a time when identity theft is at its highest they ' re handing us leisure vouchers instead of trying to protect their customers .
0	their customer_service is top as well .
2	unfortunately it was apparently out of stock .
0	the payment process is very fast .
2	foremost , it arrived late , then , i received this surprisingly high invoice from the german custom .
0	it seems like a lot of people have had terrible experiences but for me the majority of my orders have come super - quickly and the products have been great .
0	i thought i would chance it with wowcher hoping that they were a better company but it appears not .
0	this company is amazing !
2	if i were a company i would never use them .
2	secret_sales forget the high_street shops the company that has everything for everybod from house hold items to clothing to jeweleryy the prices are incredabile the designers to to many to name them all i love jewelery bling is my thing your choices never seems to stop amazing mee and the fact that after at_least one purchase your brilliant idea of charging us that set fee means that myself and thousandsd of auther people cann shop till wee drop and wee dont need to pay any postage for a year if wee choose to take that option a tottaly brilliant idea thanks a million your company is to to fabulous for words i have a saying dont be great be fabulous always and i truly belive that you are just that .
2	sadly boohoo '_s incompetence kept the item moving around their depots but never getting to me or even contacting me .
0	they were an actual embarrassment , weltered .
0	i called numerious times and the customer_service was hard to go through .
0	duh !
0	they are always willing to accommodate and get the job_done quickly .
2	i was very impressed with how quickly my order was delivered .
0	totally love tsohost .
0	emailed the company a week_ago and still no reply ?
2	villa_plus delivered on all_aspects and i would recommend them to anybody .
0	so reliable , keep up the good work digitalrev .
2	if they could not provide the answers they should have said so , rather_than setting_up an expectation and making me call , call and call .
0	.
0	i wanted to make_sure i could upgrade as time went by and the system i wanted was faithly built as per my instructions .
2	you have been_warned !
2	however , the delivery seems to have been so slow .
0	since i spoke to them my mum rang me to say on 00th_january_0000 , which was nearly 0 weeks_later she received a delivery of dead , slimy flowers and the delivery person did not request a signature !
2	we have sent images of the sink and told they would go to technical_department .
0	delivery was excellent with full installation .
0	!.
2	so i paid for next working day ( monday ) delivery which happened sadly with a very broken shower_tray .
2	they need to work out their stock_levels and list it live on the website to avoid further inconvenience to customers .
0	great picture quality and sound , even with their standard definition stuff .
2	we pack stuff really well , yet items still get broken , note how virtually anything mildly valuable or breakable is not covered , and last_week a signed for item , which costs extra proved to be a complete_waste as it was just left on a doorstep in the rain !
2	the instument new would have cost £_000 . 00 .
0	feetus had a great selection of products , including the one i was looking for at the best price .
0	apparently my credit refund hadn ' t been released because the electrical bill hadn ' t been generated for some unknown_reason .
2	the ordering_process was also very easy .
0	this is the only site that does not charge booking_fees which on other_sites are normally 00_% and when you are booking multiple nights this can really add up !!
2	in my opinion they finally have mangaged to make the whole exerience uncomportable , from booking on line with all the £ extras , restricting hold_baggage to 00kg and insisting on their cabin_crew selling cheap features and offers in flight !
0	without any explanation whatsoever my review got suspended .
0	i submitted my first email to iflorist to find out where the flowers were , as the live_chat feature was offline .
2	all together a very enjoyable_experience .
0	i found this lg after googling for a while and ebuyer had the best price and free delivery too as a special , which made it even better .
2	i got a reply fairly quickly saying that it would be passed on to the relevant_department .
0	i only shop at supplement_warehouse , i always recommend it to my friends .
0	i was though somewhat annoyed with the 0 business days for the items to be sent for delivery , and then additionally 0 business days for arrival .
2	sadly so did a lot of other people -- and finished up queuing in the car_rental hall for 0 hot and angry hours before reaching the goldcar desk .
0	it all worked out as the site said .
0	basically there was a passing the buck between the two companies ( autoeurope and hertz who actually were the company representing them at this location ) each telling that it was the other company ' s responsibility to inform us .
2	he explainded what work needed to be done and was very efficient and 00_minutes later the job was done .
2	they even balanced up another wheel with a new same make tyre that i had recently aquired .
2	i also think the instruction booklet could be improved .
0	been ordering from chemuk for many years now , always been steller service .
0	therefore , the obvious questions , as woman between 00 - 00 very rarely join such sites , in what way is the service fit for purpose ?
0	like a gold mine full of landmines .
2	the delivery was fast and the matress is very comfortable but the packaging was soaking_wet on arrival which transferred into the matress and the free pillows are absolutely_useless as they have no substance .
0	it sucks .
0	they not professionals .
0	ps_: @ officialiphoneunlock please fix the timeline approximates . save for that . legit all the way , from order confirmation , payment confirmation etc .
2	these deals come up often so keep checking .
2	this is a back - up pc so that the business can continue when the next pc dies of old age .
0	always overcharge me by mistake
2	sent my claim in the middle of august .
0	so , in an ethical and moral climate , do you really want to do business with people who exploit the front line workers ?
2	the watch is really beautiful .
0	i ended_up being one of the unlucky one ' s and had to return my ring for a refund , which was also dealt_with swiftly and incredibly well .
0	- variety of different_ways to spend your tokens ( privates , voyageur , group and tipping ).
0	excellent , everything was perfect and the price was great .
2	beware if you are one minute later than_anticipated ; you '_ll need to find payment kiosk and pay extra .
0	i spoke to the manager who promised to resolve everything , but it took constant chasing to get my full_refund .
2	he finally found something at over 000_quid , i told him i was not happy , as i had started at 000_quid , he offered 000_quid , now , after 00_minutes , i ' m at over 000_quid .
0	on a final note , i am wearing my purchase as i type this review .
0	can ' t speak highly_enough of them . highly_recommended !
0	i will be a returning customer !!
0	the next_day i received the monitor and the extra paypal payment was refunded .
0	great products at great prices .
2	frustrated .
0	which makes no sense as i ' m 00_minutes away from both of your warehouses .
0	0 .
0	0 . they put some poor asian lads in a box on traffic light to advertise their " any pizza any size " in sunny day !
0	they have the tools but they don ' t know how to use them .
2	the products are price are great though .
2	told they would call back in an_hour , when they did , they wanted all the same details all over again , and offered an_appointment on monday - iasked if i could confirm the appointment shortly as i needed to ensure someone was there to accommodate them , and the call_centre woman agreed i could phone back to confirm .
0	i booked a flight from christchurch ( new_zealand ) to seoul ( south korea ), with a stop over in sydney ( australia ), for 00th_december_0000 .
0	but annoyed with the shipping - i requested a sample which i was happy with and placed and order and paid for shipping .
2	would use again .
2	my order was processed straight_away and put on a rolling order , in that they send me another collar when the old one is running out .
0	i don ' t like the lack of transparency or the cognition of privacy on facebook .
2	!
2	i didn_'_t , as it got mis sorted and went to a different depot !
2	got the same sat_nav same price free delivery off amazon , don_'_t waste your time i won_'_t again .
2	the quality of the work we have had done has_been excellent and the value is just unbeatable .
2	however the goods were not dispatched for a week and no explanation was offered , i had to chase them using their premium_rate phone numbers sometimes being left on hold for over 0 minutes . i will not use them again if the goods are available elsewhere .
2	i ' d happily_recommend them to anyone interested in looking good while they work , rest and play !
0	i find the pizza ' s to be average and very expensive , also they are a bit stingy on toppings ive found .
2	will_definitely_use again .
2	chrck it out !
0	they sound professional on the phone , have no manners ( the voicemail left by [_name ] was " yeah hi erm ." and generally seem like an exceptionally poor organisation .
0	my rep was a great help dealing_with my question , & was provided a fast & prompt service regarding my questions & was able to resolve my problem instantly -
0	we booked a private transfer to and from tenerife south airport .
0	great price and fast delivery
0	order arrived on time , i am delighted that i decided to shop online with oakfurnitureland .
2	unfortunately my order wasn_'_t directed to eflorist '_s nearest agent .
2	if i forget to use it when buying something i could kick myself !!
2	as these two arms were fitted to the exact_same fitting points that the previous two arms were fitted ( they lasted for 0 - 0 years ) then one would assume if the fitting is incorrect , then the previous arms should have broken !!
0	this last_year alone i noticed everytime i topped_up on my pre_- pay card they were taking money at the same time .
2	they also have increased my price package by a considerable_amount recently .
0	the service has been terrible and i feel_like they are ignoring me so that they will not have to give me a refund - an easy way to make money !
0	their service is top - notch and the booking process through them is very easy to get the hang of .
2	very disappointed
0	viagogo had no further details of the ticket to pass to me ( seat number , row , ticket number etc .)
2	overall - quite helpful but they did keep me hanging_around for nearly 0 hours and initially told me that it would be about an_hour and a half in total .
0	i knew i will not have any_problems with beautybay . com . thank_you very much for my nice first experience with you :_d
0	u also have online support if u need .
0	na de online bestelling en betaling een afspraak gemaakt via internet voor_het vervangen van twee banden .
0	i accepted this .
2	unimpressed , terry porter
2	thats priceless !
2	this last time we had the engineer come on the 00th_november , to date still_waiting for the cooker element - so no oven working .
0	i literally can ' t complain_about the service scan have provided for me , ( admittedly i do not have the misfortune to need to return or rma anything ).
2	on check out , the receptionist asked me how my stay was .
2	glad i made the purchase with this company ,
0	goods arrived next_day .
2	delivery was a day late & the time of day was also late but that was the fault of parcel_force .
2	nicki
0	you may think that with number of pack cards they use , it ' s a high possibilities , but play the game and read players ' comments to see patterns emerging to suggest otherwise .
2	i think they are rob dogs they charge to much for using papal . i wont have nothing paid into paypal as they want a arm & a leg for using them . no thanks
0	the 000gtx was more_expensive .
0	very reasonably_priced .
0	so . if you have the time , the stuff is really fabulous , but it ' s a real trek to get there .
0	they also offer very good hotel and car_hire suggestions .
0	the option to purchase additional gifts ( a teddy_bear , chocolates and a card ) with the flowers was also very useful .
2	very friendly on the phone too .
2	it was lucky that bad_weather prevented me needing it sooner .
2	delighted with boilerjuice .
0	then i tried to reschedule the fibre appointment 0 times this week via the talktalk website only to receive error messages that the service was unavailable and to try again later .
0	it is so annoying when you wait for delivery all day .
0	update_: i don ' t want to delete my previous review , because it did still happen , but i have now received a phone call from owen ( who seems like a nice chap .
2	as above really .
0	if you want stuff quick for a gig / tour this is the shop for you !
2	super quick delivery too .
0	no reply from them and they sent me the cheque for the money .
0	will_definitely use again .
2	no - one came .
0	however , i still can ' t believe they didn ' t email those who had bought tickets to let them know .
2	simple seals on the whisk shafts would solve this but kenwood will not accept this .
0	i ordered my item on 00th_may 0000 and today ( 00th_may 0000 ) i ' m still_waiting .
0	who do they think they are ?
2	it just isn_'_t worth the risk .
0	my phone was in mint_condition sent it to rpc with quote they know i off over £_000 original asking price .
0	sweetie , if my data is not in your system - when i provided you copies of it - maybe there just might be something wrong with your system ?
2	ordered the same day and recieved the 0 bulbs after the weekend .
2	i was unaware due to a missed email that ladbrokes had changed their policy to after 00am on the day being gauranteed !
2	now 00_hours after message left , i still have not got a call back !
2	cheapest price i could find anywhere bridgestone fitted for the same price as budget tyres anywhere_else .
2	i found the site easy to use and access the best rate of mexican peso '_s .
2	i placed an order for 0 grant featherson chairs on 00april and paid 000 . 00 euro delivery expected august when it came near to delivery time it was pushed forward to october 0 th and yet again when it came to near delivery time it was pushed forward again to december this is completely_unacceptable i have made numerous_calls and received calls from people who just sit at a desk and don_'_t know anything about company where the warehouse is based or who the manager of the company is i asked all these questions and was told the supervised would contact me heard_nothing since i just want to know where my chairs are and when they will be delivered someone must know that truthful answer i have commenced legal proceedings through european circles to prevent this company from trading they are not open honest and transparent just let me know where my chairs are and don_'_t get a guy sitting at a desk who hasn_'_t a clue to call me i want to speak to someone who will tell the truth
2	quality is very good .
2	i was recommended this company by a friend who was trying to get tyres for his ural outfit .
0	fab pizzas
2	ccl ?
2	not here - prices are great , choice is wide and costs are clearly_stated .
0	i am still_waiting for my order and the company just refuse to reply or respond .
2	this is the second time i have used lightbulbs . com .
0	the majority of people only come on here to complain so some of the review can be biased .
2	proof will be in the pudding but booking a great hotel in bergen for a swift hop over there has_been really easy .
2	i '_ve been to majorca many , many_times before and stayed in many types of hotels and would classify myself as a very experienced traveller .
2	delivery was quick and the product was well_packed .
2	i ordered 0 sliding_door locks .
2	why ??
2	does as it says !
0	huge_selection and some of the best prices ive_seen , easy to navigate and free_swag is always a plus .
2	extremely pleased with the price and simplicity of the system however the configuration of my phones was causing one not to register , the tech files did not explain the connection of more than one phone in a network , despite soho00 being designed for businesses .
0	item arrived 0 days after ordering as a ' signed for ' item with royal_mail .
2	they should be more honest right there on the product page on what timeframe you can expect .
2	i posted in their facebook_page and said that i wasn_'_t overly happy with the delay , in a professional way . no insulting or bad language and my comment was promptly deleted and my posting rights were taken away . so there gives an insight_into how these_guys deal with an unhappy customer .
2	avoid them they are hyping all their prices .
0	i ' ve been very impressed
0	by_far the lowest_prices and biggest_selection arround !
2	was going to get flight down and drive back ( not a good idea in october ).
0	she said " it can be any sort code and account number , it doesn ' t have to be the same one as you made your order with ".
0	they picked_up my car on time , done the mot and returned it in spotless condition .
2	i let castleberg know as soon as i had received it and they thanked me for my understanding during the busy xmas_period so all good in the end but unfortunately i cannot report a 0 / 0star delivery experience !
2	and i know someone who chauffeured the directors .
0	:-) thanks guys ,
2	everything we have bought from made . com has_been well made and really good value .
2	eventually i replied to one email_stating that i was handing everything over to barclays to recover my money .
0	definitely not as good as the website would have you believe .
0	you will find varying levels of service from store to store , some valuing the customer whilst others continue to concentrate purely on profits and footfall through the door .
0	i really like the fact that there are so many reviews on each hostel .
2	firstly the line was very bad i could hardly hear the customer service lady so called back from another phone line .
0	the products are very good value for money but do not lack in quality .
0	one piece of advice : the business is located at the other side of covent_garden from where google_maps says it is located .
0	my husband and i both love supplement_warehouse !
0	sick of fu completely now .
0	really disappointed today .
0	with enough being enough .
0	nothing was to much hassle we were even picked_up from the train_station to go and collect our car today .
0	i have been calling and e_- mailing their offices all day asking for them to combine my two vouchers , so that i wont have to pay an extra 00 £ in total for something that was not my mistake .
2	i had difficulty in finding an area that was in focus , making me look like a chicken when trying to read , and the double vision / 0d glasses effect was giving me headaches .
2	good old bt hadn_'_t effected the credit .
2	indeed the reviews of cameras was superb .
0	been with vodafone for around 00 years .
2	it was perfectly engraved .
0	one of their original lies told to me 00months ago was that if i left them they would also delete my screen name and i ' d lose my aol . com email address - this is a lie .
2	will_definitely_use again .
0	i used hifi - tower to purchase radio microphones for karaoke use .
0	they then followed up to check we were happy .
0	i hope i will visit another places as well using hostelbookers , because i love traveling :) my best experience has been in naples where we stayed in cozy hostel sharing the room with other 0 people and the owners made for as a pasta party in the evening .
0	the customer_service team contacted me to resolve problems and they genuinely seemed to care about their mistakes .
0	cannot find my address even_though we live in a major city eg manchester !
0	i would thoroughly_recommend best0systems to anyone out there .
0	got no announcement of having to go to departure departure lounge at 0 :_00pm when we were supposed too and asked a jet0 rep if we could .
2	fantastic !
2	my glasses cost over $_000 . 00 and i also paid around $_000 . 00 for the repair up front .
2	i am so impressed - got this mail re my earlier review
0	i have been with t - mobile for several years now i these problem that are occurring seem to becoming more frequent meaning every other day for the last 0 months .
2	what lets the side down is the uninformed wait , my order has_been stuck on unfulfilled since i placed it and it is due tomorrow , when i wrote to complain i was told it was in transit from their european hub , well tell me that on the website , all i can assume is that you don_'_t have stock if you do not keep me informed .
0	absolute_rip_off .
0	overall i would recommend it as its a scenic tour , but don ' t expect to jump off every other stop for ten mins .
0	0 vulnerability scan
2	the help facilities are excellent but most_importantly so easy to use .
0	the website is pretty_much standard and nothing special , and at some points i found it a little_confusing to navigate and find the games i wanted to play .
2	the first lot of flowers that i ordered from serenata she was so pleased with , but after this experience - i will not be using them again !!!
2	most internet suppliers offer free shipping on larger orders .
0	superb .
2	either you are going to honour your promises or not , but if not , scrap the rewards system and lower your prices as you are not acting fair !
0	aktuell bin ich auf arbeitssuche und habe verschiedene suchmaschinen ausprobiert , um die passende zu finden .
2	jo ( resort manager ) and flora and ollie ( our chalet staff ) were fantastic - couldn_'_t have been more helpful and looked after us royally .
2	i was not reassured - i had ordered a mobile_phone .
2	!
2	we spoke at length to a very knowledgable person who advised us in a simple but certainly not patronising way .
2	now i don_'_t know whether this is a direct result of me theatening legal_action ( appropriate complaint form was already filed with watford trading_standards 00th_march ) or the result of emails sent directly to persons i have been led to believe are directors of cex ( linkedin is a useful website ) whatever , one should not have to resort to such measures if a company wants to retain a loyal_customer base and for them to be successful , that requires a proffesionally run after care customer service dept .
0	flowers were good , but the message transcribed was described as unorganised and superimposed , making it difficult to read and of course appreciate the purpose of the flowers and meaning .
2	the last text i got from them was this morning to say my motherboard would be delivered between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
2	no refund .
2	orders arrive in 0or 0days , and even paying for the prescription we still save enough in 0 months to pay for third .
0	i ' m lucky i paid through paypal as i ' m opening a dispute !
2	two coins with the same " from " price , and similar single coin price can have materially different 0 + and 00 + prices .
0	the item did arrive on time for my son ' s birthday but only just !!!!
0	there was another order with lots of chasing .
0	and u can sometimes get a really good bargin when things go on sale !
0	excellent service , very professional , have already referred it to other small start - up companies like my own .
0	still no response .
0	one time i had a problem with my bill , when i ' d gone over my free minutes ( something they ' d previously notified me of by text but this time they neglected to tell me and so i accumulated a spend of over £_00 instead of my usual £_00 .)
0	on a couple of occasions for absolutely no reason , cashback has been declined , usually by a merchant who has left the site , and quidco aren ' t very helpful at getting it back .
2	james_villas shame on you
2	booked a taxi to take me to the airport , pre_- paid online as thought would be easier .
0	yodel you ' ve been doing so well .
2	we took out insurance which we have used for repairing the cooker .
2	i would with out doubt reccomend them thank_you very much 0 the excellent service that i got from you .
2	thank_you for your reply .
0	bring back the flat_rate fee and you guys would be the top supplement chain online .
0	you will not receive your goods as the company went into liquidation months_ago .
2	i reported them to the british police for fraud .
0	having bought the engagement_ring for my fiancee in march_0000 from quality diamonds , we returned to purchcase both of our_wedding_rings from quality diamonds too .
0	thank_you groupon
2	interest_rates are more than acceptable - never the lowest of the low but you get what you pay for .
2	i then asked them to wait_until all products were in .
0	the rewards program is rubbish and might as well not exist !
0	next_day delivery was very cheap and the product i was after was still the cheapest including delivery .
0	after many phone_calls to expedia over several days , they maintained this lack of customer_service .
0	i found what i needed on ebay at half the price !
0	i sent a glass hob via them , and it was smashed in transit .
2	i did not cancel any order , however they told me my money was put back into my account , it would take 0 to 0 days ?
0	i was sent an offer through and even_though i had had a bad customer_service experience with them previously decided i would give them another try .
0	they take that monthly payment from your guarantors account .
2	unless you want to waste valuable time calling them up on their premium_rate number to see where the bed you bought with promised delivery is , don_'_t touch them .
0	the assistants are based in spain i think so it ' s hard to get across what you need .
2	would happily use them to book our holiday .
0	v quick delivery .
0	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
0	not terrible but not the service described and a big inconvenience to me .
2	i also needed to get an internal flight on a domestic airline .
2	it would have been helpful to know that before i had to call in .
2	booked the valet service a week in advance .
0	this weekend ), but today the hotel informed me they have no record of my booking .
2	arrived ok and packaged properly .
0	i use their gym gloves and the gel system works really well to reduce calluses and sore joints .
2	just to cancel .
2	and suggest you do too .
0	if i want to cancel my order and go elsewhere i am more_than welcome to .
0	very very pleased with it .
2	i must add they were very apologetic .
2	can '_t fault them
2	so , guess_what ?
0	waited_till 00 . 00 to call eatery , no answer , so called just_eat direct .
2	when placing an order remeber their warranty service is just as likely to give you a partial_refund as a fixed or replacment item and they will try and get one over on you for as little as £ 0 .
2	the canon instruction_manual referred to a uk address and contact numbers and the packaging contained a uk 0 - pin plug .
2	very sound .
0	this wasn ' t explained in_advance and it wasn ' t possible to fix the problem .
2	i was quite shocked as the tables looked to be poor quality and definitely couldn_'_t use them so i contacted customer_services to see what i could do .
2	i ' d recommend mazuma to anyone as a safe , trustworthy and honest buyer of old_mobiles .
0	we went with laser combat and go - karting near salisbury which were both fantastic fun .
0	i have no_hesitation in purchasing from barrington_sports again
0	could have easily been crushed .
2	it was before parcel0go and insurance we '_ll see - not much hope .
2	carphone_warehouse
2	but i did not receive what i was quoted even through all products where good quality and in perfect working order . or my goods where syphoned off at the warehouse . i lost a total of nearly_£ 0 . 00 , which i agree is not much .
2	shorts are of excellent quality and value .
0	i came here for a specific shirt my sister told me about , and when i saw all of the other products i was very impressed .
0	preordered two copies of a game .
2	arrived 00th_january - better late than never .
0	on suggesting to sainsburys that they include the price of any changed items on the delivery sheet we were told this was not possible and basically to stop moaning .
2	i had to contact fensa myself , it was disclosed supaglazing had forgot to submit the request to fensa !
0	excellent website and delivery was perfect just as i expected from them
2	" could we please ask you to take a picture of the problem you described , then reply to this email with the photo attached ?

0	after terrible customer_service from currys which_resulted_in me wasting a full day waiting in for a product which never arrived i decided to try ao .
2	they have succeeded in ensuring that i shall never do_business with them should i need the services of a home improvements company in the future .
0	i have a vps which became corrupted due to a 000reg upgrade , in my mind this is unacceptable but the support staff helped_me get things back up online .
2	i organised for a washing_machine to be delivered , installed and the old machine removed for my parents who live 000_miles from me .
0	they could have said there was a problem in the time it takes to process the phones or that the payments were late but no i had to complain to learn that there was a delay and it would take longer_than usual to process my phones .
0	contacted customer support who were very polite & helpful who arranged for the tickets to be collected upon departure .

2	all i can do is try to spread the word and try to warn_others to avoid this co . like the plague !
0	overdraft charges are a ripoff and their local branches are very very poor .
0	care - ha !
2	amazon and other_companies can cope easily with this but fragrance_direct can '_t .

0	- det kunne jeg gøre bedre selv !
2	after sending this review , compnay got in touch and refunded my money , i have now booked correct dates with them as they were the most competitive price .
2	with glasses_direct i got to try the frames at home over a few_days , more time to make up my mind which frames were most suited , also gave me the opportunity to get opinions of family and close friends .

2	all i have to say is that i was disappointed by the highly pressurised and unethical sales technique of the alamo representative .
2	they have not ( funnily_enough ) got a recording of this part of the conversation and nor do they have a recording of the initial call where they say they are from google , they deny they even said it , looking at previous reviews there is a pattern here as they have said the same thing to other people .

2	they have designed their business that way ; the fortress walls are high .
0	unforunately the built in flaws are too great and the discounts would have to be far bigger than they are to tempt me .

2	however i ordered during xmas_period and it was only after three working_days had elapsed after xmas that i was notified despatch was occurring , by this time i had received delivery of another item from another supplier that i placed at exactly the same time so i was quite concerned when on checking with po track and trace the po indicated that they had not received my item from the small independent castleberg people !
0	the night before my flight i logged in using my reservation code , only to find that i could not choose seats . i called iberia , who claimed it was a ba ticket . ba claimed it was an aa ticket . i called aa and they were unable to find me on either flight . i called ba back in london and they were able to locate the correct reservation code with aa that finally logged me in . i then had to pay $_000 extra to reserve a seat . however , the story does not end there . this time i could not find my flight from sfo to ord and aa told me they could not tell me whether i was on the flight or not . i called netflights - only to discover they are closed on the weekends ( this was a sat evening flight ). it took three attempts with aa to locate my reservation which lo and behold had been under the same booking code ba located - netflights or aa or both just did not put the itinerary together for me under the same booking code .

0	payment was very prompt once i ' d decided there was no way of getting the original price offered , was nice that this went straight into the bank too rather_than having the time of receiving a cheque and waiting for this to clear .
2	some of the times have been my fault in not wanting a replacement at another time / day , but not always .
0	i was then kindly suggested some alternatives ( none even remotely similar and two at_least £_000 below my price range ).
2	i am so frustrated by their useless customer service who cannot deal with the problem or send any kind of specific reply to emails .

0	i haved used several other_websites and opticians before i used dragonspecs and have to say that dragonspecs has been outstanding in responding to queries than any of the other_websites / opticians plus you pay a fraction of what you would normally pay if you place the same order with one of the major high_street opticians .
2	as per the tracking , it has spent the last 0 days bouncing around nj usa .
2	i have been using these_people for several_years - i just occasionally sell things on ebay and need to send them overseas or even within the uk .

0	i have been living in china for over 0 years now , and i have been a user of strongvpn for around one year , and i can tell you , it is by_far the best vpn service to use in china , i have long struggled with different vpn providers , and the service was most of the time not good , not only because of the server speed , but the problem is that in china with different vpn servers and different internet provider companies your experience with vpn can be very different , but when i finally signed_up to strongvpn and now i am happy with the service , their variety of servers and also packages gives you the chance to choose the best server that will best suit your needs and on top of that their 00 / 0 support makes it very easy for you to choose the best vpn server and the most suitable package for you .

2	however , on picking_up the car from hertz i was told i was not on the electoral role so could not take the car .

2	have just received ink albeit not in time for work i had to do but at_least it looks a decent product
0	gelukkig was het vlak bij mijn werk en was dit ook mogelijk .

2	the item i purchased was a ' startech 0 . 0mm 0 - pin to 0 x 0 - pin 0 . 0mm headset adaptor - m / f x 0 '.

0	a friend_recommended them but i sure will never ever recommend them based on the way they dealt_with this order .
0	it was supposed to arrive wednesday , absolutely nothing and when checking the tracking page i seen it was still in the sortation facility .
2	not impressed with the respect for their customers and given there are 00 , 000 reviews ( which will be only a percentage of customers ) on line they must be raking in cash .

0	placed the order over 0 hours before there deadline for next_day delivery as i now needed the part urgently and they still messed_up the order , gave some weak excuse that they didn ' t get payment until the next_day , funny that paypal says the funds cleared straight_away , so now if i want it i have to wait for 0 more days !
0	i was pleased with the delivery time , however when it arrived it was in a envelop which was not well bubble_wrapped to protect it , although it did not have any damage , it would have been easy for it to be caused .

0	another thing , i thought pixmania . ie was an irish company , when i got my product it was french . the box and product labels .

0	they explained that we have very quick broadband and it wasn ' t their problem .
0	sometimes a great site to purchase but refund procedure not good
2	soon , it became_apparent that there would be no bus .
2	they have changed their website and now it '_s so bad that everyone is up in arms about the way we can '_t research properly !
0	one was made incorrectly so it would fit someone with a 00 inch rib cage , and after a couple of wears , the crouched collar began to split off from the shirt .
0	other than this the return transfer was quick and on time .
0	my goods were dispatched promptly .
2	the only response i have had from the unlock company was to a mail i sent on the 00th_january saying that if they cannot sort it out then to refund my money . all they could say was to give it a bit more time i do not think it is a problem with them but it looks more like softbank dragging their feet . luckily i have another phone otherwise i would be giving up and putting the 0s on e_- bay
2	many_thanks for the speedy turn - around on my order .
2	they are very good at taking your money but useless at delivering flowers .
2	i said no refund me .
2	had a free brake / suspension check done when having 0 tyres_fitted due to a mysterious squeak from the front end - appeared to be quite thorough when check carried_out . unfortunately they couldn_'_t pin point problem .
0	they ' re that good .
2	with all the scam and fraud on the internet , i had my doubts .
0	hopefully me posting this will get me a response , as its a joke .
2	then checked their website which had previously said " out for delivery " to see it had been amended to delivery attempted .
2	need i say more
2	great prices , great delivery , great communication no more to say .
0	i am on my 0rd tescos delivery , 0st - perfect , 0nd - ok , 0rd - awful !
0	but thats just the beginning of the whole issue .
0	first they did not process the order , as we called they said the account is open now .
2	?
0	the court needed the letter to confirm that i did have this phone and who was provider and i was treated like dirt by orange .
2	cash0phones is a company that you shouldn_'_t really trust .
0	very undecided if home learning would be for me .
2	following non - delivery , it took three attempts to get to speak to the salesman and to understand that delivery would be another 0 - 0 weeks .
2	they send out the postage packets promptly and , better still , pay out the money just as fast .
0	trousers was mad out of strange marital . had to safety pin the to my knickers so that my bum wasn ' t showing !
2	on further discussion , he then offered to take a deposit of 00 %, it seems that this was the new policy that he had made up on the spot .
2	i had two ipod touches to sell for my sons .
2	would use again .
0	all of my items were under a ( ships in 00 hour ) status which they guarantee on the website but the processing time was actually 0 business days .
0	this is unusual but can happen if a competitor is unaware of a recent price increase .
2	left in no doubt about times of delivery and visits .
2	would you trust your £_000 - £_000 - £_000 tv to this set - up - no you wouldn_'_t .
2	however , i bought furniture from m & s ( spent a lot !)
0	unfortunately that graphics_card also artifacted not cyberpowers fault it was still in the box brand_new , again got a replacement within 0 or 0 days but then that card even artifacted but no where near as bad , i wanted perfection though so they suggested a nvidia card and now i ' m going for a gtx_000 for a bit more money .
2	i can '_t praise them enough . all this for 00 quid .
0	the good thing about the site is that all available options are shown , so . there will always be options of every kind for everybody ' s needs .
2	francesca single bed wonderful .
2	det hvad en rigtigt god samtale jeg havde med alka , og_fik nogen gode aftaler med dem , jeg_kan kun andbefale dem og jeg fik spare en masse penge ved at skifte til dem skam at jeg ikke fik det gjort noget før
2	so whilst only looking , bought pair straight_away .
2	item arrived next_day , delivery instructions followed to the letter .
2	they also only lasted 0 days , which was just over the christmas_period .
2	not keen on itunes , but the apple operating_system once you have sussed it is great .
0	however , the customer_service was quick , nice and helpful and solved all my trouble in but one e_- mail .
2	customer service is dire , emails aren_'_t answered , phone_calls are pretty pointless !
2	six days_later i finally received the item ( what happened to your two day promise ?).
2	seemed harsh in my book .
0	the online account for the currency card didn ' t work .
2	!
0	betting is easy on betfair .
2	the service was good & the tv was delivered the following_day by a quality courier who sent me a text the previous evening to confirm , which i find a superb feature .
2	even after using the blink eye_drops it did not improved so called the emergency contact number , an answer phone kicked in so left a brief message with 0 contact numbers .
0	about a month_ago i applied for an 0000 number , it took me nearly 0 weeks to get the ball rolling .
0	a month had past and still no refund !
0	i was installed the game with little trouble .
0	very quick delivery high_quality products for low_prices .
2	they gave me the opportunity to see someone i have wanted to see for years .
0	it means no one else has to pay for anyone_else , which is good .
2	the item ordered arrived on the date tredz stated , customer service was excellent and goods received where top_class and at a good price .
2	however he claimed that one was clearly of a superior quality , hence the difference in price .
2	this was not well - received but there was grudging agreement , provided it was as soon as possible after 00 .
2	ohhhh nooooo - not with these_guys .
0	the reviews , information and pictures of each location was very helpful .
2	regards ,
2	just signed_up to vodafone - new samsung g s0 , unlimited_texts , minutes and 0gb data through carphone_warehouse - all for £_00 per_month .
2	ruined my day juno .
0	quand je leur explique qu ' en raison de contraintes personnelles , je_ne pourrais pas récupérer le colis et qu ' il me faudrait une redirection , un autre gentil message me répond : " on ne fait plus ça m ' dame " !
2	even the third_party has refunded a portion that is permissible within the statutory limits .
0	the flowers were nice , but the vase of flowers was just that , with no protective , convenient carrier bag or box to carry them in .
0	the only_gripe i would seek to voice is that , out of maybe 00 orders in the past_year or so , on 0 of them i ' ve been sent the wrong_size or the wrong_colour , or else the item was never in stock in the first place and i ' ve ended_up having my order cancelled .
2	" t " mobile offered me a deal yesterday when i asked for my pat code and told them i had enough and was leaving , 000 minutes 000 texts and a freephone upgrade . ok i said . today the phone arrived with a bill of £_00 . 00 receipted " paid " they have taken £_00 . 00 form my credit_card without authorisation enough !
0	i only tried them on properly after 0 weeks and phoned them to complain , they gave me a free post address to return them to and they didn ' t even need the original box which had been recycled .
2	we ordered a £_00 . 00 bq to be delivered to where we work in halifax .
0	after going through the posted experiences , i got to believe it .
2	original , contemporary and cutting_edge .
0	great photo opportunity , bet some londoners havent seen all the sights we saw in a matter of 0hours !
0	my main issues were with email not being received , but this didn ' t worry them .
2	i expect a large bill and little help from mb insurance services .
2	found george mann to be helpful and knowledgeable with his advice , open approach and trustworthy even_though i couldn_'_t proceed with him due to my circumstances
0	they always blamed my computer and my router , so always prepare 0 computers and connect them directly .
0	but , like i said , product ' s that are hard to manufacture cheap i ' d stay far away if you are serious about your health and well - being .
2	but try contacting these_guys !
0	you are able to see where the hostel / hotel is located and the facilities that are included , and best of all there is no booking_fee !
2	if you have any further enquiries please raise an_email support ticket and our customer service team will swiftly assist you .
2	this trip was mercifully short and was made bearable .
0	didn ' t arrive in the 0 hours as stated .
2	merci à l ' inconnu qui ne nous a pas abandonnés à 0h00 du matin dans un aéroport sur_le point de fermer ( aéroport de funchal à madère le 00 mars )
2	the whole_experience was great .
2	warning to people who are visiting the greek side of cyprus , this company is bringing the cars over from the turkish side , when i spoke to the police i was told this was illegal .
2	i was then told i would be called before 00 . 00 next_day by both the call_centre and email .
0	if you are not in a rush and not bothered about communication between customer and company .
0	finally , their only form of contact is via_email or on - line chat .
0	i ' d love to have a ( fee - free !)
2	i shall be wary of using this company again .
2	very helpful when calling for advice and excellent delivery .
0	overall , even_though my friend dealt_with funktion_events , i must_admit that they did everything we asked for at a great price .
0	oh , and i ' m still_waiting on that final_bill .
0	after a few attempts they said they would redeliver at a time of my choice obviously i said asap .
2	the mac edition backup software does not work with the mac lion x operating software as it turns_out , with no solution according to iomega .
0	i called up the depot , after 0 attempts i got an answer that it will be delivered tomorrow around the same time .
0	thank_you .
0	meanwhile , our competior , in the same industry as us , has a perfect score .
2	i cannot speak highly_enough of viovet .
2	how can the truth be a violation !!!
2	animed_direct is a really good for any pet / animal owners / lovers to use .
0	update your points shop , stop fobbing people off with daft stories about doing this and that , and delivering nothing .
2	too much broadband break down specially on rainy day
2	the check - in at both_ends was painless .
0	upon delivery though i was rather dissapointed when i examined the watch .
0	this was not so .
0	thanks very much
0	customer_service is obviously low on their company values .
2	it more easily .
0	they refused to refund me the money .
0	i ' m seriously dissappointed with the service here - i understand that hitches happen , but the lack of contact and resolution has left me never wanting to use this website again
2	item very good , but took along time for it to be dispatched .
0	this was the 0 star_review , which is now downgraded to 0 star , see far below .
2	if i use this service again i will not be adding any extras such as balloons and vases
2	regards
0	the other is a set of bunk_beds for her two children , who have to remain sleeping on the floor until argos decide that they can finally fulfil their end of the deal .
0	thanks guys !

0	booked a long_haul holiday a year in_advance online no_problems .
0	after so many nightmares and disasters with other online_retailers this was such a relief , i would happily use studentcomputers again and have already_recommended them to others .
2	from the moment of purchase i was kept_fully up to date at all times with my order process .
2	in stock and hassle_free checkout .
2	i purchased a coffee and side table which took almost 0 weeks to be delivered although they took payment the minute the order was placed .
2	fast and accurate completion of order .
0	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
0	but yet they tried .
0	i tend to find homebase slightly on the expensive side .
2	not available at time of purchase .
0	i a rude tone .
0	and another thing to consider is sending emails at 0am in the morning , i reckon 0 % of britain are awake at that time !!
0	i also find there customer support fairly useless , once you have a paypal case closed and your problem is still not solved , they are unwilling to help and simply ignore you .
2	couldn_'_t fault this service .
0	have recently_purchased 0 plastic shoe racks which are rubbish .
0	the item wasn ' t delivered till after 0pm & there was water inside the packaging which_resulted_in the card becoming wet .
0	just hearing her again gives me a headache !
2	material was a but thin , but for the price , it was value for money .
2	i know for sure that is lies because it has_been in a leather case since the day i bought it .
0	hi i recently had my seat alhambra serviced from national in derby they were fast efficient and very friendly all in all a very cheap option from the dealers
2	the other thing i liked was when learning to fly my helicopter ant and steve were always helpful on giving tips .
0	superb
0	in the process i could see that the mover was only getting what he said he had changed the quote to and shiply was taking the rest as a " deposit " - this is despite the fact that it says " no_hidden_fees or charges " on their website .
0	anyway , i was looking_forward to receiving my items .
0	the bits they forgot to send were the actual camera and bag !
2	i have introduced my daughter and i also buy for friends and family .
2	the order failed - not surprisingly - but there was no option to use another card .
0	wanneer komt er eens een tweede supermarkt met bezorgdienst ?
0	thank_you sean -- you make us feel at homa :)
2	i wanted a 00 " toshiba smart hd tv for my sons 00th_birthday .
2	apparently in - stock and " posted " at a cost of £ 0 : 00 the following_day .
0	over all well worth using to purchase your games .
2	i am disgusted with xdp and their service and not impressed with bedroom world either .
0	i also bought the blusher palette which was a lot bigger than i was expecting it to be which was a bonus .
0	my recommendation : stay_away from talk_talk , you will regret signing_up !
2	one toilet was not suitable , vp wanted £_00 for return cost ,( wasnt told at time of order , just told i could return ) i got my own courier in the end , cost me £ 0 !!
0	i have also been left with eye floaters which are a daily frustration given that my work is 000_% computer screen based , and that is when they are visible constantly .
0	update_: i ended_up having to send the raid enclosure back again because it was faulty and again they sent the item out simply wrapped in a thin bag even_though i asked the customer_service on the phone to please package it in a box as it kept getting damaged .
2	simple to use .
0	so thanks to all the staff for making the process thoroughly enjoyable .
0	hostelbookers is a great website for travelling .

0	exactly as_described !
0	i paid a different service $_00 to unlock my phone , they told me it was unlocked but it wasn ' t .
0	i found it doesn ' t match the size of my laptop .
2	the battery was received but was found to be a 000 katana brand ?
0	its good to for video chat but seem to be finding problem these days quite_often . would be great if we could do group video chat . but extra_cost just turns off .
2	i was informed that i had been given a handbook into the store which told me that they would repair goods and not replace them , now call me naive but i have purchased items before in fact many_times and if they have been damaged they have been replaced with new goods .
2	i have used herbies for my seeds for some time now , i order say on the monday and the seeds are in my poccession by the tuesday lunch_time in a plain , discrete envelope , so a very fast services all_round .
2	i knew what i wanted and pixmania was the cheapest price , including delivery for the product .
0	the whole order was delivered in one package on 00th_december but when i opened it up , the nike class wov suit in navy / blue size medium tracksuit was missing the trousers .
2	they ' re obviously hoping you '_ll forget and won_'_t qualify for the discount .
2	over 0000 transactions is not bad for eight years .
2	so do not take carhire cdw insurance when you book , it is absolutely_useless !!
2	absolutely fuming . needless to say i am now going through all the paperwork and will be making a complaint to trading_standards or the motor ombudsman ( if there is one !!)
0	i would say i was forced to terminate the contract with xln purely_because of their awful customer_service .
0	then i found a small company called wired0fire .
0	nightmare setting_up wifi .
0	my follow_up email to their head_office was totally ignored too .
2	when they made the refund it was for the actual cost of the items minus the return postage .
0	i placed one order with them .
2	it did the job so i went back the next_day and bought another , taken from the same pile of stock in the same location in the same store .

2	me - ' hello , am inquiring about an internet order '
2	t stewart
2	we have always found them to be both welcoming and efficient , and consider them to be far more customer friendly than rivals such as ryanair .
0	hassle_free , great customer_service , excellent !
2	my friend was really pleased with her gift .
0	very frustrating !
2	i love them !
0	thankfully , not so bad as to be unforgettable , but enough to make me frown when i have to use them again .
2	i ordered my shoes from shoetique late on in the day , i fully expected to have to wait a few_days for my purchase to arrive , especially as the postage was free .
2	it would not take much at this point to make me give them an opportunity to take my money on a weekly_basis .
0	they tested and retested the unit and eventually contacted me to let me know they would return the handset to me as they could not get it to work and therefore could not offer the original_quote .
2	i just wanted to end the mess and although i could have gone to the small claim court i really couldn_'_t be bothered .
0	opinion of company not so strong after they decided to use my friend lauren o ' farrell ' s copyrighted images without permission .

2	after phoning tesco they initially told me it was my fault for not being at home , but they discovered that although my address was right in the system the print for the driver somehow cut_off the last digit in my flat no so they delivered to the wrong flat .
2	compare this to jet0 who are always welcoming and polite and make the experience easier .
2	can rely_on .
0	after waiting years for an iphone ( only because i could not justify the high price that o0 had forced upon the british public for so long ) along comes three with an incredible deal .
2	the secret to releasing it properly turns_out to be gently putting your foot on the brake while switching the electric brake off .

2	i have just sold my rolex milgaus and got the best price on the market as i shoped around through the well_known names on the high_street . after selling my watch without_any_problems i would deal with watchfinder when buying a watch . as the service was great .
2	i did not receive any acknowledgement of receipt , i had to email several_times to find out if they had been received .
0	i have recently used wowcher to purchase some cufflinks from a company called illuminata jewels .

0	wwwooowww
2	the goods are great

0	the phone is great , and even better doesnt seem to have any of the problems that some other people seem to talk about .
2	never bought from these before but can highly_recommend . very quick free delivery no_problems at all thank_you .

0	but they assume that you want to share .
2	< name_removed >
2	what do there loyal_customers get nothing .
2	anyone into photgraphy , this is defneatley worth the money !
0	with having lot of customers our selves there are one or two parcels over the years that might get damaged or lost but as soon as i give the relevant info i have always had a good offer on return .
0	digitalrev provides something unique , in that they not only provide fantastic prices for their equipment , they have video tutorials which are informative but also fun ( think top gear meets cameras instead of cars ) and a lot of articles on the site itself .
0	overall , i am totally appalled .
2	however , we did not like not being allocated to a seat and having to stand in the queu prior to boarding to enable getting a seat together and not too far towards the back where it can be cold .
0	i recently_moved and forgot to change the billing_address on my credit_card .
0	no phone is available to call only a mobile that is on constant answerphone .
0	thankgod .
2	i speculatively requested a quotation to deliver a bathroom sink i was interested in on ebay to find out whether it would be worth bidding .
2	then i decided to go all out three years_ago and buy one that cost £ 0 , 000 or thereabouts , all the best components i could_afford .
2	so i rang to ask what had happened and was told for the first time about the internet limits .
0	i highly_recommend this company !
2	otherwise the sofabed is lovely and elegant .
0	demanded refund , but clearly not expecting that to come anytime_soon , nor do i expect to receive any communication about it .

2	this company have got it spot on .
2	sent the phone off , and when we called them to find out what was going on , we were told it can to up to 00 days before the get a chance to looke at the phone , a few_days_later my son called again and was told the phone is know worth £_000 not the £_000 stated due to water_damage , which i find hard to beleive as the phone is only 0 months old .
2	we arrived at the hotel to find that it was , in fact , a flat with two rooms that were let out to paying guests ( and all this through expedia !).
0	" you get 000 points for every £ 0 you spend "

0	will be sending my mum to site to buy more for collection to ship overseas .
2	thanks emma and due to her help i shall be using parcel0go and not another company .
2	they do charge your for ups / fedex - which " leads you to believe " that you will get your product " soon "- not !
2	very good service and i would recommend them to others .
2	the next excuse was a massive snowfall on the east_coast of usa , then his supplier was in hospital , followed_by the only watch available had a diamond missing .
0	!
2	it was hard to keep_up with him at times .
2	only later in the evening did i see all the other reviews commenting on the poor service and liability for import_duty and vat etc .
2	i would urge people not to use this company .
0	at this point i decided to check reviews , and when i saw all the negative_experiences of people losing tons of money and being without flights my blood ran cold , . i then spent almost 0 months in constant state of fear that this would happen to me , a few schedule changes happened and again , took travelup a few_days to sort it out , then came the day to check in online , i couldnt . i was convinced my flight had been cancelled , they day before i was due to fly out , so i emailed them . nothing , i took the chance and travelled down to heathrow ( im in birmingham ) for my flight to west virginia , and thank the lord all was fine , turns_out united airlines have a new policy of checking international passports , so you cant check in online . ha !
0	the service netflix provide is great - the site is easy to navigate , the movies stream really fast and the price is great .
0	it ' s more_expensive but at_least i wont encounter the problems mentioned and will actually recieve what i have paid for .
2	in the end i contacted amazon , explained the problem and with the help of amazon '_s customer support staff have arranged for another carrier to pick it up in a few_days time hopefully with more luck this time .
2	prices very competitive , and 000_% satisfied with my order - worming_tablets and flea_treatment for my dog .

0	no mention of long wait for refund on website .
0	even when i expressed my interest to cancel my first order , i received an e_- mail 0 minutes later apoligising for the situation , and saying that it has been cancelled .
2	this is the third time i '_ve used this company and i will_continue to do so any time i want to send flowers .
2	we have been with virgin for years because we just cannot get the same broadband service elsewhere but if i am being honest i find their tele vision packages really expensive when you compare their charges to everyone elses even after taking into account loyalty discounts .
0	fantastic service , saved us a lot of money on the sale of our property .
2	a big pat on the back for speed and excellent customer_care .

0	very quick delivery service had slight problem with order but very impressed with the level of service received product was excellent quality and very affordable prices .
0	i florist have sent flowers here many_times so i assumed they used a local_florist .
0	i was excited to find a smart socket which an api i could build upon , but unfortunately there is close to zero documentation .
2	also deserving praise was the courier service dpd , the parcel arrived in the 0 hour time_span given on the tracking notice .
0	dr shine
0	oh and best of all , when you go to the bit in their site which says ' refunds ', you won ' t find it .
0	of course the problems were never resolved , the indian based staff are clearly dragged off the street , given no training and are just plonked infront of a 00 ' s era pc with a script to read from .
2	i had to phone umpteen times only to be promised they would be sent out first_class post the following_day but to no_avail .
0	but the prices were lower_than the online shop i normally buy from so i thought i ' d give it a go .
0	i can not praise the o0 staff enough as they were extremely polite and professional and did there best to calm down a very upset customer .
0	i am totally confused as to why i have actually been declined by cpw / o0 and quite_frankly am discusted with the service i have received from them .
0	thanks so much incrystals and deefinitely will be purchasing from you again !
0	not a big deal , really except that i was going away , and wanted the cover to kick - in immediately .
2	as the in store prices are higher . robert .
2	ttfn
2	so far so good .
2	will i never learn . that '_s the power of pricing . get em ' in on the initial number £ 0 . 00 then cross sell / upsell / power sell / tea sell / everything costs sell !
0	love that questions are answered_quickly whether you call or email .
0	" trust " pilot had requested at_least three more people for documentation containing information about their purchases and their addresses and phone numbers !
0	i did try to ask via your website but have been forced to ask on a public forum as this seems the only way that encourages you to respond .
2	infuriating constant announcements in - flight ensure that you don_'_t get much peace and the dreaded fanfare at the end of each flight announcing that you have arrived early .
0	- track your ip_address , you bet .
0	hostelbookers is so much cheaper and didn ' t charge any booking_fee .
0	i was happy to accept the £ 0 downgrade to network being locked but theyve now automatically downgraded it again to by a further £ 0 without any warning , email or advising why .
0	i understand that you have got to pay if you get sky cut_off before your contract but i didnt cut of sky . sky cut_off sky .
2	!
0	i was able to unlock the iphone_0s with r sim 0 but with iphone 0 i tried everything .
0	yeah the free_samples are ok but really i am not sure i get enough free_stuff to amount to what shipping_costs .
0	i ' m a 00 - 00 so was hardly going to order a size advertised as 00 - 00 which would have just about fit !
2	now i am feeling let_down and should have bought elsewhere .
0	so i went on to buy the game and thought i would not have any_problems as i was informed that the stock order was to come in to cjs ' s possession on monday_morning .
2	i bought a beko_dishwasher through appliances on line just before_christmas .
0	i sticked with airvpn because their support was really great , they went out of their way to help me when i had a problem .
2	eventually it arrived , nothing to do with either of us chasing , hermes just delivered when they felt like it .
2	on many occasions we had tried to speak to someone
2	so , it works but it can be nerve wracking going to a venue without tickets and picking them up from a rep in a normally very crowed area - cell phones are very difficult to both use and hear in such conditions as is finding the rep - i have done the box office bit and the meeting a rep bit all too often - but as said , have always got there in the end .
2	with alarm_bells ringing i contacted wowcher for assistance and they too contacted miss amazing on my behalf to request they contact me asap .
0	would have had an extra £_00 on top of this if i hadn ' t gone with this company .
2	!
0	i have never had a problem with the website or the supplements i received .
0	i did ask to speak to his manager and make an official compliant , but he refused to transfer me .
2	my 000_euros were refunded smoothly a week_later .
2	i purchased a ticket for the cardiff v chelsea match on tuesday_afternoon .
0	over 00 months the tv didn ' t work , the internet was on and off and they charged to fix it and then it still didn ' t work > cost me 000 to reconnect my phone line after they put it on their own line > a really bad_experience >
2	the car and staff were fine .
0	i was / am a business customer with talk_talk .
0	some bad products but overall a good service on returns .
0	monday , i received the handset with a foreign sim and keyboard .
2	when booking with flybe you start at a really low figure and are taken down a very long path , charging you for everything that should realistically have been taken into allowance before they started wasting your time .
0	i have used wowcher in the past and had no issues , however it seems when there is a hitch that they just don ' t get back to you .
2	there is no way to cancel an order online so phone is the only way .
0	the variety of different supplements and especially the prices have me keep_coming_back for more
0	overall a lovely product , but for an £_00 photo_book i expected it to be flawless .
2	trolling other health & fitness product sites is no_longer necessary .
2	i explained this to customer_services and they immediately said they would resend the items again .
2	i will_definitely_use watchfinder again and tell all my friends about it .
0	our money was transferred within two days .
0	this means you have to do a fidily manual install which is not ideal .
2	very fast delivery very pleased better_than i anticipated , the rainbow 00 '_s shirt is ideal and fits perfect .
2	the customer_services rep was understanding and has arranged to resolve the problem but the company will still not let it be delivered to my workplace which means i have to take days off for both collection and delivery for my replacement .
2	to fit it to the walls which is necessary as it does not balance by itself in the corner of the bath as cheaper flimsier ones do .
0	when checking my tickets after i had paid for them , the booking summary stated it was same day return .
0	i used to have virgin and they were much_better .
2	the booking was followed up with a dispatch confirmation stating that the item has_been dispatched from the distribution_centre at 0000hrs on friday_morning .
0	but their rates are cheap , and the service is fairly fast sometimes , so i guess you get what you pay for .
0	as the title_says
2	be very carefull when buying from this company .
2	would definitely_use this company again .
2	i have had 0 items from hifi_tower and they have all been great price and when any thing goes_wrong they are there to help you they dont treat you like a customer it is as you are part of there company i would like to highly_recommend the to anyone i will be buying from them again so the rest of you out the start buying from them and find there service better_than currys , comet .
0	the woman then persisted to tell me that they are nto allowed to give me free instilation and that they cannot do em a deal as good as them because ' they are teh cheepest in britain '.
0	city_link may aswel call them shitty link excuse my french but once they left a parcel in a bush in my garden that was of value of over £_000 and did not have no card through door to say it was there and stayed out for few_days .
0	despite my first delivery from asda being absolutely disastrous as the driver forgot to unload all the fresh good , the situation was eventually resolved through a refund and £ 0 evoucher for the inconvenience , i decided to give them another change .
0	the single worst online shopping_experience ever .
2	i was after an oase aquamax pump , they sold me exactly_what i wanted at the right price !
0	a full 0 hours after they said they ' d first turn_up , they did .
2	i had an iphone_0s that i wanted to give to a friend , after a lot of internet searching i came_across officialiphoneunlock , they seemed genuine but i used a credit_card to be safe .
2	i suggest you think very carefully before parting with any money to this company .
2	would recommend as a first_port of call for eyewear - deal with confidence .
0	diverse bestellingen gedaan en altijd prima geleverd .
2	conclusion : arnaque assurée ; a eviter si on veut des vacances sans soucis

0	after a battle with an mp0 player which was faulty they decided to do nothing as it was discontinued , not impressed this time .
0	i am very impressed with the product - good quality and comes gift boxed ( i ordered a keyring ).
0	don ' t you never ever trust their stock numbers , they are all wrong and they want it that way so that you can prepay confidently .
0	they occasionally mess things up but the call_centre guys always sort it out .
2	but as lil man is quite tall , the ones i got him are brilliant .
0	he gave me a rm tracking_number and for some reason it got returned to sender .
0	at a tenner with free delivery i wasn ' t going to complain - you can ' t even buy them that cheap at local_stores anymore !

0	ace !
0	her debit_card was rejected because it was maestro .
2	i ordered my products easily and without_any trouble but when it came to delivery , i received numerous texts informing_me of who was delivering the parcel and what time , i tried to book my delivery for a tuesday , when somebody would be in but it wouldnt let me , so the parcel arrived on the wed when no one was in , i dont know if they posted it through the postbox or left it in the garage , but for a week after , i still had text sent to say my parcel would arrive on specific dates , i emailed pet_supermarket to let them know i had received the parcel , but the texts kept coming and eventually after a week they stopped
2	lots of nice little sample foods to taste and enough staff working that it did not look as if all their staff are stressed out with too much work .
0	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	i can repeat all the other_users says .

0	at 0pm i was absolutletlty furious !
2	det kom hurtigt ud til mig kan kun være tilfreds med det
0	and this is that you can ' t put your own number or email address on the advert , openrent puts theirs on and all interest in the property must got through them , prospective tenants must leave a voice_mail with openrent then openrent send you a message with a link to listen to the voice_mail then you can listen to the message and get back to the inquirer , what is the point of this , i don ' t know ?
0	they are very comfortable and the lever action to raise and lower stool is very smooth and easy .
2	i ordered an expensive printer from their website .
0	wowcher --> i wonder_how you are able to run your business with this sort of service .

0	i tweeted their " customer_services " team who asked for a postcode .

0	pc_specialist would contact me an_email at each_stage of the order , whether for it having been built , in its testing phase and when it was ready to dispatch , which was also a lot quicker then i thought it would be , meaning i could get back to gaming faster the i thought !
2	they try their best but they presume they everyone who turns up does so by car - which means that meeting them across one side of the resort to where we had prior arranged ( because they were drinking in a bar ) makes lugging our_luggage inconvenient .
2	do not get involved with company - they are thieves and should not be allowed to remain in business .
2	yodel has a bad_reputation and they lived_up to it .

2	i ended_up having to pay another firm to get a car and when i requested a full_refund from this company due to their efficiencies they said no .
0	if only they sold vegetables ??
0	it ' s not just low_cost items either , i ' ve bought very expensive pc hardware and electronic_goods that have been wrapped inadequately and arrived completely crushed and damaged .

0	i emailed the company twice asking a question in regards to a voucher i had purchased and had no reply .
2	certainly not worth the long wait - which totally spoiled the overall good impression of the jet0 experience !
2	their customer service as in lucky wasn_'_t respectful or nice and didn_'_t even try to ask a manager if he could add the ten_pounds .
2	my wife & i are profoundly deaf and tried to insert our mobile numbers and inform that any contact by mobile will have to be by text only as we cannot hear or use a voice / " normal " phone . nae such luck !!

0	jeg_har handlet på asos utallige gange og_jeg_har altid været yderst tilfreds .

0	i don ' t understand_why you can ' t use a courier like most company ' s do , royal_mail just charge through the roof .
2	the driver got off the bus and refused to get back on !
2	basically the driver didn_'_t read the address correctly , thought he knew better_than the post_code and tried to deliver my parcel to the wrong_address .
0	i was lucky none of the smashed .
2	premises and customer facilities comfortable , clean and smart .
2	when i called them they said they would need to check the recording of the call , which they would do very carefully .

0	suddenly got this reply " if you could call tom and speak to chris he will get another pair sent out to you and claim for the goods lost , he is the returns manager and can deal with this for you !!!"

0	i ordered from bedzrus . co . uk as their price was significantly_lower_than anywhere_else online .

0	i was happy with the ease of the website , it was very easy to use , to find glasses i liked , and was happy could choose way of paying , and got a 0 %_discount for paying by cheque :)
0	although i have to say asda do get the prize for the most weird substitution , ordered - a packet of cigarettes , delivered - a plastic picnic set for one .
2	he then asked that i delete the review first - this was the final_straw and did me a favour by jolting me back to reality !
2	i drove to the shop with the bq to find it dident exsist only to be told by the hairdressers where it used to be " she went last_year and works mobile from her van " !!
2	best price and prompt delivery from hifix .

0	they are always on time and get me to my destination in a prompt manner .
0	when she finally went to use it the screen was faulty .
0	their turnaround time is slower_than me walking the uk coastline and they look after the parcels as well as banger racers look after their cars .
0	good site with loads of info .
0	i was understandably not happy with this as driving with a destroyed windscreen and a 0yr old for a week is not the best of conditions .
2	these things happen so i first tried getting in touch with reebok to resolve the issue .
2	we '_ll need to see the damage before we make a decision ".
0	i ' m not sure they ever did refund me though .
0	!
0	i phoned orange the day i got back and they point_blank told me i was not a customer of orange .

0	and told me the driver had been to my village implying i ' m the one who is lying .
0	from ringing up to enquire to the people who came to fit it i had excellent service .
0	but to make it worse , this isnt the first time things like this have happened .
0	they also hand pick the reviews that appear on their product pages !
0	( something i could have done myself but funnily_enough , it also invalidates my warranty ).
0	making free calls from mobiles is amazing when it is truly free .
2	i get people to pay through online_banking as much as possible to avoid the high charges .
0	they don ' t charge any commision ( not sure how they make their money ) but its truly simple to do , and i think it ' s only 00_% u have to pay and then u can cancel within 00_hours or something like that .
2	many many_thanks .
0	i went via topcashback and as a first timer for using a courier it was really straight_forward and i liked all the options available .
2	maybe next step will be trading_standards ?
2	and .
0	first time i have used the ebuyer website .
0	got the key the next_day as soon as they were available .
2	the online my dashboard status showed my order as ' processing ' which continued till after the battery had been delivered next_day , no email was sent confirming delivery or tracking available as mentioned in the delivery information of the web_page , although i received a mobile text stating a delivery eta while the battery was actually being delivered .
0	sw is top of the line in customer_service , product selection , and discounts .
2	new to the site and it '_s good to air my views .
2	unfortunately , on both flights the rear cabin was extremely hot ( it reached 00c on the back row ), whilst the front of the plane was cold ( 00c , with people using blankets ).
2	these came on the expected date , excellently packed and chilled - and they are great !
2	this was in the evening so i called into the branch the next_day only to be told they had none in stock .

0	but still at_least taxi from bars to clubs was paid for .
0	i ordered from asos many_times back in asia , and delivery often reaches me within its time - frame .
2	why would they have that paragraph about a 000_% cancellation_fee in there terms of agreement ?
0	rimless - didn ' t fit well , was told it was only a ' little short ' which is wasn ' t -- exchanged for a second pair
2	they could sell me one but not at the internet price , i cancelled my order that same day but not until 00 september was a refund confirmed .
2	had a parcel returned due to incorrect paperwork .
2	not at all happy and not the way to treat_customers !
2	but it gets better !
0	i felt really weird as it never happened before .
2	there i - and many other people - had the usual haggle over paying ' wheel damage waiver ' fees . or face the alternative of leaving a huge deposit on your credit_card - despite the so - called fully comprehensive detail on the booking reservation form . that in itself delayed the queue even longer_than necessary .

0	so as an update , the packages turned_up at the time that was quoted .
2	parcels are bubble_wrapped , air pockets and boxed and it doesn_'_t seem to matter , they are intact but the contents in bits .

2	i have never had an unboxed item that should have had a box .
0	the bracelets are cheap rubbish .
2	.

2	a small thing that should have been picked_up on the pre_- delivery inspection .
2	laura was superb and the parcel was delivered today .
2	the service was excellent but i was disappointed in the car .
2	this was not clearly_stated before the transaction .
2	call back i received c - s hanged the phone leaving me on line like an_idiot .
0	i found supplement_warehouse to be the place to go to find the best deals .
0	i checked a few_times through out yesterday and no up date .
2	i contacted rocket about this but they do not seem interested in correcting the mistake . with a bit more customer after care they could have got full_marks .
0	this is the worst customer_service i had to deal with !
2	their quality is unquestionable .
2	they had the lowest_price for the machine i was after and best all_round service .
0	unlike the earlier order these most of these products looked decidedly amateurish and poor quality .
0	!
2	so i emailed customer_services specifically to ask for a response from a senior person in uk and all i got was a refund on a pound of apples .
0	at the time of writing ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i still have not received the gift_card .
0	i order a single baseball cap with a home made logo on it as a test of the quality of the products made by this company .

2	i completed the return procedure but was unable to print the voucher .
0	i ordered on thursday_night , but it wasn ' t sent until the next week .

0	i contacted late evening to ask what was happening - told that the courier could not be contacted , my separated parcel was probably on the way .
2	hiding like a frightened mouse with no hole to go down and the breath of a hungry cat warming its face ?
0	we bought lots of stuff this year .
2	my reason for a memory_foam mattress was it was a little cheaper for rental than the origins pocket and because it has a removable and replaceable topper .
2	my first purchase from this company floundered because i did not complete the ' payment ' form correctly ( fat fingers !)
0	a week_later , no communications from iflorist and the flowers are left on the doorstep in the new_zealand sun .
2	to my shame , i accepted his offer , giving him my word that i would delete the review upon_receipt of the goods .
2	anyone can give less for less money .
0	i ended_up paying for money that i didn ' t owe .
2	i cannot recommend this company too highly
0	best price i could find as well for what i was looking for so overall an excellent service .
2	what level of customer service could this be possibly described as ?

2	!
2	i duly phoned to confirm and placed the order over the phone then .
0	thank_you so , so much
0	you were most helpful and patient in helping me out again .
2	great price , i thought i would have to wait awhile as i ordered between xmas & new year , but it came really quickly .
2	as always , the watch arrived swiftly , in perfect_condition and at a great price !
0	however , i do not think there service is so good .
0	this company will go places
0	thanks again parcel0go !
0	i needed this parcel as i ' m going on holiday tomorrow morning .
0	i have used theprintspace 0 times .

0	they saved me £ 0 per_month and double the mins and text allowwanc per mth . all that and it only took 0mins to do .
2	the partner used in my area were excellent tyre_fitters .
0	great selection and pricing .
0	and this is how they treat you .
0	i was expecting a parcel delivery from yodel from goods which i had ordered from a website which i use on a regular_basis .
2	twice in two months tens , if not hundreds , of queued emails are arbitrarily cancelled .
0	following this i should have only given you 0 star , but to be fair i have to give higher_than that only because of my lack of complaints in previous years .
2	the usual loads of options followed_by endless minutes of waiting .
0	i eventually called the company up and on the last tone of the second attempt i got through to someone .
2	perfect .
2	it would appear that a refund is in process ( awaiting confirmation ) .
2	just what i needed .
2	its a good job i did cause i just got to gate in time .
2	by that time you want to jump up and down on the gaffgaff sim_card until it is carpet dust .
2	first they fail to deliver , but pretend they did .
2	i ordered a game and paid for it only to find out it was no_longer available .
0	eventually they gave me a £_00 voucher and refunded my delivery .
0	she quoted me a 0 - 0 week delivery time , despite their website stating within 0 weeks , but i agreed as i explained i had the 0th week off work already so that would be ideal .
0	!
2	i have emailed their help_desk numerous_times without_any reply .
2	ao is a good place to shop for white goods ; i have spend over £ 0000 on white good in the last_year .
0	the dodgy website should have been enough to scare me away , no parcel collection , no response to my emails , no telephone support , no support at all .
0	instead , i received an insulting text_message hours_later informing_me that the delivery had been rejected by the recipient .
2	it cost rentalcars . com nothing except the processing of our payment and yet they still keep our money .
2	if you don_'_t mind your kitchen being unusable for three_months , by all means buy from wren .
0	however , the ability to purchase 0 or more per 00_hours would have been ideal .
2	do not become involved with this outfit - they are refusing to accept written instructions to cancel my so - called subscription with them .
2	i called jaques to get a new cover for my foldaroll tt and mentioned that it was stored outside but under cover .
0	transaction_id_0000000
0	for the last 0 saturdays i have patiently_waited for the delivery and nothing has arrived .
0	i sent her all the items i wanted plus messages and plus the free_stuff i was going to recieve .
0	i just rang to complain , chose the option to speak to a real_person and was immediately disconnected !
0	and to go out of my way to send them back the wrong item by next_day delivery ( otherwise no refund !)
0	the reason i chose double 0 tickets is because you can pick the seats and you know where about you will be sitting in the arena .
0	thank_you very much for the rapid_response .
0	it ' s disappointing when custom support is so scarce when there are many other alternatives around .
0	i have had to result in writing a letter to them threatening legal_action !
0	initially , with my first purchase , my item took 0 week for their customer_service to inform me of no stock , which had been planned to coincide with a trip , and their compensation proposal was insulting opposed to apologetic .
2	order delivered promptly by yodel and now all i have to do is make the curtains this week before_christmas .
0	paid £_00 for a bouquet to be delivered to my mum for her_birthday and not worth the money at all .
2	a few_minutes later he updated the tracking to say " recipient refused delivery as does not want the goods !"
0	also there was no receipt or paperwork enclosed with it .
0	great service
0	but here is my story .
0	now they ' re telling_me there ' s no address on my parcel , only the town .
0	super easy :) i ' ve used them a few_times now and will always come straight back and hopefully my run of successful bookings will_continue .
0	search_engine results show up pretty slow in comparison to google and it looks a bit cheap and spammy imho . they ' re making an effort to change their interface but still will never compare to the market_leader :)
2	i change my rating as i have been refunded , some misunderstanding .
2	thanks a bunch .
0	after a few hitches with proving my identity ?
0	i neither work for or know the people who own mfc .
2	when my contract completed i emailed stating my intention was to finish the service .
0	would also like to add that i found out from my visa that you cancelled the transaction . the same day i made the purchase . thanks for the notice you guys are completely_useless
2	the box base was soggy due to it raining .
0	if you go on [_external reference_] com you are given genuine mobile numbers so its easy to think this is the same .
0	thank_you !
2	warranty whereas my local company was a measly 0 yrs .
0	i have purchased from here before normally o . k , but the last pair were so shoddy it was like they were made by a child in primary school , they did not fit as the arms were at different angles and the actual frame work around the lens was twisted .
2	i '_ve emailed twice and had no reply .
2	this was never mentioned on the order summary and is not mentioned anywhere on the shipping and delivery section of the website .
2	unless you pay for priority boarding ( extra on top of your flight ) you have top stand in the queu for ages and as i am a pensioner can not stand for long_periods of time due to an ailment .
0	until now , i haven " t heard back from budgetair !
0	never once had an issue .
0	the price was very good , and the delivery time not too bad ( ordered on the monday_morning , arrived on the thursday ) they could do with keeping you informed a little better .
2	my advice - go_elsewhere and don_'_t touch hammonds with a barge_pole !!
0	had no issues with them .
2	if they respond now to this review with some sob - story or ' excuse ', they need to ask themselves why didn_'_t they contact me to give me a reasonable explanation or , more_importantly , get on and deal with the issue .
0	i bought a mattress called " relyon firm support mattress " which from the online description i believed to be a normal sized mattress which was firm and had excellent orthopedic support .
2	do yourself a favour - dont use - suggest we start compensation campaign < sensitive data_removed >
2	the item didnt arrive until the following_monday at 0000hrs a full 0 days after ordering - hardly next_day is it partmaster ?
2	the item is faulty ?
0	could only do it by tearing / cutting into it .
2	!
0	tried lots of different mens skin care products but dryhide moisturiser is by_far the best i have ever tried .
0	i ' m not sure if this is right but i will not be shopping at asda again , i don ' t even know why i tried and what did i expect .
2	always had superb dealings with amazon . usually find super value . always very professional
0	at no point in all this was i informed that the item i ordered in was not in stock and would take longer to get here .
2	ive been a customer of cpc for over00 years and in all that time ive had nothing but a very professional service and very polite customer_care from the whole company and i am giving cpc top_marks for all their help and professionalism . well_done to the whole team at cpc and a very big thankyou for the very best of services
0	the driver proclaimed he is ' self - employed and has no obligation to bring the items inside for me '.
0	they should definitely implement a system where notes are made about previous cars they have fitted such as a wheel_nut cap or access restrictions .
0	!
2	why not improve the online system so that , if needed , a time can be booked , beyond the current am / pm choice which is evidently inadequate ?
2	i booked my christmas flight at the end of may .
0	in short , these_guys are a complete_waste of space and time .
2	one part of my order was met but the other was not .
2	we were delighted and would definitely recommend .
0	love paypol what more can i say
0	there was no mention in the quote initially received about deducting money for the phone being locked , there is even the option to add who the phone is locked to .
0	they are not reliable anymore and i am back to looking to others .
0	i pointed_out how foolish it would be to cut it so fine given that things obviously had already gone wrong once .
2	stumbled_across this web_site and have been amazingly surprised with cost and quality .
2	card payment taken .
0	wouldn ' t of bought it if i had known this before hand .
0	he rang the doorbell i opened it to see him drop my " please handle carefully " pc box both upside_down and from waist height .
0	the internal and back wood is not oak , but some flimsy softwood .
0	due to family commitments i could not pursue my studies further .
0	i have called the call_centre multiple_times .
2	i wish they really did " record their calls " that way they couldn_'_t blatantly deny all responsibility for saying things they later deny .
0	they are conveniently claiming that they have no record of the call in which i was promised a refund if delivery was any later - such a lie .
0	could be a site i use regularly .
2	had an_email this morning to advise time of delivery within one hour .
0	i will update all events on this site !!
2	finally sent by fedex next_day delivery , so got there in the end
0	every backpackers must look this site .
0	ook weer prima kwaliteit !
0	their internet service is very good though , i have a log in page to view my bill online .
0	amazing , easy to use , quick payout by most merchants esp .
0	absolutely_shocking service - couldn ' t they have asked me if i would like to receive a completely_useless part before sending it out wasting an entire day of mine ?
0	i would definitely recommended it to everyone !
0	the website gave loads of hostels to choose from , depending_on what you want and how much you have to spend .
2	levering på 0 - dagen_efter ordregivning .
0	so i ordered an extra large top , which was meant to be a size 00 , turns_out to be a size 00 !
2	delivery_men were great and free delivery is fab .
0	i have been ordering from them for the past couple of months , just placed an order today as well .
2	it would appear that when my cousin unwrapped her flowers , she was , to say the least very disappointed - i had up graded the order too - so i am very , very upset and since she has tried to contact serenata , she has_been met with unacceptable communication and very unhelpful customer service personnel - she has tried to complain on my behalf , but has_been met with insolent and rude_conduct on the part of their staff .
2	do not trust your hard_earned money to these robbing bastards are you reading this des coffey ??????
0	for any other website , i would have stopped visiting it if this had happened , so it ' s a testament to how good this site is that i have chosen to overlook these occasions .
2	they would only exchange mattresses if we paid a £_00 handling charge .
0	you will wonder that the people working there would now what they are doing . but no .
2	i am very surprised that so few have reviewed dhgate and those who have , had nothing particularly nice to say .
2	makita li - ion cordless drill / driver set .
0	a great site with a wide_range of different slots , machines running better_than most other_sites , withdrawal was quicker_than_expected , again allot faster_than different sites , after_reading reviews on forum sites there ' s allot of happy customers my self included , more deposit bonus will be great :)
0	i recommend is completely and will_continue to use it for years to come !
0	i would recommend people to stay_away from this company unless u enjoy getting poor customer_service and incorrect bills .
2	bought a bosch axt 00tc garden shredder from the homebase web_site - excellent value for money .
2	plus points . website easy to use . orders despatched quickly and kept_updated
2	once registered - my cards appeared in the app and i was able to transfer money from one to the other seamlessly ; very simple .
0	i ' ve paid 00x as much for worse !
2	we ordered a suite for delivery in feb , the delivery date was given to us .
0	basically the courier decided to leave my box on my " porch " i live next to a busy pathway and when i got home item was not there .
2	i can only hope so !!!!
2	i will not be using this company again .
2	no ticket no seats !
2	i eventually received my furniture after all this time .
0	i recently joined the orange network .
0	this website can help you wherever you go .
0	me and my wife waited in all day saturday by 0pm i phoned the courier as stated on the email to which the reply was " all deliveries on a saturday are completed by 00pm ".
2	decided to place an order for a water rowing machine costing_£_000 as it looked cheap .
0	apparently the delivery was attempted for several days , but at no stage did they leave a missed delivery note so i could collect from the depot .
0	take my advice , avoid like the plague , you may pay more from another company but at_least you will get your order and avoid all the hassle .
2	we are very pleased with our ratten garden_furniture .
0	my estimated_delivery date is for tomorrow , and i ' ve just received an e_- mail telling_me it ' s been dispatched and it ' s on it ' s way .
2	searched online and found the company , cheapest price and excellent service .
2	appreciate it , thank_you .
2	spoilt to some degree the excitement of a new bathroom .
2	sorry to say the flowers were not as good quality as they normally are .
0	there no site like bingocams !
0	booking my hostel was very easy and fast .
0	when i came to order another bit , the price was the same as elsewhere , but due to the ease of ordering and speed of delivery , i didn ' t hesitate to use mytriathlon again .
2	they delivered in white which i could have bought on the day at curries or pc_world some £_00 . 00 cheaper and taken it home there and then !
2	i was told they weren_'_t aware that it would take an extra day .
0	she said we ' ll it ' s just for the price plan , to set the direct_debit up .
0	they also answered a number of my questions over email and we ' re very helpful .
2	going online gets me in a loop , and when i finally find the right page it tells_me the phone number isn_'_t valid , and that the system will now be locked , whatever that means .
0	but the advice on the site allowed me to get the right product for me .
0	very impressed with the expedient repair on my phone .
2	it was once a place for a bargain or a niche product , now it '_s full of traders , used products cannot properly be separated from new ones in the search and you are forced to have a paypal_account .
2	0 .
2	an excellent service all_round .
0	it ' s nonsense , i paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery , i expected dpd or tnt or maybe fedex , heck , i wouldn ' t even have minded if it was yodel !
2	cutting a very long_story short one parcel did get to me well after 0mth but the 0nd one was still in essex i asked for that one to be returned to the collection address and my payment to be refunded as this is now 0mth after i sent them .
0	i ' m still arguing for my refund , so far i have only been offered another bouquet .
2	the bouquet is described as follows_:
2	quality service .
2	always found their products of good value , and the staff helpful , plenty of sales around the year , and staff are very friendly , plenty of tills open at the checkout .
2	hence - no listing , and no bookings … and nearly 0 weeks worth or repetitive e_- mails getting no where .
0	they responded really quick thumbs_up to them for that .
2	what does this mean .
2	i '_ve used ebookers for a few_years now and they are reliable .
0	posted a job but them removed as job was filled elsewhere , but they refuse to refund my deposit !
2	pixmania refused a request from paypal for the refund , and one week_later i phoned pixmania to ask where my money was , they told me that i had to drop my paypal_dispute before they would give me my money back , in other words they are trying to blackmail me into dropping the insurance and protection of paypal - thus leaving me wide open to them denying all knowledge of any payment and me being over £_000 out of pocket .
2	the other flowers i orders did have a card
0	hard to win big too and dealers go on more winning runs then players playing live bj .
0	so to sum up , lastminute theatre and meal deals aren ' t deals at all and cost more_than face_value .
0	while i like to concept of cashback sites , i find quidco doesn ' t quite cut it for the average shopper .
2	happy to have got the goods but not happy with the communication from the company as it was at best misleading and at worst , just plain wrong .
0	in the end i ended_up asking an ebay seller who was selling the same_thing !
0	great prices , very fast delivery , well ( but sensibly ) packaged and most_important of all , good quality products .
2	the tickets cost £_00 more on this website than the official website for no advantage whatsoever .
0	however , with the fact that i got the refund i will give them 0 extra star , no more .
2	i have now opened a dispute via pay_pal and will contact my credit_card tomorrow .
2	the coffees , however , have a certain watered - down quality , lacking intensity and " bite ".
2	they did arrive exactly when they said they would , excellent service , could not be better
0	i am greatly impressed with the promptness of the service and the fact that people at slr_hut did talk to me and helped_me change some aspects of the order after_placing it .
0	they ' ve just come out and asked me to reassess my review on trustpilot as well , so i think it ' s pretty clear their motivation for good customer_service isn ' t to ensure i get what i paid for , but protecting their reputation .
2	i run a busy ebay shop , have about 000 sales a week and for the last two years used ipostparcels to deliver my parcels ,
2	this delayed their delivery and the recipient had to collect them from the depot .
2	talktalk telecom group plc
2	was looking for a north_face plasma thermal jacket but noted at their shop in covent_garden the price was £_000 .
0	i placed my order ( using a 00_%_off discount_code that i found on the google sponsored ad ) and bought a pair of black ray - ban wayfarers for £_00 , plus free next_day delivery !!

0	found the check in staff to be quite regular and nothing with the airline blew me away in terms of service .
2	well_done daniel . and the rest of your team .
0	i ' ve used parcel0go so many_times i ' ve lost_count and each and every time the customer_service i ' ve experienced has been amazing .
0	i was first told this would be replaced but then received the most disgusting email from them calling me irresponsible and pretty_much telling_me it was my fault the food was mouldy and that i couldnt prove otherwise ( my consumer_rights state that i do not have to prove it was fault0 ).
2	the local ground operation was a complete_shambles .
2	oh and if you ever need to phone them - be prepared to wait and wait and wait on hold - poor service
0	as a result i am very reluctant to order anything_else from littlewoods .
2	god pris
0	so , i ' m not going to say they ' re bad .
0	every_step was easy with mazuma_mobile , i just put my phone in an old box i had sitting around , sat that in the plastic envelope thing they sent me . popped in my order form then handed it over at the post_office ( finding an open post_office was a nightmare , but that ' s a complaint for someone_else ! )
2	the installation was perfect , the man delivering and installing the machine kept in touch me letting me that all was well and that he had explained the wash programmes to my mother .
2	my refund was not forthcoming , and in the end after receiving advice from hong_kong cyber crime which stated i had to make simply_electronics aware that i had contacted them about the non refund of my payment , i did receive back in my account 00 days after the payment had been taken .
0	was waiting in for my order , i was only called after the two hour delivery slot had passed , to be quite frank i was seething as i was counting on the delivery for dinner .
0	made an order when they claimed free express international shipping upon spending abov 000 $.
2	my first time using parts_gateway has not been good . the main_reason was the part i was supplied with was fauly / heavy corrosion and with the incorrect abs lead fitted ( obvious not for my car , i confirmed this with renault who did not recognise part number of abs lead fitted ). i called the supplier rp services who were not very helpfull and said if i return item ( extra_cost of postage ) they would inspect and if found faulty they might return money . as part was needed i sought alternative supply and decide to cut my loss .
0	website states delivery 0 - 0 weeks , in - stock , direct from manufacturer .
2	i was really impressed with the customer service .
2	advertised my tickets for mrs browns boys and got them sold , great but still have not received payment for said tickets .
2	asked if possible it could arrive before the following sunday but didn_'_t think it would .
0	would i buy from ginger0 again ?
0	i mean , sure , people would understand , and they would say ' oh no , its good that you didn ' t - they ' re not good value ' but they still think you ' re weird .
2	don_'_t let lack of inertia hold you back like it did me !
2	they would be a thousand times more successful if they had a reasonable after - sales service .
2	as instructed by trading_standards we will be writing via recorded delivery , stating our case .
0	ordered plenty of things in the past that have come with dpd , including £ 0000 + computer systems , dpd being the only courier that haven ' t managed to damage the item , no matter how much packaging one uses .
2	there is a wide_range of choice and the furniture is comparatively good value for money . when it arrives in perfect_condition .
2	based on my lack of ability to contact them before , i decided against trying to return the laptop - i had no confidence that they could handle a return and i doubt that i would see it or a refund again .
0	i have an ee contract and it ' s brilliant .
2	great product at a good price .
2	they told me to send the device back , which i did by special delivery with guaranteed delivery by 0000 on the monday .
0	00_hours , i receive a call from them saying that my payment hasn ' t gone_through but they still need confirmation of cancellation from me in writing ( email ).
0	so far it seems quite secure , and i got a good deal .
0	the stools were extremely easy to put_together and are supplied with alan key do so .

2	i have had endless problems with their site , struggled to get hold of them on the phone , and when emailed have received a reply some 0 weeks_later , or not at all .
2	very easy to sign up and use .
0	all in all a good website and range of products .
0	it was very annoying as i ordered some flu drugs that i would have needed right away .
0	guess it is time to move on to new supplier .
0	it could have spelt disaster otherwise .
2	when i call europa they say they will investigate and call me back - do they ?
0	delivered in 00_hours
0	once i ' d received the e_- mail a valid code was delivered in next to no time and that ' s it , done .
0	time will now tell as to whether the parts arrive on tuesday or not but i will certainly never use wae_+ again and will not be recommending them to anyone_else .
2	everything_went like_clockwork until we arrived in sydney to catch our plane to auckland .
2	this was correctly charged at £_00 . 00 .
2	i was having trouble with mites in the hen house tried powder for them but mites came back every four weeks , and from pet stores not one of them sold large amounts and they were expensive .
0	it was even quite exciting to see where my lens was in the world at various times using their tracking_system .
0	i have previously been very happy with the downloads .
0	unfortunately size uk00 . 0 but luckily they fit my boyfriend and we couldn ' t be bothered returning them again as we needed them for our holidays .
2	really helpful on phone , easy on line , great customer service .
2	i would suggest that any would be purchaser does a thorough search around the internet and i would add further that they might inquire why so many reviews are taken down so quickly for spurious reasons .
0	even_though it states customer_service will contact you , they didnt .
2	they never phone when they say they will , scare you about unretrievable data , take your money when infact very little has_been done and never return the hardware sent .
2	be aware the local telephone_number shown on reciept is a uk call_centre and not your local_store .
2	however the £_000 cashback has just been paid to me this week , which is ' nt so bad but when you consider the contract was taken out in november_0000 the delay is not acceptable !
0	i didn ' t , and i recieved my mechanical pencil next_day , plus a free gift to boot .
2	myself and 0 other ladies were picked_up at_faro_airport by a meet and greet gentleman , taken promptly and picked_up a few_days from the same spot .
0	as a result i emailed ( they dont have a telephone_number !)
2	will change star_rating now !
2	delivered much_quicker_than i expected .
2	definitely not a modern villa this one .
2	the parts did not match the instructions or the intended contents of the packs , but with a range of tools and some spares from around the house we re - built it .
0	i can ' t fault the service from interactiveresorts , jonny morton was very helpful and replied by email very quickly .
0	customer_service is something they might want to work on .
0	this is clearly a young company - my cheque was hand_written in a stamped , addressed envelope ( very cute touch ).
2	o spa never delivered , groupon didn_'_t want to know and refused to refund .
2	avoid .
2	when the part had still not arrived by 0 . 00pm i called again to be told that the part would definitely be delivered today .
2	this was wednesday at 0pm .
0	it is highly used by many travelers .
0	i called mazuma on free number to check , but rang out .
2	considering i requested assurance regarding this particular issue before purchase , i consider this a breach of trades description and will be contacting the appropriate trading_standards to investigate . very very disappointed .
0	easy checkout .
0	0 .
0	but in the end i saw it was back to the depot , so i left my house as i thought it is not going to be delivered .
2	their service and advice is second to non .
2	i have called the company at_least once a day since last monday and have been referred to the showroom as we made the purchase in person rather_than on - line .
0	ebay will not care about seller why ?
0	she then shouted at me down the phone calling em a liar and that no other company cn offer me a good deal liek this .
0	beautifully quiet , due to the cutlery tray i can fit lots more in and everything comes out clean .
2	i have had some terrific bargains from amazon and a regular shopper with them .

0	it ' s been 0 already !
0	i booked a hotel through booking . com for myself and my 0 friends the cost when booking was £_000 in total so i took £_000 each off my friends , when i booked , the hotel took a £_000 . 00 deposit to secure the rooms / first night however i was expecting them to take the full_amount straight_away , this is not made clear on the website that it would not be all taken straight_away .
2	scanned and emailed the prescription on monday_morning and it was despatched later that same day and i received the following_day .
0	we also struggled with timings when we picked new activities .
2	the minute you go to a proper printer , you see what quality is like and for not much more ( or sometimes cheaper ).
0	one thing to note .
0	will be telling friends to purchase at their own peril .
2	pixmania have proved to be totally unreliable on this occassion and are avoiding accepting that they are entirely at fault .
2	00 days_later a claim form arrived asking for two repair estimates which we sent immediately .
0	calling me " boss "??!?!?!?
2	i purchased amongst other small items , a personalised banner which exceeded my expectations , totally impressed and great value too !!
2	the customer service help line was very helpful when i phoned for advice .
2	wanted to purchase a bose helicopter headset at £_000 , despite the sale being available neither the straight or coiled lead version was available .
2	they underestimated the length of the job by 0 days ( a 0 day job in total ) because they ( in their own words ) " underestimated how long the paint would take to dry ".
2	received rackets for my daughter next_morning at no extra_cost .
0	i strongly_advise everyone against dealing_with this company !
0	i waited another morning , obviously i ' m being stupid again .
0	had a telemarketing cold call from 00000000000 .
0	they ignored several complaint emails .
0	fair_enough , perhaps i ' d gone temporarily deaf .
0	that arrived in a day or so and i recieved the money directly in my bank 0 days after i sent the phone to them .
0	have never had any_problems
2	!
0	the service was outstanding - the game arrived quickly and in perfect_condition .
0	never has taxi travel let me down !
2	they send you texts to let you know when the goods will arrive and they arrive on time .
0	in conclusion i would recommend this company but be cautious in doing so .
0	they never actually answer questions in emails or on the phone .
2	?
0	update ( 00 / 00 ): still no tap recieved as expected .
0	i was disgusted by their service and when i phoned customer_services they were very rude and they cut me off .
2	free shipping is not a gimmick .
0	pretty pathetic service if you ask me .
0	i ordered from amazon and opted to use the collectplus service ( at a cost of £ 0 . 00 ) and chose to collect from my local asda store .
0	this was wrong each time as my partner works from home and not once was our buzzer rung .
2	highly_recommend them to you .
2	do not use expedia , they are expert scammers .
2	i did that and i was contacted by the manager of derby optical_express to go down and have my eyes_tested to find out why i get headache .
2	paid by debit_card but the restaurant is too_busy .
2	they do not guarantee that they will supply you with tickets .
0	haha .
0	it was dispatched very quickly , the same day as i placed the order , so i was surprised that it took 0 days to come .
0	the selection of products are fantastic and all for a great price .
2	received further email from conrad at cex wecare ??
2	it only takes a second to damage a speaker so i wasn_'_t too happy to have my time wasted by these " bait and switch " merchants .
0	- support is mediocre and very meh from my experience , and being a " platinum premium " member , i should in theory receive the highest priority level of support .
2	i would still use parcel0go again .
0	you can also log in and keep registration details , which makes booking a place much_easier - it is a pain to have to re enter all details on hostelworld when i am booking a new place every week !
0	!
2	i placed an order for a pair of oakley prescription glasses which cost under £_000 but as they were offering a £_00 discount if order was over £_000 i ordered a cleaning and screwdriver set from them also but it never arrived with the order .
0	i did wait a long period of time for my text_message which did not arrive and thus would recommend accepting the phone call method instead which came instantly .
0	the product is fantastic as well both in terms of value for money and taste .
2	would definitely shop_here again .
0	booked an 0 person trip to las_vegas through away0 .
0	hi ,
2	they say they will deliver and they won_'_t
2	i should be given compensation for the atrocious service and the long period they have had my money .
0	my only issue with fragrance_direct is the poor packaging !
2	you state that i have to return the pair - which means i will not be able to use my computer . i would have purchased another set from you and would willing have done this for a credit reimbursement when the defective pair had been returned .
2	the monitor did not connect to the desktop , i spoke to them they told me to go to pc_world and buy an adapter , i went to pc_world they did not have adapters so they sold me a monitor that would connect for an extra £_00 and i was told to return the other monitor to them , when i did return the unused perfect_condition monitor and left it in store , i have since had a phone conversation with them and they want me to collect it as they do not have a returns_policy and if i did not they would destroy the monitor .
0	generally , the website works well but the bookings do not go flawless in all cases .
0	glasses_direct bridged the gap perfectly .
2	it also makes me laugh out loud every time i hear their tag line " believe in better ".
2	when i first applied the time frame stated was 00 - 00_hours after 00_hours the website updated to upto 00 hourrs and it was eventually done but it would have been quicker and cheaper to go direct to 00 .
2	i have cancelled the order and wait to see how long it takes them to refund my money .
2	the technical call_centre have all the chat but , they just don_'_t have the service quality to back it up .
0	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
2	would definitely_use jokes ' masquerade again .
0	i booked a delivery for my parcel using parcel0go but there was a problem for the courier in delivering the parcel as i had the incorrect address on the parcel , so i was concerned that the parcel would not be delivered so i contacted parcel0go through there online live_chat and was very surprised to find how fast there service was in dealing_with quires as jessica was very helpful and she was able to re - arrange the delivery to the correct address with in just a couple of minutes

0	after about 00 days the product got here and so far so good but since it took so long and took some time to get a reply from them i am not sure if i would use again unless they would have had some really really good deals .

2	why :
2	recent order had an item that was unavailable .
2	i have brought all_sorts of things from wowcher from meals to weekend breaks which i wouldn_'_t have brought before i became a member .
2	the glasses cost me £ 0 plus £ 0 postage , and came with anti - reflective , anti - scratch coatings .
0	i had a problem depositing a couple of weeks_ago so contacted support , they couldn ' t tell me if my deposit went through or not which was a bit worrying and it took a while for them to get back to me .
2	" oh no .
0	i ordered just a mattress and the quality / price etc was really great .
0	it is very easy to use , it has many different kinds of accommodations for all tastes .
0	it ' s such a shame as if it wasn ' t for the dreadful support_team , i ' d be raving about qs_supplies .
2	if you are looking for a tuxedo for a black tie event look no further , easy to order , delivered the next_day at a reasonable price .
2	i have also spent hours emailing or ringing them , to say nothing of not having the use of the item !
0	not just the cost of the tickets but the numerous_calls to their indian_call_centres where they recite a speech - no matter how many_times you tell them otherwise they will repeat the speech . nightmare .
2	the people in their london shop are just as friendly .
2	let ’_s not forget there is still a considerable start - up cost for the counterfeiter setting_up his factory and production line .
2	i have a review i raised .
2	about 00_% of the postage was refunded after this but i thought that the postage for the other items was quite expensive compared to other things i have ordered on line .
0	i had used asda all the time to get my food shopping , went months without any_problems , then one time they took two amounts for the food shopping out of my account & it was a nightmare getting one put back & their customer_service is really bad , they ' re very rude & not helpful at all !!
0	always as i need , always arriving when i ask , never let me down .
0	0 ) to begin with , he spent good long time asking me to confirm my address , my landline_number , my email address , my full name as though i was calling a bank and not a happy shopping place .

2	can find it difficult to find what i am looking for instore , prefer to look online to find out what is instore .
0	top customer_service !
0	i have had this response twice .
2	i also discovered preloved . com who , although doesn_'_t have the audience reach of gumtree / e_- bay i have sold product through successfully without the awful gumtree experience .
0	i emailed them a week_later to ask whether it had been sent , saying i ' d heard_nothing .
2	the only dowside to it was that her iphone would not work through the hifi .
2	next_day i tracked the parcel online , the parcel was at the local wrexham service centre ( yodel ),
0	would highly_recommend very efficient fast services , products arrive in good condition and with excellent use by dates .
2	overall i am pleased with the price and goods and would reccomend them to a friend but go and collect the goods rather then be lied too about delivery dates .
2	no customer service number available to call .
2	dinner was fine but when we got to the theatre the seats were dreadful and we were so high up the only way we could see the stage was by leaning right forward for the whole of the performance !
0	be warned some of the tickets that they say are available are not !
0	super smooth_transaction and a great price for my phone
2	will not use them again .
0	they will beat any prices you can find online !
0	however customer_service is truly terrible , appalling in fact .
2	an entry made on ukmail '_s web_site , hours after i had called them to cover their tracks to say it was delayed , my suspicions are that the delay was due to a champions league football match , but i can '_t prove that .
2	easy to use website , checkout and fast delivery .
0	when you consider someone for long_term and with good operation and service - i would never recommend them to anyone .
0	ordered online and picked_up at store .
2	i have phoned and e_- mailed and been told that someone will get back to me .
0	excellent value for money too
0	two days had passed and no delivery so i decided to call them up and they told me they sent it to the wrong_address and to knock for them to get the items back .
2	unfortunately , gymroom use dx couriers who failed to deliver even_though there was someone home .
2	the substantial thickness , interesting designs , customer service , easy instructions and reliable delivery all make goodprint the best in my book .
0	can ' t fault outdoorkit , their delivery service was brilliant !
0	it is cheating and waste my time
2	will_definately recommend
0	i ' m a dutch person working in the uk .
0	the reason maybe that i was trying to access the . com domain rather_than the co . uk domain and having a uk ip_address may have caused a security concern ( ie : potential fake reviewer ).
2	when we placed an order the web_site failed to finalise the payment procedure so we tried a number of times again without_success .
0	you guys truly go above and beyond in every_aspect of the word !
2	once again sarah stuart did everything for us and answered any_queries we had about our travel_plans .

0	you will have to wait 0 - 0 working_days during which time you cannot cancel the order and no explaination will be given .
0	obviously some dirty tactics to extort customers rather_than provide a good service for them .
0	always find what i want and the prices are right .
0	it was a very unpleasant experience that i hope no one else has to go through .
2	i will be researching to see if i can take this further , but in truth , don_'_t think i ' m strong enough to fight and will just accept something i don_'_t want .
2	i rang on saturday_morning and thought i had cleared it up that i still have not had this furniture delivered and was thought i had said i would ring them after delivery to arrange .
0	within a few_days the shampoo was with me , i did think the bottle seemed small but you don ' t need much on the hair and i only use it weekly along side my daily shampoo .

2	however , i can confirm that not only is there an online petition , a government body will now investigate .
0	i bought this for a friends birthday , i requested help and they were helpful in helping me to speed delivery up due to time constraints .
2	they use a uk domain_name but are based in china - at_least that is where my battery came from .
2	the next_morning i checked my account on - line and the money was there .
2	it must be said that 0wm really worked hard to resolve the delivery problems and without their efforts i would probably still be waiting for the product !
0	just wish i ' d had it sooner !
0	after doing this i did get my refund soon after .
0	it took five_minutes just to get through the pre_- recorded adverts and nonsense they ' d like you to know about before they even let you talk to a person .
2	the product ie ., inks for canon mg0000 have proved so far to excellent and at an enormous saving from the canon inks .
0	i then stated on teh webside it is advertised as free instilation and the voucher .
0	spoke with the company i bought the food from and they looked into it , and got back to me and offered to send out replacements as they have been assured if they send a parcel out it would get to the customer today . wrong no parcel , instead i get an_email informing_me my parcel has been delayed and i wont get it until monday 00th .
0	i can ' t recommend you highly_enough , thanks .
2	i have ordered from them a lot in the past and will keep doing it in the future .
0	it really is so easy to book through these_guys .
0	you continue to be diverted to another area e . g .
0	there was myself and my partner here and we heard_nothing , we normally hear the letterbox if something is posted through .

0	so , i flew out not problems ,
2	call them back to be told the bed is now discontinued .
2	this female customer service person then went on to tell me and i quote " no we have record of receiving the goods back ".
0	a great buy and awesome service !
2	now the cash_back offer , various goods on the ao website have a cash_back offer , there might be a simple explanation but i cannot see why they cannot just reduce the goods by the various cash_back offers , instead the customer has to buy the goods , then contact them to get the cash_back , it does seem a rather long_winded process and there is no direct link on their site to apply for the cash_back unless of course i have missed it somewhere , but i cant see it anywhere , so have had to email them .
0	if i need any help they are always there on live_chat like sarah who i have just spoken to , to arrange change of address .
2	my boiler stopped_working on the 00th_november , no heating or hot_water . i rang them and they said the earliest they can send an engineer out is three days_later on 00st .
0	but out of quality , fit , and customisation ( which i consider to be the three most_important things that make you consider a ' tailor - made ' garment instead of the standard off - the - rack stuff ), one out of three is just not good enough .
0	the only_downside - after being spoiled by the main competitor of asda when the driver brings all my shopping to my doorstep and even kindly asks to unpack it all in the kitchen , i was surprised first by the asda driver not being_able to find my address , so i met him outside , showed where i live and said i ' d wait upstairs as it was freezing_cold !
2	just good to have the support when i needed it .
2	i tried these_guys once , fortunately paying through paypal so did not have trouble getting a refund .
2	if there are any changes , eg flight times , i have received a text_message .
0	their customer_service should really change their name to customer disservice , as this gives a much_better portrayal of the service you will receive from expedia .
2	they offer a wide_choice of nets and voiles with free_samples of designs so that you can see what you are buying .
0	when i requested a resend / refund of these items , i was refunded half what i was owed , and was then no repsonded to again .
0	my recommendation is to stay_away from talk_talk .
0	i had read the terms and conditions before i purchased my cover , which is how i knew to report my loss to them and the police so quickly , i must have misunderstood this part of the terms and thought that registering the product in my name would count .
2	when it still hadn_'_t arrived three days_later i tried_calling , but the offices were closed at 0 .
2	i will use them again , but i ' d like to be able to choose which company supplies my vehicle at the point of hire .
2	tried to call them but after listening to inane music for 00_minutes i gave up !
0	the prices are great for some products , e . g .
0	however , out of the items i have ordered so far ( only been using for a month ), four items have said in stock when they haven ' t been , so i have received them late .
0	i spent hours and hours to select the photos i wanted .
0	not only have i not had a royal_mail card through the door , but considering the other reviews here , does anyone really think it likely that they ' re telling the truth ?
2	they are trustworthy - we have lost money with other ticket sites !.
2	i '_ve been using ccl for many_years , at_least 00 .
0	viovet is so easy to use and the site is user_friendly with extra tools to help manage re - ordering items on a rotation .
2	my mistake , i should have looked closely at the seal inside and out .

0	i ' ve ordered with viagogo before , but i recently_purchased tickets for the madrid v real betis match on sunday november 00 , 0000 .
0	why does my phone struggle to even get 0g ?
2	i have had to chase them for updates .
2	the first i realised was when a bill came through for nearly twice the amount & when i queried it they said we don_'_t tell people when contract ends if you were on a deal !
0	maybe i should have trawled through the terms and conditions but it would have been more realistic to have a more explicit warning of this .
0	wowcher said maybe i could call royal_mail to let them know so they could improve their site !
2	fast payment , easy transaction .
2	its also nice to know the work was produced by a known artist , which is dan forder & the pack includes details about him which is a nice_touch .

2	whilst there , i spotted a 0 tier plastic shelving unit on offer at £_00 . 00 .
0	i also emailed the merchant of one of the items on numerous_occasions and once again , received no response .
0	hello friend !
2	there is no access problem as every other uk carrier delivers with no problem !
0	no parcel again .
2	as an ex courier when a customer hands me an item , i and the company are then responsible for that item and it is then covered by the courier insurance liability .
2	i have been with this company since they took over tiscali .
2	would i recommend , yes - but be prepared for substitute even if the site says in stock .
0	the first day the courier phoned me to say ' there was no flat number ' on the order and he had already left ; i asked him to phone the next_day before arrival so i could leave work to come for delivery .

0	i bought the tickets of the 0 directions 0 month in_advance to make_sure my sister could go to their concert and paid 000_euros for one place in front of the podium !!!
0	i have had an absolutely awful experience with talk_talk .
2	apparently they know all about the bad_reviews but keep on misleading people .
0	i didn ' t complain_about this because i don ' t know if this is an avoidable sort of thing or not .
2	have used half a dozen times or more and always received orders very quickly .
2	i am looking at air optix ( day and night ) which select_specs have priced at £_00 , this is compared to lentiamo . co . uk which is almost half the price at £_00 ???
2	it is a terrible thing to have to go through this at the start of your holiday and we had not budgeted for this extra , so it had to come out of our spending money .
0	on a couple of occasions however , they have said that they tried to deliver but nobody was in to take delivery - some of these parcels were going to large companies which were open all day - others to households where someone has been in all day .
2	that will be samsung again but i ' m not sure about affordable mobile
2	their admin did not seem to have a clue what they were doing .
2	still_waiting .
0	the whole experience from beginning to end was easy , seemless and hasle free !
2	i was then assured that they would try to get me replacement tickets for hannover , apologised for the email being sent in germand and assured me it would be resent in english and took my mobile number so that they could contact me as soon as they found replacement tickets to change delivery to the hotel in hannover as they would not get to the uk in time .
0	when it came down to me to organise a stag , i didn ' t hesitate to book through them .
0	( 0 ) pay a broker fees equivalent twice of monthly wage and we have no_idea of import and tax duty so wait but there is no time_frame as soon as we clear the parcel we will deliver it to you .

2	i was advised that my appointment was " between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 ".
2	by this time the unit i had ordered had sold out and i was back to square one with nowhere to buy the replacement christmas_present .
0	after a custom service representative called me about this issue , it seems that the item that was sent to me was a picking error , and should not have been sent out to me , as i initially suspected .

0	the transaction details are also in dutch " betaling godkendt med transaktionsid :_000000000 "

2	cheapest by far , but needed the items in a hurry and there was nothing to indicate that there would be a hold up .
0	lost all my patience . and decided to just cancell the contract and finish with this crappy miserable service .
2	in march_0000 we are informed by hoetelsclick . com that our booking is cancelled .
0	i prefer this website because it is much richer in features for paying customers than the others , with most other cam sites you are lucky to get a basic " java " chatroom and the option to take a model private .
0	i understand it was my choice to sell the items but in honesty i couldn ' t be bothered to sell the items individually but it worked out to £ 0 . 00 a cd roughly . you know they ' ll be sold on for minimum of £ 0 . 00 each , great business .
2	i have taken the guitar to my luthier who has confirmed the instrument as " well - used " and he will replace and lower the strings for me .

2	the ones kac sent are different - they have red pump handles as_opposed to cream , the labels are different and the manufacturer '_s stock numbers too ( 0000 vs 0000 ).
0	i did all my christmas shopping online this year and this remains the only item i have not yet received !
0	the seats were ok for the flight and the food was reasonably_priced .
0	i ' m pretty disgusted with the service at wowcher , especially as i stopped using another rival company as i had a similar experience with them .
2	however with things like the nuts for the tubeless rims , being out of stock for ages on those was ridiculous .
0	we arrived for the meal at kitchen italia in covent_garden and were handed a small menu called their " rapido " menu .
0	slightly confusing but managed to get through .
0	0 star
0	booked hostels several_times in different_countries using hostelbookers . com and there were absolutely no_problems with reservation / stay .
2	they make you believe that they will pay a decent price for your mobile but instead and by the time they have the device in their hands they make a counter offer to you which is 0 / 0 of the original price and at that point there is no going back unless you pay them £ 0 . 00 for your phone to come back to you !
2	they advised me to have someone with me when they deliver the sofa .
0	shipping cost used to be high , but now with their $ 0 . 00 flat_rate shipping it is no_longer an issue .
2	due to my experience with dx , i will not be using gymroom again unless they can get my goods to me via a different delivery method .
2	i will use ocado sainsbury and waitrose in future
0	resten var allerede udsolgt .
0	at this point it was 00am , when i queried the part and if i should have been double_charged the vat , i was told ' that ' s just the way we do it '.
2	i have reported this by email , but they do not bother to reply .
2	time for some one else to take their crown and treat the people that make ebay what it is with some dignity and courtecy .
2	then i saw feedback on a couple of web_pages from people who had returned batteries and heard no more .
2	you cant knock that !
0	i was very happy with the selection and great deals .
0	it really helped_us plan our own trips daily .
2	cant_fault the go - electrical outfit .
2	i wanted to buy from a local supplier but will_definitely not recommend them to anybody .
0	i want to get some more tees as christmas_gifts .
2	easy , quick , good prices
2	delivery company very rude !
2	late in the afternoon , i got an e_- mail back from them telling_me that the parcel was not due to be picked_up from them until that day and that it should be with me by the monday ( this was friday ), and that the original e_- mail should have stated that .
0	thanks guys x
0	sorry novatech , but you ' re not like amazon or ebay , i only found you on the backend of a google_search .
2	customers dont have to put up with bad service , and i wont put up with it .
0	we are having huge problems with sky , their call_center are rude and do not bother even read the emails and reply with something irrelevant .
2	frustration . when it work it works but the customer service is appalling if you have problems , warning warning , if it works don_’ t change anything .
0	used a couple of times , whatever i seemed to choose , out of stock , didnt matter when i logged on , out of stock was quicker and easier to to a shop , delivery isnt too bad though when you do find somthing in stock
2	the items were very well_packed .
2	i ordered duvets , covers and pillows from this company via amazon .
0	so they have to cancel my booking !!
2	the door worked_perfectly the first time i tried it , i then carried_out the adjustments as advised in the setup guide ( an easy 0 minute job ) and that was that !
2	i had a parcel to send - but printer decided to give up the ghost this morning _ went on live_chat - dealt_with a very helpful and efficient lady_called catherine - could not have been easier - she set it all up for me and sent me all the links necessary - all sorted within a couple of minutes - excellent friendly service - could not have asked for better !
2	buy cosequin ds sprinkles for my black labrador '_s aching joints and it seems to work for him .

2	i have used hermes a number of times for my e_bay sales and they have always delivered on time , parcels undamaged , 0_stars here , lovely couriers pick_up the parcels too .
0	i can understand that they would need to make the necessary checks with this engineer as to ascertain what would have taken him 0 hours , but their inability to keep me updated has made me doubt aspect ' s level of responsibility and clarity on what is chargeable to the customer .
0	flowers did not arrive on special day as requested .
2	they have offered to change the rooms but you have declined this .
2	the staff seem to be some what demoralised and always seem to look tired and over worked .
2	i made an order on boiler_juice for the first time .
0	i finally got an_email and they offered to deliver the following_day ( mothering tuesday ?!)
0	when the product didn ' t arrive due to postal issues , they immediately sent out another which arrived rapidly .
0	although once i opened it i found that the retail box was crushed and in tatters as if something hefty had driven over it .
2	if anyone_else has similarly suffered , please dont hesitate to get in contact with me .
2	anyway she said they could a conference_call with myself and my business partner as we could not go to natwest .
0	took 0 minutes to go through paperwork to say the job was complete , paid easily by card and that was it .
0	i wrote back very angrily outlining why this was unacceptable .
0	i emailed them about an_hour after my purchase .
2	it seems they split the company so one side can blame the other , i mean how do you loose a parcel for 0 days and then make the customer fight for any kind of refund , instead of a refund they kick you whilst your down ?
0	i always find tescos to be entirely satisfactory .
2	i ordered an motherboard that i needed asap and wow you delivered the very next_day .
2	the only way to contact customer service is to sit in a telephone queue for approx 00_mins or e_mail them and expect a rubbish response in a couple of days .
2	so while they seem to have a pretty good reputation overall just bear in mind that if it is wrong they don_'_t jump_through hoops to rectify the situation .
0	the experience was amazing and one we will never forget , right from the start we were so well looked after by pe .
0	they have no phone number so you have to wait for an adviser to speak to you online - so they closed the service for the entire day .
0	however i can ' t blame the call_centre staff as its the companies job to install values , ways of working & expectations !!
0	unfortunately due to rough handed couriers the box has exploded on one side and had a hole in one corner where it had been scraped across the floor .
0	the problem however has now got worse .
0	very simple and good price
2	they gave us a four hour_window when it would arrive , freeing up time in the morning , and the delivery arrived on time and with no hitches , even with polite , helpful delivery guys .
2	this will be my site of preference in the future .
0	this company are only interested in your money , not their service .
2	issue - free online shopping as it should be
2	constant hassle from their sales teams about upgrades and new contracts ( they don_'_t like to let go ) are infuriating .

2	i have been looking for a barbour_jacket like this one fo a while now .
0	posted on same time to ziffit and to music_magpie boxes . ziffit received after 0weeks . and music_magpie still_waiting .
2	i have no doubt that some people have had a bad_experience and fully sympathise with them .
2	just a note to say how helpful the live team have been especially catherine_corless , very competent person who was not only quick at her replies but delivered her promises . refreshingly human by todays standard simon franco
2	purchased two 0000 watt bass bins .
2	i have given them all the information they have asked for but they seem to be incapable of imputing numbers into a computer correctly .
2	they do everything possible to avoid answering the phone .

2	sorting this out was left to the resort staff , which with no help from uk skifrance they eventually did .

2	never mind the fact i have already had to purchase another bunch from elsewhere .
0	fab !
2	needless to say with such incompetence as the norm i will not use them again .

0	all other_sites i looked at , their sale price was actually higher_than the normal price for this product on supplementwarehouse . com .
0	purchased an omega_seamaster at what was abit of a premium price ( could have been sourced cheaper from a personal sale ) but went with watchfinder due to the warranty / good overall reviews - especially as i have had poor luck with pre_owned watches sold privately on auction sites lately .

2	i was interested to read other reviews where people with disabilities have experienced problems and must draw attention to the fact that disability legislation in this country calls for " better_than equal treatment "!

0	we waited for the pick_up at the hotel and after the collection time had passed with no sign of the bus i called again to be told they had the wrong details and was asked to hold while they contacted the driver , after a while on hold i was assured the driver would be with us soon .

2	i will never buy through them again .
0	one of the keys has fallen_off already and i ' ve had it no_longer_than a month .
0	the occasional substitution , but normally fine .
0	as it is officialiphoneunlock . co . uk is the best unlock solution for unlocking any iphone , what impressed me most is the support of the team .
2	it would have been nice though if the status of my order had been corrected and the company had emailed me to tell me delivery had been arranged , if rachel had not emailed me back so promptly no one would have been at home to sign for the consignment .

0	i spoke with claire in store again and she told me it had been sent in for the charger_port and nothing to do with the screen , so they should have fixed it .

0	as the card said the item would be returned after 0 working_days , i felt under pressure to commit to a collection date .

0	serenata service definitely has lots of room for improvement .
0	great price from buysend and competitive with other online_retailer .
0	they are basically holding customer ' s money back as long as they can .
0	its clear just_eat are out for there profit only and dont care about the bad light they put the takeaway services they represent in .
2	maybe the reviewer is correct who thinks asda might deliberately be palming off any old rubbish that no one would buy in the store onto the poor home shoppers .
0	to put it quite simply .
0	price is normally very good , cd albums etc are normally equal to amazon prices .

0	great to find a company that could get some degu food no where else seemed to have .
0	they have got to be one of the worst companies to deal with when it comes to changing or ending a contract , even after 0 hours of trying to get them to cancel my contract and being told that i was making " the wrong decision " by leaving them and that leaving them for a rival carrier was " stupid ", they still didn ' t even do what i asked them to do in the first place which was end my rolling_contract , which_resulted_in me having to phone them again , and of course going through the exact_same stuff and tripe that their staff have to come out with .
0	its wrong and wont be dealing_with them anymore

0	the items were in my basket whilst i was going back and forth with the store and my card issuers to try and identify the problem . which of course was their website , but they at first denied this .

2	then my phone_call was met with " there is nobody to answer your questions as they are all being trained " hopefully in how to provide better customer service .
2	if they had a truly local_depot i would have gone and got it but a round_trip of 0hrs is a bit much .
0	the website is just set out in a simple , yet beautiful fashion , and is incredibly efficient in getting you what you want .
2	in every other respect i was pleased , easy upload , quick delivery etc .
2	i eventually gave up and threatened to cancel the order and request a refund and goods to be uplifted , only to be given another long_drawn out story about short staff etc and the missing_parts would yet again be sent out first_class post . guess_what they never arrived next_day but five days_later !

2	and apparently this is what customers wanted .
2	this means more hassle for me as i do not know what has actually been uploaded to your site hence i have to send emails_requesting details and adding the information again as well as having to incur another international bank fee for the additional transaction of emailing the photo to your office .
2	i took the opportunity to disconnect our old cooker and stick it in the garden .

2	but apart_from that , complete care shop have made one very excitable 0 year_old , a very very happy lil man .

0	well i can ' t answer that i ' m_afraid , all i know is that the variety of products has diminished and the prices have crept up and up over the last few_years to the point where play . com is a shadow of its former self .
0	nobody has , but at_least the tv arrived .
0	site is easy to navigate by category or brand or by using the search_function and there is plenty of revelant information for each product .
0	so not happy because i had to let_down clients .

2	i tested the product and it works just as the video said it would .
2	i ordered a tv from pixmania through their website , and paid via_paypal .
0	i ordered a digital heatgun which tend to be cheapest across the net after a few search_engines i done , received the item in time but when i opened the pack every accessories for the heat gun itself was not in place and it was all over the box , i guess this could be because of original manufacture packaging and not the fxx or could be because of bad handling of the item from the fxx , however the item fully works and not damaged that ' s why i give 0 start for this my very first purchase from them .
2	paypal refunded the customer , i lost both guitar and money even_though i had not done anything wrong .
0	shipping is always fast , items are always packaged carefully , and everything always arrives exactly as i ordered it .

0	the hotel was very nice , clean and functional and the breakfasts were good and well needed .
2	one thing though is certain - i will never book with them again .
2	no , this company treated me fairly and had all done , cheque in hand ( just opened as the mazuma advert was on tv ) within three days , excellent !
0	best to go elsewhere whilst they sort themselves out .
2	never responded to e_- mail for 0 - 0 days , and even then never understaood the issue of delivering so late in the day .
0	wow !
2	i googled them and this appears to be a common pattern , people order goods , nothing arrives , they then try and fob you off .
0	i purchased vega energising smoothie powder and it arrived_safely .
2	i also have a contract for a phone i got for my mum which is due for renewal , they phoned me today to try to sell me a new contract but obviously i will be looking elsewhere , so that '_s 0 customers they have lost ( husband won_'_t use them again either ).
2	as being new to shopping on - line , i found them very helpful indeed , i had a small problem , and called the company on my landline , left a message ' not expecting a reply , gosh !!!
2	they spoke to the owner while i was on the phone with them and advised that i should find alternativa accommodation in the middle of the night and with a pregnant wife !
2	well_done to all the directors and staff at mazuma , as whatever you are doing , you are doing it so well .
2	until one of two bedside_tables i ordered arrived two_weeks_ago damaged , i sent them a message via their customer service desk and received a reply after 0 days offering a refund or replacement ( i wanted a matching pair so opted for replacement ) and asking what day i wanted the damaged item collected , allowing 00_hours notice , i gave a date .

2	i have used biosthetique products for at_least 00 years and until haircare shop i struggled to get these products , not only that others charged much more for the products , the explanation for each of the products is very clear and you cant go_wrong when chosing , then the haircare shop is simple and easy to pay and very quick service to deliver .

2	i would not have objected to that but i did object to a wall view .
0	originally ordered quite alot in march , all arrived in a tatty , smelly bag , items were fine but i couldn ' t keep them due to how they had arrived i was really offended .
2	if i had had this information it could have been purchased else where .
0	i am happy with the computer i bought .
2	ordered product , e_- mail says products depatched now waiting 00 days .
2	however , when i wrote to them explaining this fact , it was too late because their price guarantee only lasts 00 hour !
2	phoned the customer_services line .
0	they promise a price_match if you find the hotel cheaper .
2	very impressed
2	it is better quality than i expected as it was a nice heavy_duty frame unlike the canvases they sell in dunelm or next .
2	very fast delivery , goods in first_class condition , would recommend and buy again .
0	i have used the site a couple of times with no issues , but when there is an issue this is where is falls down !
0	thanks
0	please solve this problem .
0	read all the local rules about special fines and charges - never ever ( i cannot stress this enough ) rely_on the car_rental company to watch your back or help you in anyway with regard to this .
2	hi , purchased from ipsl after many hours trawling the web , although initially i thought they were expensive compared to some other manufactures of this product but i only wanted to fit this ceiling product once , the delivery and customer service was very good on unpacking you could see the quality of the product info on the web_site on how to fit was easy to follow .
2	only had one problem .
2	thank_you .
2	i tried to sign up for one of their deals and they refused me credit of a whole £ 0 . 00 per_month .
0	bought the game and within 0 minutes it had been delivered .
2	i '_ve traveled now a few_times ryan_air and to be honest i would rather have better customer service , before during and after the flight .
2	rental_cars are competitive , fast and efficient but the problems appear to arise with the actual car suppliers .
2	rc enthusiasts need good back up and spares support .
2	i had over 00 e_- mails on my computer with all_sorts of crap from simply_electronics , and in the end asked for a full_refund as the camera was not being sent out .
0	great software !
2	given the enormous margin they are charging for tickets as a " reseller ", they should have people on the phones eager to assist the needs of their customers ( yes this costs money but people are paying good money ).
2	i gave them a really bad review to get them to actually take notice and refund my money .
2	and dont forget the £ 0 overnight parking fee ( or was i shafted ) ?
2	delivered on time by friendly helpful drivers .
0	at no point has this been changed on the website either , so people will_continue to order them despite them not being available which is misleading .
2	i contacted glasses000 via there web_site then also by telephone as i got no response from web_site .
2	delivery was duly made on the day so i cannot_fault the service .
0	not impressed that they don ' t take security more seriously .
2	had to get some id cards done for a client who have just set_up independently of the local council .
0	thanks folks
2	when i emailed them to question why they said there were scratches to screen and casing !!
0	i had the day off of work so waited in my front room for the hour , knowing that i would see the van turn_up .
2	it took 00 calls for customer service ( hahaha ) to actually do something to address my issues .
2	one wall of the room was door and window , with floor to ceiling curtain , which did nothing for my claustrophobia .
0	they should definitely deliver a scathing response to asus who just decided to rma the board no questions_asked .
0	very disappointed :(
0	took 0 days !
0	excellent service with next_day delivery at no extra_cost .
0	since posting this review my order as been looked at again and therefore i had the correct service and the lady was very helpfull .
0	but to be honest , i have stopped buying from here as its a rip_off .
2	only 0 working toilets on the 00 hour flight back - not nice !!
0	john_lewis or m & s .
0	i can ' t say it is a very bad_experience but as the booking with literally hours from the intended travel time i had some inconvenience with being issued a booking reference initially which when checked on checkmytrip . com said that booking cancelled . was in a bit of a hassle till 0 hours_later i received the e_- ticket with different reference_number .
0	quite fast and easy way to book but experience some difficulties while using the payment_method via credit_card
0	i emailed and got a reply saying they would check dispatch date and email back but they never did .
2	always had good service from this company and fast deliveries , would recommend
2	i finally received my item but after a lot of correspondence back and forth .
2	will never shop_here again .
2	best prices
0	not happy at all !
0	what ?
2	a top brand , with top prices and out of this world customer service .
2	however , that does not detract from the fact that i received seven quotes within 00_hours of posting my job .
2	with the old pricing_structure you saw what you would pay , there was almost no difference in price by different quantities , and you add postage on at the end , once .
0	you could have earned all 0_stars if that was the case - sorry .
2	i made a mistake after having 0 options for my flight back from sa in 0000 .
0	so then my chasis arrives , the pacaging is perfect , the styrofone is perfect and holds its so well it takes 0 grown men to get the chassis out of the box , soooo . how has the internal parts of the chasis been shattered , its because its a b - grade product , iv been charged for a full product .
2	i paid for two parcels to be delivered to my turkish home full of tesco ’_s goodies for christmas .
2	( i was half expecting order to arrive too late ).
0	its not like i have a life !!
2	director
0	i have received a confirmation , and viagogo was quick enough to withdraw the money from my account .
2	this is , in my opinion , very odd . as with trip_advisor , surely all reviews should be un - editable , and relate to one experience .
2	i am told there isnt a manager in the building past 0pm on a friday and their returns department stop work at 0 : 00 each day and no one can get in their after that time .
0	the good news was that none of my items came doa ( dead on arrival )
2	hi , received the homeplugs today ( wed ) very fast processing of my order and well_packed .
2	now they have written demanding the £_00 they say i owe them , threatening me with debt_collectors and damaging my credit rating .
2	easy website to navigate .
0	0 . long_story short , i paid because i was worried_about my credit_rating .
2	online_chat was so helpfull in choosing the right bike and size for me .
0	where you would change the ticket you have to a refundable ticket ( which you would need to buy )."
2	i wish i knew about you sooner .
2	a request for help is answered swiftly and with a real sense of purpose .
0	also great when you are present shopping as it doesn ' t look as suspicious as having your debit / credit_card in hand when the girlfriend is hovering around you like a hawk !
2	couldn_'_t ask for more .
2	we bought tachodisc software and installed it on a pc which unfortunately died ,
0	unlock does exactly_what it says on the tin , unlocked on apple ' s database but may take a lot longer_than you expect .
2	so i called redhill again to give them 0 more chance , but was still told that it should be delivered next week , but no guarantees .
2	at this point i lost the plot , went home and found this brilliant web_site !
2	therefore i would suggest that an easy to use screen detailing the shipping details and estimated delivery date would have made this move from a 0 to a 0 .
0	would recommend to everyone , just wish i had found this sooner .
0	they waffled on in bad english about something , which did not make sense .
0	i was kept on hold for about 00 seconds while the advisor checked the status .
0	when the costumes arrived they had sent completely the wrong product .
0	i ordered valentines flowers on 00 / 00 / 00 for my girlfriend that is currently in oz .
2	all done in a friendly and witty way .
0	business suicide .
0	i am furious at this point but i stayed composed .
0	removal of a number would mean the profile becomes inactive until a new valid number is associated with it again .
2	they had and produced them .
2	we decided to go down the purchase route and again the member of staff took time to explain various products strengths and weaknesses for what we required .
2	norman even mopped my floor to make_sure it was safe .
2	fast delivery email_updates recomend 000_%
2	our review of house trip was not positive and it appears that trust_pilot does not want to publish our review because it is negative
2	paid by debit_card .
0	the temperature gauge was also damaged on the motherboard which definitely scared me for sure given the temperature restrictions on the amd processor inside !
0	de bezorgers zijn bijna allemaal prima en de website werkt goed .
2	bit of a " come on " so still think they need to look at their sales strategy from a customers point of view !
0	the site is very cool and clever with a great breadth of listings that i ' ve used .
0	they havent ever failed me , delievery / turnaround times are very good , 0 / 00 orders ( before 0pm ) arrived the next_day .
2	pre ordered an audiolab item , and was delighted to get a call immediately the shipment arrived in uk .
2	delivery choices are excellent and my goods have always been delivered on time .
2	it has taken me 00 years to persuade my husband to get on a plane , having had a bad_experience on a flight some 00 years_ago .
2	medicanimal offer an amazing service and they are a lot_cheaper_than our own vet .
0	issues can be sorted very easily by contacting the just_eat team , by ordering takeaways online it solves the issue of repeating your order or address 0 times due to the lack of understanding from the take away , have no money handy , problem solved by using your debit_card .
2	there was a very slight_delay with my order due to the item not being stock and i was immediately e_- mailed to inform me of the expected delivery date .
2	phoned dollar / thrifty to report problem , they came back & said they ' re sending replacement car .
2	i had found the website easy to use and the prices on offer seemed to be very competitive so it is disappointing that they have been let_down by the couriers .
2	overall the service was very good although i could not complete the order via smartphone or ipad , but had no problem via laptop .
0	probably not the best idea when i haven ' t received it !
2	the gadget ordered was about the right price and was the only one in stock anywhere on the internet when i looked .
0	when i commented that this would not suffice fully as i would never use them again and i wanted my travel and expenses covered in full , i was advised i had to write to there head_office in switzerland , again at my own cost .
0	omar
2	and it was sent on thier next_day service !!!!!!!!!!!!
2	this is what you wrote to me :
2	trying to cancel my order requires a letter sent by registerd post .
0	just tired to get automatic e_- mails from you .
0	i bought a pair of trainers and unfortunately they didn ' t fit my boyfriend .
2	i have used this company about 000 times now . and never had any_problems . local people pick my items up when stated . at a rough time to suit me . and not one has ever gone_missing yet . cheaper_than royal_mail costs .
0	it was really a great help .
0	but again when it comes to their clothing i wouldn ' t buy from them ever again .
2	order was placed quickly and easily on line .
2	great products .
2	he was adamant that i owed this money from a previous order even_though 00 per_cent of the order was returned over a month_ago and was showing on my account as returned .
0	so money not spent well as is was a special gift from my son to his aunty .
0	they had some good reviews , as did plenty of other_companies i found on the net .
0	de service in de vestiging zelfs was verder prima .
2	without prejudice
2	a pity because they have an excellent inventory of products .
2	i contacted blackberry support who could not have been more helpful , and with their assistance ran through a whole series of checks and tests , including using other pcs , and re - installs of the pc desktop software .
0	the time and hassle just doesn ' t seem worth it .
0	i hope yesstyle can actually post meaningful replies and not some automated_reply like they always do as well !
0	i ramdomly found this website and so glad i did .
0	i am fed_up and just want to cancel so i can go somewhere_else where i can receive the services we are paying for .
2	this lack of customer after service will make me think about purchasing from them the next time .
0	no_idea who it was , did a quick google and discovered it was these people .
2	i found the attitude disgraceful and to be honest i saved a fiver and wished i had never bothered .
2	if they cant match / better it they explain_why with valid points .
0	today i found i was unable to login to trustpilot .
0	never had any issue with quality though .
0	not happy .
2	wouldnt_hesitate in using them again , and wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend them to my mates down the field . some other models shops would do well to follow their example :-)
2	very slow customer service .
2	i asked if i could cancel the order and was told that was fine , but i probably would not be able to get it elsewhere any quicker .
0	steer_well clear .
2	only small complaint only one delivery driver , lift was not working so i had to help him carry up one flight of stairs im a single lady so it was not easy . i had slight_damage on unit but sorted_out quickly .
2	use a reputable company , not play . com !
2	customers beware .
2	as a consequence , about 00_% of the order were bent and damaged , and not usable .
2	they wanted 00 . 00 for me to end the contract that they are not supplying , well i will take it to the ombudsman first . oh and as if by magic the line came back for 0 mins , and low and behold their systems are always down so you can '_t be transferred to someone with a brain and have to keep pressing 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 and repeating all your details over and over , so frustrating and angry .
2	i wish i had read the reviews on this company before ordering anything from them .
2	since i do not have a credit_card i asked to cancel the booking and have a refund .
2	ordered the product one evening and had it delivered to me two days_later .
0	the shipping is where i would say this company loses out on getting the other two stars , it takes a long , long time to get to it ' s destination and i felt that once you order from them and they have your money they are not very forthcoming with their communication .
2	since then have sent repeated emails and have had several conversations with people who tell me i can expect a full_refund in a few_days time .
0	it seemed like a great price when i ordered that item so i decided to give them a try .
0	fuel at their filling stations is always good value .
0	they said it would take around 00 days to get my phone repaired and sent back to me .
0	!
2	some of the companies who sell through amazon have poor looking websites themselves and don ; t carry the same trust that amazon themselves have built up over time yet we ' re almost led to believe we ' re still receiving the same quality of service .
0	i would recommend to all and i will be back for another canvas soon !
0	doesn ' t feel you with confidence as there are a lot of negative_reviews but i was pleasantly_surprised !
2	instructions are simple and fast !
0	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else in the future .
2	i ordered a goodmans digital recorder that when it finally came i found that the remote did not work ( i tried a friends remote and found that it worked with that one ) and when i contacted the company they said that it was up to mighty_deals to sort and mighty_deals are just ignoring me .
2	!
0	however easy to use and some good up to date games !
0	total scammers !
0	if i hadn ' t , i don ' t think he ' d have stopped .
2	have waited over a week for my items which really defeats the object of being_able to order online for convenience and speed .
2	the mains cable was missing , a minor point but annoying .
2	i was surprised to see so many really bad_reviews .
0	now they give me couriers number .
2	well that was half true the base arrived but no mattress .
2	but what will it help me ?
0	( rhetorical question ).
2	it is an_absolute joke especially as bedroom world state you can watch a video to say how reliable their delivery is .
0	i had to pay 00 € for fuel which seems to be normal when you ' re from the uk or germany , but i drove the car nuts so i ran out of the fuel and had to refuel the car .
2	i had an anxious wait but my camera was delivered before expected and well_packaged .
0	a whole lot of pain just to give someone my money !
2	i am exchanging emails with " rachel " which is obviously not even reading the enquiries but answering with some standard email .
0	i called service team and explained the problem , they neglected to call me back or provide updates on the situation .
0	oto horacek
0	in the meantime , t - mobile have just brought out a ' truly unlimited ' data package .
0	i quickly learned that even for name brands , supplementwarehouse will outcompete other_websites ' off brands in price .
2	!
0	i booked a roundtrip from london , heathow to san_francisco international ( sfo ) with them .
2	are they going_bust ?
2	order was placed and then i heard_nothing about submitting the prescription so i waited for delivery .
0	avoid .
0	not worth your time let_alone your money , unless ofcourse you really like watching really old movies that no - one has ever heard of .
2	my son ordered the original for mothers_day , from where he lives in new_york .
0	the latest purchase however was a bit of a nightmare due to the fact that the cdkey supplied with the game was already in use , so i had to send the game back .
0	i have ordered over 0 items from shopto since i found the site and not once have they failed to impress me .
0	the system to check which items have been changed does not list the price and instructs you to refer to the receipt which would mean emptying the enite contents out while the delivery man waited .
2	when i got a plumber to fit them he laughed : they had a 0 / 0 " thread instead of 0 / 0 " and would not fit the holes in my hand basin .
0	i can ' t imagine getting a better service , certainly not from a high_street agent , and when you factor in how much you would pay to a high_street agent as a % of the property value that makes this a hugely high value service .
2	easy to order , arrived on time , kept_informed at all_stages from despatch to delivery - flowers were a small bouquet , but really pretty & looked like they did in the photo .
0	would recommend them to anyone .
2	as usual , a very prompt and efficient service - posted the mobiles on a tuesday - cheque received on thursday !
2	before trying to sell something on gumtree i wanted to get a used iphone .
2	my experience with this company has_been exceptionally positive . excellent communication and positive_outcome from the auctions . will_definitely_use again .
2	can '_t do anything unless i come back to the store .
2	i was unable to contact the company as their e_- mail was always off - line so sent it back (£ 0 . 00 for postage ) and to their credit , they refunded my money within a week .
0	price wise you cant argue they do some flexible good deals , but blink or click on it twice and its gone in a flash - apparently thats how they bump up the prices on the basis of the amount of clicks when searching on the site .
2	fast forward to innumerable and unsatisfactory calls including me taking time off and waiting in all afternoon for an a no - show engineer ( he went to the cab and it was too hard from him , so i subsequently discovered ).
2	they deliver when they say they will and should i need to return an item ( only once in 00yrs and that was my fault ) there is no third degree questioning .
2	having done this i found a quote for £_00 per_month !!
2	tried again and for some reason got the option for a callback .
2	our household have since changed to a similar small uk isp and could not be_happier with the quality of service we ’ ve received .
0	they provide a wide_range , low_cost and legitimate selection .
2	follow_up : following factual feedback left for this company on the website on which it trades i have received several abusive emails .
0	will 000_% be using them from now on .
0	pathetic
0	i was expecting to receive a lower_price but not by more_than £_00 !
0	this is their award winning service ?
0	i ' m pretty sure this is illegal by the uk ' s distance_selling regulation .

2	watch out for these_guys !
2	think i have had a lucky_escape .
0	i ' ve made many orders with ebuyer , they offer good prices on office furniture and okay shipping times .
2	very good quality selection and service !

0	gumtree is a eager company with a high ambition .
2	only ordered this giant front fender on sunday_evening , and it
0	however baffling is that have been using my address to shop online and receive stuff all over europe and the us .
0	i am writing a review as online reviews for lenders are important for other customers .
2	it worked !
0	i was kept fully up to date with right up to the point of dispatch .
2	i must pass on my experience of buying an lg soundbar from a company called crampton and moore .
0	its a rip_off !!
2	i decided to go with fonebank who were offering £_00 or a £_00 amazon voucher .
0	what more can you ask for ?
2	i have noticed that the website hasn_'_t really kept up with the technology and is now starting to look a bit old and clunky .
0	the first order contained a copy of microsoft windows 0 and a cooler master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
2	i placed the order online with a 00 - 00 day delivery on 0th_september and on chasing the order today , which is the 00th_september i am told the sent me an e_- mail on the 0th_september advising that delivery would be 0 - 0 weeks and because they never_heard back they never did anything with the order .
0	the website was easy to navigate and i liked that it had no booking_fee .
0	this company does not have a proper number to call !
2	their packaging for original shipment was not up to the standard that they demand from customers who wish to retun an item , a poor approach with such delicate high - value products .
2	delivery time is second to none .
2	on the viagogo website it only said that my ticket purchases were " pending confirmation ".
0	then it was " before 0 ."
0	ordered the last two flight cases from this company and the service has been fantastic .
2	i therefore cancelled my policy but of course the online quotation wouldn_'_t say if i would be owed or if i would owe money .
2	this us my local restaurant but i am continually being short changed on the coffee sizes .
2	i ordered 0 packs of 0 filters = 00 .
2	ordered usb_cable 00th_december and promised delivery within 0 working_days .
2	make_sure you are on the electoral register if you plan on hiring a car .
0	i paid extra for the priority service and it was delivered extremely quickly .
2	some nice clothes average pricing , checkouts always manned not as good as m & s , some of the clothes do not fit as well , make you look one hundred at the age of 00 .
0	the money was taken at the time of order yet even after 0 weeks + there is no sign of it .
2	ordered an item on 00th_feb , asked for confirmation of dispatch as it was to norway , nothing .
2	having said that , they were efficient in offering an_alternative and that arrived very quickly and well_packaged , plus zero hassle with the refund of the difference in price .

2	worst company i have ever_dealt_with
2	pedalon advertised a good price and provided a prompt service .
2	fab idea , flowers were beautiful , delivery bit worrying as to office address and then noticed they deliver up to 0pm !
0	their website is easy to book on and they don ' t take any booking_fee which is a bonus compared to hostelworld , whose charges are pretty high .
2	you will find lots of counterfeit stuff on the site but this shouldn ’ t come as too much of a surprise as the site itself is effectively a counterfeit ebay - they even have a dispute resolution centre !
2	i said that i wanted this before wednesday the following week and they said that would be arranged .

0	ordered my skis on sunday 0rd apr as they were the only one i could find that had k0 one luv .
0	i booked them in march - a month_ago .
2	in hindsight i should have phoned up to check - a bit disappointed and somewhat annoyed .
0	i called away0 as i had been to vegas before and the trip was booked through them although i never deal with them directly , it was done through a friend .
2	i have used them before several_times - not these days
2	totally_unacceptable !
0	this was utter hell , and yes , late charges were applied to this too !
0	it all stinks of misinformation and im none the wiser

0	booked my appointment online , 00_mins later got a phone call to confirm tyre choice and size correct for make and model of car .
2	overall excellent .
0	i then had to ring the takeaway place who said they are delivering the order and to ignore just_eat as they had asked them to get this sorted many_times .
0	which is ok but it takes considerably more time , this isn ' t just go to the front_desk , " sign here " " there ' s your stuff " and gone in less_than a minute .
2	the futon it self is wafer thin and very uncomfortable .
0	great site
0	even more reason to book directly with airlines .
0	they dispatched my order the same day i ordered and gave me a £_00 voucher for free .
2	as we had chosen the " hotel " due to its location and convenience , we decided to stay there and await for our complaint to do the rounds inside expedia and in hope of a refund .

0	play - asia is a great website as it stocks a lot of difficult to get items in europe , the prices are a little_steep but i suppose if you are looking for hard to get items then you have to expect a price hike .

0	i had to phone call them the next_day asking about the order because i received no email to confirm my order .
2	i would certainly order from them again , no_complaints whatsoever .
2	given that the issues quoted their expertise in their furniture should have made them realise that a french_polisher would be required , so why was one not booked to come with the senior technician ?
2	an extremely professional , knowledgeable , helpful & pleasent company to deal with .
2	when i asked if i could use it online of course the answer is no !!

0	i was not offered a replacement product ( even_though scan had taken my money ) and was told if i wanted a replacement , i ' d have to pay the difference or have a full_refund .

0	thank_you !!
0	don ' t reward them with your business .
0	very disappointed .
2	very easy site to use and perhaps the most_important aspect of hostelbookers is the trust that i am being given the best value accommodation on offer at that time so no need to trawl_through loads of sites to get the best price .
2	initially i chose this company because , unlike many others , they will do lenses as strong as i need .
2	so an order that was supposed to go out and was at one stage ready for despatch but not sent was re - opened , a card_reader included , re - packed moved to priority despatch then mysteriously disappears .
0	if you contact the livechat the operator will give you with a $ 0 ( or £ 0 . 00 ) money off code when you spend over $_00 .
2	would highly_recommend this company to all znd will for sure be using again .
0	could not have asked for a better service .
0	and a bag .
2	what a bunch of wasters .
2	this is a good website for finding deals and offers that you would never had known about .
0	i recently applied for a same day visa in croydon home office using imperial_visas & i am very satisfied with them .
0	they do not state anywhere that this surcharge is non - refundable - so after arguing with a belligerent customer support agent ( who i later found out was a senior_manager and owner .) for twenty minutes and threatening various actions they finally_agreed to refund my money i was rightfully owed !
2	this was a good but basic flight , went to benidorm , not a lot of space for your legs but there was refreshments on board !
0	i rang talktalk today and the guy said they had still not received the box but he would ring me when they do . he said talktalk don ' t have an_email address for me to contact them but i told him i refuse to ring them again .
0	overall i think they are a good company but as with all courier companies the customer_service is pretty poor .
2	i had to contact them to find out where item was , they said item had been sold in store on saturday , i bought item on the previous friday .
2	all i asked for was one replacement seat panel .
0	i phone them the next_day only to be told there must ' ve been a booking error and what day did i want to reschedule .
2	it is now 0pm and i am still_waiting for a call and my husband is still stuck indoors .
0	i then tried a local_garage and they found that they have broken one of my ht leads which connects to the spark plug but still forced it in place .
2	shame !
0	put simply , this business could easily double its revenue by making a few simple adjustments .
2	eddie pier
2	got the phone back today , powered it up and inserted my sim_card . it read it straight_away and the phone is in perfect working order !!
2	i bought a couple of inner tubes ( wildtrak 000x00 / 00c ) which arrived within days of ordering and was well_packaged so could fit through my letterbox .
0	i cannot understand how a multi million pound company can treat a customer this way and is allowed to continue to do so .
2	if you find anything wrong , no matter how small , no matter what the delivery_men advise . refuse to accept delivery and make them take the whole lot back .
2	since 00st_july i have been fobbed_off with many excuses , the last one via_email last wednesday apologising (!)
2	i will_continue to use this company on many more occasions without a doubt .
0	this isn ' t really a hop on hop off service , there aren ' t enough vehicles for that .
2	this is when we found all the crap spread over the rest of the house along with mastic spread all over the frames and window revels .
0	the cost of the costume was great and it fit_perfectly too .
0	i phoned again in the evening and they actually gave me the drivers number and when i spoke to her i was told after a large huff that she had just been in my area and that she had finished work for the day !!
0	i have now cancelled the order rather_than have any more poor service , lack of information , and general incompetence .
2	only use the site now when not in any hurry for goods .
0	please stay_away from this business , yet are a joke .
0	disgusting customer care and awful service i would not recommend buying from this company due to mistakes and bad service i am £_00 out of pocket and i am still without a sink i will never buy from them again as my custom was truly not appreciated and £_00 was a shocking goodwil gesture for mistakes and stress
0	this company is part of an organisation that owns many bad carparking companies .
0	he them made up some rubbish about how it is not like for like so he cannot carry the deposit over so their is cancellation charge of £_000 it was rubbish excuse after rubbish excuse .
0	dpd came the next_day and then took the pc , the day after to my horror i get an_email_saying that the motherboard was damaged with pictures to prove it , i got angry because i was adamant that i had not damaged the motherboard and blamed them .
0	a sham of a company .
2	there used to be a price range selection - where is it ?
0	loving all the fake 0 * reviews by people who only have ever written this one amazing review .
2	i am probably the sort of person who struggles with the impersonal nature of this type of transaction and would have much preferred to pick_up the item from the newbury warehouse where i could have had a conversation with a human_being .
2	purchased ajax tickets and was gutted to find out after spending money on flights and hotel to find the tickets were fake and lost a lot of money .!!!
2	!
0	easy to use and compare places to stay .
0	so thats a good 0 % saving for me .
2	if the venue does not allow a third_party pick_up then the only way is for the original buyer to attend the box office and get the tickets and then give them to you .
2	went online and ordered some lenses ( no facing about with having to contact my opticians for my prescription , which is always time - consuming ) and they turned_up the following_morning !
0	later that afternoon i visited my local cpwh store and explained the problem and the sales_person seemed helpful and gave me a new handset as there may have been a fault causing the internet not to load and other faults , she phoned tmobile who said that their systems were down and to call back in an_hour so naturally my partner and i paced the town_centre for an_hour and then went back into store to be greeted_by the same lady as before , she phoned tmobile who again said that this number was not linked to my name and in fact somebody_else ' s .
0	can ' t fault the service or products one bit , fantastic !
2	my only concern with using many companies is t &_c stating check item before signing ? the carrier will not allow you to open package until you sign for it so we will need some legal work done on this ( am investigating ) and would therefore reject the item unless i can open it before signing .
2	not surprisingly i have now closed the direct_debit but have attempted to contact them with no success both by phone and email .
2	simple to post and immediate payment into account .
2	use ryanair quite often as it gets me from a - b cheaply and on most of my business trips that '_s all i require .
0	gave my ps0 to him and he fixed it perfectly in an 0 hour and 00_mins and showed me it worked_perfectly .
2	they are not as cheap as you can find elsewhere .
0	this brand of printing . com ( chilli cactus ) basically informed us that he was going on holiday for two_weeks the morning he went on holiday and that we wouldn ' t be able to collect the work from him .
0	a very unhappy customer and will not be using ever again .
0	i feel virgin has gone down_hill . most red hots are in slots or casino . red_hot wednesday aint has exciting anymore rarely see the big house ' s only great thing about the red_hot ' s is the free bingo being more in enterprise than adventure . i feel this site needs to relook at there red_hot ' s and bring more bingo red hots back and less casino or slots . i use to reccomend this site to my friends and family but now i would reccomend they stay_away sorry to say
2	booket one week accommodation in rio de janeiro through expedia . co . uk .
0	but of course , they won ' t speak with me regarding this .
0	easy to use on line shopping and yes , the favourites bit is helpful , but i feel that delivery charges are unreasonable when you a purchasing a ' big shop '.
0	j - l
2	the first plaque arrived with a flaw in the slate .
0	i don ' t know it it was their way of getting more business , or if they genuinely thought something was wrong with the phone ; but i find this very hard to comprehend .
2	hopefully the products are ok .
0	i have had the carpet for about a year and it is ruined .
2	tenants can '_t find upload documents section , so they have to email separately .
0	if something isn ' t right , they refund / exchange really easily and have never had a problem with them at all !
2	my order arrived really quickly , and i was so impressed that i was straight back on line to order another .
2	to all ,
0	cd_key warehouse is probably your best bet when it comes to cd_keys .
0	voucher_code : q0000e - 0pfhhq
0	they did not do anything to help or offer me and alternative .
2	you often don_’ t get the same technician so you end up having to explain it all over again and again again until your tearing out the last bit of tuft hair in your head .

2	however on receipt of the item and on putting it together we noticed that 0 of the pieces was wrong and the kitchen could not be used .
0	regardless of whether this woman likes her job or not she could at_least put some effort into it .
2	take a big fat wallet if you are thinking of having a few drinks .
0	and my product was absolutly fine .
0	brilliant website found it super easy to find the exact sunglasses both me and my hubby were after .
2	and as the idea to treat her was a last_minute i was praying for a speedy delivery .
0	i did not have this luxury
0	lauren_w of parcel0go . com was amazingly helpful she helped sort out my problem so quickly and efficiently she is a credit to the company .
0	the shipping was quite fast , considering that i ordered from italy and it took only 00 days to deliver .
0	i ordered a game from here , it took_forever to get to me despite what the website said .
0	however , one of my customers cancelled their order so i attempted to cancel collection of the package .
2	delivery company send you an_email and you ring back if not ok .
0	have had many great experiences but they completely screwed up one of my christmas_presents when they sent me a watch that had clearly been used and returned ( it was scratched and had a flat battery ).

0	easy site to use and give the best prices out there .
2	then a few_days_later it turns up looking like it has_been run over by a bus !
0	thanks
0	the reviewing system i ' ve found to be very reliable , and the website seems to find cheap prices which other comparison_sites don ' t pull up .
2	if i hadn_'_t been tied into a contract i would have moved my account some where else .
0	every_single day i have to deal with my eyes stinging and feeling achy and tired .
0	i let her know that her selling techniques were a underhand and that she didn ' t mention any of the costs involved / direct_debit before asking for the account details .
0	i was working at maplin ' s and they have great customer_services but if you are wanting products cheap avoid them ;)
2	on return , car staff disinterested and advised me that i had to park car in bay before he could check it .

2	nothing arrived .
2	very unapologetic e_- mail saying that the money would be refunded !
2	i placed my order and the money was taken immediately and the status of the order on their website changed to ordered .
2	bottom_line is pay 00 quid and the phone will be unlocked but be prepared to wait . this is not something that happens quickly .
2	she was very helpful and gave me the information quickly .
2	this company is to be avoided in my opinion .
2	always efficient and when they didn_'_t have a product i ordered emailed me and suggested an excellent alternative .
0	once a myprotein representative has replied , the query changes to completed even_though it hasn ' t been answered and i am still_awaiting information .
2	and of course you can pay for extra leg - room .
2	up until last_year travelodge were as cheap as chips , they then suddenly decided to change tack and charge us slightly less_than the nearest budget hotel in your chosen area hence the massive price rises that you see today . their sale days used to cause the server to crash as you picked_up rooms for £ 0 ,£ 00 ,£ 00 and £_00 , but not any longer £_00 is the cheapest you will find and some in london are ridiculous prices . some hotels are brand_new and some have been refurbished but the untouched ones aren_'_t worth £_00 a night as everything is so dated in them . i have recently used ibis hotels which are cheaper_than travelodge and give free internet in the room .
2	i '_ve just booked a hotel in nice for 0 nights that was £_000 cheaper
0	i ' m looking_forward to the delivery of my new ct !

0	they collected my laptop on a friday and i had a call on the monday to tell me that they had received my laptop and would like to pay me the amount that they had quoted .
2	they did everything for me .
2	click & collect works well on their site but furniture delivery can be a bit of a nightmare .
0	i booked some tickets to see pat metheny at the hammersmith apollo in june .
0	we chose the ash because is seemed a closer match to the light oak laminate it was to be paired with than the oak version .
0	by the way , in relation to the phone_calls , don ' t bother ringing them , it simply a voicemail message_telling you to email them . now thats customer_service .
2	what appears to be good value offered but , after i paid , i received a call to say that the tyres i wanted were unavailable , despite_being shown on the website .
2	money has always been taken but it doesn_'_t seem to trigger the delivery .
0	i shall be happy to book for my tickets and holiday again with ebookers in the future and would also recommend ebookers to my family , friends and colleagues who has not heard of ebookers before .

2	i had problems booking a hotel online . ended_up with 0 hotel bookings for the same dates .
0	i came home in the late_afternoon to find it had been delivered as my brother had signed for the package .
2	i realise that these latches aren_'_t the dearest in the world but they should all operate properly - in my opinion ironmongery_direct have a fairly serious quality_control issue with the latch manufacturer that needs urgent attention .
2	i was kept_updated at every_stage ,
2	goods delivered in excellent condition and on time as requested .
0	my bridesmaid who arranged everything had alot of problems with contact - she did a lot of chasing up responses and correcting errors .
2	while i was browsing around their site i found the odd typo which i mentioned to my chat friend - and the errors were corrected immediately !
2	disappointing .
2	code : ha000 - 000
2	i gather that the shop is better_than their on - line presence .
0	i recommend e learning really good price easy to do and a certificate to prove you have completed the course amazing
2	one , the samsung_galaxy_s0 mini , was for me , and it came with a 0 year_warranty .
2	we knew it was going to be hard to build initially , but all went well , just took time .
2	professional quality .
2	after checking my credit_card account to make_sure they hadn_'_t charged me twice , i must_admit i was really tempted to go to the store to see if they did indeed have a duplicate order for me , and if they were daft enough to give it to me .
2	however , the previous review , in which i ' d given one star to a mobile_phone unlocking service and explained my bad_experience , had been blocked .
2	i complained to prestige_flowers and had to send a couple of photo '_s .
0	the product was very cheap for the services it provides and when i called student_computers , instead of flogging off their more_expensive items , they directed me towards this cheaper version which actually was better in performance .
2	he has no_idea what is going on and hides behind that as an excuse .
0	you order things , and days_later after chasing , they finally tell you it ' s out of stock and you ' ll get a refund , ok , that would be fine if , they didn ' t have multiple companies around the uk that they own , doing the exact_same_thing !
2	superb as a part of a cheeseboard , a filling for celery sticks and wonderful stuffed in a pork fillet , and roasted !!
2	she - ' well perhaps they '_ve gone home early '
2	they were picked_up on the 00th_november , plenty of time you would think for christmas .
2	can '_t possibly accurately rate a product like this unless i have to claim which i '_ll probably never do so the 0_stars are purely for cost , purchase process and the fact one can download the documents .
0	after seeing the advert on telly i wanted to join wowcher and see what ' s on offer .
0	apart_from that i am satisfied customer .
2	i have now had 0 horrid expericences .
0	the mirror is exactly as ordered .
0	one of the top google suggestions was slrhut .
2	mistakes_happen and she was friendly .
0	i ' ve often shopped with zavvi , as they ' ll post some very competitive offers .
0	excellent quality came individually boxed for protection .
0	my items were not delivered to me .
2	when unpacked 0 item missing
0	exceptionally helpful in getting the delivery made on time by delaying the postal van specifically for my order , good / quick customer support so far in dealing_with a query_regarding the item i bought - a marantz pmd000 .
2	thank_you , ordering was simple , dispatch was very quick and item arrived on the day specified . i would recommend you everyone .
2	engineers not showing up three_times now , uncaring customer service team .
0	i accepted that there would be a delay from their usual 0 - week delivery timeframe and the 00 - week wait that they indicated on their web_site was more_than i ' d have liked but as they were cheap i went for it anyway .
0	i am disappointed that there was a major piece missing to the trampoline and believe this should have been checked prior to delivery .

0	rung up , pleasant lady answered the phone , all went well until i couldn ' t provide other drivers details , was told to ring my insurance to get that info , rang my insurance , not allowed to give it me for data_protection , fair_enough , waited for scheduled call back from nah at 00 . 00 and didn ' t get the call until 00 . 00 .
2	i dont understand_why they use that policy .
0	as well as paying for the tickets i paid over £_00 in booking and postage fees .
2	after more than 0 months , substantial damage to our home , mess and weeks of delays and frustration they still_haven_'_t finsished .
2	excellent service
2	ebay can be very good - as long as you don_'_t have a problem .
2	kitty from london
0	i use it alot to watch gute and funny videos and also listening music .
0	i had to call my customers but i wasn ' t in the uk .
2	i would definitely recommend them .
2	they cannot handle the simplest hotel booking , and when attempted to correct the errors , you might as well be dealing_with martians .
2	i , foolishly , understood that this was the uk division of the company due to their ' co . uk ' internet address but - beware - this is not the case .
0	not only do they have the best prices online , if you can find it cheaper elsewhere they will beat it .
0	will use again .

0	as for the customer_service , i couldn ' t be more impressed with it .

0	when arranging delivery or checking on status of an item the customer_service staff seem to lack any interest at all .

0	i called nabru today about the refund and they said they had refunded £_00 i asked why only £_00 and not £_00 ?

0	[ digiprint supplies ] our sales conditions that you agreed when placing the order don ' t accept order cancellation .

2	they ignored paypal too , so ( eventually ) i got the refund under paypal '_s default system .
2	obviously i complained and cancelled my direct_debit with first_utility .
2	good communication until the delivery was despatched , then i think they were let_down by yodel .

0	and half the phone call was having a nice moaning session about the post service .

0	i can recommend them for cheap flights but not for some planned vacation because they rarely refund or anything_else like that .
0	even worse , they dare to charge £_00 for " delivery " and told me that if i wanted to cancel and get a refund , the delivery charge would not be refunded !
0	good luck , their website is hit and miss .
2	we have had to wait between 0 weeks and 0 month for all deliveries and had to chase them up for it .
0	when i phoned to ask about it , i was promised an_email to let me know , which never materialised .

0	highly_recommended .
2	no card or explanation and no_idea how long they had been there .

0	you ' ll be seeing them on watchdog soon !
0	!
0	i know now that once my contract is up unless they can offer me a better deal or match what i can purchase elsewhere they will be loosing another loyal paying customer !
2	i think their customer appreciation stinks and if i could i would rate this company as zero , but unfortunately the lowest score i can give them is a 0 .
0	now a whole week after that i finally received my order .
0	first review which i posted 0th_oct and reflected my previous experiance of parcel0go follows .

0	delivery men saying that they knocked when they didn ' t , leaving expensive goods literally on the door_step , despite the fact the path across the front of our house is used by everyone living on the street , and even deliveries not showing up at all .
0	great firewall , great av , great sandbox , great kiosk , great behavior shield , diagnostic tool usseful , great detection and repation rating , and instantanly support ( not the best but instantanly ).
2	it took 0 emails to get a clear response .
2	the clothes were fantastic value and quality .
0	i would recommend anyone_wanting to recycle their old_mobiles to use this site .
0	the only little thing that was a little uncomfortable - i couldn ' t find a way to look for specific hostel at the site , but sure that there are an option for it .
0	mine did , it was a hard case hand_luggage . but when we got there they had those ridiculous trolley cages that ryanair do that almost always inevitably proves hard to fit a suitcase in .
2	have written to kenwood , but they just stick their heads in the sand and come out with the usual mantra " no one else has complained ".
2	the price is reasonably competitive with the other online streaming offerings available in the uk but there just is no comparison on quality , lovefilm fails and it fails on choice too .
0	on the morning of wednesday 00th i submitted another email to iflorist as again the live_chat feature was unavailable .
2	00 minute job .
2	good price for jacket with delivery a week from dispatch however wanted to return an item and e_- mailed to receive a return order number received an_automated_response to say i would receive a return order number before i could proceed , and 0 week_later still no response despite e_- mailing again
0	again , answered within the hour with the promise to immediately send me a replacement .
2	this was my first experience of using this service , & it did serve me well .
2	however it is not possible to save a partial calendar and return later to finish it .
0	it sould have arrived as stated the next_day .
0	with a 0 year_old and 0 year_old at 00pm this is difficult - especially when it says transfer is 00_mins ( which it was when we finally got going )!
2	what i am not happy with is that delivery of the replacement cistern follows the normal delivery course , ie about five days .
0	customer_services provided no help .
0	i followed the advice put on this review site that said boohoo have their own face book page , i also wrote on this and yet again have had no response .
2	i really am shocked by this and i am investigating further with regards to my statutory_rights as the item delivered was not as_described and should be replaced and i certainly should not be expected to repair it .
0	budget_air is terribly slow at getting back to me ( i first contacted them at dec 00th and it usually takes them 0 - 0days to write back to me , until now , my issue has not been sorted )
2	heart operations has found it to be the most suitable rollator and has not stopped
0	essentially this company has stolen £_00 from me .
2	however , when assembling the kennel , i was disappointed to find that the fixing screws were not in the delivery box .
2	john_lewis
0	so i am happy with the way they dealt_with my complaint and hope they will keep improving their services .
2	there '_s absolutely no atmosphere to be found anywhere on board and it feels_like travelling on a ghost ship .
2	never had any_problems with either .
2	he was then " unavailable " despite ups useless customer_services saying they were " trying to contact him " .
2	look at all the other reviews for city_link , what a terrible company record , so bad i suspect the only good reviews are from their employees paid to do so .
2	the entire spare support system for the hummer is a mess - i cannot vouch for other models .
0	and why did they confirm dates if they couldn ' t honour the delivery ?
2	no mention from alpha_batteries why i had something different from what i asked for !
2	don_'_t trust them .
0	spoke to two customer_service staff and they were very friendly , helpful and professional , i am very pleased to see their high_quality of customer_service .
0	so i chose iflorist because the flowers looked beautiful and this is the first time i have ordered flowers online .
0	no it was a 0 :_00am pick_up on a lovely smart mini_bus and we made good time to the airport and where there for 0am .
0	so if not in a rush defiantly order from these_guys .
2	i love shopping with stone_bridge hair accessories - there '_s something for everyone , including me with my unruly , " mind of their own " curls .
0	i then discovered the raid enclosure itself had been badly handled by god_knows who and had scratches all over it .
2	the surgery in london was packed and it was one in one out .
0	i don ' t think i ' ll ever go anywhere_else for my supplement_needs !

0	excellent seller !
2	on 00 november i ordered a hamper for my sister and nieces through ihampers , a subsidiary of iflorist .
0	a lot of netflix content are tv_shows from channel 0 ( such as the inbetweeners and shameless ) which are available to watch for free on channel 0 ' s steaming site , so not sure why you would need a paid for account on netflix to watch them .
2	signing out for good .
0	:)
2	ordered carpet_runner got message out of stock waiting for delivery , got it about a week_later , but worth the wait , looks very nice

2	in short we need the call_centres here in the uk not india !
0	i received my pc within a few_days of ordering and using the free shipping option which was impressive .
2	they had had my device for over two and half months and nothing has_been done !
0	this time the courier routed the package incorrectly and it took a further ten_days to arrive .
0	totally abusive , cheeky , sarcastic and offensive .
0	it only takes seconds to find out that something was delivered and to pick_up by anyone walking by .
0	i received another phone call today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) from emilie to update me and said that the full_refund had been put back on my credit_card , so i checked . and yes , a full_refund was back on my credit_card .
2	very frustrating experience but credit where it is due , they are trying to put things right now .
0	i have used wowcher twice .
2	thought i would give asos a try and ordered 0 items .
0	i know they had only attempted the delivery once as the one dated the 00nd , they had left the barcode tear off at the bottom of the card ( they would normally scan this and take it away to prove their driver had attempted delivery ).
2	achica owe me £_000 which i still have not received .
0	the tv_unit was out of stock when ordered so delivery was longer_than usual , but worth the wait .
2	it seems to me that the accepted rules of the gumtree jungle if you ' re a buyer is that you ignore what people put down in terms of price and frankly people don_'_t read what you write .
2	this is quite clearly a planned tactic by simply_electronics to ' borrow ' your money for as long as they can get away with and presumably make interest on it .
0	i got my wine , delivered by another company , and the supplier dropped citylink as well .
2	they did eventually offer a full_refund of the purchase price but only a small_amount would be available straight_away and i would have to stump up the rest of the cash to buy a replacment at a greater price from them .
2	well , it has_been 0 days so far and still it is pending confirmation .
2	have used them on a number of occasions and i have to say the service has_been exemplary .
2	the item is now too late for an event .
2	rang cs number several_times over a two day period .
0	complete_joke
2	all good .
2	in the end we agreed to the refund , have ordered another one off the website , which we are hoping may even be delivered the same day as the other items are collected and replaced !
0	very fast delivery and easy to navigate through the website !
0	i got a very bland reply back saying " the order has been sent royal_mail second class delivery which takes 0 - 0 working_days .
0	!
2	unless you pay by cash then don_'_t bother .
0	and usually when that happens , rm will leave a note to tell the customer what is happening with your parcel .
2	are you mad !!!!!!!!
0	first off wow !
0	no telephone_number to actually speak to someone on hdnl website apart_from the useless rescheduling line , though fortunately i managed to get hold of two different depot numbers from some nice people on the web for my nearest depot .

0	honestly i was sceptical of what i will be buying as the cost was the cheapest .
2	thank_you gear0music .
2	maybe he wont be quite so quick in future to treat people in the manner in which he treated me , but then maybe i '_ll win the lottery this week !
2	i discovered this company on line .
0	no .
2	only problem was .
0	i ' m not really a fan of baught pizza ( i like to make my own ) but , i rate them higher_than puppa johns and pizza_hut but we have a good selection of local pizza companies offering a better range and usually better quality pizza ' s for much lower prices .
2	i was able to order a kitchen that fitted my space better_than i could find from any other diy source at a very competitive price .
2	cover appears to be the same as that offered by other_companies .
2	ok not rocket_science , but why the hell didn_'_t they just tell me that on the phone days ago !!!!!
2	unfortunately my 00 year_old mother is not tech - savvy so customer ' service ' refused to take any further action .
2	the person is of average height etc but the top may as well have been a bra top . quite a lot shorter than_expected .
2	all i want is my repair money refunded and my property back or my glasses replaced but am getting_nowhere .
0	whether your a professional athlete or an amateur gym go - er not only is there kit stylish but also fully_functional .

2	i found this really good website iflorist , it was so easy to use , you simply must try them
2	00p a minute to land lines in the uk shocking
0	the go - karting itself was brilliant fun on the day and everything was ready for our arrival .
0	i think its ridiculous that you have to pay £ 0 . 00 a month then another £ 0 . 00 to watch one episode or £_00 . 00 to get the boxset or £ 0 . 00 to watch a movie its ridiculous , this new prime thing is just terrible i don ' t see the point on keeping it running when you can go to netflix and watch unlimited movies and tv_programmes for only £ 0 . 00 a month .
2	the staff in the shop could not care_less so i shall use another phone with my sim_card and not give them any more of my money .
2	but if i book through holiday_autos web_site , i want my car from them and not hertz , olympic or someone i '_ve never_heard of .
0	great free_stuff
0	i insisted this was not my phone but they had confirmed they had received it with my tracking ref etc .
0	plus , it would have been better to know it was out if stock before i ordered .
2	definitely_use upad again .
2	cheers
2	goods fairly_priced , but then postage on top .
0	id :_0000000
0	that is pretty bad going .
2	there is no vat chargeable in guernsey and this was removed automatically once my postal_address was entered .
2	the lady_who came on later in day was a joy and sorted the towels out and got us a nice arm chair and more beverages .
0	they have not sent my item bought on the 00th of jan .
0	he said i had been charged for next_day delivery instead , i was furious .
0	the website is a great idea keep intouch with friends and family but the website is too well_known for its drama , bulling and jeremy kyle .
2	btw the car i purchased has also developed a fault since purchase it looks_like the dual mass flywheel is failing and according to people who i have spoken to this would have been noticeable at a service ( which was supposedly done just before i picked_up the vehicle )
2	however , do not attempt to purchase from them unless through paypal / credit_card or some other means of getting your money back .
2	i am in dispute with them via barclaycard for £_000 where they took my money when the goods were discontinued and have not refunded after multiple attempts / methods of engagement .
2	i was looking for a portable record player for my husband who is in a residential home .
2	strange as i was told last_week that my order was due to be delivered on 00th_may .
0	all companies that show up under their " compare " are part of their " group " of scam companies .
2	got my glasses this morning and love them !
2	very fast service , excellent
2	call on 0000 costs but the support is good and to the point .
2	now i had it , i will now give sainsbury a chance and suggest everybody_else does the same .
2	it has_been my misfortune to have recently had dealings with this company .
0	angry , upset and disappointed !!!
2	yet again ( 0rd time ) i had to register all my details when i know they should be present as i have ordered parts several_times from nitrotek before .
2	one we have found , it is well balanced and easy to put in the car .
2	they tend to send you standard " cut and paste " answers - not really reading the question you have asked .
2	without paying a high price to call sky , which many people are unprepared to do , it is very hard to get in touch with sky unless you ' re happy to deal with a non uk_based centre ( which i ' m not ).
0	if you order or pre order an item if it doesn ' t turn_up they do absolutely nothing this has happened to me a few_times in a few_years worth of shopping there .
2	00 / 0 / 00 i still havent had an_email_confirming they got my letter ( that they signed for on the 00th of may ) after they get that i know they will allow themselves another 00 working_days before they might make the payment and that can apparently take up to 00 working_days .
2	every little hurts as this monster forces smaller shops off the high_street and makes other_supermarkets drag their values and quality down to compete with tesco '_s base levels .
0	have nothin but problems using this app when using my mobile data .
0	all the wood slats remained intact , but some of the metal had been poorly soldered together , and had snapped right along the middle .
2	didn_'_t think they were value for the money £_00 would have been a most fare price .
2	ville klart handle der igen !
2	!. but it shows it works folks !!.
2	as said , with careful checking before buying you will avoid hassle and has to be said that there are not many venues and events that print names on tickets and then match them with photo id at the point of entry - just takes too long and is way to much hassle for them to do this .
2	we ' d lost our exit ticket but that wasn_'_t a problem .
0	" biggest cowboy outfit isp award "?
2	however its a post_code test and doesn_'_t use your logon so its never going to be the best test .
2	i was kept_informed at all_stages of the transaction and the price was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
2	after looking around at my regular suppliers online stores , i decided to try proviation for my next new bit of kit ( a £_000 radio .)
0	the only detailed_information on the site was how to download illegally hacked software .

0	they kept in the website a product that was also .
2	00 / 00 / 00
2	try them and see
2	that '_s it , your currency sorted .
2	when you can '_t physically walk into a store and complain you stand a chance in being treated like dirt .
2	they organised the appointment on a day suitable to me and kept all their promises .
2	was apprehensive buying on line as was unsure of quality , but very impressed .
2	they wanted proof of purchase !
2	even_though i had contacted solwise for advice as the device was faulty within the 0st year , because when i returned the device 0 weeks_later to them it was 0 weeks over the 0 year_warranty they refused to replace the device as it was not repairable .
2	- never had a landline problem ( but pricey )
0	except at my home , but i do now have a home booster kit that they offer for free :)
0	want to be spoken to in a rude and abrupt manner from so called " customer_services "?

0	over the last couple of years i have placed 00 or so orders with shopto . net .
0	has been 0 weeks and it still_hasn ' t arrived .
0	now my review stands out .
0	unfortunately one of the headlamps was out , but we got it fixed at a local_garage and was refunded the cost .
2	this is the worst service i ever came_across - please [_external_reference_removed ], stick to [_external_reference_removed_] or [_external_reference_removed_]
0	we went to passport control and the queue was very long and was mixing in with lines in check in desks .
2	i wouldnt recommend this outfit to my own worst enemies they couldnt give a damn about loyalty to customers and they really dont realise that without us they wont continue in business .
0	in the end the problem was not in my house but with their own equipement .
0	i think this was kind of a waste of time as visa is an universal credit_card and it works everywhere_else just fine .
2	requested refund which arrived some days_later .
0	i wouldn ' t have the patience to serve all those people if i was a stewardess , my only complaint is that the seats are so small in economy , otherwise it was ok .
0	if only all webshops were more like webtogs !
0	a really helpful company who deliver well_packaged , timely , quality products .
2	however had no delivery of first order due to yodel not delivering it and then sadly had to wait nearly a week before a replacement was sent .
0	not sure i will want to shop here anymore , god_knows_how ill this could of made my kids and me .
0	?
2	i asked to be put through to a supervisor and he just kept repeating on and on over me .
2	on checking credit_card statement we now find that an additional fee of r000 . 00 for petrol has_been charged .
0	good service but products a little hit or miss .
0	the looks were sharp and sporty so it had plenty of appeal !
2	this company to me is the best and easiest holiday insurance company to deal with online and i have never even had to speak to them .
0	i have never had any complaint .
2	not sure at this stage if this order will work .
2	having been a good customer for christmas and birthday cards i am very disappointed by this shoddy service .
0	they ' re always failry upto - date on music release , and give accurate estimations on forthcoming music .
2	this has_been the worst on - line buying experience i have ever had .
0	apart_from that , i enjoy shopping with you , but i get seriously cross when i ' m not respected by you .
0	- i have never personally encountered a poor juddery connection over the past 0 years of using this service but then i guess this is subjective to the models connection , server location and its upstream providers to your isp .
2	so picked one that could pick_up and deliver when i needed .
0	should sort out there voucher situation !
2	no answer to my numerous_emails . tried there online help service . thats a joke . and as for tying to get an answer on the phone . am i sick of hearing ' i ' m sorry ' etc . will just have to order them from elsewhere and take the financial hit . lesson_learned . never use this company .
2	he listens to us , our ideas and any concerns , making helpful suggestions all the way .
2	!
2	seems like they do not have as good a range of products as local b_& q oulets
0	they will go out of there way for you .
0	would def use this service again
2	i was quite cross by now .
0	thats it , all good , no_complaints ( they are probably saving my waistline not having the chocolate in stock !)
0	only thing i think could be improved is have the pencyclopedia section easier to find for newcomers , perhaps listed clearly on the home page , apart_from that everything else is perfect .
0	been trying to get my refund ever since and on monday they told me my refund had been processed into my account , it is now friday an there is still no sign of it !
2	postscript : shortly_after posting the above review , the owner of shoetique contacted me to apologise .
2	might try to change eventually , but being leds with a long life seems a shame to scrap them , and they do not fit any other of our lamps .
0	hi after purchasing from savewatersavemoney i found it nice and smooth to use and the mobile site has been designed well too it was easy to show my girlfriend future_purchases whilst out and about and we now have a good selection for our new property in the summer
2	jeg_har flere gange beklaget mig til personalet over at der bl . a mangler fedt til silde maden . svaret er for det meste ," vi kan ikke tilgode se alle kundernes behov ".
0	i got so upset and said " ok , charge my card 000 € i don ' t want to pay for insurance ", the lady was obviously not expecting this response and said that debit_cards cannot be charged 000 € and literally forced me to take up the insurance !
2	conclusion . results can '_t be trusted 000_%.
0	i was very happy to receive my full ultegra group set and pedals within 00_hours of ordering them .
0	they didnt seem to care , but i was told there had been a system error and that my parcel would be here monday0th / tuesday0th .
0	i ' ve had mine for just over a year and they ' re not as great as i thought , definitely not worth the price you pay .
2	just eat is so handy , all my local takeaways in one place , let '_s me choose easily , and ordering is so simple too .
0	i usually have no problem with chemical except with this order and a few others .
0	pestered me for 00p when i ' d set_up direct_debit which they accidentally cancelled - damaging my credit score !
0	the whole website makes it really easy to find what you are looking for , and it was super easy and hassle - free !
2	. had to sit for 00_mins until car was ready , left the airport at 0000 ( still dark ).
2	no tasty little nibbles for the customer to try either .
2	go out and grab yourself a set - you '_ll not regret it !
2	die bedienung wer dann zwar " umständlich " und dauerte noch einmal fast 00 minuten , war fachlich aber i . o .
0	i was disappointed at the quility of the book i received .
2	love , love , love this shop !
2	phone arrived but delivery refused .
2	i was a little_sceptical as others have reviewed , but no need to be . i was drawn to the currency_club through a money search_engine , and many good reviews . the best rate that i could find on the day and other days , better_than my bank and local eurochange . ordered on saturday lunchtime and received euros on tuesday_lunchtime .
2	my wife was given the task of finding good quality tiles at a reasonable price and to my surprise that is exactly_what she did via tile hq .
2	i had to make changes to my pick_up & drop_off times & they were done quick & easy .
0	i have ordered from overclockers several_times over the years , often buying complete new pcs from there .
0	please everyone , imagine those emotionless staff working at the customs at an airport , or someone who has depression working at a ticket office .
0	it would have been nice if the company had actually contacted me and made me aware of the delay at_least once throughout the three_weeks , instead of me having to call them numerous_times .
2	dreadful call_centre wait times - held on for 00_minutes today ( after the initial message said wait times were around 00 min ).
2	however when they arrived , they did so with indicators .
0	worst company i have come_across .
0	then when checking the very dented and scratched car over we discovered the oil light was on .
0	erything put_together makes it really expensive .
0	i rang and was told my phone was out of warranty , at the store and was initially sent to the repair_centre for a cracked_screen .
0	ridiculously_expensive i don ' t know how they justify their prices .
2	it is not a fibre - optic network ( as widely advertised ) - bits of it may be , but most of it is the cheapest , nastiest coaxial cable that they could find , and is rapidly rotting , giving all_sorts of intermittent faults and random reductions in their already compromised data rates .
0	the network is always in reach for me and always the fastest 0g internet !
2	because i took a copy of the web_site when it was showing 00 / 0 and now 0 / 0 that now makes the
0	i don ' t have time to send it back , but i suggested to them that rather_than wrapping a piece of cardboard around their boxes which does barely anything to protect them , perhaps bubblewrap would be better .
0	very easy to use , simply printed , posted and got paid !
2	we have never used worldbound before but will now do so for all our future travelling abroad and will have no_hesitation in recommending them to others as we do you who read this review .
0	i had considered selling it on ebay , but the hassle of advertising it , the fees and the risk that the buyer would want to return it just put me off .
2	do not order from here it is all an excuse to expand their data base and spam you !
0	update_:
2	i listened and said that i was interested in a deal .
2	terrible service .
2	they can be contacted even late in the evening with promp phone back service .
2	i also use the preview option to look at the book " as a whole " - for example , my latest boom is a 00th_birthday_present so i wanted to make_sure that the pages follow logically and this is easy to do in the preview .
2	!
0	would like to see them stock schiek training accessories , but that bears no reflection the speedy and satisfactory service .
0	it is safely_say this company has all the incompetent and ignorant sides of royal_mail which in turn is usually an excellent service provider .
0	this seems to be a phoenix company of a similar brand called simplyelectronics . com .
2	i would thouroughly recommend them .
2	these meal replacements are excellent quality and value and indispensable to me in controlling my weight .
0	out of intrest i sent them an_email letting them know i wanted to send my soaking_wet monitor back on friday_morning ( 0nd sept ), and still no response , they will want to courier it back which will take 0 days to arange and a day to take place , at best .
0	they had identity theft protection which i used some of the prevention services of regularly .
0	the story continues . i will update once i hear back from these . should i say it ???
0	the buying experience was okay but once you bought your item you got an_email with instructions on how to track your item and the tracking_system doesnt work .
0	i thought weekends would be the best time for most people to view cars .
2	so now after numerous_emails back and forth i can '_t establish what address they have been delivered to - as it certainly wasn_'_t my friend .
0	in that case , should i want to leave genuine feedback , i would be forced to create a fake facebook profile ( which is just as easy as making a new email ), which undermines the whole point of using facebook logins to avoid fake_reviews .
0	i have sent at_least 00 - 00 parcels via parcel togo and had no_problems with the compant , 0 parcel did take a little longer_than the 0 - 0 days i paid for but i was always greated at the end of the phone by a friendly member of staff that tried their best to help in tracking the parcel and letting me know the status of delivery .
0	after sales is poor , and i ended_up receiving my retention certificate 0 days before it was due to expire ( and that wasn ' t sent special delivery as i asked , or not even recorded ), i have now found out this was extended so that ' s improved things somewhat , but again i found the whole_process very difficult with numerous contact instances on my part .
0	i spotted a smaller kit for £ 0 . 00 , £_00 cheaper .
0	the actually service at dell i don ' t have a problem with .
2	they couldn_'_t refund it unless i sent an_email to cancel .
0	i ordered from elc & explained i lived in a flat for my order to not be left anywhere , but when i got home they had said it was left outside my door , which of course wasn ' t there , why would you leave a big order outside someones door ?!
2	i have had many experiences of the very expensive parcelforce .
0	absolutely_gorgeous and it ' s really really cheap too .
2	the different hirers also have different bureaucracy and some are very old_fashioned and it takes_ages , and you have to repeat information you have already provided .
0	or the fool using it .
0	good pre_- sale customer_service .
0	the camera is better_than_expected and i willl be buying from this website again !
2	very patient and understanding sales_team .
0	made the order for collection , realised our printer didn ' t work , contacting the company via the livehelp , and was assisted extremely quickly by jessica ( which , apparently is her real name ), who sorted everything out for us in around a minute !
0	i happened to have some cash so paid the driver the fee . a few hrs later i got a phone call to say that my online payment had gone_through and so i had now paid twice and that they would refund me but that they could only refund me the card amount so a little less_than they should have refunded me . customer_service was good to try and correct the error but i could have done without the double paying and initial confusion !
0	my 0year old didnt want to go on a bus tour after an experience abroad last_year where we were listening to all different languages and very boring tour , half way round i asked if he wanted to get off ' no way ', so i guess that sums it up .
2	this service was great . everything_went like_clockwork .
0	i hate to say it but sainsburys is too over priced on the leading brand named items .
2	got what i wanted with great customer service .
0	i called them back again .
0	premium features are naturally reserved for paying customers .
2	it '_s fab that you have a plus size category but more size 00 '_s pleasseeee
0	plus , i do manage to find great places to stay for cheap .
2	they have a great variety and i only needed to put a 00_% deposit down where most others want it all paid up front .
0	once more i had to appologise to my neighbours who has got same door number as me as i felt quilty knocking to their doors and begging for a parcel .
0	i know you have to remain competitive , but at_least have some respect for your customers ' intelligence .
0	it took two more weeks in order to get my iphone delivered .
0	if everything was deliverd fine 0st time it would of been 0stars .
2	you will be lucky to find one as they usually send out a generic
0	for an independent , family run business , the vast_range of products they stock is remarkable , definitely spoilt for choice !
2	by the friday , the status of my order was still_showing as " processing " so i thought i would try their live_chat service to find out what was happening .
2	i have contacted their useless customer_services asking for the charges to be refunded but they just keep sending me the same reply - its the charges from your sale which you didnt reply to which we had to find tickets for ????
0	monster_supplements , offer a great range of products all at far lower prices than available in the high_street or indeed almost anywhere_else online .
0	it ' s like queuing up at the cinema to buy a drink , knowing you ' re about to get a good rogering by the cinema staff for what is essentially water ( free ) and sugar ( next to free ).
2	would never use again .
2	they '_ve got my vote , great juice , fast delivery and they have paypal .
0	but ultimately , it just makes me think that if i did place another order with you , i would end up receiving unwanted e_- mail and hassle .
0	the final amount is paid in cash on arrival .
2	then reserve on line , and make additional trip to pick_up at own_expense !
0	so , i truelly really on these_guys to get me preped and ready for my shows !
2	much_cheaper then some of the more known blind companies with no drop in quality .
2	the 000 - reg pricing was good too as i bought during a promotion period .
2	you have no control of which hire company you will be introduced to , many will demand a very high deposit if you do not pay for additional_insurance , this will often not be returned .
2	thank_you
2	and when i contacted ggf '_s compliance manager i was told there was nothing they could do .
2	after confirmation the bed did not arrive as indicated .
2	very cheap prices . delivery on time , what more can you ask !
2	i paid over £_000 for my elderly_parents to stay at premier_inn , dover , as they were too tired to continue with their journey home .
2	i booked and paid £_00 . 00 online with parcel_monkey to get a parcel sent to coventry next_day on 0 / 0th_feb_0000 .
2	never in all my years of online shopping have i received such appaling service .
0	that said , i felt the search features on hostelbookers were lacking compared to the competition .
0	i ' ve purchased before and will_continue to do so because of their customer_service and willingness to get your products to you fast and without hassle .
0	i use google + too , which is fun , but it doesn ' t have the adoption required to be a required website .
0	lots of customisation options to find the perfect hostel .
0	after phoning the garage directly they are going to do the work for a max of £_000 - the same price they quoted service stop apparently .
2	the funds are returned back to your method of payment and we do not require you to provide any further information .
2	sorry folks it '_s all about the money !
2	if you want to go from a roll to print a one of a0 / a0
0	i got what i ordered so that was ok in the end , but it took 00days to get to me after dispatch .
2	forgot to add that i also cut my hand on one of the broken lights - they do not bother to pack them properly .
0	0 . : hvad sker der for kun at have halvt menukort , allerede kl .
2	the order process was no_fuss , the delivery information accurate and we were kept_informed every_step of the way . although getting a phone_call at 0am with delivery information on a saturday was a bit of a shock ha - ha .
0	do yourselves a favour people pay a little extra for bt or sky .
0	leaves a bad taste in the mouth , to be honest .
2	also non of my correspondence has ever had a reasonable reply , only directed me to their website !
0	stawberries and cream flavour was great not to sweet and mixes up well with milk or water .
2	there are some systems which i think they should change but the matter is now resolved .
2	no compensation , or no voucher off my next order .
0	my wife has now contacted her card provider to raise a dispute in order to try and get our money back .
0	i have made several purchases from this company , very impressed with the service and value for money , would recommend
2	it was light and , according to the royal_mail website , would have cost only another 00p to post " next_day , signed - for " .
2	ordered 0 toilets , at £_00 charge , was given 0 hour delivery slot , delivery came 0 hours earlier , house was not occuppied plus i took time off work , was told delivery time is an estimate , so why give one at all !!!
2	as it was , it took us over an_hour to drop_off our single bag - and we were the lucky ones .
2	thanks petmeds for making a complicated procedure simple .
0	not impressed .
0	i tried to use my work address for the delivery and it was impossible .
2	a good shopping_experience .
2	not to be deterred i checked online availability at another branch and again the item was in stock and it allowed me to reserve it for in - store collection .
2	no delivery received .
2	very pleased with the service which i will recommend to friends and use again .
2	its more or less a one stop shop for me as a jewellery maker , there are only a few bits that they do not sell that i need to go_elsewhere and buy but i ' m_hoping they will have them in sometime soon , then i wouldn_'_t need to shop anywhere_else .
0	i certainly wont be using eflorist again and i will be telling everyone who will listen to me to avoid them .
0	ordered item from the website which in itself was fine and easy to use .
0	i had to do an official restore with my tmobile sim in the phone .
0	i emailed them a week_ago and they guaranteed my new ps0 would be here by monday .
2	i will use this company again and can recommend .
2	the video '_s and detailed_information with each product helped_us make our decision from the overwhelming choice available .
2	i bought a battery from ebatterys aka ocean electrical .
0	my campaigns have had excellent results !
0	computer arived undamaged , ( concidering the lift was broke and i live on the forth floor ).
0	lovely colour .
2	maybe the last time .
2	emma sorted me out with in minutes tnt upgrade came with in 00_mins . now thats what i call a great service thanks emma
0	when i tried to use the voucher it said invalid , i emailed them and got a response one day later telling_me to try another code , which i tried and surprise_surprise it also said invalid . after yet again another email explaining my anger and another day went by , they tell me to go_ahead and place my order and they will refund the £_00 , like i ' ve heard that before !
2	i got no help whatsoever , the desk person was extremely rude , i had to find the man to do the outsize check in and find out where to take the bike afterwards .
2	i thought it was sand at first !
0	was looking for best deal available for canon 00 - 000 0 . 0 is ii .
2	the trustpilot system has worked well to improve customer conversions , however , the automated email generation system leaves a lot to be desired .
0	we missed the game in salvador because all other flights were fully booked .
0	tried and certainly a trusted supplier - repeat customer .
0	i now ask online_retailers which company they use .
0	why they just can ' t help you out is beyond me .
0	will_definitely_recommend to all my friends and family .
2	the reason is if the service is this bad now what will it be like after the kitchen is fitted ?
2	everything fitted together beautifully and everyone who has seen it has_been really impressed with the result .
0	bij isc waar wij bij zitten is infurn ook al een ' bekende '.
0	euro car parts are fantastic for their range of products , and unbeatable_prices - i ' ve never found some of their branded items cheaper .
2	if this information had been up to date on the website i probably wouldn_'_t have bothered ordering anything_else and cancelled the other items .
2	excellent company to do_business with , wide_range of products at a very competative price .
2	several emails later , they agreed to send me a replacement , which arrived today .
2	i have used kenable several_times over the years and have only praise for their service .
0	i booked the wrong tickets due to the website displaying incorrect booking summary details before i purchased !
2	another email today from 000rackets , they will pay for me to return the bracket and send me another one or give me a refund .
2	upon complaining i did get a normal room with a normal balcony but had to pay an extra € 00 for the privilege .
2	last_week they phoned to say their fitter paul would be with us on monday 00th and make_sure room is completely cleared .
0	fast to take my money and horrible non_existent cs
2	satisfied that the goods were there i just waited .
0	i was excited to use one of the offer .
2	they taste just as good in the rain .
2	i rang and was advised there still was no stock and did i want to cancel .
2	got a reply from the company and they just come up with lies after lies , saying now that he was waiting for us before we even called him !
0	we received a call to say that the lorry had broken down and would not come .
2	i '_ve smoked 00 to 00 " analogue " cigs every day for 00 years , but not any more :-) [ i tried patches , gum etc many_times but no use :-( ]
0	a week_later another phone arrived .
0	as we left the branch we were given a patient pack , containing all the relevant documentation and t &_c ' s , but were advised ' don ' t worry_about reading this now , your wife will need to have a look through it closer to the time of the surgery and come with it signed or ask the surgeon any_questions that she may have '.
0	cheap flights , but i hate being stuffed in and having to pay rediculous prices for eats & drinks .
0	- i missed a dinner with my girlfriend ' s family
2	had to buy and install a new copy .
0	i ' ve heard this company before but never gave it a chance , until i waslooking for a specific product and i came_across it on here .
0	but their delivery and dispatch times are terrific .
2	fasthosts must think we ' re all mugs .
2	with a proof of posting .
0	buy your cards from [_external reference ], they have a fantastic customer_service , and deal with questions etc , in a friendly_manner and they send items out in boxes with fantastic packing .
2	in addition , the service i received from my account manager was top_notch .
0	we were told it had just been serviced but the light had been forgotten to be turned off .
2	it was now after midnight , when i was shown to a well worn mini_bus where it seemed i was the only traveler , i must add here that had no other travelers arrived i would most definetly had not traveled on the vehicle .
2	booked a car at glasgow airport - when i arrived there was no vehicle available .
2	he '_s right , i ' m_sure .
0	the service i have received is 0st_class .
2	item could not be delivered by courier ( royal_mail ) and was returned to postal office for collection by customer .
2	would i buy from them again . no .
2	and so far they can '_t lose .
2	i thought this is a good deal and decided to contact them to enquire_about the same deal for ourselves .
2	i '_ve never had to wait that long for cartridges from anywhere_else .
2	instead tells_me what to do to find a booking .
0	i really_appreciated this site for it ' s ease of use and easy to follow design .
0	in retrospect i think i could could have argued the case but not really worth my time .
0	another complaint - sent a email to feedback_@ and also got no response - obviously a arrogant company that think they are doing us a favor by allowing us to buy from them .
0	i initially waited a lot longer_than anticipated for my order , and then when it arrived ( on two different days as a split delivery ) i was devastated that one sack of dog_food had been damaged .
2	order placed 0th_november , extra delivery paid to get goods quickly .
2	definitely as i was already at that point that anything done later would have higher risk .
2	the chairs were of better quality that those we had seen at other stores including next but at far less cost .
2	stuart urquhart
0	unfortunately , i was completely wrong .
2	recommending it to anyone who is buying supplements , protein mix etc , is a given yes !
2	however since placing the order i have had numerous cold calls for disability equipment which can only have come from this order .
2	not good .
2	i did this but it was a complete disaster .
2	good service , but for the small user , like me , it comes at quite a price ( 0 . 0 % + 00p_per transaction ).
2	once you '_ve ordered and paid you have to go to the banks or courts to get your money back .
0	[_name ] was great with the non - stop calls , she was like my conscious speaking . i just had to put the money aside to finally do my website !
0	or is that one person is doing the work of three ?
2	overall the experience was perfect from placing the order to being_able to play the guitar exceeded my expectations .
0	overall a great service .
0	when i asked for a refund of the deposit , hostelworld said they ' ll look_into it and then never replied since .
0	i was told to open the machine up to check the wireless card was installed correctly whilst the machine was on !
0	i ordered a custom sized mirror from this company ' s website .
2	!
0	i fully expected to have a long and hard fight but kevin was reasonable throughout our discussions and never brushed me off or was condescending .
0	overall im thrilled with the price i paid for them now .
0	she said this would then be sent directly to lichfield for them to either fix or replace the affected part .
0	w . neil
2	had it done so i would probably have bought one .
0	she was , and so the clinician pressurised us into making the holding deposit payment of £_000 and booking the procedure then and there .
0	i also received an_email_confirming they were ready for collection .
0	the delivery times stated on the website are not true and both my items arrived chipped
2	would i spend anymore money with this company , no thanks .
0	always loved their pizza , the stuffed bbq crust is a letdown however .
0	phone service and reception is also very poor and mobile internet is poor at best , if i can get a signal .
0	one of my favourite places was astral cocktail bar .
0	i ' m surprised they are still trading !
0	numerous_times we have had parcels delivered by myherpes through people on ebay .
0	would recommend to all .
2	nice product at a good price and delivery was very quick
2	every time they say it is going to be delivered i have to book leave from my work , then 0 days before delivery date i am told it is not going to happen .
2	very easy to use web_site
2	my gift for a friend arrived on the same day as indicated on my order .
2	pleased with it , if the above had not of happened then i would have had
2	and regardless , it makes you look bad . and your competition better .
0	- doesn ' t feature a 0 - click wordpress installation ( many other hosting sites do ).
0	highly_recommended for those who spend quite a bit on games regularly .
0	and really easy for payments with credit_cards . except with my case .
0	these goods were worth well over £_00 .
2	i have tried almost every vacuum_cleaner . is dyson , kirby , siemens , the results after using the ram air is astounding to the point of embarrassment . without_doubt a 0 * product .
0	so to sum up our experience if you want to purchase a top_class vehicle with 0st_class customer care and great value for money , deal with chorley group .
2	suite à un vol annulé reporté au lendemain , impossibilité de récupérer le véhicule réglé 0 mois auparavant .
2	i would not_hesitate to use the company again .
0	the second time however was when the charger for my lavatube shorted while charging batteries , both malfunctioned .
2	they are based in switzerland , have no telephone_numbers so obviously think they are outside all consumer_law .
0	reading all the reviews i ' m now seriously crapping myself over whether i ' ll get taxed by customs , and whether i ' ll actually get my ordered items !
2	you also need to choose
0	0th week still unpaid .
0	when i raised this with yourselves , i was told it was the replacement item so someone just decided to send me the piece of metal !
0	ridiculous !
2	to actually make a booking , the autoglass website offered an_appointment three days_later .
0	will sure use again
0	the layout of their website could be much simpler , the transfer times for payments could be much_quicker ( rather_than sitting on customers money for 0 days to collect the interest on top of the extortinate percentage rate ) and the customer_service much_better .
0	!
0	for the entire duration of my time with t - mobile they have sought to resolve each and every issue i have ever had .
0	the driver was however very apologetic i will therefore use there services again .
2	my only problem was the the scooter control_panel was advertised as blue and even said on the bag it was blue but is actually black .
0	they tried to diagnose my near dead laptop over the phone , which was an_absolute nightmare .
0	i emailed in case my " live_chat " message had not got through and after two days there was no sign of anything being done about it .
0	most of the day went by with no email .
0	i then said that i was very worried that i had been trying to pay for this item for over an_hour and making numerous phone_calls , helping identify a problem on their website , only for it to then be fixed and someone_else then being_able to buy them from under my feet .
0	and because we ' re all locked into contracts . there ' s not much else we can do about it .
0	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn ’ t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance department .
0	the item was received next_day , and shipping was included for free .
2	ie no liability on ourselves if we did not make the connection with the other flight ( uk to spain ), due to no fault of our own .
2	all in all a good experience all_round i would definitely_use them again or recommend to a friend
0	my laptop came when it was supposed to with no_problems .
0	let ' s all be honest , we ' re not exactly going to get savile row quality and fit from an online tailor who manufactures in china , but i ' ve had coats from other online tailors ( specifically one with an apple - prefix ) which had far better fit and quality .
0	i phoned straight_away and was told they would check if the mirror was loaded on to the lorry that morning and if it came back .
2	recently though i purchased an item which wasn_'_t as_described .
0	things get ridiculous here as the talktalk customer_service representative then books me an_appointment on the 0rd without waiting for me to confirm that that was ok .
0	high_quality products at reasonable prices a delivery service that is second to none
0	however , if you have tried twice to make payment online and it fails because of their system problems , they refuse to take payment over the phone that day and insist you have to call back another day !
0	i really_appreciate that .
2	advised i wanted it delivered in the afternoon .
2	use infrequently and due to this account expired but was still held i was just unable to access .
0	i am interested in the field of teaching , therefore i am doing this course .
2	i asked for a refund on my delivery charge (£_00 !)
0	just spoke to oliver at customer_services who confirmed they do not provide sat navs as a company .
2	can you please confirm your full name ?
0	a bit disappointed with that , but the product itself was good and resolved my problem .
2	i would have thought that if it '_s howing as available on their website then it '_s in stock but apparently not .
0	hdnl is the worst delivery company i have ever come_across .
0	fair_enough .
0	i ordered from this company a few_times and have had no_problems .
2	my total purchase was over £_000 gbp , so i benefited from the multi purchase discount and shipping was free ( or at_least built into the price .)
2	ordered 0 lights , so far have received only two good lights and six damaged lights .
0	only ever works when connected to wi_- if at home which refers the object of having the application on my phone in the first place .
0	very nice to chat to plus quick at fixing the problems .
2	by the way , i do not work for get me in !
2	glasses arrived very quickly and were pretty good quality .
0	careful when trying to use the code they send you for registering for their newsletter , after i purchased a song i seen the deal showing 00_% of your first mp0 purchase and applied 00_mins after my purchase .
2	if they want to stay in business , they have to start giving decent customer service .
2	i ordered a walking_stick that was posted by oneclick as in stock .
0	0 days_later , no email of the product being sent out , and 00 attempts at calling them have gone_unanswered .
0	really disappointed and will not use again .
2	and then before i realise what i am doing i am booking another flight on ryan_air .
2	please leave card ).
0	so i thought why not give a try .
0	their website was easy to use .
0	the bus tour ( hop on hop off ) you had to travel to a location nowhere_near the meeting point to collect the tickets -- we didnt have time to do this so wasted money on that also .
0	i bought a tshirt from ebay from a seller in italy , never arrived , the seller kept telling_me to wait and i waited so long ( emailing this seller every 0 days ) it went over the time limit to open a dispute on paypal .
2	arrived within that window , was very pleasant and fitted tyres .
2	chris
2	many_thanks
0	i have also been left with start bursts / halos at night , which had made night time driving impossible .
0	please steer_well clear of wowcher and their not so amazing a deals .
0	cheap and cheerful , that ' s all it ' s about . and in that department , they definitely pass 000_%.
0	down falls .
0	the trolleys are hard to get in after using them .
0	however seeing them in person later that night , they were a lot smaller_than i expected and was not how it was " as pictured " as they make out on the site .
0	this was explained to expedia , but they still refused .
2	perfekt og professionel service !
2	portadown
2	for them to reply to my review - yet still not respond to my email , is simply unbeleivable to me .
0	the service from bsm is very poor indeed .
0	i would rate their service lower_than one star if i could .
2	i will have the refund thanks as i have had it with this company .
2	i was even more surprised to see the courier at my door later that afternoon .
2	i have now rung them again and have given the info again i have also contacted my credit_card company and they are going to launch there own investigation now .
0	yes , snapped .
0	many of us miss out on items we want
0	don ' t miss your opportunity now for these deals you won ' t find anywhere_else .
0	finally get through tonight and after being cut_off 0 times , i am told i never reported my phone lost or stolen , but they will send me a new sim as a good - will gesture !!
2	i was also surprised how low the prices were for sandwiches and drinks on board .
0	they were at_least 0cm longer and packaged better .
0	i open the door to collect my parcel from the jobs worth and he stands and lies to my face .
0	got cheque in post within a few_days so no more worries , but the post_office either need to get a grip or mazuma need to confirm these options with them ( oh and answer your phones !!!)
2	the refills were 0st_class .
2	that level of service cannot easily be matched .
0	hello , i am wondering about my tickets , will they arrive in june when tomorrowland . be are actually sending them away ?
2	could you please confirm to what email address you wrote to at bravofly and which email address you used yourself .
0	i ' ve ordered quite a few things from very and i ' ve never had any troubles with any aspect of them .
2	i was stolen .
0	i made a request for some keys thule , within 0 days you had the keys in hand .
2	i ordered two_pairs of shoes , both were excellent and didnt look £ 0 . 00 at all .
0	it came well_packaged and the box and product were pristine .
2	epiphone 000 sg was very nice , good action for a cheap guitar & in perfect_condition & well_packed .
2	i use to be a regular fashion world customer , but i find that there clothing is getting more exspensive but the quality is getting very poor . so i have not ordered anything for over a year now think .
0	thank_you very much e_- careers for this oportunity !
0	a guide price was given before i sent in my phone , the pre_- paid envelope arrived a couple of days_later and i popped my phone in and waved goodbye .
2	easy from start to finish .
0	used crc for years and always used to be easy and straight_forward to order anything but lately there seems to be a problem .
2	if the customer service had been better , a lot better .
0	the accommodation was all that we could ask for , for a group of 00 on a stag_do .
2	first time i '_ve used pet_supermarket and i was impressed by the pricing of the prescription hills cat_food and the tetra pond fish_food .
2	ok so grumble grumble we carried on paying .
2	update
2	at this point i gave up !
0	nigel_o ' hara processed my refund quickly and with no questions , but later reported my review on trustpilot .
0	however i only received my ring on january 00 , 0000 and the band is already starting to look gold .
0	the details on locations gives you all the info you need in order to book , and the site loads fast on slow connections , which is very useful when wifi is slow while traveling !
0	i haven ' t taken them up on any yet but i might do to see if they improve on quality .
0	avoid !
0	[_name ] gave great service with a friendly and helpful attitude
2	no stars greenpod , i have used this compay before without_any problem for laser_printer_ink .
0	never again .
0	i was catagorically told £_00 was only being refunded as i was being charged £_00 for a next_day delivery charge .
0	when selecting components , if something wasn ' t quite right a pop up would appear and recommend a different component which would be more suitable .
2	i ordered a cabinet and although it looks good and sturdy the melamine cover is thin and the chipboard beneath is not dense enough to purvey a sense of quality .
2	i got weight gainer off you , s a few_weeks_ago and i havent put any weight on i didnt know much about your products as i wanted something 0 make me put on weight quickly i know you can buy it as i have done so in the past out of a gym in glasgow it was the same idea [ banana milk shake ] but i phoned you , s up for advice and the girl i spoke to didnt know anything about the product i was buying off you , s the 0 i got was whey gain by gn i have followed all the instructions but didnt find it affective ive since been told by my doctor that nesquick is just the same stuff so could you advise me as i was going 0 buy a different 0 from the site thank_you .
0	ok . but why is this my problem ?
0	exceptionally fast service and never had a snag yet , despite my requests constantly changing and being a little complicated .
0	i even went as far as saying " i ' m sure you can fix everything , but can you please just let me deal with any_problems i ' ll get with my new provider and cancel my contract !".
0	i followed their online procedure and was lead to a page saying that i would have to talk to an operator to complete the process .
2	i recently reviewed youframeit , and gave them 0 star .
2	that they were experiencing system failer but that i would receive my refund after 00 working hours , these expired yesterday and there is still no credit into my bank as of now !
2	yes i had proof of posting etc they just refused to assume responsibility .
0	my most_recent was burberry body intense which is normally £_00 but on here was £_00 .
0	however , i made a tiny mistake when i made the booking so i had to call their customer_service up and i found out that their office is actually based in philippines .
2	when i bought the top up i thought i was connected to tesco mobile only to find mobile topup is a third_party provider .
0	there ain ' t no wings and angels , but there are boards and dudes .
0	i was working on my laptop during the day which is next to the window which looks out of my the front of my house .
2	a display_unit was damaged so badly it was unusable , and appeared to have been dropped , a chest of drawers had a split in the bottom of a drawer , again unusable and irreparable and the third , a computer_desk , had a large section of filler right in the centre of the desk .
0	this means , if you absent mindedly click ( like 00_% of people ), you will end up sharing fairly quickly .
0	£_00 with delivery and when i contacted you regarding this i was expected to take a trip to a post_office and i can ' t drive and pay for postage back to you which i feel was unfair thanks amy brewer
0	i cannot face another phone call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .
0	i also received no call from the manager as promised .
2	never known such a poor delivery service by on line traders
2	decided i needed a new dishwasher due to the bosch one i had for 00 years starting to play up .
0	here is what i ordered and the quality :
2	no refund and no replacement .
2	very reasonably_priced , but no economy with the quality of flowers or service !
2	do you know of any other company that charges a 000_% cancellation_fee ?
0	when i went to return the car in the arranged place in nice it wasn ' t there .
2	however the site is now a dell computers site and i never have nor never would order from dell due to the horror_stories i '_ve heard about them .
2	guess_what ?
2	i will never use hotelopia again .
0	on the 00th i still_havent heard_anything so live chatted again and was told they still didnt have stock and didnt know when it was coming !
2	was actually refused an account even_though i have the highest possible credit rating .
0	great , reliable company , highly_recommended !
0	in short , don ' t put your faith in eflorist for special / meaningful occasions . there is a real chance that they will let you down in more ways than one .
0	they responded quickly to all correspondence , delivered the item when they said they would and had the best prices i could find online .
0	i always look at ocuk first when i ' m wanting new computer parts , as i know they have great customer_service & will have the item i ' m wanting at a good price .
0	also a store in northern_ireland to walk_into would be great because a lot of the offers are for walkins only
2	their resort staff are extremely_helpful and will go that extra_mile for you if needed .
0	it is quite vulnerable to hackers and could do with some sort of sorting system e . g .
2	wrote and sent copy of credit ratiing just to prove a point .
2	their on - line site is vast which lets your experience down a little bit .
0	terrible delivery service , please do not order from this company , i ordered 0 items of furniture from them and as i live in " the country " ( large town just outside glasgow ) they would only deliver to the pavement outside my property .
2	i then phoned and the guy on the phone said he could not help me and just pout the phone down .
0	( i kept the email incase of any_issues down the line , i then sent my phone with royal_mail , insured for free up to 00 pounds as_described in mazumas directions , and after 0 days received a confirmation_email , and the money straight into my bank_account :).
2	they then refused to tell me why they wouldn_'_t give me credit , which is contrary to the consumer credit act and also to the advice given by their credit agency , equifax .
2	quick delivery , easy to use site . no_nonsense
0	excellent service , highly_recommended !
2	there are other issues other than these and the whole_experience has turned from a joyous expectation to a depressing experience and both of us feel very down and not only that but we still cannot get our house back in order because we are now waiting for a solution , the company promised to get back to us today and fix a date for resolution work , surprise_surprise no call by 0000hrs .
0	i called to ask when would be the collection time as i need to go out on the day just for an_hour .
2	order no :_000000000
2	i have emailed them and they say that the arm has broken due to improper installation - when they were installed in the exact_same geometry as the ones that were there previously !
2	plastic plates ( really thin !!)
2	we have managed to use the tracking device which was still in use on handset and shall be sending our proof of this been a fraudulent company to trading_standards as they still deny handling / received handset which evidently is not the case .
0	. i ' ve never been given that back . all as i ' ve been given is the meter wiped .
2	still_waiting for refund and second order . what compounds the issue is i paid nellypot p_&_p and extra £ 0 for what i ' d thought would be a lovely bag !!
2	after all , you '_ve got my money , you agreed to supply a product via next_day delivery and have entered_into a contract as such , and you ' re now in breach of contract .
0	after looking on the net we came_across a fantastic deal from chorley group thinking it was maybe to good to be true we gave them a call and was put through to sales and spoke to russell .
0	get paid for buying !
0	my order was split in two , the first part ( sofas ) could not have been better however had to wait nearly a month for the 0nd part ( coffee_table ) to arrive .
0	i ' d say our experience should make anyone reading this take notice - we know what is important in an ecommerce platform and we know a good system when we see one .
2	on their van !
0	the number to call from the us doesn ' t ring .
0	its only fair on this occasion , to give them 0_stars for their service , but , read the others reviews before considering their service .
0	we meet a grumpy man , wonder he has power or not , but he speak very quickly and we can ' t hear at the first time .
0	very glad i found this site and it saved me a lot of money .
2	so i '_ve now had to book a ' warrant ' call out .
2	still high , but not so ridiculous )

0	factor in the 00mph vehicle limiter , the one way systems and ' pedestrian ' and / or ' no loading after 00am ' zones in city centres , or single drops that are nowhere_near any other drop that take another hour just for one packet ( that cannot possibly be cost_effective and would be cheaper to post ) and with an average of 00 drops per day it soon becomes a mammoth task to complete all drops within an effective 0 hours paid delivery window .

0	estimated time of delivery 00 / 00 /_0000 , date today 00 / 00 /_0000 , still no email to say the item has been despatched .

0	when i was selling them my samsung jet for £_00 . 00 i got payment right away , but i would of had a better experience if they paid out more money on phone models .
2	would definately recommend them to others and would buy from them again .
0	not sure if they just hire a useless courier service ( as per review below ) who apparently couldn ' t find two st . bernards if they were in the same telephone booth as them or they are just ripping me off .
0	so if i hadn ' t queried this and thought , oh they ' ll take the payment and obviously that wouldn ' t actually happen , i ' d get charged for failing to pay - and they ' d blame me for thinking their website was accurate with them being a financial institution .

2	less_than 00_hours from placement of order on - line .
0	they have a good return_policy and the business_model was the 0st of it ' s kind .
0	i tried the phone system again hoping now the pickup dates available will have shifted forward " please hang on while i transfer you to a member of our team . sorry , our opening_hours are monday to ." i then logged on to the website to try and sort .

2	i bought 0 tubs of rendagrip from this company , ordered on a saturday , delivered free on the monday . outstanding service . would definitely recommend you to others . 0 ★
2	the mattress is good quality and good value for the price however for a product urgently_needed and delivered disappointingly late made the whole_experience stressful , inefficient and bad customer service .
0	initially the response was good , understanding over the phone and had a good record of my past corespondents .
2	its nice to know that they are willing to risk customers lives by not carrying out basic checks such as checking for damage under bar tape after an accident .
0	we ' ve used our local_branch of national for years and have nothing negative to say .
0	and i would use again .
0	however when i chose to have guaranteed next_day delivery , i expect next_day delivery .

2	they claim that they can provide a " 00 mb / s " service .
2	beautiful_flowers clearly illustrated with comprehensive description .
0	and now that i have to complain_about it being broken after just 0 times of use i am sure this will be another huge mountain to climb before actually getting a replacement or getting my money back !
2	i have no issue with that but believe part of the premium i paid for " express delivery " was to have the item dispatched that day .
2	i bet they were glad to see the back of me !
0	pricing was also very competitive and i am sure i will be purchasing from here again :)
2	however , . when we arrived home i immediately noticed that they had given us the wrong_size of tv so i rang and spoke with dale who apologised for the error .
2	then sit at pc on facebook .
0	!
0	i called the store and they politely apologised and said if i sent the phone back they ' d refund me .
2	so be warned the service charge is a levy applied for the privilege of receiving such a sterling ' customer service experience '.
2	if you continue to support this company being allowed to block its reviews consumers will lose confidence in you
0	nice interface and layout , very simple to use .
0	low_prices , but messed_up order however customer_service was reasonable and order resolved quickly .
0	if others act the same way either they will lose business and be forced to improve or go under .

2	avoid .
0	there was no card , no bark , no knock , and all this happened while i sat 00ft from the front_door .
0	in fairness i was sold on the first contact but wasnt quite ready to launch , there was no pressuring and once back in touch as requested , we were up and running in no time .
0	the staff are really helpfull especially when i don ' t really know what i ' m looking for are always happy to take the time to help me work it out .
0	apparently , according to the owner , it takes too much time and money to change an order , so it was either keep it or get banned again .
0	will recommend them .
0	i have never bought sex toys in my life as i ' m shy and find going into a shop even ann_summers embarrassing so i decided to order something online .

0	my son eventually settled with the new yaris .
0	after_reading these reviews after purchasing and receiving the tv i was very worried but after now recieving the unit i am now only worried_about warranty issues in the future .
2	aside from the first time we rang , the company was eventually very responsive and sympathetic to our needs although the shower refit job took 0 days longer_than it should .
2	really good item at good price but to then charge a fiver for delivery of something that would fit through the letterbox is a bit too much
0	very useful website , super easy to use and definitely better_than manually searching the net for the best price i can get for my old_phones - i didnt even know there were so many companies or that my old phone could be worth twice as much as some of the bigger named companies advertise on their websites .
0	they could have sold that to me and left me to get on with it .
2	the prices are great as well .
2	this is probably the quickest and easiest_way to purchase btc in the uk .
0	would recommend this website to anyone .
0	i ring to find out the status of my delivery .
2	i '_ve had no reply to that e_- mail or to thecompany '_s customer_services website form and telephoning is a waste of time and money as you are just held up in a queue due to operators being busy ( must be all their disgruntled_customers ).

0	i ' ve ended_up opening a claim with paypal , hopefully i ' ll get at_least my money back !

2	so far i ' m up to about 00 emails to this company trying to sort_out a refund .
2	the tickets arrived on sheets of a0 paper , with someone '_s name and address crossed out in the top left hand corner .
0	we found it first time of trying , using the extremely accurate driving directions emailed by the advisor .
0	by this point i was feeling exhausted with having to keep returning to the store , the repeat phone_calls to customer_services , where i had to explain everything over and over again .
0	i had been looking for a winter jacket online and had seen a few that i liked on a number of websites such as e_- outdoor . co . uk .
0	pleased with the lamp , good price .
2	talk about waste of time and frustration , never mind the fact that we have no kitchen_sink or tap ( i am too scared to go and buy one elsewhere as we cannot_afford to lose this money ). i have no_idea what else to do now , they really do not have a care for customers and tehy seem to get away with it .
0	when i ' ve used the next_day service the goods have always arrived on time .
2	service is valid and they don_'_t try to screw you with non covered bs .
0	had to pay a bit more for my ticket but that was partly my own fault for not ordering one earlier .
2	but the delivery company is less_than good
0	official_iphone_unlock is the absolute best service ever !
2	my nokia n00 0gb was 000g in weight and therefore i had to pay the po £ 0 . 00 to deliver it and also insure for loss up to £_000 .
2	clare indicated this was a one time offer and if i wanted to take it further to contact the furniture ombudsman .
0	0 antipishing and advices of malicious webs in a graphical form

0	the hotel was fantastic and if you can mange to get up for breakfast it ’_s a great hangover cure .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i would definitely recommend e_- bookers .
0	the man i spoke to advised that the address was wrong , and they are now going to be delivering them to the correct address .
0	overall a decent costume .
2	the site promised immediate delivery , but we had to wait 00_hrs whilst they manually processed the credit_card payment " when the office next opens ".
0	i was sent a faulty ps0 which i later sent back .
0	the customer_service team were quick to reply to my questions .
0	will order from them again .
2	i have sent over 0 emails regarding my bills and yet to have my billing rectified .
0	so i went back to the store they happily sorted out the problem for me .
2	so the companies concerned : 000rackets . co . uk ; racketsrus . co . uk & tvrackets0u . co . uk will_continue to scam the uk public with their underhanded ; shoddy ; un - principled ways .
0	he could not confirm if this included vat , which would bring the cost up to £_00 , and said he would investigate and call me back when the accounts team were in at 00am (!
0	therefore i would recommend not going near o0 and especially near the derby store unless you happen to be riding a bulldozer .
2	reference to the vodafone forum revealed that over the past 00 months , many , many people had endured the same experience when simply trying to get a pac_code , i . e .
0	lies all around about broadband speed , absolute nonsense on my bill , no relevance to required payment and billed quantities whatsoever !
2	very good buying experience .
0	now , they claim that their system is down and their accountant department cannot deal with the refund right now but they will , asap .
2	don_'_t go near such a poorly serviced travel company whose phone operators are clearly struggling , even to find out what has happened , never mind communicate it to the customer .
0	i was consistantly notified via e_- mail and text on the were abouts of my product .
0	i would be more_than happy to use them again and recommend them to anyone thinking of ordering from them .
0	i might also suggest a quick google of what a delivery company is supposed to do , it seems you ' re struggling with this concept a little .
2	great to speak to someone who can recognize that someone may have individual requirements .& who can show they have all possible information on their product right from source of manufacture .
2	if i lose my phone i call them to cancel .
0	i visited the manchester printworks harvester pub a few_days ago , the service was slightly mixed , great bar service but unfortunately just average table service , the salad bar was very well stocked and regularly replenished , however the food although very tasty was barely warm and the plates were cold , the waiter did not check on us to check everything was ok and not very easy to get a hold of despite the restaurant not being particularly busy , i would have tried to find him to complain but i am disabled and find it difficult to walk around .
0	same_thing again gave me a pin wiped it off .
2	she sent an e_mail to wiggle asking if a replacement can be sent and it was in the post straight_away !

0	i always haggle at the stores when i ' m spending big money and always get some free bees .
0	i want to mention the excellent and prompt service , as well as james , alina and christina for their attention , care and professionalism !
2	dpd service and tracking was second to none .
0	i refused the delivery of only one order ( an innistrad booster box , which i now regret ) and you took the postage_costs from my refund , so you didn ' t pay royal_mail .
0	i ordered a new monitor , starting at the weekend , two parcels were sent , one for the cables and such and another with the monitor , both arrived within a day of each other , both perfectly packaged and undamaged .

2	i am_disabled and require disabled access shower facilities .

2	it was a straight purchase of a software package .
2	i wasn_'_t sure that they would arrive as i didn_'_t receive an acknowledgement , but online customer_services did what they promised .
0	i think 00 . co . uk is a great site , always offering bonuses and 00 . co . uk doesnt just take your deposit , like most sites i gamble on they take my deposit and im gone within 0 minutes .

2	easy , efficient and fast .
2	well_done
0	oh by the way i am still_waiting for my refund .

2	i read all the reviews of the then advertised fence spray system .
0	factor into the equation the cost that the website bares when serving thousands of cam streams to thousands of users , many of whom are guests or regular members , where does the bandwidth come from for that ?

2	outback themselves no_longer seem to deal direct with the public online and the retail_outlets they recommend don_'_t stock the one i want . then after a year of searching i found the garden_xl site and there it was . the elusive cover that they claimed would fit a number of models of outback gas barbeque .

0	i asked why they needed this for ' security '.
2	!
0	this delayed us with our timings for the next activity , and caused a problem when we had to get between the two .
2	this is poor !
0	also you have the opportunity to leave a comment or note with your order as in the past my items from other suppliers have been sent in a jiffy_bag and have arrived crushed , i asked for my items to be sent in a box to avoid this using the comments / notes box on the order form and that ’_s exactly_what they did .
2	some of my purchases have been straight_forward .
2	i even buy and sell stamps to increase my collection .

0	this means i anxiously waited for 0 weeks before i recieved my tickets .
2	this leaves you and i , the paying customers , with high pings , packet loss exceeding 00_% and sore fingers from typing so many frustrated emails to their support staff over the weekend .
0	as the title_says , i would most , certainly use these_guys again .

0	this was acceptable and i proceded .
2	i would recommend this company to anyone contemplating going ahead with a divorce and finding legal gobbledook had been a problem to you .
2	they did not answer mine or paypal emails and so batteries - trade . co . uk should be avoided at all costs .
2	very easy to use web_site and very competitive_prices , much_cheaper_than royal_mail .

2	did you know that jennie bond is 00 , angela rippon is 00 and gloria hunniford is 00 .
0	the fact that prices are quoted on a monthly_basis , but then billing is quarterly ( and manual ) is very odd .
0	i ' ve experienced 0 times that i made a reservation , and received an_email_saying that they would contact me again with the confirmation and then nothing happened .
2	the price then changed , lower , however i had to go to cambridge and ask them to adjust the price , as i believe they would have just charged the varifocal price for the cheaper option !
0	i really like using ebuyer , not only is it one of the few stores listed on topcashback that sells computer_components and peripherals , but it also and has a very user_friendly design and very comprehensive search_function .
0	as it was something i did not need promptly i agreed to that .
0	the flights where both smoothly , however choice of hot food on board is minimal , and of what there is , wasnt nice at all .

0	really amazing service . i use them all the time and really the best .
2	i was unsure at first on the quality of the batteries , i have had the battery for 0 months now and all seems fine
0	if you buy something online and the retailer uses this company , i would recommend you proceed with extreme caution .
2	also , why should we have to pay for a phone_call to cancel something we did not want in the first place .
2	would it not be easier to simply credit my paypal again rather_than having me need to gather so much information and then email this to you .
0	complimenten !
2	we ordered a towel_rail which arrived missing a grub screw so my husband was unable to put it up .
0	the main_reason i made this purchase was because it was free delivery when spending over £_00 .
0	had a package delivered the other day and it was just chucked over my gate ( luckily not breakable ) however as we all no the weather is not the greatest in england at the best of times so yes the package got wet , really wish amazon would use a more reliable company who are not lazy .

2	second order heard_nothing after a week , so emailed and order was despatched arriving next_day .

0	tried isn ' t good enough when your sending people to another country .
2	you can view my reviews under webuy . com

0	and now i have 0 months of more anxious waiting , :_d
2	i was told to read their terms and conditions and they accept no responsibility whatsoever for my delivery as i opted for standard deliver service which incidentally still cost £ 0 . 00 .
0	also , they forgot to add my loving message to the flowers - which was a big_mistake since it is the 00th year i have been with my girlfriend , which the message referred to !
2	the flights where booked separately and non_refundable .
2	this came_across with the comment that any_problems would be dealt_with and if need be the freezer would be replaced free of charge and that ' you will never have to buy another freezer again '.
2	they need to be more honest with their timescales and provide more communication , but it seems to have worked out ok in the end .
2	world_stores , even you could not make this any worse if you tried !!
0	haha .
2	a few_days_later i discovered that the price i was paying was actually billed in pounds , not euros .
0	couldn ' t believe it when somebody designed me some trainers , they ordered the wrong_size and they accepted the return .

0	in august i insured my ipod_touch and with protect_your bubble after my previous insurance ended .
0	i recently stayed with house trip and unfortunately the people i was renting my apartment from cancelled at the last_minute with some very dubious excuses .
0	the delivery is always promt , the only problem i have is the new packaging .
2	now i could see that one of the parcels was in holland ready for delivery , but the other had gone from manchester to london , to paris , then cologne .
0	the only negative i ' ve had is the router you ' re provided with , it is no good at all with providing good wifi connection to my laptop i have to have it plugged in .
0	i consider myself a very honest person so this whole situation has left me infuriated ans the money hasn ' t even reached my account !
0	not sure whether this would be down to city_link but the contract was with interparcel so held them mostly responsible .
0	simply perfect !!
2	i will_definitely be using this site again as i was very pleased with everything about the company .
2	excellent service and follow_up , thank_you .
2	having said that unlike_some competitors it doesn_'_t therefore prompt you to save periodically .
2	not nearly as quick as they used to be & no cheaper_than their competitors .
2	if you wan0 great quality products shophere
2	i think it '_s from the white pen they use to write on the front window .
0	after i ´ ve sent all of the paperwork requested , they requested a report from apple about the maintenance , which was done last_year .
2	so far i am very impressed and will be using printer_basics again .
2	they often have special_offers and their delivery is fast and reliable .
2	ie .
2	excellent choice of frames , probably the best customer service i have ever received and at a great price .
2	back when this network was run by cable camden , the uptake in the neighbourhood was 00 %.
0	it also seems impossible for them to acknowledge any written communication & the ' contact us ' on the web_site is very hit & miss , on one occassion it took over 0 months to even get an_automated acknowledgement .
0	also as a nice_touch they sent me some champagne chocolates to make up for the delivery issues ( which were not their fault ).
0	only upon writing in the supports ticket .

0	the coverage is amazing and the contracts are great value !
2	the sales_team are most helpful and knowledgeable .
2	would highly_recommend this company , both for value and also first_class speedy service .
2	with the growth of couriers such as dpd who give you an_hour delivery slot , they should look at alternatives .
0	the side of this pc tower is 0mm steel so god_knows_how badly it must have been looked after for them to " achieve " that .
0	so i bought a cornilleau sport 000 indoor .
0	i honestly don ' t think you can get better value for your money elsewhere .
2	the parcel has arrived in 0 working_days since placing the order .
0	great service at an amazing price !
2	waited months for orders to arrive . when one did was awful . sent the bag back . no refund .
0	it ' ll take all day !
2	by shopping around , you can get a great quality writing instrument for a fraction of the western alternative .
2	the legal requirements for tread depth are that the tread must be a minimum of 0 . 0mm across 00_% of the tread width so the garage was lying when they told me they would fail the mot because the outer edge ( only ) was less_than 0 . 0mm .
2	however i was not ringing them for that reason so obviously telepathy is not a strong point at orange .
0	if you are worried_about this , you should delete your facebook , hotmail / gmail account and sign off from the internet .
0	i had to call them and wait on the line for like 00_minutes until the security stop from the order was cleared .
2	in my dealing , it felt to me that the company was simply interested in getting hold of my money as quickly as possible , but unwilling to provide the customer service that is inherently required in dealing_with an internet retailer .
0	the process of changing the trainers was very easy and smooth .
2	slow but good for simple html websites .
2	i think argus_car_hire is a scam company .
2	on opening the box_containing the sink basin i found the enamel to be scratched , i immediately contacted the store and arranged a replacement which was a 0 week wait .
0	in the branch called me " boss .
0	i wanted to change the motherboard in my order , set for next_day despatch .
2	i ordered a steam_mop through kgb , when the mop never arrived , i wrote to kgb numerous_emails asking for a refund , they did not even answer . if you want to use these sites stick to groupon , i had a similar problem with one of their deals and they refunded me without_any_problems ! i have now referred the case to my credit_card_provider .
0	wont be using ever again !
2	i would like to review this company , but dont want to be even more bullied and intimidated , and have what few of my rights are left taken away .
0	so when i discovered this site i thought it was great , which normally it is .
0	the paintball was fun but got a few complaints about extra money for our own transfers as it was so far away .
2	i think that booking with late_rooms is ok but i found that the price they give you is not much of a saving i paid £_000 for bb but their price would have been £_000 so saving £_00 not much of a saving not worth going through you .
0	my mobile was stolen on the 00th of may and delivered only on the 00th of april .
0	searched everywhere for a suitable outfit for book day with a good postage price and time and jokers_masquerade fit the bill , the outfit arrived today but the sizing is completely wrong , there is no way it would fit 0 - 00 years it is an unsightly sack on my 0 year_old , needs 0inchs off each side , and the neckline is so big she can step through it !!
2	i will never buy anything from them again .
2	amazon seems to have a larger range though .
2	would use again .
0	i had to call again as leaving the office , and rebook for that afternoon at home .
0	all they do is they phone a real supplier company and let them ship the goods .
2	i would tread with great care if you are thinking of buying through this website .
2	he couldnt understand_why i was getting annoyed .
2	what with the added expense of flights , hotels etc the whole trip was a total failure .
2	a safe way of shopping a magical emporium with so mutch to offer at amazing prices .
0	tried_calling shiply ' s helpline , but was unavailable no matter when i called .
2	i would score a 0 - which for those who are not familiar is not a promotion of the company !!!
0	in the end i got fed_up waiting and just asked for my money back , however they have so far been unable to do this .
2	they are a great on - line company with a simple , well displayed site .
0	the customer helpline are no help !!!
2	i would score them more favourably than negatively .
0	great site for finding offers on lip balms and nail_polishes which is helpful for when buying gifts .
2	however my main gripe with these bays are the shelves .
2	i ' m extremely upset about the mother '_s day bouquet that was delivered to my elderly_mother 0 days before mothers_day . not on the day as i had requested . the bouquet was a disgrace . looked like it had been thrown together .
2	i suggest anyone with t - mobile ( or orange , who have also gone down the pan since the ee merger ) gets the hell out and finds another_provider .
0	i heard talktalk was a decent company , so i went with them .
2	in the end i had to buy a new psu so had to remove the old one as the model number and stickers were not visible which was strange - and i was incredibly shocked to see on removing it that it had been put in upside_down , and there was no venting for the fan , which was there after all , to exhaust out of the bottom of the case .
0	i bought some tesco storage crates which are moulded plastic and the quality_control just isn ' t there - on the shelf 0 or 0 were broken already and having brought mine home they have suffered the same fate .
2	in the end had to go back to an_appointment in london at my home .
0	but there are times that you search for something and it is presented in such a confusing way you are never actually sure how much your paying for someting and the search_function is a bit weak at points .
0	well at the moment that is all i am commenting about , delivery is still for today , but is it going to show up ??
0	the negatives which i ' d already read about prior to buying were that it took quite a while to assemble and my husband got quite grumpy with the instructions and the trays can be wet post cycle , however importantly the plates are dry and once it ' s built those frustrations deminish !
2	' interest - free ' was an interesting term , because , of course , the purchase price was noticeably higher than you ' d pay on the high_street .
0	i can understand that it is not argos ' s fault for the faulty xbox ' s however i just wish the staff were a bit more friendly in my area .
0	as it was toning we wrongly took their word that all kit was in boxes , it wasn ' t , we were lied to as they knew there were still items incomplete but put that all items were in boxes anyway .
2	this transaction was sooo slick .
2	you should routinely perform the same checks with sellers before making any purchase .
2	yodel chat begins
2	update - i received an_email very quickly offering to replace the flowers on a date of my choosing .
0	the only other thing is the volume of e_- mails we , as customers , recieve thrughout the duration of our order .
0	i thought i had done well , i paid the
2	flew out on a very tatty plane , staff were excellent though , hotel was fantastic , pick_up for return flight left us with 00_minutes to spare at the airport , no time for duty_free , all in all a good company to book with , upgraded planes would make things a whole lot nicer
2	however , when we tried to assemble the mirrors they were discovered to be faulty .
0	i just only use available wifi to contact people .
2	i waited for 0 days for an_email_confirming that my phone was unlocked ( that is what they say they do on their website ), then contacted them to ask what the hold up was .
0	for them to tell me they are sorting it out to with the driver .
2	if you dont need their goods in a hurry then fantasic review , otherwise they are not very forthcoming with keeping informed when goods dont turn_up in time and i have a plane to catch !
0	the jumpers are definitely of lesser quality compared to other brands
0	we had to cancel our appointment with them and , to this date , have not had a refund .
2	i '_ve been both a seller and a buyer on ebay for eight years , its the first place i look before buying anything , and sell all my unwanted items .
2	terrible .!
0	shame the sellers fees are soooo expensive and not being_able to leave non paying / rubbish buyers negative_feedback is really poor
0	i want to thank_you for the excellent service .
2	overall a good experience with travel_republic with the organisation of the holiday .
0	y tomorrow ??
0	the staff was very helpful and the rooms where nice but on my stay had some noise from other guest plus i was next to a rail way so as im a light sleeper i kept getting disturbed through the night plus at 0 . 00am i was woken to someone banging apart_from the lake of sleep the room was nice with free view telly and a hair dryer and a phone the bathroom was small infact it was very small .
0	it was very easy to follow the instructions , and choices were well_presented , but this issue was quite infuriating .
2	great service , delivery & price . will_definitely shop_here again .
0	they are , on average , 00 - 00_% cheaper_than anyone_else .
2	surely the site can be more user_friendly than this !
0	had an_email an_hour after making the purchase to say they were out of stock and their delivery for them to be back in stock was 0 - 00 days away .
2	incredibly they could find no record of me at all .
0	i pre_- ordered flowers to be delivered to my wife on valentines_day , not only did the flowers turn_up a day late , iflorist didn ' t respond to any_queries on valetines day when i ( and many others ) tried to chase up our orders .
0	email stated it as if i had cancelled it .
0	if you need a payday_loan then most of the time you are in an_emergency .
0	around a week_later , i received a text to say the phone was not in warranty , due to a cracked_screen and could be repaired at a cost of 00 . 00 ; i was asked to ring customer_services .
0	but still its great from where we have come from .
0	overall it was a good experience the hotel provided was ok was very clean but is in need of some moderinsation .
0	0 , why get me angry then try arugeing with me down the phone .
2	booked the water wheel apartment in charlestown through blue_chip on the recommendation of a friend .
0	bought a vauxhall corsa excoflex .
0	the courier couldn ' t tell me when it would be delivered , but said it would be that day .
2	ok so cheapest doesn_'_t mean best service but i was so impressed by them - i recieved an_email from them confirming everything , then a phone_call to let me know my preferred delivery date was confirmed , and was told the driver would contact me to advise a delivery time .
2	i watched a movie without losing the signal halfway_through , very good reception and easy to use .
0	emailed over three times took a week for a response which basically states some rubbish about high email volumes and the email received showed no interest or inclination to look_into or deal with my query .
0	( 0 ) supposedly they sent it and and was returned to them .
0	!
0	i called the following_day and was told all the changes had gone_through so nothing to worry_about .
0	them : " no the courier will phone or text you "
0	i ordered flowers 0 days before i wanted them delivered , they were a suprise for my sisters birthday . not only didnt they turn_up but when they did they were half_dead and ended_up in the bin the next_day . absolutely no remorse from company so will never use them again .
0	stops the unexpected surprises upon_arrival
2	and the packaging was excellent .
0	if their customer_service is this bad , i don ' t even want to imagine the final product !
2	even after speaking on the phone to one of their employees who confirmed that no fee was due , the invoices continued on and on and on .
2	delivery & collections are really easy to book , but that can give a false sense of security .
0	they said they would give me a refund .
0	after ordering my biggest purchase of clothes online ever i was super excited to receive my package .
0	it should have been noted about my issue also being a second time customer and i did give my number_plate over the phone .
0	always amazing and on time .
0	it mentioned that payment via_paypal wouldn ' t be ' captured ' until 00_hours before dispatch , but i was charged a week before dispatch , which caused my account to go overdrawn and cause problems with my paypal account .
2	driver very pleasent .
0	easy to order online and to pick a date for delivery .
2	all went like_clockwork !
2	i have a contract with my customer who has purchased my goods and expects to receive these , i shall honour this and make_sure that he does .

2	knowing what excellent quality the men '_s underwear is i thought i would take_advantage of the womens sale products .
2	there wasn_'_t space to put anything .
0	they always leave the note and leave parcel in my carport .
2	really easy to use website and ordering .
2	bought an inno cycle carrier and a thule roof box both products are excellent and delivery was very quick had to phone customer service before buying for advise they were very helpfull in dealing_with my enquiry excellent
2	empty to empty or full to full is much fairer .)
2	all_round satisfactory good job :)
0	for what they do i think its worth it , they cut some corners with regards to things that they provide such as guest_list entry to standard pub which doesn ' t need a guest_list .
0	i should have rather paid a bit more and got the flowers from john_lewis .
2	first_class .
2	sent my iphone 0 off on thursday_morning ( recorded delivery )
2	well i didn_'_t , so send me it .
0	the checkout is easy enough to navigate , as is the website itself .
2	there were delays when i returned the following_day for my check up and had to wait over an_hour to see the optician .
0	the book was not in quite as good a condition as i expected .
0	- the website does indeed archive every conversation , not really a secret considering there ' s a link which allows you to view your past conversations with models . without storing the information , how else would one make this possible ?
0	they can just go to the websites and check it .
2	they are exactly as_described and i am very pleased with them .
0	dance_class overran due to the room at tiger_tiger being unavailable .
2	i was told to run the procedure instead .
0	avoid as you have no guarantee of receiving your goods damage free and have no chance of resolving in a timely_manner be warned an extremely stressful experience that has put me off online shopping .
2	thanks !
0	i went straight home and ordered for my own wedding .
2	required a new tablet has i had broke my old and very out of date one so searched the web for info and reviews on the latest tablets on the market .
2	sam gave me clear and polite help which resulted_in steph from parcel0go '_s customer_relations team contacting me and very soon the overcharge was credited back into my bank_account .
2	i ordered a guitar which was marked as in a sale .
0	00 / 00 would by from here again .
2	how good is that especially as it '_s silly season in full swing .
0	tomorrow i ' m starting a dispute for the transaction with my bank , and have let a couple of consumer watchdogs know given the huge_amount of reviews online saying the same things .
0	delivery service - 0_stars service
0	product was better_than described , will shop there again .
0	in engeland hebben vrijwel alle ketens dat !
2	he was cheerful , smiley and very conscientous , unwrapping the appliance ( i hadn_'_t paid for the service ), positioning it and advising me as to how to let the fridge settle etc before i turned it on .
0	i ' m a customer for life !
0	long_story please read !
0	the product was well_packaged when i opened everything was there and was up and running in a minute .
2	they are quick and helpful to sell you a product but not so helpful to support you even in the initial start up stages .
0	at_least now i dont feel alone in the matter .
0	im very happy .
2	shoes delivered next_day in perfect_condition , with a text to let me know parcel had arrived .
2	one negative , the doors made for us warped ++ and on balance i would recommend using ventrolla for windows only ; but they are very good at window renovation .
2	!
0	i didn ' t received the item shown on the picture .
2	the choice is amazing and i will_certainly use them again .
0	yodel are a nightmare .
0	after hours of multiple calls - each new call starting the whole_process over again - i was getting_nowhere .
2	!
0	as expected i ' ve received nothing .
2	despite placing my order through the ecco uk website i didnt realise until reading the small_print that returns have to be sent to sweden - which explains the relatively slow delivery and which makes things potentially very expensive if returning something .
0	thanks
0	when i finally received my package , i opened it to find an exposed make shift craft knife laying at the bottom of the box ( nice and dangerous !)
2	the item finally arrived 00 days after ordering .
0	as always , great job truffle_shuffle !
0	one charge was refunded and the other has not .
2	then in late march_0000 , after several weeks and the posting of my review on trustpilot , they did send part of the replacement order and offered me another refund .
2	also , it is impossible to book an_appointment any further ahead than 0 weeks as their computer systems can '_t cope with this .
0	unlock your iphone at cheap .
0	i ordered and paid but there was still no option to book the delivery slot .
2	they are almost_impossible to contact ( it took me many many hours ) and they have no_idea where the goods they claim to have dispatched may be .
2	because i think i will then be £_00 . 00 out of pocket with nothing to mount my tv on .
0	so another week went by , so i emailed again .
2	if i want another trophy i know where to find your website .
2	***
0	i ordered a cricket bat , i waited in all day for it , the driver did not knock on the door or leave it with a neighbour but went into the back garden and left outside against a wall .
2	i suspect that my experience was a one - off , but nevertheless i was sent a size of wheel different from what i ordered , without_any discussion .
2	i hope my insight coupled_with your_own judgement , enables you to find a bargain .
2	set of 0 in our hall lamp on the deep crimson chest no_longer looks welcoming , but these were all that were available in the rating and cap we needed .
2	quick , efficient service , excellent camera ( fz00 ), could have bought it cheaper elsewhere , but more risky .
0	do not use u have been warned !!
2	he tried to call me many_times , but i couldn_'_t pick_up the phone .
2	he has , however been in business for many_years and i assume that he would not be allowed to continue trading for so long if there were problems .
2	buying flowers was really easy , i was told when they left the depot , and exactly when they were delivered , well_worth the money to ensure they arrived on time .
2	lord douglas errol semple .
0	i have found standards to occasionally slip , particularly when eating in .
2	but make_sure you read all the small_print and go back to them within 0 days days if you have an account query
0	he arrived about 00_minutes late , he explained he had the villa address , hence the delay .
0	if , like me , this is a reason to stay , rest_assured , they don ' t .
2	i am always aware that if i do not leave with my bargain / offer , i will have over spent and therefore not really had a good shopping_experience as i said they over price !
2	why would i want one of those .
2	no refund had been received , so i once again started attempting to contact interspares .
2	after 0 weeks , we are still_waiting for one part of bed to arrive ( unusable without it ).
2	i contacted vd who offered to fix the lenses for a fee and it would take 0 weeks . so far so good . that was back in june_0000 .
0	it just isn ' t worth the time and misery .
2	i would recommend them to anyone .
0	about a day later i got a phone call from an advisor stating that 0 of my items were not in stock .
2	this was indeed the case .
0	i ' m obviously livid and bewildered as i took a day off to wait for the packages .
2	late_afternoon and we now have a fitting date of tomorrow and wednesday but it took a lot of explaining the hassle that we had clearing a room into the rest of the house and taking 0 days leave to be here when they decided to come originally and failed .
2	the mattress when it did arrive was marked at one corner however having_read the problems other have had with returning items i will live with it .
2	note
2	i love the up to date information , from letting you know your order was dispatched , and when it was delivered .
2	that said , having better customer support than the likes of bt is far from high praise and many other smaller uk isps offer similar or better support to their customers ( including during the hours you will actually be using the internet if you ’ re in gainful employment ).
0	it makes it easier and more trusted this way and i wouldn ' t go with another company !
2	the chap on the other hand , always worked hard for you no matter what .
0	price range can vary a lot but everything ive gotten from here has been really nice !
0	we end up speanding an extra £_000 between flights to london to be able to fly form their airline , hotel in london because their flight is super early , foods , seats , transport from and to hotel - airport both locations , i can continue .
0	!
2	because they have sent their money to a credit_card company who i dont have any dealings with they also refused to return the faulty item i could have returned to the manufacturer to resolve .
0	so mass lack of research and communication on chilli_sauce ' s behalf .
0	no communication .
2	within one working hour of putting my comments on line i received a call from the supplier customer service apologizing for the problems that i had experienced .
0	i took photos of the damage and sent them to groupon asking for a refund .
0	we called their customer_services several_times , to be either fobbed_off , or lied to .
0	i needed to unlock my phone because i will be in italy for a few_months and officialphoneunlock fixed me up over night .
0	not ony do they have excellent coverage , they also offer top price plans for pay and go and pay_monthly and rewards !
0	my only complaint is about some of the takeaways themselves , who give themselves good ratings .
0	?
2	i find naturesbest product are of the highest quality .
2	why would we want another delayed and dead bunch of flowers ?
0	quick delivery , excellent product , great service .
2	i got a great deal on designer_frames with prescription lenses .
0	bracket : didnt even look at it .
2	while their overseas call_centre is makeshift and tries it '_s best , it '_s engineers almost always seem to be unqualified and unhelpful .
0	love that there are no fees and plenty of great reviews to help pick a place to stay .
2	make the post_office look like a fabulous service
2	still no refund , but everytime i email i ' m told ' few more days '.
2	fortunately i paid by credit_card so will be pursuing them for refund and return postage_costs .
2	northern_ireland
2	i have recommended them to friends on numerous_occasions and will happily continue to do so .
2	quick delivery of ordered goods .
0	talk about chivalry .

2	avoid like the plague !
0	says everything .
0	trying to get my phone ' s internet unblocked through my handset , as they classify even an art website as adult content , with no success tried online , through my three account , also with no success , i then tried_phoning them , after talking to an indian assistant that i could barely understand , and give all my details from bank_account , address , drivers license etc , to be asked to wait up to 0 hours for a text_message confirming that they had my details checked .
0	these are the same t &_c ' s that were directly contradicted by the advice given to us in the branch at the point - of - sale ; the same t &_c ' s that were handed to us after payment was made and the same t &_c ' s that we were told not to worry_about reading straight_away ( despite the fact that there was a severely limited time - dependant clause on the payment of refunds ).
2	i recently decided to review whether i was getting a good deal and discovered i was definitely not .
0	find me a subscription website that doesn ' t do this .
2	had to return it and then is when it went from bad to worse .
2	they let me unpack the item to make_sure i didn_'_t have another duffer .
0	000 quid cheaper_than going directly to the shop i had them fitted !!
2	great customer service .
0	i found that hen_heaven themselves are a little cagey about what is and isn ' t included with certain activities .
0	the company doesn ' t respect the warranty_period , doesn ' t answer complaints , lies .
2	also , being in a sack makes it quite messy to use , so i would rather pay a little more for a tub .
0	received excellent customer_service from sammie_taylor at parcel0go .
2	i have no problem with takeaway . com . however they have too many disclaimers .

2	nothing damaged .
0	not happy !
0	they charge $_00 to list your site , then a 00_% sale fee which they threaten you to pay even when your buyer hasn ' t paid you .
2	the said company obviously took umbridge because i wasn_'_t saying how wonderful they were .
2	ordered some disco lights from a company in london that dpd collected on 0th_december that still havent arrived .
2	another huge joke - the agreement states exchanges within 00days yet i was told a different tale when i asked about exchanging something saying i only had another 0 days for an exchange and they then only hold the credit for 0 weeks or i would lose it all , despite_being away on holiday and being disabled which is why we were going away while the bathroom was being fitted .
0	but 0 week after order placed still no sign of order , i had to email them which in fairness was answered within_00hrs to be told manufacturer issues , fine no issue with that but to have been contacted to tell me this would have been nice , couldn ' t give me a delivery time .
0	after dragging their heels , - not recieving emails , unable to open pictures sent i was asked to return the chair at m y own_expense .
0	nabru could not promise when the sofa was delivered but tas the courier advised i would get it on monday 00 / 00 / 00 and was delivered as promised .
0	telephones not being answered , online email messages not answered and the online_chat makes you wait a very long time between each interaction .
0	we placed our order on friday 0th with express delivery as the method of postage .
0	i was looking for a doll ( like a you & me or a babyborn ) for my niece , however i get loads of pointless results for action men , stuffed toys , and even the odd completely random item .
0	using seven seas has certainly not been a simple_task .
2	onlookers must have been loving the embarrassment i felt .
2	the delivery_men were really helpful , phoned when they were half an_hour away and easily got up some awkward steps at the front of my house that other delivery drivers have ' huffed ' about .
2	i bought the three seater electric recliner sofa and chair after spending much time deliberating in the shop - the most expensive there .
0	tina hxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
0	kind_regards
0	that ' s funny as i have looked online and can knock it down almost £ 0000 ?
2	you ' d think if they knew they had a computer problem and they knew items were not being delivered , they would contact the customer rather then make me stay home all day waiting for an item that wasn_'_t going to be delivered .
2	the service from sport and speed has_been excellent .
2	name brand bin bags , without the inflated prices .
0	so i replied and said " your reply was far from helpful .

2	would definitely recommend .
0	would definitely_recommend to anyone
2	first , the ticket never arrived as it was lost in transit !
2	massive savings even if you do not visit a lot of attractions and much_easier than standing in queues .
0	also the envelopes they send seem to go down after a time , you start with 0 , you send back the 0 films in 0 envelopes and they put 0 new films in the same envelope so you down to one and then they say you can send them back in a freepost_envelope you have to buy yourself !
0	i booked it in my girlfriend ' s name .
0	errrrm no !
0	a ++
0	elle est réactive , professionnelle , douce et disponible . tout ce dont on avait besoin .
0	they offered no compensation or better model , and as i ' ve had several gigs and had to borrow or pay to hire amps for them , it ' s ridiculous !
2	just a bad bad_experience , and i have used them regularly for a good few_years to know this .
0	update_: i haven ' t responded to your reply because as stated i ' ve cancelled the order because you are incompetent .
0	a pair of ' premium leatherette leggings ' i bought i can hardly wear as the waistband just falls down .
0	it took several emails to the sales department to find out what was happening .
0	de producten zijn namelijk wel van goede kwaliteit .
0	it jams logs sometimes and they dont have as much sport events as bet000
2	great prices great choice of products & quick delivery .

0	pretending to care by posting a reply after the horse had bolted is clearly pointless and highlighted by many other reviews .

2	i bought a geberit wall mounting wc and a vanity_unit .
0	great business_model they have !

2	flight , hotel were fine .
0	will be recommending to my other business friends :)

2	i decided to book an appointement near a location i was going on holiday , but on the day of the appointment i was called to say the replacement windscreen had not been delivered to the autoglass centre .
0	this procedure cost me a staggering £_0k , i may as well of thrown that money in a bin .
2	all over their site they say " there is no such thing says free shipping "- hahaha implying that everyone_else is ripping you off for shipping_costs .
2	why invent a fictitious order for 00 / 0 / 00 at a time when i was at work & never emailed an order ?
0	moonpig are pretty handy , but i wouldn ' t rely_on them as a last_minute option , as their urgent delivery is a little too pricey .

0	and , 0 polishes in 0 package when the limit is now 0 per package !

2	despite all the items appearing in my order history when i phoned to seek help i was told i would have to re - enter them all again to place an order .
2	( they are continuing to sell this product online ).
2	however , after my front mech seized & had to be replaced , they fitted an inferior alivio unit rather_than a like - for - like deore !
2	everytime they have met or exceeded the best price i can find .
0	i do hope this matter gets resolved quickly as i would like to continue using the website as the clothes really are a good value for money .
0	what ' s really frustrating is i had £_00 or more of credit with them , i think they prompted me to add credit to my account , but then when i went to place an order with them little over a year later all of my credit had mysteriously " expired ".
2	i would suggest anyone staying here to pop across to tescos , a stones throw_away , and get all you need for less_than half the price .
0	vanessa carroll help - 0_stars service
0	this badly creased the reciept as well as the item , when i say badly if i ' d made an effort to do it badly i wouldn ' t have been able to match his expertise .
2	i think they assume we will give up if we get no response .
0	just in terms of constructive criticism , the website itself is sized quite small , leaving a huge_amount of white space on the right hand size of the screen ( on all pcs i ' ve visited it on ), and also it would be helpful if the actual hostel ' s contact details were clearly on display on their respective pages .
0	only a decent price will bring me back , and only if i ' m in no hurry to receive it .
0	i made an order and i received it the very next_day .
0	i think it would be much_better if all price plans were transparently shown on the website rather_than having to have to direct contact with trustpilot in order to receive a quote
0	extremely disappointed as it appears one inefficient depot does spoil the bunch .
2	having paid £_00 + for it .
2	they then inform me that there is nothing further that they can do and that this is now an insurance claim , i advise them that this is not an insurance case and that this is fraud and ask what they are going to do about it , i am informed to take it up with the insurance department so the buck is passed on further and i , my business and my customer can go and get *******
2	my order was delivered very quickly and the items were very good value .
0	surround_sound : absolutly terrible , there was glue all over it where it looks_like some toddler had stuck it all together .

2	i had pretty_much worked out what flights and train journeys we needed to book but thought i ' d just call to check if a discount would be available in recognition of the number of flights involved .
0	i have now had three follow on calls , even after i cancelled my order trying to upsell some rubbish internet security package without which apparently i will be in grave danger , and it is way better_than norton and mcaffee which they have had a lot of complaints about , apparently .
0	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
0	so in a nutshell , gameguideworld are selling stolen goods .

0	a decent operation , like my credit_card company , would refund first then look_into it .
0	after informing watchfinder of the problems , we exchanged some emails and agreed a solution - email exchange was a little slower for sorting_out an issue than it was forming the deal .
0	give the user the option to choose the type of delivery they like .
0	so i didn ' t have any information about the satement .
2	product - just what i wanted |

0	what a joke !
0	i did experience minor issues with deliveries but neither were within the sphere of influence of table - tennis - tables . co . uk .
0	they lost a star , because i openly / passively said " this is what i get for using a not well_known company ", to which that tugged a few strings and i received a very rude reply " excuse me , we are well_known , we have been in business for many years serving clients who are extremely happy with our service , that is completely wrong ". upz . did i hit a nerve ?
2	but after contacting customer_services it was put right in a proffesional way .
2	never again , truly shocking !

0	i am now expected to take unpaid time off work to accept their 0 - week late delivery , and i will also have to unassemble and move my old bed myself ( as i said , i am a girl in my 00s and i ' m not great at diy or lifting ).

2	don_'_t be conned into using the express service , it won_'_t be much_quicker_than normal post , at_least then you won_'_t feel slightly ripped_off having wasted money on an " express service " that is anything but express .
2	it is far too hard to sort_out the transactions that dont track properly of which i have had six this year .
0	this really is not good customer_service ; making claims that delivery will happen and doesn ' t then being charged for nabrus incompetence .

2	what i read online was what i found out for myself .
0	i ' m sure it wasn ' t their fault – and their support staff was helpful when i contacted them asking for an update – but if you want your game in a hurry you can ' t rely_on them to deliver it super_fast .

0	after_reading the other reviews i learned that this company is not a uk company .
2	on opening the package i found the item was damaged and have found it very difficult to resolve the matter .
2	but did not like the pushy_sales on service contracts .
2	they support sucks they have no intrest at all .
2	although customer service was fast to reply , and there were no issues as such with my order , it seems a bit_slow to have to wait ten days for just a magazine .
0	this is a complete scam company .
2	they emailed to say the bed would be delivered on the 0th_august .
2	i joined first_utility because of their advertising the roll out of ' smart_meters ', two years later and they have now stated that the roll - out is not going to happen . my rate was changed to a different rate without my knowledge and despite providing online meter_readings my bills are still being estimated , attempted to contact them but am getting an_automated_reply stating ' due to an unprecedented level of interest , responses are taking longer_than usual - we will do our best to respond to your enquiry as quickly as possible .
2	nothing arrived .
0	and the prices were good too !
0	i went to the store 0 times and it still hadnt arrived .
2	the assistance i received from the staff at hifi_tower was fantastic .

2	i emailed them a couple of questions and they responded in minutes .
2	he said someone would call me back .
2	as a first - time buyer , i found the prices to be good , the delivery excellent and general buying experience to be good .
0	its all good and well saying " great i get my insurance £ 0 cheaper_than the other_places " however as far as i am concerned i may as well have thrown that money away because im never going to get my phone back .

0	delivery was fast as always and i will_continue to buy from the store .
2	like black holes , the mere existence of this company is a complete and utter mystery to me .
2	i have been trying to get a refund on the 00 day terms of refund . customer service is hopless . and unhelpfullhave been misinformed about returning item to store . for refund . not straight_forward as led to belive wasted hours going back to store to get this refund , still trying
2	i followed your instructions but still could not connect .
0	i had unwittingly grown used to eating chicken_breast which had been bloated on water by money - hungry supermarkets , and so was very pleased when i cut into one of the enormous chicken_breasts from westin_gourmet and found it to be just pure meat !
2	it did arrive , but they had sent 0 top parts , the reason i knew this was because the bottom part should have had a draw - no drawer present .
0	i am not sure why the difference in time .
0	0 . hang_up on you
0	gave my new supplier a fake and much over estimated reading .
0	the flexibility , price point and off the peg quick sofa all seemed very appealing .
0	we planned to visit the lake in detail and hire a boat from keswick launch company .
2	now despite getting the automated_reply , and then a read receipt for my emails , no one will reply .
0	they replied to say it was out of stock , but more should be in soon .
0	they sell seats .
0	i love using beautybay , i think it ' s such an easy website to navigate and they always stock the best products for such a good price .
0	you also seem to respond to any criticism like a 00 year_old girl .
2	they didn_'_t deliver or ring me ( clearly they have my number as they texted me ), i checked the dpd website , that says the driver couldn_'_t find the address .
2	have spoken to argos customer_services every day from the 0rd , they will not let me have my money back , i keep being told that there is a problem with their system which won_'_t let them authorise a refund , has to be the technical_department .
0	as i was making my order on the online designer , it went fine .
0	i had an issue with an item arriving broken , without delay a replacement was sent and arrived a few_days_later .
0	i have even bought a few returned items from them at a discount and they always arrived and worked like new .
0	the customer_service person was extremely polite and contacted the warehouse to amend my order .
0	so , the resolution was , wait another 00_minutes for said food . er , no actually , id rather starve . luckily i got a full_refund , but seriously , they could put that on the webpage & inform the supplier to email them / us if they cancelled thinking it was a hoax .
2	one was water damaged and was to be investigated .
0	i love asda most of the time , but in store things seem to be missing from the shelves a lot more_than usual and when ordering online they seem to often send lots of items that are going out of date very soon after deliver , which makes doing your weekly_shop online a bit pointless .
0	i ' ve studied sage on - line for about 0 - 0 hours a day and finished it in about 0 weeks , of course u can go back and look again at what u are not sure !
2	they had tried to deliver it the day before ( monday ) but since it was attempted at 0 : 00 and it was my work address there was no one there .
2	i was promised a credit to my account but have not heard from them after agreeing to that offer .
0	men tjek det ud - det_er besparelsen værd at bruge lidt ekstra tid på at finde det man leder efter !
0	but never again .
0	comparing it to the pictures on their website , it was the same so i must assume that their product description is incorrect .
2	this company promises every but delivers on nothing . order placed 00th_january with a 0 to 0 day delivery , but after waiting for over a month ( with usual long list of excuse e_- mail ) i cancelled this order their response was this dear customer , dated 0th_march
2	fine if you know your exact size and can purchase a pair of shoes without having to go through the nightmare of a return !
0	at that point , after contacting their levenshulme store again for the umpteenth time and complained as i had been the first person to try and buy these , " riz " confirmed that their technical_team had identified a fault connecting with the 0 d secure payment stage and that this other person couldn ' t pay for these either .
0	delivery can be very patchy and amazon expect you to wait 0 weeks before declaring it missing
0	i haven ' t contacted them through the phone yet because i ' ve had no_problems , but then again if you were to find a different network_provider you ' ll probably have same issues .
0	as we enetered the brand_new awa barcelona hostel central hostel we felt at home , sean the guy in the reception gave us the best speach ever about barcelona , to keep us safe from the pick pockets and guide us how we can see all the importants sites in barcelona by walking few minutes cause the place is just in the midle of the center and as they published .
0	since my last review ( see below ) i have contacted the one . com support_team ( specifically a lady_called stéphanie ) who was extremely_helpful in understanding the situation and offering a extremely reasonable mid - ground by cutting the additional_charges that added onto my bill and charging me the correct amount for an additional years subscription ( what i wont be using as have cancelled my account but i understand that i was a fault for not checking my account had successfully been cancelled , so was happy to pay for ).
0	best part they have anything you could ever need

2	this is incredible - it seems that they may have lied about stock to prevent a refund .
0	royal_mail leaves a card telling you where your package is and how to collect it .
0	every problem i have had using your company has been down to them ,
2	they find me the best deals and i have never had any_problems .
2	item ( an sds drill ) arrived with inadequate and torn packaging .

0	sure enough the following_morning , it arrived safe and sound .
2	keep the big supermarkets on their toes aldi
0	paypal fee ' s should be included in the price of ebay fee ' s , only people using it as a payment system for non ebay items should pay .

0	they really helped make our holiday .
0	i recieved my items extremely quick and they are brilliant .

0	after being given a sim only contract at a good price and assured that i could cancel it with 00 days notice with notice , i proceeded to use it for about 0 months .
0	i give a 0 star .
0	the website is terrible i have to say .
0	their website could use some updating as it ' s not the most user - friendly , but it gets the job_done .
2	i and a friend of mine have used sweatband a number of times and have no issues over the quality and pricing of the goods which are excellent .

2	i shall never order from them again .
2	i then tried to return it as faulty but they insist that i need to send it recorded delivery , at my expense , and if ( i think it will be when ) they find it not faulty , they then insist that i have to go and fetch it within 0 days .
2	no one had informed us that it had been cancelled by qantas yet we had asked for our flights to be monitored as we were travelling extensively .
0	i have bought several games from onlinekeystore .

2	morgenbordet er heller ikke hvad det har været , røræget er meget bastand , det bør være blødt og saftigt , der mangler bacon . brødet især wienerbrødet har fået for meget varme . de blødkogte æg var gode , samt det frisk bagte rugbrød .
0	price did not change for me however .

2	i balked a little at the £ 0 +_vat but was told that was because it was next_day delivery , so reluctantly i sucked it up .
2	no matter how i tried , even posting them my receipt and acknowledgement , they just reply chapter & verse a generic reply of no use nor ownership of the mess up .
0	excellent priced items .
2	half the tv in the seats didnt work , no vegan option for food , a 00 hour flight with no food . come on . it dont take much to cater for veggies and vegans these days

2	the gtech multi is not in the same league . very , very disappointed it is just powerful enough to pickup household dust and is not powerful enough compared to my cheap electric hand vacuum for car carpets .
0	first_impressions - brilliant .
0	i have been awaiting a parcel and have found the online tracking_system very vague .
2	since completion of the store , i have come to realise that moving things around is now one of the new permanent features of the store .
2	this company didnt confirm my booking until after i traveled even after numerous_emails to request the details .
0	i love the website , its very easy to use .
2	i would normally expect some positive_feedback from the recipients but i have only heard from one whose flowers were very poor quality , with some stems broken and blooms " nearly dead " - very disappointing and a poor reflection on the charity '_s intentions .
0	i ' ve used face the future on three occasions and every time the product has arrived quickly and as advertised .
0	i have been using since 0000 and also recommended others to do so - i am now hesitant in recommending have had to chase 0 of my last 0 transactions -
0	but the story dosent end there . then they say weve got keys post them up £_00 . 00 but no way to buy them on the site i ask on facebook how to the as if by magic the price goes to £_00 . 00 and you can buy it what a joke !!!!!
2	now awaiting delivery in yet anothert week of new replacement part to be able to build the bed .
0	never used them before , so i check the reviews out in trustpilot and most of them were good .
0	like many others , tried to sell an iphone 0 00gb , was originally_quoted £_00 and today they ' ve received and tested the phone and due to ' water_damage ' and a very minuscule mark on the screen that i knew about , they now want to offer me £ 0 . 00 for it !!!
0	they then_proceeded to lie about trying to contact me and closed_down a helpline , even_though they knew they had sold myself , and probably others fraudulent tickets .
2	needless to say , i shall not be using your company again and will be ensuring family and friends are aware of my experience .
0	it ' s just a shame you have to have an entire week free to find what you want !
2	they have offered to change the rooms but you have declined this .
0	ok so i browsed a few different websites and came_across a lovely bunch of flowers on serenata , ordered was happy to pay nearly 00 pounds .
2	i tried_calling but nobody ever answers .
2	now in hands of small_claims court .
2	another £_000 on the price .
0	i will wait_until next month but only because i can - i would hate for someone who was in a financial predicement to do business with orange as they don ' t really care .
0	no loss obviously .
2	i placed an order on line with serenataflowers . com the site was easy to navigate and i received an_immediate email conformation of order .

0	i didn ' t actually use my account at all , got a email requesting to cancel or my account would renew .
2	since then despite several emails to the person who responded to me and via their website i have heard_nothing from them at all .
2	i did receive a £ 0 refund which was done quickly .
2	in fact i took my time made the right choice with the help of samples that they sent prior to me ordering .
2	another week has_gone past and still nothing called a third time and told no sure on when stock would be in .
2	prices are extremely_competitive and insurance is good .
0	0 days_later i gave in and called protect_your bubble , having heard_nothing from them .
0	krakow ’_s that good i went twice .
0	i think the focus of this company is quantity of purchases - it doesn ' t seem like they have invested much in their website .

0	ordered maxx essentials mct which was in stock according to their website .
2	you even get points when you buy food , which we used to do every friday , i spent my points on something and i am still_waiting for the goods ( 0 years nearly ) everytime i ask they say they are still sorting it out .

2	i wanted to ask them if their lynx tail lx000 & their double bearing pitch slider came with the fittings to connect from their tail to the pitch slider & from their pitch slider to my microheli weighted blades , as the photos did show any , nor were any shown on their site , did one have to use the links from the original units ?.

2	a follow - up call an_hour or so before delivery made sure i was ready , and the actual delivery and installation , including disconnection and removal of my old machine was completed within 00_minutes .
0	so my advice is simple .
0	where the image stretches across my chest , it is all jagged and looks terrible !!

0	delivery was on time .
0	i am always happy with the prices and the delivery times .
0	never had any downtime , neither has a friend who has a separate tsohost account .
0	for this kind of business there is no need for direct contact with a human and i would rather trustpilot spent their money on making a better automated online experience instead of hiring salespeople to bother me with calls i don ' t want or need
0	maybe if i could fly with a different airline i might think again .
0	i just don ' t understand !
2	best delivery i '_ve ever had and you know where your parcel is and exactly when it will be delivered , outstanding service .

0	i also tried to contact them via the live_chat but they ' re never online , so i had to fill a form on their website and send it in but no reply at all .
2	as previously mentioned , my husband lost a day ’_s holiday from work which i understand you usually compensate with £_00 , i had to take an additional day ’_s leave so what do we get for the downright rudeness of your employee wally and the incompetence of your surveyor ?
0	- i had to pay for two meals in australia , which are at_least twice more_expensive than the meals in korea .

2	the radiators were picked_up and returned , and we ordered 0 different ones , steel and robust .
0	tak
2	customer service is very poor it took 00_hrs for somebody to email me back , you cannot track your order on their site and when i rang up their telephone system apparently suffered a technical fault as i was explaining my issues and went down .
0	selectspecs has a love - it - or - hate - it reputation on the internet ' s reviews .
2	howecer this time i have been charged twice from my bank_account for the holiday -- not good .
2	in total it took 0 working_days to arrive .

2	thankyou very much !
0	unfortunately , the same cannot be said for anything which needs to be plugged in to a socket .
2	they were polite .
2	delivery two days earlier then promised !
2	they obviously don_'_t like
2	i was nervous to even call , but the voice on the other end made me feel comfortable and then did something really special .
0	like many services , all is well until you need to actually speak to someone .
0	the site is not well_laid_out , not very user_friendly .
0	from the onset our site was set_up ready to use , no hassle and no issues .
0	hands_down unbeatable_prices .
0	i contacted the company and even_though the worktop had been sat in our dining_room for a month before i started to prepare it , the company agreed to replace the worktop .
0	i order medication for my parents dog after being charged over the odds at the local vets , not only as the medication cheaper , the customer_service was faultless .

2	i have ordered photo_books from several sources but the one i made at photoworld was the best for flexibility of design .
2	i had just had my tyres checked at a tyre supplier garage and they said they will need renewing in the near_future but were ok for a while yet .
2	it was delivered quickly with no hassle .
0	thank_you very much & i would use this again .
2	if you don_'_t , be warned , you are heading for a nightmare and there will be lots that comes between you ( your_sanity ) and your ' perfect sofa '
2	i appreciate it is difficult for trustpilot to monitor all reviews being added to their site so beware and make_sure you read a good sample of reviews before making your final_decision on a companies online reviews .
2	i just wish they didn_'_t use parcelforce who at best are unreliable .
0	after making an order online i rang to make a small change ( tariff ) to my pre_- order for a sony_xperia z , the rep i spoke to said they couldnt amend my order , all they could do was cancel and resubmit it but i was more concerned to hear my application had not been accepted and i had not been contacted despite having made this order 00 days earlier !
2	the online service made a arduous task simple and effective .
2	this includes any vat and any duty that maybe added .
2	thanks mazuma x
0	a second_hand doll still in excellent condition would cost me half as much as a newly bought one from my local toy shop .
0	always a top choice to order games online
2	fortunately item turned_up just in time !
0	i ' m not interested and i don ' t want anything from you .
0	i ' ve contacted both companies only to get no response they took my money and i never got the item i would recommend you stay_away from this money stealing website
2	i however feel that going back to my original , more_expensive order was ' sharp_practice '.
0	he fitted the new one and the heating was working again which was great .
0	would have preferred none .
0	within 00_mins i had all the option presented to me and chose which i thought best , i even switched my business card printing to them there and then .
2	an_email was sent to advise of my concern .

2	will sort transfers out my self next time .
2	last_week i tried to purchase salter knife sharpener , although it was in the old and new catalogue they were not able to supply it .
0	i still_haven ’ t received the second item of my order despite being told by iwantpants . com that it would be dispatched after a week ( see response below on 00 . 00 . 00 ).
0	this is a complete_joke and i will never use this service again / discourage anyone i know from using your awful company .
2	i phoned with a query & the girl was very polite & knowledgeable so i feel like we ' re in safe_hands .
0	i would estimate there is a profit in there for the administrators but not as much as you might think .
2	ordered an ixus 00 canon digital_camera on 0th_august_0000 .
2	so a big fail for me .
2	for instance_:
2	last_year they offered a lower payment cause i never upgraded to another phone when contract ended .
0	i am not a fanboy from comodo but i must to say i never will be infected while i use it , now i use it , is my third year and i am a happy usser whith the product , but i think you have a lot of things to improve .
2	thank_you for your excellent service .
2	have bought a few things via amazon and so far have no_complaints .
0	the website was slow and sometimes non - co - operative and in the end , we ordered .
2	good experience
2	checked tracking link and yes it had been delivered .
2	after 00 e_- mails and two official complaints i eventually suggested that they cancel the original order and reorder for me ( why didnt they think of this ?)
2	beware purchasing from them if you may need help after they have your money .
2	but the cube was a different_story !!
2	thank_you x
0	the package was finally delivered to the " new address " 0 days late and missed the customers event the goods were needed for so rendered useless so a refund was made from our company .
0	please anyone thinking of joining sky don ' t as you will be disappointed , very

0	outfit generally good apart_from problem with hat
2	d . d . sawdon
2	great .
0	they never phoned back so after 0days i emailed them and they phoned my partner again saying we had had it delivered and again they would ring back about it .
2	next_day delivery i always feel is excellent but dpd go even better and give you a 0 hour time_slot !
2	jacket quality was poor and too short .
2	still having problems getting into my virgin_media after a year of trying .
2	!
0	would use again and recommend to others
2	the next thursday i called again and was told definitely next week .
0	the worst part was that they tore off the label to hope that we would not be able to recognise that it was the wrong one and a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for .
2	although i bought the bay link " sleeves ", i decided to join the 0 bays with nut , bolt & washers ( as allowed by big_dug instructions ), for a very secure fit .
2	different stories from different " customer service " representatives .
0	i received the email two days_later then expected after 0 more phone_calls .
2	in my opinion they are great value , good quality and i would recommend them every time .
0	i have recycled two iphones in the past with a different company and received perfect service , received exactly the same amount i was quoted and received my money quickly .
0	he told me to call him back in 00_mins because he was in the post_office que .
2	this was the first transaction they were doing on shiply , perhaps you should check them out more thoroughly before allowing them onto your site .
0	i did have to chase delivery as well so i ' ve knocked another star off for that .
0	does look like they even have insurance for anything like scams ridiculous !
0	overall great experience with this company .
2	update - trustpilot has put my review back up , good , but still not sure why they took it down in the first place , but have given them 0_stars now instead of 0 .
2	order delayed by security check involving sending copy of latest utility_bill which i provided on the same day as the order .
0	phoning around midday they said my flights had been cancelled - still with no clear explanation .
2	very arrogant in their dealings with the public .
0	no option to invulnerability browser
0	without us , you will lose out in the long run !
2	time wasted trying to find it then they said go_ahead and park and they would tel manager .
0	i have a contract with o0 as well and have been for 00 years which will_definately stop at the and of the contract .
2	the only down_side is that ( as in most stores ) it can be difficult to find an assistant if you need help .
2	thanks very much brian howes
2	i read recently that ebay dealt_with more than £_000 , 000 , 000 in a twenty_four hour period .
2	and there we have it , i now have to pay to get my items back , there is no refund for late delivery ( 00_hrs took 0 days ) and yodel are two different companies , with two tracking_numbers and probably too many chiefs and not enough indians .
0	in the end though we just ended_up going back to a club that we found the previous night as we knew it was a good place .
2	i am looking for a simple cost_effective drop - off service and interparcel is just not consistent enough .
0	it got collected on the 0th_feb_0000 , we didn ' t hear from babythings0u so we rang on the 00th_feb , finally received an_email on 00th and still_awaiting refund over a week_later !
2	the garage did not return any worn parts to me .
2	it was very easy to arrange over the internet , the purchase of the shower door .
0	you can ' t avoid things going wrong sometimes , but i think you get the measure of a company by how they fix things which have gone wrong ; based on my experience with mpb i would have no reservations recommending them to others
0	in the last_year i ' ve sold 0 phones on mazuma and every_single service has been great , prompt efficent and very helpful .
0	!
2	they seem cheaper_than most other_suppliers and the product arrives promptly and well_wrapped .
0	ebuyer has a fantastic layout but seems poorly maintained ( the ' lists ' function has been replacing the catalogue system for a long time now , yet no ' lists ' link exists outside of trying to use the old catalogue function in your account ).
2	having been let_down and highly inconvenienced by amazons failure to deliver , i cannot be anything other than disappointed with them .
0	price smashed everything else i saw - specifically homebase and b_& q , but also ikea .
2	told it would take 0 to 0 days for payment , now been 00 days .
0	this happened year ' s ago .
0	i would , however point out that in their online terms and conditions , they state that a mattress cannot be returned after removing from its packaging for hygiene reasons ; it is impossible to check the quality and suitability for purpose from within the packaging and so the t &_cs could be technically be invalid with reference to the sale of goods_act .
2	they realised that their website was wrong and sent me a lower model tv than i had ordered but did not charge me any less .
2	ordered ski tops for my wife and myself .
2	you can find info here regarding specifications and useful advice .
2	this is the place to go !
2	i have ordered a few things from safercigs and they have always been very good ; good products , good prices and excellent service .
2	brilliant .
2	the options are many for each component and the prices are very reasonable .
0	they ' ll forward my issue and i ' ll hear back from them , then they hung_up phone .
2	pc_world have made the mistake , so why do you have a system which insists on the customer taking time out of their day , petrol costs etc to come back for resolution .
2	or as i say , " all fur coat and no knickers "….
2	i used to use another supplier but they ran_out of stock , and online i found these_guys .
0	lots of competing companies offer free delivery , which is fast and includes tracking to northern_ireland .
2	i bought a android tablet from them but wasn_'_t happy with it i rang them up seven months later and told them this they said no problem send it back next_day it was collected and a little while later i got a full_refund even including my postage i have been shopping with them since they started and have always had a very good service from them ok they might not be the cheapest retailers but you have the knowledge that if you are not happy with the product you will get your money back where else could someone buy a ring and after having it a few_days deciding its not suitable get refunded the purchase price ?
2	as the website was not working i called the call_centre , the person was very helpful but could not get me an_appointment for 0 weeks .
0	i was skeptical from the beginning as all the 0d crystal websites including this one seem so unprofessionally presented - so i am happy with the service i received .
2	i bought the liner to be used when i am carrying a mountain bike in my mondeo with the rear seats folded .
0	it took just over a week for the money to reach my account which i wouldn t call especially fast or slow .
2	i recently_purchased a bathroom_suite from bathstore chelmsford , all went to plan up until delivery day .
2	the car_hire company hertz would not let me have the car as they claimed i was not on the electoral role .
2	can '_t wait_until viovet change their delivery service !
2	despite the order summary of my tablet showing a certain value , with no sign of any delivery charges , days_later i got a letter from dhl asking for £_00 !
0	while the champagne is fine , the courier managed to deliver to the wrong house .
2	i have been with virgin for quite a few_years and am pleased with the service that they have given me .
2	personal thanks to mark & chris
0	i ' m always pleased with fragrance_direct ' s pricing and their shipping is fast , however their packaging is appauling and this is not the first time i ' ve received items that have been damaged due to glass_bottles being left loose with minimal padding in a large box .
2	have switched provider altogether and much happier with my wonderful services and plan .
2	i had to wait 00 min to get trough since it was urgent .
2	phone came back today ( not repaired ) via_royal_mail - thank_you for that .
0	i ' ve really noticed a decrease in cellulite and now have much smoother skin than before using them .
0	they said they would be sent to the correct depot today , to be delivered tomorrow ( only 00_hours after the event they were needed for had finished - therefore , again rendered useless ).
2	way back in early march i ordered a piece of furniture .
0	they got 0_stars because you can place orders quite late for next_day delivery which is pretty_much the only bonus !
2	we are a throwaway society now , so primark suits the uk .
2	my attempt to email then for an update took 00_hours to receive a reply .
2	when i said no was advised that ws would contact the delivery company .
2	goods not received .
0	my friend_recommended me to the site after i had tried other protein drinks from high_street stores .
2	on calling back i was advised that the clear one would be better ( but was made of same material ) and unfortunately out of stock .
0	dangerously when this light came on power would suddenly be lost leading to some very dangerous situations , not good when you have a gf and her 0 year_old in the car , performing what should easily be a safe text - book overtake .
0	fantastic customer_service !
0	obviously ( he said this ).
0	the price was the best in europe , they have absolutely gained a new loyal_customer
2	update_: 0st may 0000 .
2	happy new year .
0	i got £ 0000 finance and paid the rest with cash on the day of order .
0	the monitor is fantastic no_problems with it .
2	returned car on the due date with a full_tank of petrol .
2	our combined energy and telephony charges have gone down so much .
0	i would probably order from them again but i will read the t &_c ' s first .
2	however , they did respond to queries promptly .
0	wired0fire did a great job of making a custom - built_pc .
0	looking for an electric scale i felt annoyed to find the same product almost 00_% cheaper on a similar site .
2	outstanding service and great value for money .
0	will be using regularly from now on .
0	you can do international transfers direct to a bank_account , quickly , with very low fees , at a very good exchange_rate .
0	delivery service used was fantastic , probably the best out of every company i ' ve ever used .
2	called ' service .
2	we booked our car_hire with plenty of room for our_luggage ( argus actually states people and luggage capacity on their website ) and paid .
0	i will have to pay the price the person would pay who just happened to walk in possibly an illegal immigrant with no checkable personal history or credit_rating or anything people could call background .
2	the two fragrances i bought from fragrancedirect were exactly the same as ones which i had previously bought from a store .
2	even the ' contact us ' link on their website does not work !
2	i had particularly wanted 0 x 00 because that was a wheel size offered by seat , so it would keep the insurance company sweet .
2	she gave me the verbal equivalent of a shrug of the shoulders and didn_'_t seem to care that the flowers had been left there for 0 days so look awful or that they should not have been left on the doorstep at all had the delivery instructions on the label been followed - ( if recipient not at home , please leave securely on premises or with a neighbour .
2	i was quite impressed by this service and the quality of the goods once received .
2	i placed this order for a special bouquet of flowers for my mother in law for mother '_s day .
0	then went to another provider and saved £_00 .
0	may not matter to some but when you ' re hearing_nothing from the people who have something of yours with significant value in their possession it ' s slightly unnerving .
2	will_definitely not buy again .
2	stores understaffed .
2	i don_'_t think i '_ve ever trusted a company as much as i do essential nails .
2	in my experience they have the best reception of all the mobile companies i have used .
0	fantastic !
2	useless !
0	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my money here , wont be using again .
0	it ' s just a shame they are so cheap , but in weighing up the pros and cons of using animed_direct , yes i might pay more buying from someone_else , but if i was to get my order quicker then surely paying more for it means nothing in the long run .
0	apart_from that the other 0 things i bought were good , and the delivery time was good .
2	it was my choice to pay the big premium so i can '_t complain_about price , but the complete absence of customer - facing ( accessible ) service is a real flaw in their business_model and should be a real concern to shoppers .
2	the rest of the stay was ok .
2	i am beyond exasperated with iflorist .
0	therefore the package could have easily been stolen if we had not notice it in time .
0	then i asked to speak to the manager , nice guy , but the only thing he could offer me was 00 pounds off the next contract .
0	as with all the zizi ' s you can pretty_much rely_on the food quality , and farnham is no exception .
0	the flowers look nothing like what i ordered on the website .
2	pc did arrive and a few_days in is working well .
0	value for money was brilliant .

0	was in dire need of some more pampers sensitive baby wipes but i like to buy the 00 pack ( anything less seems a waste of time ).
2	my order was a little random , i have a nephew who is 0 years old who is obsessed by my crutches and i have to keep changing the height on mine so he can race around on them pretending he has broken his leg !!!
0	!
2	00_mins later i called back but they had no record of my earlier call and no message had been sent to the driver .
0	terrible service , terrible company and avoid at all cost !
2	on the 00 . 00 . 00 they didn_'_t arrive so i sent an_email to iflorist which was greeted_by a holding reply saying that the florist had delivered . i knew that the delivery address had been occupied all day and that they had not delivered .

0	i contacted musclefood , i received a very poor response advising that i had to enter the code into the special promotions box for which i replied back that it is exactly_what i have done , i received a call a few hours_later advising that i would not receive the extra chicken_breast as i did not enter the code , when i challenged it the advisor suggested that it was my fault and i should have been more careful when processing my first order .
0	i order several items all for gifts to other people and felt the ease of their website was good , the options for delivery were good , the actual arrival time for delivery was exceeded ( always happy with that !)
0	i googled it and ebitsi came back as the cheapest so i purchased them before google changed its mind !
0	la date approche , le stress et l ' envie monte mais avec sara on ce sent déjà rassurer .
0	they have delivered the majority of my items before the actual release_date , with one or two being delivered on the release_date , which is amazing .
0	:)
2	we didn_'_t want that and didn_'_t use it all and it added a lot to the cost we hadn_'_t budgeted for .
2	i was present when my friend telephoned talktalk and was surprised by how many_times she was transferred and more surprised when she had the phone put down on her !
0	that was nearly 0 weeks_ago now and i have sent another 0 emails to which i still_haven ' t heard_anything .
2	fantastic service .

0	not a single complaint , would advise to others and will happily use again in the future .
0	i would definitely_recommend anyone to do courses with e_- careers .
2	serenata was not the first choice , but it will be in future , interflora '_s loss is their gain .
0	resolved quickly and fairly , which saves me from rating a 0 star .
2	i had to consult an electrician to see if it was save just to change the plug into a 0 pin .
2	whilst the cost of trading appears to be relatively_low_cost at £ 0 , the amount they make on the exchange_rates is considerably higher .
2	i will_definitely be a returning customer and would recommend them to anybody .
2	have used cheerful soles before .
2	no apologies by the way .
2	we would highly_recommend sound exposure .
0	my friend used funktionevents because of their good reviews and helpfulness on the phone .
2	every time i have the trauma of getting to an airport at some ungodly hour to stand in a huge snaking line for what feels_like an_eternity to be told the flight is delayed and then when finally boarded to be charged a days wages for an insipid cup of tea with a damp sandwich i tell myself . never never again !!!
0	i had some questions_regarding the layout of our_wedding invites and found the company to be really helpful and provided some good advice .
2	i use ebay a lot , it '_s great to buy , but hellish expensive to sell .
2	a detailed enquiry produced a knowledgeable response with a follow_up email including both the answers to my questions and a video_clip .
2	the website claims show this as being about an inch .
2	apparently , hotels . com only give cashback at full price but the whole point of hotels . com is that their prices are discounted !
0	i wait 0 days for the items to ship before making a call .
2	still not receiving any personal communication , i contested the payment at which point it was handed_over to a debt_collection_agency .
0	additionally , there is no place to add a note or check - in time to the booking , which guest houses generally appreciate knowing .
2	at best they are either extremely poorly organised and trained or at worst they deliberately alter contract lengths , overcharge and confuse imei numbers so you are unable to unblock the phone when moving to another_provider !
2	i rang up again an_hour later and spoke to a different member of staff .
2	never ever again and i am going to make_sure that everyone i know never uses this company .
2	be warned before you buy from this company .
2	now even the lady in our local post_office uses myhermes to send her own parcels and our village supermarket has_become an agent for drop_offs and returns since i sang your praises to the owner .
2	the delivery is quick and efficient , usually a couple of days_later and they have special_offers where you are given discounts and free delivery too .
0	tons of free_stuff .
2	the online order tracking didn_'_t work , the live_chat managed to get me a link that worked - now i know that the courier has had my order for a week and i '_ve had to go to pets at home so that the cats don_'_t starve .
2	a ' technician ' was sent out late in february - it is very difficult to get a response from the company - who declared irreparable .
2	sorry . not impressed
0	very cheap deals and arrived very quickly with superb packaging , would definately buy from here again
0	so i went to aldi to do a bit of shopping , not the supermarket i choose every week as i like to shop around .
0	however i recently had an issue with the caller id not working on the phone and after ringing their customer_services probably a dozen_times they still cannot resolve the issue or even pinpoint as to why the problem is occurring .
2	in the past i have emailed the company with questions and gotten responses in a timely_manner which shows great customer service which to me is one of the biggest parts of sales , no matter what they are .
2	alas , not dispatched until 00th_april and not received ' til 0rd may .
0	issue resolved straight_away , refund issued , i only rang to get mf to have a word with the courier .
0	i would recommend anyone who would like to use the service to create a secure e_- mail account just for use with paypal to avoid scammers / hackers from trying to access your account .
2	most online purchases have a structured delivery charge dependent on how much you are spending with the company - spend less , pay more delivery , which is acceptable and fair .
0	i was unfortunate enough to have to have dealt_with expedia last month , and i swear i will never ever again use this dreadful company even if they became the last travel company on the planet .
0	use at your own peril f - 0 / 0
0	my only small criticism , if i were to have one , was that the prices were a little higher_than other fancy_dress shops but the quality of the out fit was of a higher standard .
0	excellent !
0	i did not exist at my address and my name was nowhere to be found .
0	edit_: flowers arrived this morning , both lots as they replaced them as the original were no doubt pretty dead by now !
2	i was very impressed with parcel0go .
2	warning in which magazine - at_least its their corporate colour .
0	i figured i ' d use my credit_card to pay for it so that in case it was a scam my credit_card company would refund me and help shut_down this site .
0	yes you can find virtually any song you want and its great for finding them hard to find tracks , however itunes does tend to be overpriced !
0	i am_disgusted with the service and couldn ' t be more relived that i cancelled my order prior to it ' s arrival .
2	the service and products from you are first_class and the service was excellent thankyou
2	however i can '_t wear it with all my shoes as it does make them a tighter fit but i mainly wear it for work & those shoes are okay with it .
2	the unit is very well_designed and strong but elegant and practical .
2	!
2	i will not bore readers with all the details as its pretty_much what previous reviews have said .
0	i love google , although i think android is a bit of a grey area as i had an android that was faulty after 0 months .
2	bought a new dish washer from ao . com .
0	ordered 0 wishbone chairs , back in february .
2	the order was processed quickly and , more to the point , i was kept_fully_informed of its progress .
2	overall , the website itself is poor and the range of things available surprisingly small .
2	the print came as ordered and was ok but you can see the edge of the frame through the print , this in my opinion is poor as printed canvases from other_suppliers i have do not have this problem .
2	how many emails does one have to send to get a reply from cex wecare ??
2	a very disappointing shopping_experience .
0	i want my ££££ back !!!!
0	i agree that my email is my responsibility which is why i had emailed them to tell them i hadn ' t heard_anything from them and asked what was going on with my account - this email was sent to them within the 0 days they were supposed to wait for me to accept or decline the offer so they basically knew i hadn ' t received the email but continued to process it anyway ?
2	note - they never call their customers back .
2	good advice given when contacted .
2	cctv covered the incident , but she brazenly persisted with her bullying attitude , protecting the liar of a driver totally .
2	jack hunter
0	and i find it utterly wasteful an ridiculous that anyone upgrades with carphone_warehouse .
0	i ordered and paid for a tunic on 0th_september , expecting delivery in the following week .
0	earned several hundreds of £ buying things i would anyway or on the risk free gambling sites .
2	we bought a fridge_freezer this time .
0	best greetings by emma , too good to be true !
2	they are a network of extremes as i '_ll point out during this review .
0	no real promotions for its players .
2	this is the kicker if your a seller and the buyer chooses not pay you you cant leave negative feeback because thats not fair haaa !!
0	i fully checked through the bag but i appear to have only been sent the tracksuit top and not the bottoms .
2	started off okay , but soon started to lose their colour .
0	customer_service apologised and arranged for another to be sent out which arrived 0 days_later ( total of 00 days ) which was the correct leg .
2	a perfect result .
0	so after receiving an_email_saying my order had been cancelled because of my payment details , which were correct and my bank_account had plenty money in it .
0	i rang the sales_team who instantly informed me of a better deal only available through the sales_team so i took them up on the deal .
0	all costs money , fees , taxes , queue jumping , luggage ( 00 £ for 00kg !!!)
0	jeg_købte en luftrenser hos pixmania efter megen research .
0	i needed to clear away my old cd ' s and dvd ' s as i need the space so thought i ' d use music_magpie as i ' d seen the adverts and the app looked easy to use .
2	the was very good service and good quality product .
0	larger bras can be very expensive so their special_offers are much_appreciated .
2	pleasant helpful staff , i was kept_informed every_step of the way which made it easier than i thought it would be .
0	i would sometimes use your site to compare prices with the accomodation .
0	i am from europe and a company like this would not last for 0 months there .
0	was disappointed on the packaging though as glasses arrived in jiffy_bag with glasses in draw - string bag .
0	here is my story .
0	as the last time i used ukmail to buy an apple product , the status will show fail to deliver .
2	we were in at the time they claim they delivered , and not even a " you were out " card left .
2	topcashback , you should drop hotels . com if they only pretend to offer cashback .
2	world first are first_class , extremely friendly and very helpful customer service and above all excellent prices on insurances packages , will never use anyone_else for our tavel insurance purposes .
2	ordered a toaster via [_external_reference_removed ], yodel tried to deliver to neighbours instead of me , i received the failed delivery card a few_days_later from them .
0	i thoroughly and wholeheartedly_recommend parcel0go to anybody looking for a trustworthy and reliable courier agent .
0	they sent me an_email my order has been shiped and i checked with my wife she said she haven ' t received anything , so i again checked with them they tried to convince me that order has been shipped . atlast i reported it as a scam
2	the mail order sender is of no help either .
2	however , i would say pet_supermarket is efficient and professional .
0	they told me one of the items was out of stock and asked if i wanted them to ship the other .
0	great company to deal with .
0	used for a few_months now , never had any_problems and great prices !
0	only thing is i wish they were able to offer more competitive_prices for shipping to northern_ireland ( still have to use dhl for that ).
2	order no 000000
2	just think how frustrating you feel when you purchase something and the supplier can '_t provide you with a time_slot . provide your customers the same service and flexibility you want as a customer .
0	i will_definitely be ordering again .
2	that will be a no then .
0	contact hassan and i promise you will not be disappointed .
2	i was a little_apprehensive ordering a silver bracelet and charms online as i would usually like to see and feel the products ( jewelry ) before i purchase .
2	i didn_'_t receive any phone_calls at all , but i would probably use your website again to advertise cars for sale .
0	great prices spent over £_000 over 0 months but the anti_fraud system is lame . i understand because it protects getting approved i understand too but not getting approved for the future after 0 times of uploading ids and the docs being accepted each time .
2	what we signed was a satisfaction form to say we were satisfied with the job .
2	the customer service department are excellent , very helpful .
0	the hotel we had was in the city_centre and a very nice looking one with helpful staff and car_park .
2	sure_enough i clicked on the tracking link just after 0 and it was logged as having arrived .
0	would recommend e0p to everyone , great value clothes and shoes , never disappointed .
0	ebay is just an amazing concept !
0	one bunch of flowers arrived a day late , half_dead and looking nothing like i had ordered so we refused the delivery !
0	£_000 they have belonging to me all they keep doing is changing the status of my refund , yesterday it was at refund completed today it says refund queuing on the gateway and will be with you soon !!!

2	these have eventually arrived !
2	also the dvd_player on set - up was in french and when i tried to use the button to change to english settings it did not work .
0	i thought i was gonna have to switch over to att for this phone .
0	also when i add up all the excesses charges and phone bills i have used to try and get hold of protectyourbubble then the cost almost outweighs the near £_000 phone that was " insured "
0	the front glazing was the original glass and the back was ' glazed ' with thin frosted plastic that looked like it had been cut out from a cheap document wallet .
2	i replied that i ' d go to asda in that case , and he just shrugged - apparently . com customers get priority .
0	as i had a fair few questions_regarding the products i sent out emails to snorestore which were promptly replied to .
2	i chose to have precisiontime make adjustments to my watch , but i had to have the watch adjusted again at a local jeweller ( for the same price ) my advice is not to bother with their adjustment service , but go to a local place .
2	and then a massive service charge pr ticket was also added frustrating but we got to see the show and my wife was very happy however she does not know quite how much i paid yet :)
2	in the case of a return , a refund will begin processing once the item is checked for wear , marks or any signs of usage / adjustment .
0	amazing shipping and they are very quick on shipping there items u have to pay for it , but it ' s worth it cause they are really good , i hope i don ' t encounter any_problems s with the item i bought from them as i haven ' t dealt_with their customer_service yet
0	the customer_service has absolutely_terrible , i think i have made about 00 calls to them , each lasting more_than 00_minutes at a time and only ever recieved 0 call_backs after being told each time i would get a call of a manager and on top of the calls about 00 e_- mails have been sent and the only responses i seem to get are generic ' we ' re sorry ' e_- mails , this all started when they gave me incorrect_information over the phone which_resulted_in them not taking payment from my account and charging me a fee , not all i asked was for them to pay half the fee and i ' ll pay the other half . that was 0 months_ago :( very unhappy and stressed out !!!!
2	lovely hotel great staff smashing food so whats missing . ah yes the generator that will keep you up all night with the drone and whine
2	a third set of lenses were ordered , this time the tailor - made ones .
0	thats it !
2	but what i am no satisfied is a i sent a email to chemist help_desk services on my order and till now none had replied my mail , in my opinion no trustful services .
2	this company is the 0000 '_s web equivalent .
0	will buy again !
2	was given constant_updates on progress and most impressive were the actual dispatch and delivery details that were spot on .
0	nice one !
2	when i spent over 00_mins on their automated expensive customer call number , i ws informed that the mattresses was missing in transit so would not be delivered as planned and another date for me to stay in doors from 0 - 0 pm ( no am or pm delivery approx time is given ) on friday was given to me .
0	would probably buy again as good value
0	i received an_automated_response email when i sent my first query to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk which was nice , just notifying me that they had received my email , and would be in touch shortly .
0	i call citylink and the person i speak to says they were sent to the wrong depot ( for no apparent_reason other than stupidity ).
0	which brings me to the only slight negative with party_krakow .
2	update_: it looks_like the years interest free credit will have run out by the time we have a complete kitchen .
0	i assumed this was an oversight as the person mentioned there was only one t in my name on the bank_details so i went back online to resubmit the application .
0	i had to take a morning off work ( unpaid ) to wait in again after the failed saturday delivery .
2	obviously they don_'_t hold stock , they simply try to get their suppliers ' to drop ship .
0	it ' s a shame cos they seem a good company .
2	over the years i have had to contact ebay customer service a few_times and have never been happy with the service .
0	i will re - rate on the 00th of february .
0	ordered cash and currency card .
2	it '_s quite wrong for people to assume things , causes all_sorts of problems .
2	this company is very reliable and give a great discount .
0	clean easy to navigate site , massive_range of drawing utensils , the pencyclopedia explaining everything about pens and pencils , and the feeling that these people are here to help and not to clean out your wallet .
0	thanks for helping me turn into the animal i strive to become !
0	again in the future !
0	if you feel that you are getting a bargain for items that you have not seen in the uk , think again shopping with this company will most_likely cost you twice as much than you would pay for the items in the uk and they will do nothing to help you rectify the situation .
0	it is a great service - so quick and efficient .
0	kind rigards

2	many_thanks
2	the website is so easy to use , you just pick what you want and when you run out , you refill the order without even having to think about it and it '_s there the next_day .

2	next_day free delivery was a bonus .

2	these items fetch a premium_rate and are “ worthwhile ” faking .
2	can '_t say more .
0	i recently_bought a pre_- owned guitar , so there was only one in stock which showed when i ordered online .
2	added to this i would say the vodafone website is among the worst around with little or no focus on what customers actually want , rather what vodafone think they need .
2	the wheelie bags were delivered within two days which for the higland location is very impressive .
2	keeping my fingers_crossed where my refund is concerned .

2	the fact is you can try to save what probably amounts to about 0 - 0 % on a regular ticket , or you can pay the extra 0 % and get it through the airline direct .
2	three days_later i received a termination letter telling_me that as i had applied to a new isp they would now be disconnecting my phone and broadband , even_though i am paid up to date .
0	how is it that they can take your money for a month and not delivery what you paid for ?

2	i purchased a cd key a few_days ago and found it all to be quite a straightforward process so i highly_recommend this company .

0	the idea behind the website is great and it is very helpful to find someone to help with a move , but the website / company seems kind of dodgy at times .
0	the sandwood 0 + 0 tent is £_000 cheaper_than many other outdoor shops .
0	i understand there are it issues but having recommended the company to other people i am starting to regret it !
2	however , i am still_waiting for the incorrect item to be collected , despite_being given two dates , the courier is still not here 0 weeks after :(((((
2	" once we receive the glasses , we will contact you to explain the cause of the fault ," - yadda yadda yadda - they were poorly put_together - no explanation necessary - rubbish quality doesn_'_t have to be " explained ".

0	in addition to this , they keep me informed of special_offers - and exclusive ones too .
0	their adverts currently state " we ' ll buy every car " and going by the standard they ' ll sell you any as well , even if it ' s clearly full of faults , as by the time you notice somethign isn ' t right it ' s too_late .
2	would use again and definitely recommend to others .
2	which is , frankly , ridiculous .
2	asked if i could speak to a manager and she would not put me through , asked if any body regulates them and raj refused to answer .
2	my account states that i have been paid , alas my bank_account says not !
0	i emailed to tell them this was incorrect and as it was couriered in then they courier must have lost some boxes .
2	disappointing experience overall .

0	sometimes they ' re great and items arrively quickly and safely - other times , not so much .

2	my phone ( n000 ) failed over the easter_weekend and i needed a replacement urgently .

2	my electrician told me that is unit was dangerous as the dust , being conducting could be lethal if it got wet ( it was laying all over the floor ) and was stepped on .
0	finally a company who treats the customer like they ' re kings !
2	but their meat is usually excellent - so even if you can match the price you need to be sure that you are also matching the quality .
2	!
2	nice_touch on including some free plectrums !
0	if you want your parcel to arrive on a day you expect it do not use dpd .

2	i originally put 0 tickets up for sale on this website .
2	i am especially worried by a few of these reviews that suggest that products might not be the genuine_article .
0	awful customer_service .
2	clearer and more upto_date information would have meant a more relaxed shopping_experience .
2	i know you get what you pay for but this tablet that was once owned by noah was £_00 more then the cheapest i had reviewed and the tablet specs spoke for them selves .
0	i suggest calling before purchasing to check their stock_availability is correct .
0	transferred to solicitor who would handle claim and half my information had been input incorrectly so was a lengthy process to have to go through most of my details for a second time when i had already done so in the original phone call .
2	needs some serious attention to detail .
0	so you can try by the products elsewhere thinking it ' s in stock , get charged , then the same_thing , they finally tell you they own the companies too
2	i understand_why it was done from a commercial point of view ( people saying they had not had a delivery when they had etc_etc ) however , it was an utter invasion of privacy as the delivery team did not , at the point of delivery , tell me they were taking pictures .
2	a totally_inadequate response from vodafone , with more effort seemingly devoted to sending you up repeated blind alleys , than actually providing a simple number .
0	perfect service , perfect quality and perfect_timing !
2	i called my grandma and she was delighted w her plant that she received !!
0	they had two contact numbers for me and an_email address and none of these were contacted .
0	outstanding support - excellent website design - fantastic system - perfect .

0	this is aggrevating as it is messing up my supplementation so hopefully my friend ' s order comes sooner_than mine did .
0	they could not understand_why expedia were being so difficult .
0	i called customer_service , and the lady said they were sorry but there was nothing they could do about it , and this lady was just rude .
2	having said that , when it did arrive it was extremely well_packaged and the delivery man was happy to lift it over my threshold whereby i could slide it into the house .
2	ok , we had to put on the legs ourselves but that was easy .
2	i was told that snow was to blame a week ago .
2	was surprised at the range of items available , and the prices were good too .
0	after 0 days ( no contact from babydino ) called them just to be informed that i have to wait six_weeks for goods to be delivered .
2	very well_packaged , would use again and would highly_recommend .
2	talk 0 . 0 has_been invented !
2	i think they have stopped using trustpilot as the site they point their website to for testimonials due to some recent critical reviews .
2	however , compared with other_websites , their prices were way lower_than that of their competitors so i risked it .
0	they are cheap yet very reliable .
0	i ' d never used game seek before nor heard of them when i purchased the ps0 for my son ' s birthday but i thought why not and the price was a whopping £_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else !!!
2	we then get a phone_call to say that our suite hadnt even been made and that the delivery was not going ahead .
2	however when i sat down to do so and i read the small_print i found that the insurance did not cover ' food spoilage ' and if the unit had to be replaced that was the end of the cover .
2	good communication but if you want it asap keep an eye on your emails after you place order so that you can send a copy of utility_bill and avoid adding to lead time .
2	i had absolutely no_problems with my order .
2	the staff were knowledgeable , personable , and courteous , and put me completely at ease .

0	it is insulting to know that i have waited that long of time where if i had found out 0 days earlier , i still would have had enough time to order some clothing for a cheaper price and it was one of my prefered items which i felt i had to have .

0	the build_quality is great and so is the delivery service .
0	very happy with the item and the delivery time .

2	please do not be_fooled by viagogo '_s claim that they give a 000_% guarantee .
0	as we both work full time , we dealt mostly with michelle over email and she was very quick to respond to us , the service overall was just brilliant !
2	please to say that packaging was what one would expect - almost no chance of damage .
2	the first_class lounge is nice .
2	i concede that they have a good product but that '_s where it ends .
2	just about a perfect outcome , i ' m very happy with my purchase and the service i got .
2	our washing_machine recently packed up , so checked online .
2	i received it 0 days_later .
2	the reason for this is that i took a second , and third , opinion about the pre_- surgery , , outcome of the surgery and post treatment .
2	it did finally come and on time , lets_hope it works after christmas and for many_years .
2	but the worst part was the lack of information - no - one seemed to know what was happening .
0	unfortunately the item was not suitable , superfi refused refund even after many emails and emailing manager .
0	i went online to see if i could find an address for the local_depot - nothing .
0	wren conveniently just apologised , sent me screws after the installation and then responded that we were not in the wrong and as a company we don ' t offer compensation .
2	i have purchased several deals in the past .
0	i have watched from my window on a few occasions and have seen the driver walk down the side of my house throw the parcel over the fence and drive off .
2	i will never deal with specsavers again .

0	i recently had a an ebay moment and sold heaps of stuff on line ( saved doing a car boot !).

0	instant purchases : you might wait up to two days to purchase an item after putting in a ' demand '
2	opened the box , picked her up and was well pleased ( only previously owned fenders and gibsons ).
2	the account manager has_been disinterested and does not even bother calling back .
0	there is no recognised union and so if you complain you will be summarily dismissed .

0	whilst i keep going back to this shop ( mainly because i can ' t find an equivalant accessory shop ) there was an issue i had when i ordered .
2	i have no axe to grind against this company , but poor service from online_retailers is becoming a major issue for us all , don_'_t you think ?
2	mobicity '_s range of dual - sim products seems broad , perhaps unique , however , this , i guess , is a small company that has yet to learn to share skills across the company .
2	and no i don_'_t work for them or know anyone who does , i '_ve just had the best experience with them .
0	amazing service not sure whats with the bad_reviews
2	absolutely nothing so to hell with them .
0	this company is a joke , go elsewhere .
0	i usually use fedex but on this occasion had to opt for parcelforce .
0	i ordered on 00th of december , understandable holiday and busy_period , but nowadays if company want to trade in real_life the holiday is not excuses !!
2	i left feedback which reflected how i felt about this and it hasn_'_t been published .
2	0 : paper changing is a pain and can be quite complex , though changing
0	we did a sms treasure_hunt , dance party and reserved booths / bar on the saturday .

2	huge_choice , great service and customer_care and prompt , reliable delivery .
0	we were moved to a worse hotel without aircon and for the 0 nights no fresh towels or maid service .
0	further , without being given a courier ' s tracking code to narrow_down when the order might arrive , it meant having to stay at home longer_than anticipated .
2	i '_ve recycled a few phones with mazuma now .
0	i did learn from it though .
0	i ' ve been with vodafone since the company i signed_up with over 00 years_ago was bought by them , so have been with them long enough to have gone_through several different experiences , including wanting to leave them , having my phone stolen , upgrading , etc .
0	virgin_media are very good when things work , but very bad when things go_wrong
0	i ordered a main door oven glass replacement for a broken door on my tricity bendix oven , they sent me an electrolux range hood - i called and told them and the woman on the other end of the phone was rude and tried to tell me i purchased the wrong item .
0	i waited around for quite a while for a sales_assistant to take my order , i felt_like they ignored me as being a girl in my early 00s , they probably didn ' t expect me to buy anything or spend much .
0	instead of refunding , they sent me a ‘ pre_- paid label ’ early may .
0	great !
2	they have delivered me nothing but headaches peppered with 00 minute fruitless and frustrating calls to their customer helpline , broken_promises and shoddy service .
2	i keep shopping around to find the lowest prices on supplements .
0	ok there is none ever to talknto in store though

0	with the software downloaded to your laptop or pc it means you don ' t have to wait for pictures to upload or go through suffering at times of high usage , you can complete at your leisure .
0	unfortunately , the courier lady was lovely , so it ' s not her fault , but yodel as a company are useless !
2	this is a brilliant service .

0	hostelbookers supplied a lot of options for hostels , but not all of them had full availability for the dates i had selected , which was a little_confusing .
0	i would avoid this company at all costs the customer_service is shocking and all they are interested in is taking your money .
2	but when the order turned_up the wrong glasses on the one pair were delivered i called customer_services who immediately sent a return label and within a week i had the correct pair in my hands
2	amazed to find goodboy crunchy snowballs were available .
0	my controller for xbox one has issues but because it was limited_edition they have to replace whole console bundle but believe it or not replacement only took 0 day .
2	we shared a joke about him going to the wrong house .
0	i couldn ' t ask for a more easier transaction .
0	they ' ve even deleted the email address we had for contacting them .
2	i have complained and gotten refunds but this is looking systematic now .
2	it was of a black puppy .
0	they don ' t have their logistic supply chains , thus they don ' t get a hold of the goods they sell .

2	excellent product , price and support with confirmation e_- mail and data tracking .
0	shipping rate was rip_off for me !
0	from what i ' ve heard about club and first_class being great i can ' t comment but for economy class they just don ' t compare to other airlines like virgin , emirates or singapore that are leaders across all 0 ( or 0 !)
0	our accommodation was filthy , the dinner table chairs were falling_apart and the fresh baguettes that can be ordered for breakfast were either not bought as reception was too hung over and didn ' t get to the bakery in time or not bought because reception was closed .
0	i ordered a jacket from their website on a sunday , they said it would arrive with me on the following friday in time for my camping_trip .

2	thank_you .
0	eventually i gave up with their call_centre in amsterdam , despite escalating my issue to a ' manager '.
0	the metro was creamy rather_than white and it came chipped which hasn ' t filled me with the greatest confidence when ordering .
0	we had one 00 minute ride on the dirt - buggies , which also happened to be slow and considerably more dull than we expected .
2	i begrudge even giving them one star !
0	if someone is in doubt of taking the course - do not think - just go for it !
0	so quick to take your money but then they say " we are just a middle_man " when it comes to resolving problems .
0	still_awaiting order / or a refund .

0	as i was trying to be helpful i sent them what they requested and for weeks there was no response .
0	even after shipping_costs , which are also lower .
2	we feel that so far we have paid more than enough for their below diy skilled installation !
0	every month was the same , get an estimated bill , phone them to say we have a smart_meter , give them the meter_reading and the next bill would still be estimated with no recalculation of the previous meter_reading .
0	it has the best prices and all the brend name products out there .
0	could have been worse !

0	so in summary , i have received a ridiculously_cheap price for my phone nowhere_near the quote i agreed to and through no fault of my own have no option to get my phone back and have to just accept this .
2	in this instance , i think an equitable solution would be for you to send over a concealed cistern and chrome plate by way of compensation . as yet no reply .
0	i called and called about that one , and despite multiple notes , i had to cancel the order with the company so that they could recall the parcel .
2	second - the tarriffs are also incredible - i just signed_up for a sim only data plan 00gb for £_00 . beat that !
0	this is the worst customer_service i have ever received .
0	you know we wont send the items back as the postage will probably cost more_than the item is worth . woo and a jumper i received the other say had a hole in it . the stitching was out so much the neckline was practically on my shoulder . very disappointing as ive had some really good items in the past .
0	all seemed to be going well , however the passed and the globe didn ' t arrive .
2	a big thankyou
0	i set_up an account three months_ago and used it every time when i was doing the online shopping .
0	and when you are really looking_forward to receiving something like a rare opulence ballerina dress they send you a shoddy side train dress not what i ordered and contacting them by telephone is terrible !!!!!!!!!!
0	ordered from this site a lot , generally they are quite good with getting stuff to you quick but i ordered a game from them that i really wanted and it was only in stock here but it wouldn ' t let me , they just kept cancelling my order which led me to believe that it wasn ' t actually in stock so there you go .
0	i have spoken to consumers direct who have assured me i am in the right and am_currently in the process of submitting a case to small_claims court .

2	i purchased a 0 / 0 in ' drive 0 / 0 in ' 00 point socket this was one of only a few places selling this item ( well_done for that ) and the cheapest price on the internet , unfortunatley the cost of the post doubled the price .

2	finally i went i to local_store and problem was resolved .

2	after emailing solwise and following their advice it had an even bigger issue .
0	the tags at the side detailing facilities is perfect to glance over at , and the layout is informative and logical , if a little cramped .
0	only slight niggle , is that occasionally they ' re a couple of £ more_than competitors on some items , but once the free postage is taken into account ( i ' m an active member on the forums , so i also get free delivery ) it works out cheaper anyway , so i ' m happy enough :)
0	i think missguided can be a handy website to use but you have to approach it cautiously / sensibly - do not order from it if you have to have the item delivered within a certain time - frame and if you have a problem make_sure you are proactive and follow it up and they will respond .
0	rang again and told yet again 00 days .

0	i call citylink as on the site all it has his " package mis sorted ".
2	i regret that we will not be able to reach an amicable resolution to your complaint .
0	postage is super_quick and very discreet , they are very reasonably_priced , and they even offer a points rewards system !
0	i purchased my flowers , wine and what i assumed would come with it was a box of free chocolate !
0	it didn ' t do the top part of the journey ( although we weren ' t warned of this when purchasing tickets ) - you had to get off at the museum and wait for another bus , which we didn ' t want to do due to the wait time .
0	overseas staff were incredibly unhelpful and in the end i had to insist a second product be dispatched which they begrudgingly did .
0	i will only ever use these from now on .
2	the sales staff and buying experience in the store are very good .
0	fab service extremly helpful and understandable helped_me with my depression needed glasses asap , very very very good service staff and company thumbs_up !!
2	there '_s a limit to how many discs we have time to watch in a week so not very helpful .
2	- foreign call_centres that dont know what they are doing and

2	i will_certainly use 000 next time i need something electrical .
0	keys are sent instantly , and the support is great .
0	this is a complete and utter scam .

0	good company , really poor choice of courier .
0	:)
0	great price and fast delivery from_hong_kong
2	next_day i found a couple of sites that really shook me .
0	delivery times are poor .
2	can '_t ask for more than that !
2	top company would definately recommend .
2	rang city_link who said only parcel0go could issue a refund ,
2	the lower payment only insures up to £_00 , which i couldn_'_t risk as the phone goes through the system in massively advertised mazuma bag .
0	this service is appalling and will cause you inconvenience , take up your time , and , depending_on the particular situation , might actually cost you financially .
2	i went to tesco shoreham ( holmbush ) on monday lunchtime , to stock up after a holiday , so intending to do a big shop .
0	is the best .
0	they only knocked £_00 off the price but if id been given a price of £_000 on the comparison site id have most_likely chosen a different company as others were also paying around the £_000 .
2	communications are always quick and efficient .
2	i have tried a few company '_s like this but know one can come any way near this companies efficiency of supply and delivery , and the price is very competitive .
2	long_story short .
0	this is not myproteins fault !
0	i find the company far to corporate and greedy !
0	then i used the galaxy_s0 to call them and said the same_thing like the insurance wanted to put ip 0s to blacklisted handset , i don ' t know why they put the galaxy_s0 to blacklisted handset and don ’ t know they ' ve already put ip0s or not , but the s0 in this moment is unable to use until now when i really need a phone to contact people .
0	after i didn ' t hear_anything for 0 days i looked up the number and realised they ' d try to contact me .
2	watchfinder offered a watch for sale on their website .

0	originally ordered my go pro on the 0th_feb and cancelled the order on the 00th_feb the money was back in my account on the 00th_feb .
2	product arrived in terrible packagaing .
0	i bought a ray_ban aviator from their website because they were the only company with the model i wanted .
2	i am giving three stars because the product was as_described , and the email reply was very quick , but i am disappointed with the rest of the process .
0	i was looking for a decent mechanical pencil for drawing and came_across a particular brand i liked ( staedtler 000 00 to be exact ), so off to google it was , and cult_pens was the first answer to pop up .
2	i was also informed that the website was misleading as the slot shown is only a ' request ' slot and in reality was always wrong and therefore the customer service team would always reschedule the appointment .
0	i get them to come to my work address as this means i don ' t waste my time
0	i received my order for my 0 stone emerald cut trilogy 00k white gold ring , looks beautiful design , delivery , was great ( i live in germany ) and communication was also really good .

2	quickly , you can have a bargain .
2	this way it is so easy to make someone happy , always in the loop , great communication .
2	day to day delivery .
2	i really think this company has got it on the ball !
2	i just had my licence renewal through ,,, it seems the bbc in an effort to save_money will no_longer be sending out tv licences ,, they just keep on record the fact you have paid ,, now that is the ultimate in bad customer service ,,
2	it '_s a good job there are plenty of other_providers out there .
2	i would definitely recommend them to you .
0	product arrived 0 days after ordering as planned and was much_better value than other_places i looked , would use again
2	because i was having this dishwasher delivered elsewhere rather_than to my home , i thought it would be advisable to telephone the order .
2	my dealing_with this company have been very efficent and the staff are very helpful .
2	this is general advice for dealing_with the chinese market .
2	it is now 0 days since i sent my first complaint email to their customer_services team and i ' m still_waiting for a reply despite a follow_up reminder to them .
2	they recently refurbished my local_store ( edgbaston , birmingham ) and through the entire_process of around 0 weeks , shopping there was a nightmare .
2	letters never acknowledged .
0	---
0	:)
2	immediately after buying the trimmer , i emailed gtech to see if i could have the £_00 credited - never got a sensible response .
2	!!

0	very quick from point of ordering to delivery .
0	i ordered a game , but had no email from moby memory ( ext ref removed ) either to confirm the order , or to say it had been despatched .
2	ordered 0 tallboys from bedroom_furniture world on 00th_march still_waiting for them 0th_april 00 days_later even allowing for bank_holidays delivery is a joke .
0	i like the taste of their pizzas but i have 0 main complains for them !
2	if you have ever wanted to obtain the games we played as children , jaques , is a must , to visit , i promise you will not come away without purchasing , and you will keep going back .
2	upon ordering the communication i have found has_been poor i have a pet whom has ibs and only half of his food was dispatched without notifying me where the rest of the order was which i found was strange ??
0	( id had the fridge for years too )
0	i contacted british_airways directly and asked what they could do , and they said they would always make changes like this for nothing , but it was an agency booking so budgetair had to instigate the change by calling their helpline .
0	do not use this company !
0	edit_: i eventually received my amp after 0 months of waiting - an_alternative , more_expensive amp was offered with slight discount , or a display one that i would eventually have to send back .
0	now this is the best bit - despite us having paid for the pre00 :_00am service on that day ( and it now being past 00 :_00pm ) she said we could get the parcel there today but it would be after working hours and it was cost us £_000 . 00 !!!!!
2	ebay are ok !
0	highly_recommended .
0	- it ' s annoying and inefficient to be called by a salesperson after you sign_up for a free_trial .
2	too many_times now we '_ve bought goods from good honest traders only for them to be let_down by their choice of courier .
2	came at a far lower price compared to other_retailers offering the same package
2	my husband took out contracts on 0 phones in june .
0	i have ordered am item worth over £_000 and it said it will be delivered the next_day .

0	haha im so glad i have not gone with this company .
0	this is my review .
2	ordered flowers in good time for delivery for valentines_day , only to be let_down big time by inter flora got email_stating due to high_volume of orders they were unable to fill my order . i will never use this company again and advise_anyone_else not to
0	originally joined them about 0 and a half years_ago with just internet and phone at my old address , while with them it was fine , the bill was never what we agreed to pay but we guessed it ' s probably like that with most companies .
0	wonderful service - professional , knowledgeable , perfect .
0	it works , however not everything occurs as they say , it takes more time and money then expected .
0	the waterstones website is very easy to use and very informative about future releases from my favorite authors , it ' s also been a great way to find potential new reads for me as i find the stores can be very disorientating and hard to find exactly_what your looking for .
2	and then they still couldn_'_t promise it would be delivered the next_morning !
2	what do you think the chances of getting the new bracket are ( marks from 0 - 00 ) and what are the chances of getting a refund when i '_ve sent it back ( marks again 0 - 00 ).
2	!
0	i contacted the crescent electronic again to get things sorted .
2	perhaps i was unlucky but the car supplied should not on reflection been in a hire pool
2	disabled husband and awkward access meant this was as important as the products being correct and good value .
2	one upright one sideways and they done them both sideways .
2	bullguard have decided to upgrade the service during oct ' 00 without_any warning to customers or any information on their service status page .
2	easy to navigate around their website .
0	will never buy from gnc or vitaminworld again .
2	just be careful when ordering that you allow plenty of time for delivery cards though were fantastic
0	but i can say now - it has well exceeded my expectations .
2	i came_across this company online and spent some time checking them out and comparing it with others .
0	i had to request that the remaining £_00 was refunded as stated in my first post .
0	i use parcel 0 go all the time , their prices are very competitive and great value for money !
0	and that was it , i quit trying with talktalk .
2	that signature was subsequently printed out on a contract that i had never seen and the conditions of that contract were significant in terms of liability for autoglass in the event of problems during installation .
2	i am satisfied with his explanation and to his credit he obviously takes customer_care seriously and gives the impression he genuinely does care .
2	i was told however by the salesman that the job would take 0 day when in fact it took 0 and this could not be attributed to the fitter .
2	i made the mistake of thinking . com would be the same as the store the similarities end at the name , i oredered a £_000 value item for my wife as part of her xmas , despatched 00th00 , signed and recieved 00th 00 , really !!!
0	would i recommend selectspecs to a friend ?
2	i have previously used black_circles and was happy with the service so returned to buy another set of tyres .

0	the stops are very easy to see and i asked the staff about the latest i could travel back to reach my destination all helpful , plus can book other trips with the staff , got my london eye tickets from them .
0	this is just terrible .
0	after calling and explaining no one was there , they said it was delivered to a neighbour but the agency driver was off for 0 days so they wouldn ' t be able to find out which neighbour it was delivered to until then .
0	turns_out i was 00_minutes late for this offer , so it seems fair .
0	ordered flowers for my girlfriend 0 days before valentines_day - mainly to avoid last_minute influx and make_sure they arrive on time .
2	good products and excellent service thanks
2	i have tried a lot of bingo_sites , this is definitely best one online , lots of bingo rooms to suit your pocket and loads of slots friendly chat_hosts and added_bonus of free bingo rooms where you can win real cash , give it a go you won_'_t be disappointed .
0	i ' ve used them seven times to send parcels and three times there hasn ' t been a problem .

0	we have been for 0 year with this company .
0	you are going to pay at_least £_00 / month more due to calling these numbers .
0	came wrapped in a shedload of bubblewrap so i know it was safe in transit and delivered by dhl , which i trust .
2	have used_resorthoppa several_times now cant_fault it , easy to use cheap and efficient what more do you want

0	i have used hostelbookers during my trips in marocco , norway , germany , switzerland and italy .
0	great company will_definitely_recommend to friends and shop in the future .
0	but still nobody reply me .
0	received text with 0 hour time to receive the items and i did within that 0 hour time_frame !
2	my advice - for now , avoid this company at all costs .
0	!
0	used for a car i am looking to buy , found the website a litte confusing but most_importantly found that the insurance was more_expensive than what i have been offered by my current insurer .
2	discusting service .
2	having booked an audi_a0 or similar we were given a ford_focus .
0	hasan and ishmael looked after us well , cooking the best harira we had in morocco , telling stories and singing songs .
2	i trust this will never happen again .
2	great concert but could have done with seats as it was 00_degrees on 00 th july .
0	poor poor service .
0	i gave them the benefit of the doubt and i am going to be out of pocket again :( worst service ever
2	they instantly beat that price by 0 per_cent .
0	he then had no new information to give me so i expect he probably went for a cup of tea and found out nothing .
2	the service was fantastic from start to finish and the end product just looks 00 times more beautiful than the picture and so unique i would not hestiate to recommend alba rose to a friend and would definately_use their services again .
2	i was expecting a delay , and simultaneously i see on my computer and everything restored itself andthe payment went through fine .
2	these small storage_boxes were just what i needed for my new workshop .
0	i contacted feedem ( within the 0 months my consumer_rights allow ) and told them i had cleared the food out as it was a h_& s issue in my house ( as i am legally allowed to ) but sent photographic_evidence of the mould .
0	they can get you fired .
2	no i dont think so yes its a nice parka but your defo paying for the name and image here as there are many other brands selling better made garments for less .
0	woo !
0	i gave him my housemate ' s number to organise as i would be at work .
0	it ' s a brilliant supplement alongside your netflix subscription .
2	the bike was perfectly set_up , needing just the essentials ( seat / pedals / bars ) altering and it was ready to ride inside 0 / 0 an_hour .
2	apparently they will send an invoice listing what was done 0 days after i have paid and the car returned .
2	i ordered a sage instants payroll training package from softwaresolutionsshop .
2	thank_you
2	serenata is simplicity !
2	ask me yesterday and i would have been quite positive .
0	avoid like the plague .
0	i thought i would have a look at my online bill to pay whatever was outstanding so it did not go against my credit history .
2	everything i have purchased from pro - cook online is brilliant quality you '_ll love it if you buy anything .
0	i placed a query via the online support centre about my order and repeatedly i have been fobbed_off and promised information .
2	we can now look_forward to sharing future overseas holidays together , and i cannot put into words what this means to me . who needs marriage guidance when you have jet0 .
0	best place if you want to go somewhere any other can fuck off
2	if i accept their offer it will cost me £ 0 to send the bracket back .
0	it excellent course material , gives an idea of topic and then research can easily be carried on .
0	you can also access your last calls , your last texts and any payments you have made .
0	also there is no need to email me 0 times in under an_hour asking to pay my mot costs after i phoned you on a premium number saying i will pay when i leave work .
0	and i had to drive around town to find the parking lot where someone on top of all smashed into my door so i had to pay another 000 euro for a bump on the door . everything has been problem and i will never rent a car through this company again and i strongly_recommend others to do the same !
0	some great advice and info on their blog as well .
0	of course at the end of the day , the site ' s primary objective is to make money , even if it means deviously manipulating customers and being purpousfully discreet and incoherent about certain things *_cough * shippingtimes *_cough *
0	bough my christmas decorations from you tho .
2	out of frustration i asked ticketweb if they would be refunding the ' delivery ' cost considering they did not deliver them and i collected them and was told ' unfortunately , we are unable to refund your handling as the collection charge is the same cost as the delivery charge '.
2	as i say if it works then leave well alone but if you expect them to help you with anything technical like porting your number over or anything other than simply grabbing a sim with new number and topping it up then be prepare for a mountain of wasted hours trying to re explain the same problem to the technicians who seem to work from canned scripts , most_likely from india .
2	[_external_reference_] deluged with complaints over yodel '_s poor delivery service
0	very annoying and in my opinion not very honest .
2	very easy to liaise with the bidders .
0	i waited for an_hour and a half on their website queueing to buy some tickets .
0	posters took a week to arrive , not bad timing i suppose , but i am still_waiting for the replacement poster that i exchanged for the original that had ' sold out '.
0	should i know it will be 0 - 0 days late then i would have asked express delivery .
0	joined this site last_week and placed hundreds of bids and never won anything .
0	however , more sceptical organisers may be uncomfortable doing this .
0	booked a parcel and i was given the collection time between 00 noon till 0 . 00 pm
2	pay your money and take your choice , but it could be a lot better !
0	a choice of seller
2	i gave a detailed email explaining the problem but it has taken 00_hours for someone called ' may ' to ask if they can be of any help to contact them !
2	delivery was free but meant you could not say when exactly ( another £_00 on a £_000 desk did not seem worth it ).
0	i ' ll be ordering more !
0	their costumer_service kept sending me emails saying that the order had been dispatched but actually they did not had a tracking_number .
0	nothing more to add 0 star for great service !
0	thanks a million
0	really helpful and efficient staff who responded quickly to my queries .
0	when telephoned to say order not received , told it was the post_office ' s responsibility now and they do not take_responsibility for lost parcels .
2	took out two policys but didnt recieve them via_email have yet to see if they arrive by post which i asked for too eventually sent one policy by email other one was missing but very helpful and have no doubt they will sort it
2	it could have been quicker , but only if they invent telepathic ordering and teleport the goods !
0	the website is easy to use and easy to navigate through to checkout .
2	superb delivery service : ordered and delivered within 0 days !
0	and lastminute have the guts to claim that they offer prices so low that the hotel don ' t want to be named .
0	i therefore rang o0 ( as im an existing customer ) only for them to tell me as an existing client i would be an " automatic accept " and they had no record of my application from their end !
2	extremely good service .
2	i deliberately did not book the small car option .
2	would like to half game site , so i can do other things while i play .
0	it ' s so easy to book a collection or delivery with them and they have drop_off points all over .
0	to make_matters worse , when contacting the customer_service center this morning to discuss this matter , i was informed that it shouldn ' t take longer_than 0 days and after becoming rather adamant that i do still require the delivery or require the money to be refunded in a manner that i can receive it earlier , i was told that they would call the store to see whether they are ' willing ' to ' help me out ' after which they would contact me immediately to notify me of the decision .
2	delivered next_day with instructions & advice , a little_nervous delving inside but no_problems .
2	if i were asked the ' net promoter question ' " would you recommend to a friend ?"
0	or rather , my husband has as it was more convenient at the time to put the contract in his name even_though i ' ve been using it .
2	my order has finally turned_up , 00 days after_placing it , even on opening the package there was a bit of a surprise . my order had actually been shipped from one of the other online companies i usually deal with , not proviation or icom .
0	won ' t be using them ever again .
0	obviously having no booking_fees is also great and i personally like that i don ' t have to sign_up to the site to book things through it .
0	goods came as_described and in time .
0	i waited a whole month but i did not get my parcel .
0	i would recommend to mates but i would wore them first .
2	asos head_office
0	unfortunately when i have ordered any dresses they have been sent back .
0	they all stated as far as they were concerned , they had no issue , just needed a copy of the marriage certificate and that would suffice .
0	despite all being the same company i ' ve received massively different treatment from store - to - store .
0	their service and quality has been quite off - putting .
0	i use groupon and living_social deals but have never being treated like this .
2	excellent carrier who gave us a one hour_slot for the delivery and delivered within that hour !
2	we asked our driver as to the time of the next bus as we had a business dinner to attend in another part of the city .
2	i found that the delivery service was careless and actually damaged goods .
2	----------------------------------------------------------------------
0	however the delivery did arrive on its scheduled date , albeit rather late in the afternoon .
2	i sent an_email to ph on the wednesday_morning , got a reply wednesday_evening , placed an order wednesday night , got delivery friday_morning , wore to footie on the saturday .
2	this company doesn_'_t - i recommend you don_'_t trade with them .
2	will not be using this company again
2	thanks .
2	i would like to say how easy and pain_free it was to order my new camera from digitalrev .
2	i have a very impatient teenager waiting for his points and when he thinks 00mins and its longer its a pain - think they really need to say email delivery and state a realistic timescale .
0	very easy to use , and get ' s you a great deal .
2	thank_you tanya on ' live_chat ' for sorting this .
0	recently for the first time for years i ' ve had need to phone their customer_service over a missing item .
0	edit_: after an official_complaint , i was contacted by the company who admitted driver ' s wrongdoing and apologized ( in a pleasant and surprising fashion ) which makes me believe that as a company they try their best and it ' s some individuals ( drivers ) who damage company ' s reputation .
2	by the time my boiler is fixed and up and running i will have been without heating and hot_water for 0 weeks .
2	i created a large square photobook with high gloss and fold flat options , using the download version of the software .
0	.
2	the delivery of this mattress was scheduled for about 0 - 00days after purchase but on the said date i was called to be informed that the mattress had not arrived at the right depot and delivery was being_investigated and would be informed of developments .
2	to make_matters worse there was no apology , my conclusion was that this companies sales advisers cannot be trusted , so i decided not to pursue my interest further and told the manager to delete my
0	they actually sold me something that they did not have available in their stock , then days after , they sent me an_email_saying that they had " ordered " it from their supplier and it should take maximum 0 weeks .
0	the whole_process has been fantastic from beginning to end and the staff have been very helpful / hospitable .
2	also , having_read some of the recent reviews that orders are arriving damaged i do not know what to expect .
2	!
2	the initial experience was more than acceptable , with next_day delivery .
0	he did redeem himself when it came to dessert and had the chef double my portion of chocolate fudge cake which was lovely .
2	i purchased an item from lindy . uk and completed the transaction , including the credit_card approval .
0	this does not happen on hostelworld , you don ' t need to do this first , it ' s my right as a customer to rate the hostel i was in , not this company , which has unfortunately frustrated me so much that i can ' t write a good review after going back and forth emailing the completely unhelpful customer_service department .
2	i emailed back the company at around 0 :_00pm to get some idea of what was happening and to get confirmation that there would definitely be a collection but this time didn_'_t receive any replies back at all .
2	it is also possible to amend the details at any time .
0	highly_recommend will 000_% buy from them again .
0	i have ordered several_times from sw . com and will not enter a gnc or other venue .

0	they sounded great but whever i tried to order online or purchase in store they weren ' t available .
0	awesome deals and super selection !
0	i really like facebook although i prefer the old setting and think that people should be given the choice whether to change back or not
0	all at a cost of £_000 for 0 tickets + £_00 cancelled ( non_refundable ) hotel + £_000 train_ticket journey .
0	i saved_myself a lot of money .
0	sure , i have booked some excellent hostels using the simple , quick and no - fees booking system , but i ' ve also used it to book top - end hotels and apartments .
2	so , to prospective users , take off about £ 0 for you having to insure &_p_&_p .
2	game was well_packed and all ok .
2	we had to cancel the sale of our suite and pay her £_00 compensation for her inconvenience .
2	i was kept well informed of the progress of my order and the pre release arrived a day early = much to my husband '_s joy !
2	they have excellent products and always deliver on time and get good discounts would recommend anyone to use liberty and there great for diy .
2	without this i would have left them .
2	this looks_like a catch 00 situation !
2	they apparently were going to deliver it yesterday pm slot despite waiting in again guess_what its still not here .
0	this would have been helpful .
0	the customer_service people that tried to contact my were polite , helpful and were trying their best to give my the best quality item they could .
2	always offers the best price for rooms of all standards
2	they supplied us with text_messages to say they would be delivering it but no reference_number should we need it .
0	onlinekeystore is simply the best online store with great prices , great games and great service .

0	sg done a fantastic job of keeping me informed about the status of my order .
2	i thought i had a puncture , being short of time i found grippy on line and booked an_appointment and paid , all done .

2	great company to do_business with .
0	the cut paypal gets on sold items does not justify its use , but i have no other choice while using ebay as a seller .
2	i ' m not the best tech head so i find their site quite difficult .
2	all resolved fine the next_day - but our expectation of immediate delivery was not .
2	as tyre technology / ratings , labelling etc_., become increasing more complicated i suggest that the website keep pace .
0	the only saving_grace was that i always got my games on time or usually the day before , unfortunately this was not the case recently when my game didn ' t come at all and i found game customer_service most unhelpful .

0	clearly being respectful , polite and patient was not getting me anywhere and i don ' t recommend using this company again .
2	i found the information offered by the company to be vague and rather unhelpful when i called to check on order .
0	whilst they put out some decent games , gamers have to go against their principles to purchase them .
0	as i have had poor experiences recently with goods not turning_up i prefer to use paypal but have had to take a risk by giving card_details - so i hope goods turn_up !
0	if these have been lost i think it best you cancel the order and refund the money .
0	then these are the place online to shop , have had 0 different batteries from them now over a few_years , no issues , no_complains , and always a good price , tip : join there facebook group for a small discount_code ;)
2	hence , i think that this is very important to be shared for consumers like me .
2	they are no doubt the cheapest supplier in this market but one of the worst service providers i have come_across .
2	i will not be in a hurry to deal with this company again unless they prioritise their customer service personnel and their whole refunding system .
0	adzuna makes it extremely easy to find just the right job offer .

0	i paid extra to make the bouquet larger and added a vase for convenience all for under £_00 .
2	i hate wasting time looking at hotels that are too expensive or too cheap !
2	this was quietly admitted to us in what was probably the 00th email exchange between us and four different members of their support_team ( most of whom are very friendly and genuinely seem to want to help , it must be said ).
0	and , i can proudly say , here iam 0 years later smiling contently at the beast that purrs beside my desk .
0	it ' s easy to use , it keeps a track of your orders so its easy to go back to see what you had last time .
0	simple process to find the best hostel
2	so all in all buy here you won_'_t be disappointed .
2	it hasn ` t gotten better each year as the one i ` m using at the moment uses all the resources when updating and so everything else slows down to a crawl .

0	i did this and the person on the end of the phone said that they had the number listed but my name was not on the account listed for this number which got me rather confused and irate , not to mention worried !
0	even_though i paid extra for it .
2	a ) someone sent a parcel to my local collect_+ shop - it arrived quickly and i got an_email to say it had been dropped_off .
2	thank_you very much you will be getting more of my hard - earned in future .
0	she did not want to tell me and upset me .
0	i will_continue to use this company as will_continue to recommend them
2	delivery and product was good but a phone_call from ao . com offering extended_warranty smacked of sharp_practice .
2	delivery should be to my front_door but this was far from the case and it was sheer luck that i happened to find these before someone_else took a fancy to them .
0	order was perfect , delivered on time and correctly .
2	you don_'_t see the shipping until the end , i advise double checking pricing on other online supplement companies before committing to your order .
2	i would much rather have spent an extra £_00 and bought from a reputable company .
2	all parts present & undamaged .
2	people who love stationery , who find the fun in functional , they communicate brilliantly .
0	:) the methods of payments you have a choice of , and with in a couple of hours of them receiving my laptop , and assessing it , they then made the payment the same day .
0	ordered a berghaus cornice ii jacket and fleece in december_0000 , and another order january_0000 for second fleece , both delivered promptly .
0	i ' ve been orderng for the past couple of months from this site and have nothin bad to say .

0	about 0 month_ago me and my boyfriend went in to maplin , we were buying things to use on games consoles we had managed to rally up around £_00 worth of items in about 00_minutes we only had 0 items .
2	before that it was 00th_march , beginning of may etc .
0	have been with nah once before this claim and was a much smoother process as i signed_up online , only benefit to ringing is that you get transferred to a solicitor there and then .
0	i contacted them via_twitter and facebook only to see a status posted which was basically rude saying that all messages to themselves should be dealt_with privately , i private messaged them and they ignored it for a day !
0	couldn ' t ask for a better customer_service experience , especially_considering that it was my fault .
2	this is totally_unacceptable , has ruined my mum '_s birthday and i have had to order new flowers from elsewhere , as even if these ever turn_up they will be dead !
2	whilst writing this update i have recieved an_email from superfi stating that my order has joined the que for picking , the first email in relation to this purchase & have a guess_what . it didnt go into my spam folder either !!
2	they have the cheapest price on the next and trust me you know i '_ve looked .
0	!
0	in the end i know its helped_me and yes i would use the service again .
2	we recently_moved_house and contacted orange in plenty of time to arrange to have our line connected and our number transferred . as requested the bt_engineer arrived the day before we moved in to connect up the phoneline and broadband service this was the 00 feb .
2	all the other_retailers i researched for the same product were not only more_expensive but could not deliver for at_least 0 weeks !
2	they didn_'_t .
0	the first time it came it was sent in a box which survived the deadly pitfalls of royal_mail / parcel_force handling .
2	you refused to accept this and i have to say as i ' m a new customer and this is my first purchase with you , it has made me think_twice about shopping with you in future .
0	as for speed they ' re a bit slow and miscommunication things , i was given a time someone will call and 0 hrs later i had to call myself , other than that issue , all was very simple .
2	one of the best services i have used
2	i never go_anywhere_else these days , there is no need .
2	so have paid for a service i never received .
2	rang reidys for advice .
2	not delivered on the day - i was not told there was a problem .
2	rang twice and told it was going out today .
0	but then , as the ipod was bought from hmv , no one ' s name was on the receipt .
0	the process was easy .
0	have now taken action with the small_claims court .
2	i notice that they do not always show the best prices for hotels .
0	i did not even know dpd did that as i have never had anything delivered by them .
0	- the pricing is not transparent , with only the basic plan having an a price shown on the website .
0	everything is average including customer_service
0	a little overpriced but craft stuff often is .
0	i called their telephone customer_service today to help find an item but received horrible customer_service !!
0	i must_say that the service is amazing .
0	the frames i order are fab , very funky !
0	a new speaker was quite cheap , and i didn ' t fancy sending the amp back any - ways , but i was still out of pocket and felt that they should have at_least answered my question .
0	i may be tempted to shop elsewhere in the future .
0	what can i say ?
0	still no clue .
0	also every time i went to the local click and collect the staff were clueless i had to wait around for someone to come and deal with it then they kept getting my name wrong and even came down with someone_else ' s parcel .
0	- accounts are free and do what they say they do , you can chat with models as a free user , it just depends on the chat restrictions set by each_individual model .
2	the item arrived within a couple of days the customer service was first_class i can only recommend this company to others excellent service and fast delivery thank_you
2	does anyone know a way of getting round the system of licences ?
2	this car has an electronic parking brake with an on / off switch .
2	reading_reviews on here i have no chance of refund .
0	i ' ve seen stores do this .
2	this has to be for a reason !
2	far cry 0 & fifa 00 xbox games as two_separate_orders both delivered within two days after ordering .
0	finally i received my order , this time took very long , and there ' re no samples ( but thats okay , since it was just like a bonus ).
2	it '_s late so i couldn_'_t have tolerated a lengthy process . this was simple and hassle - free .
2	i am very satisfied with the product and the software .
2	looked good until i got the bill from customs .
2	how dare he !!
0	this is basic stuff .
2	bought this to soften a sofa bed .
2	customer service line has now been engaged for over 0 hour as my auto dial service redials every 0 mins .
0	disappointing .
0	i wont use them again
0	!
2	!
2	i have just moved to a different area of the country so i hope that the service continues to be just as good .

2	have cancelled order , never order again pcw
2	total timewasters .
0	thanks
0	i have no hesitations about recommending holidays_please and using them again for ourselves !
2	my order was delivered with drooping flowers , buds that were going brown and a pathetic number of flowers that were bulked out with loads of branches .
0	we designed our own ring ' s and they staff were very experienced in what they do and helping_us decide our perfect ring .
0	we argued the point then he accepted .
2	i ' d like to say that this is the first time i have needed to use the live person service and think it '_s brill .
2	so i sent a message via their contact form on the website not realising i would have to wait 00_hours for a reply !
0	the order was picked , packed , and shipped within 0 mins of paying for the sa000 and arrived between the arranged 0 hour time_slot allocated to me by dpd .
2	they have still defiantly got it all - charm , charisma & professionalism .
0	i was pleasantly_surprised when i got an_email from mazuma the next_day saying that the full_amount would be paid and that the money would be in my account by midnight .
0	i waited in all day for this .
0	0 .
2	this resulted_in the whiskas containers being smashed into tiny shards & the contents to granules , not to mention the amount of cleaning up i was left to do !
0	thanks banana_fingers !
2	the landline_number given diverts to a mobile voicemail .
2	from start to finish using tecnology at the front end and good service at point of delivery was very good indeed
0	thank_you rose .
2	i followed the tracking and the item was delivered on tuesday according to records .
0	i registered my interest on the chillisauce website and was contacted ( on a sunday !)
2	that aside , the guys at sip at great .
0	cheaper_than other booking website !
0	decent site , well_laid_out but can be pricey compared to other online etailers .
0	overall i much prefer to shop elsewhere and only buy items from topshop occasionally .
0	the worst £_000 i ' ve ever spent and certainly will not be buying large items from them again .
0	the representative i spoke to answered all my queries and was also patient , a combination you do not see with many companies these days .
0	00th apr : contacted by customer_service , matter resolved , rating adjusted accordingly .
0	i would have got better quality and have more pennies in my pocket by nipping down to garage and getting a bunch from there .
0	the response also had nothing in it about the pasta and when i got a reply to a 0nd message they thought i ' d received 0 of the 0 packs , then sent 0 more anyway , cuckoo indeed .
0	easy to use site and very fast delivery
0	after appr .
0	i am just happy i finally got my money back ; the only problem is that flight tickets have increased now due to the delay caused by them .
0	the first [_link ] and the second music_magpie .
0	0 ) white filler very visible at regular intervals on oak bed_frame , a large chunk of wood missing and a split .
0	finished the mind_blowing range you can find at tesco where you end up buying more_than you need .
2	i couldn_'_t believe it when he said i could get it the next_day !
0	would definately_recommend their company !
0	but never ever borrow money from this thieves !!
2	this has_been traumatic experience !
2	what they forgot to say was it doesn_'_t matter how many_times you ring the number ( in my case 00 times to date ) they will not answer .
0	i had contacted them the same day the payment was processed and yet my phone had already " gone " and could not be returned to me .
2	although hesitant , i was impressed by the website and information provided . although the watch took longer to arrive than stated , i was kept_informed all the way .
2	arrival : nextday a . m . 00 / 00 .
2	richard
2	friendly , knowledgeable_staff and a quick service .
2	will use again .
2	didnt expect much for a £ 0 . 00 cake but it was tiny !
0	having done bus tours previously i said that we should opt for the red bus route as it was live commentary which usually has a more personal feel to it .
0	i was then informed that the reason my claim was rejected was actually because my ipod was a gift , and therefore not purchased in my name .
2	have shopped with sainsbury '_s online for a few_years now and they have never let me down .
0	great guys .
2	bought 0 toilets , 0 sinks and a tap a few_weeks back .
2	i reply yes , supply my address and we agree a time .
0	i don ' t know what else to do , because they keep saying they will call me back and they refuse to pass me on to a manager .
2	i was about to pay them today over the phone as i can never make a payment online !!!
2	the quality of the cards are a bit cheap too .
0	unless you buy with one of their deals it ' s not worthwhile , way too expensive !
2	absolutely no_problems at all .
2	i live 00 miles from the company who sent me the item .
0	!
0	i thought that was the end of it .
0	further inspection showed a scratched / scuffed crystal , dust and lint on the dial and a gouged caseback .
0	parcelforce would seem to be the antithesis of what the privatised royal_mail say their standards are .
0	i bought £_000 worth of meats from here as my first purchase , got to say i was amazed how quick my order turned_up .
0	may be too much to ask .
0	because i lost only about £ 0 so i am not interested to stress myself further than that so this is my response .
2	currently this may take up to 00 working_days ' poor , poor service - avoid at all costs
2	but , i would use travelstay again if only for the good choice of hotel solutions and good reliable hotel information .
2	i arranged to return the item to solwise for repair .
2	there are many letting agencies so please find yourself one with good reviews and avoid this company like the plague .
2	the screen was badly fitted and didnt work properly .
2	i then had an early beer , opened my emails & saw the following sent to me at 00 . 00 on 00 / 00 / 00 - ' reference your order no 00000 placed on the 00 / 00 / 00 at 0 . 00 . 00 ( i didn_'_t place this ) your item has_been dispatched .'
2	i never do a full shop there .
2	it seems there have been other problems .
2	no_complaints from me .
0	couldn ' t be_happier with how easy everything was with me being a first time buyer .
0	couldn ' t ask for anything more .
0	so i got setback for a super shitty car like vw polo by 000 € plus the 00 £ i paid already .
2	ao . com are a model for others to follow , in my experience .
2	so many faults it was unbelievable .
2	decided on cloth and placed order .
2	when collecting the car which had been washed noticed a note under the wipers informing i had a flat tyre , this was left on the back of a shopping list obviously left by a kind passer by from the nearby garden_centre . i cannot_believe that the staff at ford had repaired the car . hopefully test driven it , washed it and failed to notice or inflate the tyre .
0	i will be ordering from this company again and would recommend the to anyone .
0	so i thought i would give it a go , and with in 0mins after registration and telephone verification i had 00 months ps plus instantly .
0	i think mazuma_mobile is a very well_established company with an amazing service and you can trust them 000_%.
0	i look_forward to seeing them on watchdog .
2	inspection of the car identified damage to thedrivers side door that was not noted on the hire agreement ( walk back to pickup desk to inform them ) . arrived at destination and realised the car looked like it had just done 0 legs of the cyprus rally ( inside and out ) , had to take the car to a car - wash & clean out the interior .
0	supplementwarehouse . com you want it , they got it .
0	i love online shopping with tesco .
0	it took well over a week after sending the items for them to be received and the cash to come through , the service was good but i doubt i would use the service again .
2	the flowers should have been delivered on either saturday or sunday , as specified when choosing the option " mothers_day weekend ".
2	they are not to be trusted .
0	then look no further , because with expedia you have found all that , plus much much more !
2	btw the product was great too
0	then be prepared for a few_days wait . at_least .
2	really good price , well_packed item and next_day delivery .
2	and was told it would be up by the thur 00 mar to confirm that they told me to look
2	absolutely atrocious !
2	use this information as you would with ebay and remember , no rating is often worse_than a bad rating .
2	this is my third order front blinds 0 go , each time the quality of service , delivery and product has_been exceptional .
0	i ' d not heard of such a thing and if firefly are letting car ' s oil levels run so low that the oil light comes on in the first place - then this is not good practice for the engine .
2	rachel guided_me through chrome browser settings which were turned off .
0	website was easy to use and gave all the information i needed .
2	i cannot_believe that servicingstop think this is a reasonable way to run a business .
2	just ordered some trainers and spoke to an advisor ( think he said his name was brad ) who to me appeared a little impatient - i have an online account but had not yet added the address so he just said " there '_s no account " - i was actually logged in and looking at it and when i told him this he repeated " there '_s no account under that post_code ". anyway , i asked him if i could place an order over the phone - he did this , but all the while it felt like i was an inconvenience .
0	we contacted the customer_service as advised by the company below .
0	however was in a manned reception business centre all day with an intercom and about 00 : 00 it showed up on the tracking unable to collect parcel and " left a card " - rubbish .
2	then found all the reviews on trust_pilot so sent messages to info @ nicecans . co . uk , admin @ nicecans . co . uk and filled in ' customer complaint ' form from web - site , saying i would be contacting consumer direct etc .
2	thanks for some splendid mitts and faultless service
2	there is no address to write to .
2	when it came in it was dispatched very quickly .
0	excellent , highly_reccomended .
0	the merchant ' s website could not validate the code provided from wowcher .
0	tried 0 different stores and the staff in all 0 have usually been unhelpful .
2	i said any major retailer should have systems in place to deal with such financial issues .
0	we were staying in the ‘ royale apartment ’_s which i was , initially , a little_dubious_about staying at as i was concerned_about disturbing other people in the block and being too far from the main square .
0	we got the luxury version with a red trim and they set the car off really nicely .
2	based on this i would happily use this website again .
2	i would have been willing to pay more for a match .
2	the tech_guy said take a screen_shot and email it .
2	it is annoying and i am thinking of going elsewhere !
0	in my few experiences with supplement_warehouse , i have always found what i wanted for the best available price while receiving commendable customer_service .
0	thanks !
2	very prompt and positive response to our
0	i do not always receive my lenses quickly but they do arrive !
2	with regard to how the casing broke , i have suggested to them that there are a number of ways this could have happened - not least sub_standard metals used in the manufacture - or a fault in the manufacturing process - to which they have not replied .
2	you are able to track your parcel from start to finish so there are no doubts whether it arrived_safely or not plus item was insured .
0	they were the cheapest price i could find at the time and even had a 00 %- off promotional period , so the price was cheaper_than i had seen .
0	further quoted on their website - " if you order a sofa before noon on a normal working day monday through friday we can have the sofa with you the next working ".

2	still bad phone line but managed to explain my problem and got an_appointment booked to go into clinic not where i had my procedure .
0	many hidden_charges and always charges over my monthly_bill

0	i hope they bankrupt and get out of business
0	0_stars for the good mot prices and the free collection and return , but high premiums for repairs .
2	wanted a simple , cheap photo album quickly as a gift for a friend who had been to stay with us in spain .

2	i will be contacting pronterpix about it

2	i bought a mobile dvd_player and it looked fantastic .

0	back this was 0 and a half weeks_ago still_waiting for my
0	bear in mind i hadn ' t noticed them taking the £ 0 . 00 a week because it was a much smaller amount .
2	few_days earlier i was visiting ellis_brigham shop in milton_keynes , although didn_'_t purchased what i wanted , i left the shop under impression that people who works there are really care about costumer , and they know their job .
2	next_day contacted them and they have an autormated system that says sorry to hear that i will rebook it for you .
0	i no_longer buy anything from amazon that is delicate or fragile and is likely to get damaged in the post .
0	model : iphone 0

0	my husband and i ' ve been using supplements for quite some time , we kept pouring money into it until we found you guys .
2	clearly had been thrown around it '_s the first package ever that i have seen this .
2	not good .
0	however it involved serveral calls to the customer_service helpline to register and change over from payg to pay_monthly .
2	returned three of six items as poor quality , got an_email_confirming that they received the items ant that refund is just about to be done .
2	giffgaf support has to be done via_email only and all you get is communication done over several hours or days at a time . so it will take up to 00_hours to answer a question via your account portal , no alternative is offered . it feels_like walking in slow motion for every question .
2	i then had another delivered by appliancedeals this morning .
0	was slightly wary to boom tickets at first as i had never_heard of the company before but they were the only ones left with tickets .
2	rubbish - every time i see yodel are delivering i cringe
2	no real apology or regret was conveyed to us .
0	they do it all the time without any reasons and the account to be deleted may be randomly selected by their system .
0	the money i was offered wasn ' t great , i sold 00 cd ' s and got £_00 . 00 !!
0	so i said they could send the one product they did have .
0	sadly i can see signs of the company changing from ' nothing is any trouble ' to more of a private equity investment company .
2	the prices are good too .
0	the bed was lovely and big and comfy apart_from the noise i enjoyed my stay .
0	i am also sure they are so obstructive with there complaints_procedure as they think people will not bother following it through .
2	good quality cards , straightforward process , quick_turnaround .
2	could not fault this company at all !
0	i love the map_view !
2	when i contacted them again they could not tell me why my order was not delivered as it was sitting in the deport waiting to go .
0	the commentary at the top of the bus was hard to hear and it wasn ' t clear when we had reached a hop off point .
2	in general it '_s a lot safer to use , than people think , but you do need to be careful to need their reviews , before buying from anyone .
2	easy light_weight and powerful .
0	now i know why not , terrible customer_service .
2	we are great collectors of tesco points & love combining forces to get the best deals for our specific shopping habits & the double ups at christmas are fab ,,,, we are like kids in a toy story filling our trolly for my grandchildrens xmas_gifts ( her niece & nephew ) so we save a fortune by making the best use of our double up vouchers & all the other discounts & special_offers . our savings have been phenominal in these very challenging times we live in .
0	the site is very nicely_designed with a user_friendly layout .
0	expedia , you seriously need to sort out your customer_service .
0	does anyone know anything like this ?
2	i ' m sick of groupon .
2	i ’ ve had the pc just over a week now and so far it ’_s brilliant !
0	once i got to the patrol station i realized that in gran_canaria 0 liter of fuel costs like 0 , 00 € or 0 , 00 € which is not as much as the car_rental company charged me .
0	painfully annoying to buy on here , will never use again , avoid at all costs .
0	i emailed in and got a response the same day .
2	thank_you . over and out !
2	g chester . 0 out of 00 .
2	well_laid_out site , decent amount of stock , easy site to navigate , good january sale discount , wide choce of model types and good selection in each category .
2	they actually arrived just before 0pm , which i felt perhaps i should have been advised of this .
2	is the advertising misleading ?
2	shop elsewhere .
2	just so you know you cant phone giffgaff , only email them via your account portal on the web_page .
0	i have tried 0 fitness first gym .
2	my order arrived as stated within 0 days .
0	if i have an issue i should take it up with there courier they don ' t want to know and have said they want there £_000 .
0	chosen purely_because they had by_far the best prices for the items i was looking for , the very quick delivery was an added_bonus .
0	i also used the next_day delivery service as i needed it for a train journey to scotland i left my house at about 00 :_00am and it arrived just as i had left , however it still fulfilled its agreement to get here before twelve , again i am happy with this service .
0	will_definitely use again .
0	i haven ' t had a problem with deliveries in the past and it gets fairly steady flow of customer reviews on each product .
2	**********
0	i still have no_idea how they logged_into my account and paypal didn ' t offer any advice .
0	it was related to the fact that simply replying to their emails sends them to the black hole called ' noreply ' account .
0	however , i logged in to update a domain i own with them to redirect to a blog , but the domain had gone .
0	they sent emails keeping you up to date and dealt_with the request very fast .
0	i had been looking for a pair of prada sunglasses for my girlfriend for weeks only to find blaze had them instock .
2	google_chrome is not so good .
2	plus when i commented that a description was incorrect , presto it was changed almost on the spot .
0	but i had to deal with the agency because i paid the agency .
2	so .
0	at first , she read out my old address in its entirety , and after correcting her , she then read out a combination of my old and new address , but finally grasped my new address on the third attempt of explaining it to her .
2	they havent answered an_email for over a month !
0	just 0 to 0 days . normally its even quicker_than that .
2	the never - ending invoices continued to arrive .
2	as a result , i have posted on these sites which has not helped your reputation .
0	superb company , well_priced , great customer_service and the ability to pre_- book a courier to pick your lens back up , so you know exactly how much you ' ll be paying before you order is excellent !
0	i have not contacted the company with my disappointment , as i am sure they would happily exchange the unused mattress - i just don ' t want the hassle of returning it etc and not having a mattress while i waited .
2	i have lost money on phonecalls and time waiting in for a delivery that never arrives
2	so easy to search and order and delivery is second to none , very often with free popstage as well .
0	customer_services were excellent though and quick to help with my problems .
2	total_joke of a company
0	friday : mazuma received phone and issued argos_voucher
0	i ordered a plastic clamp band , and i receive a piece of metal - completely_different things .
2	ordered the friday_afternoon , got them saturday_morning but the foliage was all poor and wilting , expected better .

2	the simple point the " expert " roy still can '_t grasp is that a thermostat that has_been working_perfectly for 0 months has to have something more than the setting wrong if it suddenly stops working .
2	they have reported the problem to our it department to ensure this gets resolved as quickly as possible .
0	thank great job
2	it took almost two months to be delivered .
0	i made an_email appointment within an_hour of my bonnet flying open and smashing my windscreen .

0	the manager rang me back promptly within the hour , and apologised saying he would contact the warehouse and find out , then call me the next_day .
0	le site rassemble les offres d ’ emplois des grands sites d ’ emploi habituels , ce qui évite de devoir visiter les différents sites les uns après les autres ( pour , en fin de compte , souvent tomber sur les mêmes offres ).
0	google ejaculated printerinks . com and i took a look .
2	the tracking service is excellent as you can follow you parcel from the moment it leaves you until it arrives as it '_s destination .
0	i don ' t mind if an item is out of stock , but a quick email_stating that , and an estimated_delivery date would have been great .
2	very misleading , scamming company !!

0	i can ' t fault the service and price , i would definitely order from them again and i would recommend them to others based on this experience .
2	pleased with delivery time and communication .
0	it was finally delivered , only because i happened to look out the window as the van was driving by .
2	its presence immediately disfigures and downgrades the item you '_ve just spent your good money on .
2	i will be watching for more bargains from this top seller .
0	additionally their service people never any clue about our package or any service we have ordered .

0	always foun what i need on amazon and the prices are great !
2	short_dated produce .

0	the top 00 athens book was just that , the obvious were detailed and written concisely and straightforwardly for those not akin to all that travel bumpkin malark .
0	i was in sheffield shopping with my family for the day when customer_services called me .
0	your account will be deactivated and you will be asked to submit your council tax bill ( this is invasive and a step too far ), these_guys does not respect peoples privacy , rude customer_service and worst still you have 00_% chance of being violated if you are from the minority background these are facts .
2	it didnt arrive .
0	of course you are going to opt into the " pay £_00 for same day fransfer " as like i said , if you are applying for a payday_loan then you are probably in an_emergency .
0	very stressful experience buying from viagogo .

2	easier , and cheaper , than going shopping !
0	being passed from pillar to post im non the wiser .
2	the call lasted 00_minutes ( most of the time with customer_services ) .
0	they charge me full_amount and after 0 months im still trying to get my money back !
2	there is no e_mail address for this company which is ridiculous given that they supply internet services and expect me to use the online service to order from them !!
0	i am not very happy with this provider .
2	it was all so easy i ordered an extra bunch of flowers for my mother for easter .
0	the communication from my account_manager was poor .

2	i will never use this company again , stay_away !!!!!!!
2	the only reason i got o0 in first place was shawn bean .
2	the conclusion of this is that i am deeply dissatisfied with the treatment i have received , i can '_t remember when i have experienced_such arrogance and poor customer service .
2	makes online shopping so much_easier .
2	website now showing goods out of stock and no support from gameseek , other than to say that the goods have been posted .
2	in this day and age this is simply unacceptable practice .
0	it arrived today no damage what so ever fast free shipping i would recommend them to anyone , i will shop with them again amazing prices came with english manual even if it was form france .
2	this was categorically not explained .
0	now made a complaint and waiting on some response from topman .
2	the counterfeiters work in much cruder factories and this is evident in everything they produce , be it electronics , clothing , cosmetics or even viagra .
0	always use to buy our printers and consumables they are cheaper_than others i have tried
2	the camera packaging was sealed and in good condition .
2	they said they would refund me and 0 days_later that has still not happened .
0	here ' s a few things i ' ve learnt from experience and what staff have told me .
2	a few_days_later after receiving no response i chased world_stores only to be told that the item was not available ( despite it being still advertised on the website ) and a refund has_been requested .
2	very impressed with gadgetpanda , great communication and fast payment .
2	ordered a pair of shoes which i would of thought would of been new .
0	when i contacted them about my missing belt , the best they could come up with was that it was definitely sent , and would i accept a £_00 . 00 credit towards my next order ?
2	prompt and reliable service , i would recommend them , easy online booking and confirmation texts where useful .
0	great service and great product !
0	inconclusive , but they " suspected " different problems .
0	eventually i chased down the details of delivery ( had to phone up , which is not good ) and everything was arranged and delivered .
0	all i can say is thanks to bratislava stags for one the best weekends away any of use had .
0	this vpn is very stable , and very safe . when i use some chinese vpn before , i found my internet company can realized it , but after i use strongvpn , my internet company cant find me again , this is very important in china , you know .
2	no problem with the company itself , more of an issue with their courier .
0	a game which is in stock is still ' processing and awaiting stock pick ' 0 days_later .
0	what i recommend for this and other website which is set_up solely to take money , is for all members to upload a photo that you have used on other_sites , such as facebook , then it could be found on google image search should anyone be interested .
0	initially was refunded for items not provided in the shipping .
0	i called them to explain the fault and they told me to send the phone back .
2	ordered through travel_fx 00 / 0 and paid travel_fx with an expected arrival date of 00 feb_0000 , plenty of time allowed for transaction .
0	people on the phone at the flower place seemed okay and were very apologetic .
0	i wasn ’ t exactly sure which design to choose , so sent the guys at lovekimono an_email to see if they could help .
2	i came_across this company '_s website via_google .
2	my old packard bell easynote came with 0gb_ram but can take 0gb max .
0	it worked_fine for 0 months and after that a non stop for the internet problem .
0	this may have been down to the delivery company though .
2	second , the replacement ticket ( seemingly not to the same value of the first ) turned_out to be fake and i could not get in to the concert !
0	like it , its shows some potential , but it keeps cutting the end off shows
2	delivered late - on valentine '_s day .
2	well_done terry '_s i shall be back !
0	i sent 0 of the dresses back but heard_nothing about my refund .
0	and for the price ( i upgraded to deluxe ) i expected to get a much more impressive bouquets , the size didn ' t seem to even be as big as the picture , let_alone a deluxe version .
0	it was just a disappointment .
0	now a few email complaints later i was finally granted the permission to use their service again .
2	i have booked a holiday and paying in two parts after the deposit .
2	very good order processing , fast shipment , communication and delivery .
0	i ' m writing this review just because they offer some money back for doing it and also cuz i ' m grateful it worked .
2	legendary delivery times .
2	faultless !

2	ordered underfloor insulation boards which arrived promptly , well_packaged . excellent service .
0	friendly , direct communication with a fast response time .
0	we cancelled the agreement with them as we saw many bad_reviews about one of their other_websites and have never , to this day , received a refund .
2	!
2	the staff where helpful and friendly , breakfast was good , the hotel was near the venue i was going to , i would book here again if nothing for the staffs good nature and attendance towards me , and everyone_else there as apparently it was the busiest it '_s been for a while .
0	they ' re a huge company which means mass - production for value rather then quality is gonna be seen here .
0	!
0	i m very happy with the service . both our phones are now succesfully unlock and able to enjoy our iphone . thanks again .
0	my broadband issues this time were sorted very quickly .
0	all attempts of communication did not seem to be effective at all as i got no response on my query .
2	i ordered a clothes pulley , and the whole_process - from choosing , to ordering , to delivery , to assembly - could not have been easier .
0	could of done with being a little closer to more night life & closer to the sea front .
0	if your selling smaller , cheaper items then it isn ' t too bad , but larger items incur final fees of 00_% or more , on top of the listing fees !
0	as you can understand this is a very frustrating situation , especially_considering we ordered the mattress almost a week_ago .
2	i received an estimated delivery date for before 00th and 00th_march and also ordered the furniture assembly service for each of the two_separate items .
0	they had no obligation to assist me as my warranty had expired years before .
0	mi reazons for use bullguard are :
2	takes all the pressure away from your travel_arrangements assuring good value
2	we will travel to dubai tomorrow to attend the concert on april 00 .
0	i ' m not so worried_about smaller purchases but i ' m now cautious_about making expensive purchases over concern about how long it could take to get a refund or replacement should anything go_wrong again .
0	things here may be cheaper somewhere_else but somewhere_else may be more_expensive .
2	we bought a coffee_machine last month from there , great custiomer service .
0	i ordered their standard broadband package expecting a service fast enough to do all the usual things you ' d expect from the internet in 0000 , streaming hd video , having more_than a couple of devices hooked up etc .
2	i recently transferred some eur and exchanged into gbp .
0	!
0	i had lasik intralase wavefront performed on both of my eyes in february_0000 and an enhancement , but lets call it a correction in october_0000 and have regretted that decision ever since .
0	the company were spot on despite the cock ups , and issued a refund me without any fuss .
2	we have been using it while we refurbish the property and it is wonderful to sleep on .
0	wish i had looked there first instead of wasting my money !
2	i will not use them again , even if they are cheaper_than competitors .
0	really quick delivery and excellent product - new shaker looks so good !
0	i called the courier to find out what was going on and from the very start the lady was rude , abrupt and very unhelpful .
0	after about 0 attempts to contact me they made the cap as best as they could and i am very satisfied with the quality , speed of delivery , and the company as a whole .
0	i couldn ' t get though to customer_services by phone about delivery .
2	had my product listed with full description at a great price and it was in stock .
2	when he arrived there was no_messing_around , once i had given him the locking_wheel nut key he got straight to the job .
2	at 00 . 00 i had to ring and ask her if she ' d received anything because i felt sure she would have rung if they had .
0	whilst polite customer_services do not really answer or have the ability to answer your questions .
2	i would recommend cookersandovens but i would also recommend people search the internet for a better deal as my purchase from cookersandovens was due to wanting a specific oven that most others suppliers did not stock .
0	ups have advised that it is currently with customs , and have not yet responded to my escalation emails .
2	very weak construction at the plug end .
0	all of the clothes were too big on me ( that ' s better_than being too small though , that ' s what usually happens to me when i order online ) i do like the clothes but i ' m not sure if they are worth the price , and even_though they do offer free shipping . i had to pay a lot of duty . i was very surprised on how much the duty was .
2	their stock is invariably at variance with the data on their computer ( in every branch i '_ve ever been in to ).
0	i can ' t believe the score is so low for dpd !
0	he was so blasé with his attitude , he was approaching rude .
2	would recommend .
0	their blog is well worth following !
2	thinking it would be more efficient if they used the customer reference_number which had been supplied in the original email , i offered that instead .
2	scumbag company as many other_reviewers have said .
2	passion digital are knowledgeable in the digital space while also having a really good understanding of how to engage with the customer and get results across key digital marketing .
2	i will not order from healthysupplies because of this , unless they change their packing procedure .
0	well , i got lucky and i got a vauxhall astra back !
2	( i will be forward a link of this review to them to make a point )
0	very good condition will make a wonderful christmas_present defiantly reccomed this company
0	this company needs to get their act_together , i ' ve been tracking my parcel from the beginning of when it got shipped , as soon as it hit this uk_based company things just went to the dogs !
0	i just want to complain_about the service i have been receiving with regards to their repair and protect washing_machine package i bought 0 months_ago .
0	i ' ve recommended to many friends already and i will be buying christmas_presents for friends and family also .
2	shipping per se was actually quite fast ( 0 days to austria ), but it took 00 business days for them to even get the frames for fitting the lenses , then another 0 days before the order was shipped .
2	i '_ll definitely_use argos again but perhaps for a product like this i '_ll use a different company where i can inspect it before i buy .
0	friendly driver , he even apologised for the wait .
0	especially as it took 0 working_days anyway , however postage was free and i ordered many parts adding up to around 000gbs .
2	i duly did and then 0 days_later had a similar email - now hardly any choice !
0	perfect service as always will be back and would recomend to anyone .
0	the free date change is a really good perk - you don ' t know until you get somewhere how long you are going to need so we used it a couple of times .
0	starting with the good : they have a great range of films and you can even watch online .
2	one last thought , if this is a duplicate order & i happen to end up with two tents , how exactly are you going to pick_up the duplicate considering i live on an island 00 miles offshore ?
0	i accidently purchased 0 units of the same order off their website .
2	several days_later , they eventually turn_up .
2	i chose frames then had a fitting .
2	no email to advise of a delay .
2	easyjet or sleazyjet as some of my friends like to say . are the prices fair for what you get . hard to say tbh .
2	not only did we get a good washing_machine , we got cash_back ( bosch promotion ) the company phoned us to double_check our order and we got as good as next_day delivery free ( ordered monday at 0pm , arrived wednesday ) .
0	i went to vision_express and the cost of the frames was over priced .
0	the total_lack of customer_service says to me that if anyone does get their sunglasses from them double and triple check them because i would definetley guess at them being fakes !
0	been chatting with sammie_taylor on my first transaction with these_guys and she has helped_me through step by step with the transaction .
2	i asked if the trainers could be delivered next_day and he asked for my 00 digit number from the card - again , felt like i was interrupting his flow - but i went with it and gave him the details .
2	if only there was a competitor
0	using hostel_bookers is so easy - they even give you directions to the place !
0	well technically once it was posted it arrived quickly .
2	there had been no phone_call and the fridge_freezer was left in the middle of our storeroom complete with packaging despite our invoice stating that it would be unpacked and all packaging removed . we sent an_email to curry '_s and their response was to tell us to phone customer_services and arrange for the packaging to be uplifted .
2	see you in 00 months when my contract runs out
2	a very easy transaction
0	three times !
0	told they tried to call me on my number but it wouldnt connect so they had cancelled my food , no email , no text , nothing !
0	my dog was confused is this man invisible ?
2	i ' m an experienced electronic engineer , designing medical equipment for the international space station , so it '_s not as if i ' m without relevant knowledge !
0	one email a month would be plenty
0	but for the price i paid i could not be bothered to send them back .
0	great company , great service - very clever !
2	well_worth the money .
2	the item was quoted as ' in stock ' with delivery ' in three days '.
2	my experience of this company is very good and i will without_doubt use them again
2	this is unacceptable and the public should be protected .
2	with the different pieces not used i am able to do something more in a different design .
2	and very good value for money compared to supermarket meat , which seems to be of a lesser quality .
2	your money is freezin ." on and on .
0	the phone is in good condition ( will look new once i ' ve cleaned some much off the screen ) and well_packaged ( boxed in a generic box , phone protected by bubble_wrap , charger kept safely away from phone screen , all in a correctly sized jiffy_bag ).
0	worse is that this time they ' ve given me a credit note rather_than just refunding what i ' ve paid which means that now i ' ve got to go through the hassle of getting them to send me a cheque / cashing it .
0	i ' ve been buying different professional haircare products and always received them in time .
0	an entirely hassle_free process .
0	sometimes there is great deals on there and i love the one click payment option .
2	also viagogo email you saying if you can '_t get there in so many days they will destroy your tickets people go on holiday you know and may miss this , this needs to change it would be devastating after paying all that money !
2	parcel was late being picked_up so i rang company .
2	000 / 00x0 = 00 days to delivery - shall not be happy if they are only fit for compost heap .
0	i have since emailed protect_your bubble showing the ipod ' s registration in my name on the apple support website , but i have not yet heard any reply .
2	i had to work had to persuade the staff_member to let me speak to a manager .
2	i received my order very quickly after purchasing it .
2	the sellers i have encountered have all been responsive and happy to reply to enquires .
0	i wish people would stop rating this complete scam of a company with 0 or 0_stars .
2	found the products and prices really good only problem i had was with the delivery , arranged a delivery date before going on holiday only to find i had to wait another week before my order arrived .
2	very affordable with special_offers .
0	we wasn ' t sure if we wanted to just do vegas or a multi trip , we gave michelle all the different options we wanted to explore and she gave us quotes for every option possible and ensured she found the best possible price for us !
0	these are a bunch of clowns with no_idea about prompt reliable customer_service or how to perform internet / mail order retail successfully .
0	no surprises to say that 0 items ( which were way too large to be hiding under flaps ) were not there .
2	but to no_avail .
2	not with them now but was for 0 years and found them to have excellent coverage wherever i was in the country
2	treat
2	will be back for more very soon .
0	can ' s wait to put that on my canon_0d mkii .
2	i find i have a lot of connection issues , it is always dropping the internet , and today when i was trying to get hold of my daughters school i couldnt get a signal , to be honest im sick of getting the sign which means no signal !.
2	please_please_please do what a review site is supposed to do and show reviews good and bad - dont make it so easy to block a bad review just because a company is paying you to be on your site .
2	really good
0	raised an issue via trustpilot , had contact from magic_madhouse who offered a resolution .
2	i have contacted your customer service over the phone and still_waiting .
2	i was suprised to find that they were still selling them as everyother site i had checked did not have the listed or were out of stock .
0	i dont normally review anything but the service was so bloody good they deserve 0 minutes of my time .
0	brought an item of ebay , was meant to be 00 hour courier .
2	i made a criticism of amount of water in chicken .
0	over all 0 very happy customer
2	very quick dispatch and 000_% accurate delivery time

2	stefan / malta
2	i received the contact details from the finance company almost straight_away , but no confirmation from pauls cycles .
0	easy , no booking_fee , fast , and friendly - that ' s why i use hostelbookers for already more_than 0 years from now .
2	hassle_free , but prices could be a bit higher i think .
0	please_accept our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience that this may have caused .
0	there is no uk tuner facility which means no freeview hd .
0	quick transaction fast delivery .
0	you read about online scams and stuff all the time , but i decided to give simplycdkeys a chance anyway , and the service was fantastic .
2	i was also told that the coffee_table could be sanded down and would look like new , who has ever paid for a new item to be told that it could be sanded down to look like a new one , i bought a new one !!!
2	i wish i ' d booked with hotels . com because their price guarantee lasts right up to the hotel '_s cancellation window .
2	everyting perfect and fast : i '_ll be back soon for more bargain !
0	in the end it didn ' t arrive until the tuesday the following week .
0	then out of nowhere , a small slab of lasagne arrived in front of me , stone cold !!!
2	the neck was perfect so i just lowered the string action a little and it was fine , no frett dressing was required .
2	may be better to order by phone as the onlne ordering is not what it should be .
0	however i never rely_on this because i dont think next_day delivery can ever be guaranteed .
0	we ' re very excited to go and chuffed with the service .
0	also , i bought a grey top with sequins , and they kept falling_off after a day .
0	ordered a pedal board case and it arrived next_day can ' t complain hassle_free will use gak again .
2	andertons was a breath of fresh_air and i was treated with respect as a customer from the start .
0	have used hostelbookers a few_times and would def_recommend .
0	hopefully someone from the companies office picked_up the dispute and made sure the item was delivered on time
0	£_00 pounds for the game , and it ' s still not here !
0	the service here is really unnecessarily stupid .
2	i purchased it , and am very glad i did .
2	my order no by the way is the one sent already to your website .
2	there are 0 cable hole covers missing , they have made an access hole in one unit to allow access to a power socket and have cut it with wavy sides just like an diy person might do , there is most of a large bar_code label still stuck onto the front of a cupboard , one screw has_been screwed in and split the veneer .
0	this is an excellent company .
0	so i decided to use express delivery because i so desperately_needed these items and believed i would get them quicker .
2	we booked flights from luton to tenerife with monarch .
0	i have shopped at cw many_times .
2	just the fact that they do not have contact details would stop me using them again .
2	i received a phone_call on 00 november from tom who assured me they were taking action to prevent these issues occurring again and it was unreasonable to expect the ceo of a multi million pound company to respond !
2	the free game is a way of playing when you havent any cash and the big game at the end of the month is great , the slots are my favorite as there are not many bingo rooms the way you could improve is chat in the slot rooms and chat_games .
2	prompt deliveries , great customer service , fabulous products ; great value for money
2	a week and a half later with no call .
0	really really disappointed with the service .
2	i ordered my spec '_s on monday_afternoon and they were with me by friday_morning and i got one pair free .
0	i would definitely_recommend this service and will use it again in the future .
0	fair_enough .
0	ordered a sofa last friday after they claim next_day delivery .
0	they offered the best price so i went with this company .
0	i wouldn ' t stay here again unless i could make_sure to get a top floor room to avoid the possibility of noise from above .
2	ordered yesterday - arrived this morning and now fitted .
0	i reported this to groupon and they said it will take 00 working_days for them to investigate at which point i must call them back for the result as they will not call me .
0	the booking page is clear it tells you exactly_what you need to pay when you get there and also about cancellations , which as a backpacker is key information as plans always change !!
0	this has pissed me off as i have had to spend 0 days at home waiting for this , i got an_email on the 00 / 00 /_0000 saying it was being " out for delivery " at 00 : 00 :_00am , and again on the 00 / 00 /_0000 at 00 : 00 :_00am , and yet nothing .
0	and im still_waiting for this issue to be resolved even after 0 emails , and over a month .
0	really gone out of their way at times to help .
0	the first time i install all my apps and programs and affter i install bullguard , now i first install bullguard and latter all the programs and all works_fine , i dont have infections , i dont feel my computer slow down , and i feel so secure .
2	i had already ordered this through comet 0 weeks_ago only to find it was out of stock with no supply date
0	only let_down is , it can take time for it to be delivered over however that cannot be helped due to the company being in guernsey & me being in london .
2	don_'_t have to look_elsewhere for much else .
0	great vendor , fast service and excellent communication .
2	excellent email communication notifying of each_stage of order process from when order taken to delivery .
0	so yeah in one word " brilliant "
2	i did not want one but i had to say no at_least 0 times before i could end the call .
0	0 .- the geekbuddies sometimes dont prevent the consecuences of their actions , one time i ask to upgrade my product because i have troubles whith this and i can not initilalize windows on normal mode only in safe mode .
0	!!
0	i unlocked an iphone0 .
2	could not criticise service in anyway .
2	so thanks for that !
0	the site is well_laid_out and includes a variety options when choosing a place to stay .
0	although the frame is cheap bear in mind that the price of even the most basic bespoke frame will be more_expensive than this whole item and a basic bespoke one would probably not end up looking much_better .
2	that '_s what it always feels_like anyway because the items often arrive the next_day .
2	they go heavy on selling you a cover upgrade .
2	thank_you and regards from murphy .
2	well , i '_ve booked hotel / apartments through alpharooms numerous_times over recent years .
2	he will only do this if he can sell for a premium price ( apple , armani ; etc_.)
0	the camera arrived faster_than_expected and is exactly_what i was looking for , the price was excellent too .
0	they clearly seem to think that coats are what europeans wear for fashion , not for function .
0	i was originally looking for a wedding_ring i searched the internet as i was could not find the ring i wanted in any of the high_street / shops .
0	i was considering selling mazuma my htc hd desire but as they only pay out £_000 i do not want too .
2	your service brilliant till the point the phone arrives , after that you not really care to much , as you send me to samsung warranty .
0	i cannot get any discount .
0	only one suggestion , be very clear about what is included in the package .
0	!
0	hey , i recently_purchased two tickets to sensation white at the plesuredome , amsteradam and unfortuantely the person who did it for me put in the wrong email address .
0	the online management tool was really good .
2	there should be a law against this behaviour and trading_standards should shut them down .
2	after hours trawling the jewellery_quarter for an engagement_ring i happened upon marlows .
0	a very reliable company to use , even_though i had my doubts at first , as i ' d not heard of them before .
0	i do however have a few problems : i think that the customer_service is very very poor , taking a long time to reply or just completely ignoring you .
2	the company charge much less_than parcelforce , dhl and many other carriers .
0	such a con of a website and a copout response from viagogo - never again will i use them .
0	customer_services replied initially and told me they would be back in touch once they had spoken to the courier , which they never did .
2	order q0000000 flowers nice but why was there no card attached and delivery did not ring the bell
2	needed specific product - chair raiser .
2	as other customers have said , rattan_direct took my money on 0th_march_0000 .
2	they took my money and then couldn_'_t confirm the flight or provide a ticket .
2	the shopping_experience was great , the website promised loads and the cost was reasonable . but to be honest , the coffee isn_'_t really that good .
0	prompt delivery etc . just very frustrating that size ordered was misleading on their site .
2	at this point alarm_bells were ringing in my ears so i declined the power pack and after finishing the call went_onto the review site to check out customer reviews .
2	the stitch around the outer corners of the rug looks a little thin but time will tell if it stands up to wear and tear .
0	in many ways i love ebay .
0	i am aware of wear and tear but . so soon .
0	such good prices generally half the price of anywhere on the highstreet , and usually delivered within a 0 days or so .
2	i understand that the oe wants to sell the product , and that they are high_street company , but they really need to be honest with their patients / customers rather_than talking in small_print .
0	good to keep in touch with friends but you end up with a list of people you dont want to talk too , dont really care about and you have to read how boring there life is on your home page from there status .
2	i have been using interparcel for years but have stopped recently because it is just not that user_friendly .
2	eventually we reached them by phone and asked if we could exchange it for another machine which would fit .
0	i began googling the redpoint jacket when i got home and found that it did come with a hood .
0	terrible for a parcel which cost less_than 00 pound to pay 00 x for only agency fee .
0	i was genuinely surprised that something under £_00 would be free delivery , never mind £_00 . 00 !
0	great . but their customer_service is beyond bad .
0	after a couple of days i contacted them again saying i haven ' t received the refund , adding that i placed the order nearly a month_ago , haven ' t received anything in return , and i think it is fair to ask to complete the refund as soon as possible .
2	any other company i have dealt_with sees a pop and promptly refunds customer !
2	i was so amazed at the speed my converse high tops arrived as they were for my daughter and they made her day !!!
2	think again .
2	perhaps i '_ll use interparcel on occasions for more complex items
2	i ordered a gas_hob online from marks on a tuesday_evening ( 00 / 00 / 00 ).
0	my experience was not good with this company .
2	i would highly_recommend this company , i have been buying from them years and had a trouble_free service .
0	nick quilter provided a brilliant service and is clearly an expert in his trade .
0	the customer_services at this company is a total joke and in a way i am glad it all fell through as i found the package cheaper elsewhere .
2	great perfume at a very competitive price but the post to me nearly missed the birthday it was a present for .
0	i find they are generally too expensive compared with other online_retailers , more often than not they charge more for pre_- owned games than for a new copy of the same game ?
0	update_:
0	i caught the delivery man peeing in front_door of flars 0 ! weeks before and i was upset with him for that , he started , to abuse me instead for saying sorry , i wrote to the company about this issue got no reply and no action was taken
2	will use lesar again .
2	but the best thing is the choice of places for fitting so where ever i am i can use the local fitting service .
0	the customer_service was totally unhelpful .
0	thanks !
0	after phoning up for the second time last thursday i am only now getting an_email_stating i will get my refund that will take up to another 0 to 0 working_days and i am yet to see the chocolates !
0	tried yodel and booked a parcel before reading the trust_pilot reviews .
2	anyway after over 0 months disappointment , i had had enough and i contacted my bank and had to fill out some forms detailing all my emails and the correspondence i got back from them , and i received refund in full from my bank , we then managed to buy a 0ds much_cheaper with extra games from well_known high_street store .
0	the company had the cheapest price for the product i wanted ; this did not come at the expense of service , quality or delivery .
0	visual soft have been excellent from start to finish .
0	i raise a ticket and they do reply very quickly ( queried my delivery today , got a reply within 0 minutes ) - so maybe those complaining that they never hear back should check their junk_mail folder first .
0	when they received my ipad they sent me an offer of £_000 !
0	after ( he ) trapping my finger as i tried to help the imbecile close the box , i endured a further minute of his profanities .
2	bit of a distraction but at_least three of the games came with threats that avg was not happy about and on at_least two occasions i lost my pointer .
2	not even the decency to communicate properly with customers !!
2	we did have a great holiday and the price was good but we also had a few issues along the way .
0	!
2	rarely had to contact customer_services but on the occasions i have , they have been quick to come back to me and resolve any_queries .
0	we have also bought various pairs of shoes and trainers from here and again the staff have been friendly and my children have also had a good choice of shoes to choose from .
0	i thought i would give another side to all the rants as the reviews expressed are probably a bit one sided - people tend to comment only when they have a problem , not when everything goes_smoothly .
0	i have a fiesta which i stupidly decided that kwikfit will be a great place to do a full service on .
2	as they take the money the moment you make the order , i think they make their profit on the interest rather_than selling garden_buildings .
2	arrived 00_minutes early for our return_journey which extended the hanging_around at the airport .
0	highly_recommend .
2	it '_s not helpful either when you have to call 0000 number !!
2	after 0 days i emailed them to point out that was more than a few_days and they replied that the item was " on backorder with the manufacturers with no specific lead time ," hmmmm .
0	i spent the day with my coat on and won ' t be wearing this outfit again !!
2	money was taken from my card immediately .
0	it ' s simple .
0	the company is an ubsulte joke , there quick to get a uk_based call_centre to try and keep you with them but soon as you have a problem your get through to someone in india who cant understand i word your saying , they sound like robots and keep repeating the same_thing as if there reading off a script .
2	person said they would get the driver to turn_around and try again .
0	went in store to ask a few questions about what deals / tariffs they have got and the staff_member said , " just a minute " looked away and started talking to his friend at the counter , 0 minutes later i was walking down the road .
0	the only_downside is that the 00_% deposit is charged in english pounds .
2	shocking customer service .
0	and we shall refund it as soon as we get the product back .
2	that would be business suicide if they were doing that .
0	i order something along time ago on website and didnt hear_anything about it
2	occasionally i have had cause to make a personal call to their customer_services , every time i am greeted with a polite and knowledgable person , who acts swiftly to confirm or resolve any_queries i may have .
2	they once were the number one company , but over the years the standards have drop_off quite .
0	this does not give me any confidence in their service what so ever .
0	when all i wanted to do is sort out this ridiculous account .
2	would go back and gladly do bissness with this company again .
2	this clare duly did , however , she told me the director was not available to approve compensation and she would call me at 00am on monday .
0	i have brought a few things in the past and they have been good but the postage is very high and puts me off buying .
2	when i plugged the playbook into my pc , to my surprise , it connected – once .
2	this is the first guitar that i have not had to adjust the truss rod ( i have six other guitars all brought new ) i don_'_t know whether it was set_up at the factory or whether dawsons set it up but it is certainly a factor that will influence me to use dawsons again .
2	he said he had done that .
2	will_definitely_use again .
2	acc no 000000
2	i needed to defer the start of my trip by one week and the cost quoted was an unbelievable 000_euro !
2	annoyed as had to go and collect it
0	sadly i will not use aria again for any pc purchases as i could not deal having to speak to the same uncommunicative arrogant customer_service rep in the event of a problem .
2	i '_ve ordered 0 in the past by to family and friends much further afield , so therefore unable to see the actual quality and standard of the bouquet and flowers supplied .
0	what more can you ask for a * service !
2	that most_recent one makes them out of line for simple stuff such as wordpress hosting .
2	it has a premium_rate number for after_sales which just seems like a scam .
0	i have been a customer of vodafone for around 00 years - when calling to upgrade my handset they would not offer me a better a deal only something thats more_expensive per_month or to upgrade to 0g for an extra tenner a month !
0	will_definitely use mazuma again , and have no quams recoomending them to others !
0	whereas some just . didn ' t .
2	the company is at the mercy of the free - lance drivers it hires and if they don_'_t care much we finish up with low scores on here .
0	i will not be using cash_generator again .
2	changed the way i feel about the company plus i have now lost a valuable client because of all this .
2	excellent service and great glasses for the price .
0	firstly i was trying to see what details were required for my credit_card and the numerous options present on the page was somewhat confusing and when i thought i was just checking the validity of my credit_card , it went through as a payment .
0	i would highly_recommend identity !
2	the whole_process was straightforward and easy and the price was very good .
2	i '_ve ordered tyres through blackcircles for more than 00 years and for a variety of our family '_s cars .
2	:)
2	the service and transaction were fine .
2	i '_ve purchased the correct fitting for my car off ebay and its cost me £ 0 . 00 so why can '_t they do that .
2	one thing i have learnt tho is their delivery service is a bit poor if you choose the next_day delivery option as 0 out of 0 times - it has never got here the next_day , and the saturday delivery is even worse - that never comes !
2	then you don_'_t have to worry_about sending pins out in the post .
2	all in one site .
2	i live in dundee , scotland & we have many tesco stores available to us , but our local is south rd & myself & my daughter are recognised by security staff & till operators alike . it '_s good to feel you have a familiar friendly face if you do have a problem & it is always quickly & efficiently resolved & they are good natured & exchange a bit of banter & we have a good laugh . which just adds to the shopping_experience .
2	p0g might be cheap but please do not use them .
0	order memory_card was expecting it to be delivered in 0 or 0 days .
2	i appreciate she has a job to do , but she could easily have diffused things with just a little consideration .
2	after a week i decided to cancel and sent an_email_confirming this and requesting confirmation but .
2	well , monday came and went , as did the rest of the week and nothing .
0	this is a company that offer competitive_prices on their products and quick delivery , however they need to make some major improvements in terms of their communication with customers both in keeping them updated on the status of an order and being available for contact .
0	they are just a bunch of scammers !
0	einar met us at the airport and took us to get the car .
2	i think that if you have ordered you will receive your knife eventually .
0	definately be using again .
0	thank_you .
2	!
2	excellent customer service and deal with orders efficiently with fast shipping and competitive_prices .
0	incdently , superfi were still selling the item at full price and so wouldnt have made any loss by refunding me . as i said appalling customer_service . i will be taking my custom striaght back to amazon who are top_notch company !
0	i registered my phone and the free paid envelope arrived within 0 days , i sent the phone and again within 0 days the money was in my account , overall the whole transaction took approx 0 week super
0	it didn ' t cause us any_issues with flights etc but extra stress you could do without whilst on holiday .
2	their well_trained and knowledgable staff will have , or will find you the answer .
2	got the tyres i wanted at the right price , right time , right place , could not get any better . perhaps knocking on your front_door to say they have just been fitted .
0	i ' d likely shop with them again , just be aware that they dropship from various suppliers directly ( most companies do , these days ) and as a result sometimes errors occur on their part of their third_party .
0	all in all they are a horrible company to deal with , don ' t be suckered in by their cheap deals as what you may have saved in money , you pay for in time , effort and stress with having to deal with rude and frankly incompetent staff .
2	in view of this excellent service i '_ve updated the rating to 0_stars .
0	they want to charge me for a new phone !!
2	this email will confirm your bank server has accepted the refund transaction .
2	i have had no_problems with this company and prefer my package to anything bt or others have to offer .
2	once , prime time dramas had 00 to 00_minutes between breaks .
2	well_packaged , beautiful table and chairs .
0	i ' ve often taken returns back to store for a refund or even an exchange but it has always been a hassle .
2	where '_s trading_standards when you need them - this company needs removing from the internet so no one can place any further orders with them as they are clearly not honouring them but pocketing the cash .
0	i bought a new car at the grimsby branch with a trade - in of my old car .
2	after_placing the order ( after ) we were surprised to be told that the item was not in stock , but will take about a week .
2	they said yes if they had the lenses so i asked them to check if they had them for a pair of glasses and a spare pair .
2	things !
0	they have also sent threatening final payment requests to my home , saying they will take me to court , i had a solicitor ' s letter in january demanding that i pay .
0	this is extremely unreasonable and unacceptable
0	[_name ] didn ' t stop creating until i was 000_% happy .
2	i have not yet even received my ink so cant really say at moment but if and when i do i give you a review
2	they always arrived when expected , their work was carried_out efficiently and neatly and to a very high_standard , and they were both a pleasure to work with .
2	when my cards arrived , i was disappointed to find that they needed to be cut down because borders were visible on two sides , even_though they hadn_'_t been visible on the proof .
2	customer service is terrible , they never know anything and are not prepared to chase up an order or find its whereabouts .
2	i ordered a completely standard pair of glasses on 00th .
0	definitely keep using this site !
0	great deals and great service from chillisauce .
0	so now i am not going to be able to see / sign in the delivery when it comes , neither will my parents because they will be at work .
2	i ' m really glad i bought this stereo unit , really pleased with it . sounds good , does what i want it to do and is easy to operate the service from hifi_tower and delivery was very fast and the unit was extremely well_packaged . thank_you .
0	and there ' s no water_damage to the phone either , loads of bollocks !
2	they were absolutely frosty towards us , despite the fact that my poor husband was clearly not at all well .
0	how bad they are !
0	useless and poor internal comms !
0	they changed my tariff to help me .
0	i thought i ' d have to wait a couple of days for the keys to come through but they were there the morning after i ' d ordered them online the previous afternoon .
2	i took the 0 receipts back to the shop , along with the packaging , explained the situation and asked for a refund for the difference in price .
0	told every time that the parts would arrive the next_day .
2	i was now much more frustrated by their attempts to avoid dealing_with me than i was by the delivery of the wrong product , and was going down the small - claims and county - court route to seek redress .
2	what can i add , to my heading , i found the on - line experience extremely easy with griptape !!!
2	excellent range of hi -_fi equipment . ordered an audiolab m - dac , received it the next_day . took the option not to have the cable deal which took the price down to around 00gbp cheaper_than anywhere_else . huge_range of ex - demo equipment too . one stop 0st choice for all your hi -_fi needs , i will_definately be shopping there again . many thx
0	this has not put me off groupon as ive ordered from them in the past and been very satisfied .
0	i use tcb to buy things as i usually would so it ' s not like i am going out of my way or buying things that i usually wouldn ' t , except i use this portal to link to my chosen shop / service and get rewarded handsomely in doing so !
0	very well_packaged and just what i was looking for , thanks !
2	in summary " well_done fashion_interiors "
2	can we push this product at you ?
2	0 william street
0	jambo pallets used to be good from here .
2	it '_s obvious who i '_ve just bought computer no . 0 from !
0	of course every product i buy for my guitar will be done through guitarguitar .
0	paula amos
0	the quality of all the meat is good , there ' s no question about this .
0	still have £_000 worth of audio_equipment unopened in its box which is completely_useless and worthless thanks to superfi .
0	may i add the first time i had rang iflorist querying about my purchase the girl on the phone was rude , cheeky and not very helpful at all !
2	was told i would still have to pay until the end of the 00 months quoting terms and conditions which i have yet to find .
2	everything was eventually sorted but it did take a very long phone_call .
0	however , my experience with them has been the opposite .
0	it was the first time i purchased from londonperfumeshop . co . uk , and the item was delivered on time .
0	- i was sure on their site it said they would return the handset free of charge ?
0	i was sent a different piece of equipment that i reluctantly agreed to , at a slightly reduced price - which turned_out to be faulty !!!!
0	although it arrived in one peace , and really it comes down to the individuals experience .
2	i asked for my name to be removed from their list .
0	i have over 0 / 0 million points , so kinda class myself as a customer who has the right to moan his arse off if he so chooses .
2	i just need basic pc with small footprint which i can run xp / apache / php / mysql on .
2	i was offered a very fair price for the equipment , and they sent a courier to collect it .
2	or do originals have to be mated to the upgrades so it will function ?
0	to bad need to find an easier away to reset your password and make it easy to use
2	if the rest of the reviews are anything to go by i can kiss my parcel goodbye !
0	both really nice guys who seemed to want my business to perform well , im glad they found me and shared their service , which is that well operated you do genuinely feel you are there only customer and they have no one else to do anything for !, as everything is responded to so quickly .
2	it was fantastic value for money , good quality and was delivered promptly .
0	this is where their business lies .
0	heidi nordsell
0	i can ' t recommend this company enough .
0	i purchased my ticket on thursday and within 0 hours i was notified that my cc may have been misused by an_automated email . i followed their directions of the things they wanted for proof ( still find it very strange since no other site has done this ) and have yet to hear back from someone . that information was sent friday around noon i have yet to hear from them and its saturday evening .
2	i have since made several other sunglass and prescription glasses orders form other sellers which may well have been made with glasses000 if not for there after_sales service .
0	so i ' m now using up an entire days annual_leave stuck in the house all day .
0	i just received my sunglasses , ( arrived the next_day as promised ) they look a lot better_than the picture .
0	company also known as firesgalore .
0	i have used parcel0go . com for a while now and they have always been great .
2	as it happened , the date they offered , i wasn_'_t going to be home .
2	i would like a full_refund of £_000 . 00 and an_apology , please .
0	momondo er rigtigt godt når siden virker .
0	this review is more of a thankyou .
0	kingston upon thames branch is just crappiest shop in london .
0	i have recently_purchased a 00 month web_design course which was £_00 . 00 from which i received a £ 0 credit onto my account from my email , i went through my purchase and my £ 0 credit was not honoured .
0	the holiday was better_than_expected , very helpful staff , perfect oranisation , lookin for next year `_s with them at the moment :)
0	but same time charing 00 gbp for installation of the line i already have !!!
2	they were delivered in two days to the local_garage who also provided excellent service .
0	when sony controls the market , they shouldn ' t need to inflate prices over 000_% for a certain regional market , lack the initiative to ensure all content is equally available and inhibit people who have the incentive to care for international accounts ( i . e .
2	all in all we could not be more satisfied .
2	i used to website to book a holiday to kreta last_year .
2	the playbook would ‘ see ’ the pc but the pc said it was an unrecognised device .
0	i got the confirmation_email , and the phone is now working for claro ( argentina ).
0	finally spoke to a manager and was assured a call back but again never happened .
2	well_packaged to avoid dammage .
0	they came back to me the next week admitting they don ' t have the item in stock any more .
0	it was now friday so we went away for the weekend and have just returned .
0	really the only place i go anymore .
0	on calling their customer_service , it turned_out that one of the items i had ordered was out of stock , despite saying it was in stock on their site .
2	the item was faulty .
2	desk staff were helpful , though at the airport there was nobody in the office at the car drop - off point and the key needed to be left at the desk inside the airport terminal .
0	brilliant business_cards at very high_quality and i could easily adapt and change my design on the website .
2	it was easy to find the specialist memory that i needed to upgrade my new printer .
0	i can see again !
0	i turned the network back on as soon as i landed , and there was " no service " for a good day .
2	my recommendation is that a centre support be used when fitting a 000cm pole , especially when hanging heavy weight curtains .

2	i have just tried to redeem the first one at a clinic that i have used in the past , only to be told that i ' m not eligible as the coupon is for new customers only ( this was not clear on the groupon advert ).
0	it ' s a great search_engine , heaps of info , maps , reviews and so user_friendly .
0	i rang customer_services at lunchtime and was told the same_thing , yet again went through the whole story as to why there was a bill on my account for a repair .
2	from ordering till delivery was only a couple of days it was so quick .

2	i was astounded at the offhand manner with which i was treated .
0	0 .
2	holes and uneven silicone application to bedroom 0 sill , needs to be removed and applied correctly .
2	all in all , thoroughly disgusted that a supposedly reputable chain should feel quite content to blatantly rip it '_s customers off in this manner .
2	would appear that if you post on their facebook_page you get shunted up the list of customers that need responding to .
2	the day after that it was still in wrexham , i rang yodel , the customer service member said he would raise a flag on the parcel and it would be delivered in the next 00_hrs .
0	also , the green stick was broken at the top and the card wasn ' t attached to it .

0	now of course , my review isn ' t all encompassing - i am yet to try one of their many appealing steaks , any of their wide_range of sausages and burgers , or their luscious looking lamb , but i most definitely will be doing so in the near_future , and i have every confidence that this company will impress me again and again .
0	i ' ve been for four days trying to get a proof of purchase from them and the idiots always send something wrong .

0	waste of time these dumbos !
0	it ' s an awesome site which makes it really easy to find and book_hostels online .

0	one thing that was important for me when i was purchasing the pc was future proofing it for as long as possible .
2	i had booked hotels where alpharooms stated the hotels as having rooms with facilities for the disabled .
2	still disappointed overall .
2	good choice but the postage_charges are not apparent until you go to checkout
0	not to mention this brand_new rip_off called " be more dog " or " refresh " where customers ( the stupid ones ) can do an early upgrade if they want to loosing their discounts that would come at the end of their contract .

0	this company doesn ' t in any way approach professionalism .

2	oh - and the service is great too .
2	i presume by new potential_customers . who are obviously more important , as they are generating more money .
2	the technician arrived as arranged and repaired the windscreen which now looks perfect .
2	and too many sites , do not make it clear whether their upgrade parts fit as bought or whether further items have to be bought ?
2	but the other set were good quality , and yet the printed images on the desktop calendar are slightly dark , but more_importantly low resolution and not as sharp as i would expect .
2	they phoned me after only having the car for one hour and said my car had passed the mot apart_from the indicator bulb which was the wrong_colour but they used their common_sense and just changed it there and then .
2	it seems they are now scraping the barrel to get companies to sign up to offer a deal .

2	in 0000 it is unacceptable for a company in the channel to take money off a customer promise delivery and miss that schedule by 0 weeks .
2	it was also a good price , though i have since seen it cheaper elsewhere .
0	it ' s a no_brainer .
2	they are much more_expensive than specsavers but offer no customer service , no personal fitting and the glasses took two_weeks to make - only after complaining_about where my glasses were did they agree to send them out .

2	prices are very reasonable , service is excellent , and on each_occassion , the recipients of the boquets have phoned me immediately to say how beautiful the flowers were .
0	so i ordered it .

0	i never usually_write_reviews but felt_compelled to do so .
2	after i rejected bozowi '_s new offer , which suddenly was a lot lower_than first agreed for my iphone ,( basically they changed their offer once they had my phone ).
2	i wish i ' d read these reviews before placing my first ( and last !)
2	david_: i contacted yodel who told me once found it would be returned , now after loosing the parcel for five days , upsetting my customer , hours of typing loss of sales , your telling_me i have to pay to get my items back ?
0	live_chat not very helpful neither .
0	this was not good enough for me so i therefore rang them back to ask was i getting the mirror or not , the guy replied yet again saying there had a signature therefore we had the mirror so no we would not get it .
0	the ring itself looks great just as i expected .
2	note - there is no telephone_number to contact and eqnuire about an order .
0	tsohost ' s customer_service is nothing short of amazing and is the best customer_service experience i ' ve had from any company , ever .
0	it is great interactive learning , like someone by your side explaining what to do but with more patience .
0	van drivers can be a mixed bunch in terms of trust , but if totd trust them to drive the high end custom fitted merc vans around then they should be trusted to have some company supplied tools to help with instances where a stubborn wheel_nut cap could make the difference_between a failed fitting charge & a very unhappy customer and a faultless 0 star_review service .
0	free delivery is great and they ' re generous with the periodic issue of discount_codes , etc .
0	after this , i assumed i ' d have another go uploading a photo but i wasn ' t prompted to !
0	i ' ve had many orders through supplement_warehouse and have never once had a problem .
0	i ordered the new sony_xperia ray and was expecting a worldwide launch sometime in september .

2	you even have to pay if you want a blanket !
0	awfuly awful service .
0	i have to fly in to madrid for the concert , and i ' m_afraid i won ' t get the tickets at all , and have spent money on nothing .
2	i '_ve read loads of poor reviews about other mobile_phone recyclers and i can_honestly say that : a . mazuma have never questioned their original valuation on the phone and b .
2	wae cannot tell me when the refund will be processed .
0	funny how it took a review on trustpilot to trigger a response from them , they got that email ok !
0	good selection of products on the site , simple process to order .
2	packaging : very well_packed .
2	anyway - my pin is in the post apparently .
0	i had a laptop for about three years before it kicked the bucket , and , to my surprise , i had forgotten about the warranty that i had with it .
2	( auctionchex . com is something similar too and perfectly good , based in the needs of people who are offered cheque payment in another currency .
2	i finally received monies owed on 00th of march but no proper explanation , appology or offer of recompense for all the inconvenience_caused !
2	i can '_t bear to listen to the incomplete information that constantly pours from this iniquitous company , they have taken trust that was built up over many_years and have totally abused it .

0	this is the third time i ' m writing you .
2	autoglass need more technichans in london plus the online booking system is not live as i had looked at it and it had said there was appontments available in london but the call_centre people said that was not correct and a 0 week wait was typical .
0	absolutely awesome , excellent & fabulous service i have received .
0	hostelbookers is an extremely easy website to use , once you ' ve looked up your location you can arrange the given accommodation into ' prices : low to high ' etc which is very helpful if , like me , you ' re on a budget and want to try and find the best value for money .
0	when i upgraded my head i returned to this company for a second time but have had some problems with the measurements due to the manufacturers of my amp not providing the correct ones .

0	i have had to open a paypal case to try and get my money back .
0	from start to finish i received constant contact from them updating me of everything and when i had placed the wrong delivery address they changed it quickly without hassle .
2	of course , over time there are bound to be a few_glitches and i '_ve had two recently .
2	when you get an_email_saying a student has sent a message you click on the on the work " here " and you are taken straight to the message . no further singing in with user name and password as the site is linked to the emails they send .
2	they had what i wanted and some extra things i hadn_'_t thought of .
0	they failed to collect the parcel , failed to rearrange for 0 days , would not give me my money back ( even the extra i paid for next_day delivery - which clearly didn ' t happen .)
0	sadly the website can sometimes have issues such as not allowing payment and ?

0	ordered flowers for mothers_day , they turned_up on time but were wilting and looked on their way out .
2	had to cancel payment myself as they where just going to keep it .
2	excellent service and fantastic quality .

2	found product with lower price .
0	instead of deleting my account on request , they simply told me about all the new things they had since i joined .
2	hotel reception on arrival - unfriendly
2	monday 0rd of march and stock is being allocated to my order .
2	i guess it provides the info you would expect , it '_s all a bit vanilla and sicophantic for my liking .
2	do the honourable thing for your customers - pay up and compensate !
2	looked on the internet and found a . o .
2	there should be a standard sizing code across the world so that you know it will fit especially from the assian countries ie china where their clothes come up small by at_least 0 / 0 sizes .
2	now it seems to be only indian restaurants offering deals .
2	i made 0 orders to wiggle before my recent cycling holiday in spain both of them have been a disaster .
2	having written a bad review due to a very sub_standard bouquet , containing roses that were dying , i now have to write another review because i '_ve had a replacement .
2	was after a computer_desk to match our existing indian wood dining_set we have in the dining_room .
2	i feel so let_down by the very poor aftercare service in eastbourne and don_'_t want to travel to brighton for this .
2	customer service was great too , replied to email same or next_day and were generally pretty helpful .
2	my eyes are also dry since the surgery .
0	recently had problems with my broadband and went to talk_talk who are just useless , then went to bt who are just con merchants . went back to sky .

0	profit !
2	next_day delivery , great communication - highly_recommended *****
2	i would expect much more accurate information , even personal sellers on ebay can provide better quality information and respond to queries or complaint in a much more timely_manner - not sure i would order from car audio centre again after this experience .
0	!
2	placed an order for a quad bike before_christmas and was informed that it would probably arrive on the 00nd or 00rd dec but if not , definitely on the 00th .
2	great price what a price
2	i have only had one experience with them , but i will always look at their site first now before searching elsewhere .
2	good website easy to use , products are always good and very quick delivery .
0	yet after getting a phone call from my close relative explaining she had received flowers i went round to see the quality .
0	i agreed to this .
0	then last but definatly not least , the ladies only river cruise . once in a lifetime and not for the faint hearted !
0	i waited in all day on saturday from early in the morning until late into the evening , i figured i ' d give it more time as it can be very busy and dangerous at this time of year with it nearing christmas .
0	the back of it seemed to have quite a heavy use to it .
0	it ' s your network .
0	this says to me the package has arrived at the manchester depot ( even_though tamworth is nearer to birmingham !!!)
0	they mostly use uk mail as a courier , who are usually downright awful .
2	give them a try - once they were always the cheapest but sometimes it '_s cheaper on amazon .
0	i have been waiting for it . but this situation is pissing me off .
2	however , i had to wait_until 0 days after i placed my order for the goods to arrive .
0	both parcels were collected together on the 0th of october , one arrived alone ( clearly and repeatedly marked ' 0 of 0 ') on the 0th of october and its now the 00th with no sign of the second .
0	finally i have phone again after more_than 0 months as an ipod .
2	i booked a four - night stay at the cricket field hotel in salisbury , and left after three nights .
0	thoroughly satisfied with the printer i bought and the customer_service was fantastic !
0	oh , and i warn you now that any reply , any kind of response from you will be made public .
0	top quality service .
2	i feel sorry for the customer_services people as they are being let_down by the despatch team it seems .
2	! we also paid for transfers from airport and back to airport . but was informed we had to take a taxi to another place where we would be picked_up from ( as we had to vacate at 00am ) which we had to pay over 0 euros when in my opinion i had already paid for transfers !
2	do yourself a favour and order elsewhere .
0	but everyone_knows that just_eat takes half an_hour over the stated delivery time . all my friends have said the same_thing .
0	good nice clothes
2	i am reporting this company to the tps .
0	i ' d like to know if box offers a service to replace missing keys or rather to apply them back on to the laptop , i still have the key , but i can ' t get it back on myself .
0	my transaction_id :_0000000
2	and all this effort for me to give 00_% of my hard_earned income - if i ever get any !
2	had i known the area better and had time i would have been able to book another 0 star hotel for literally half of that price .
0	however they soon lost interest and started to give me the run around .
2	prices were good with free_postage and no nasty visa_card charges .
0	the motorbike tyre was the best price i could find , and even with delivery cost was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
0	!
2	very easy to register and print labels .
2	have been very happy from the day my colour swatch arrived ( very professionally presented ) to the day my vertical blind arrived within the 0 days promised .
2	i would also like to think by me complaining it may improve their customer service for the next person ?
2	so now if i see five_stars i think , ' great ' but if i see three stars i think , ' oh oh , best avoid '.
2	i ordered tickets to a boxing event weeks_ago and paid in full up front .
2	fast delivery excellent price excellent tusted seller 000_%
2	very disappointed .
0	very good product range and great prices .

2	small as we are , we feel we matter too .
2	the goods were first_class and i will be back .
2	checked tracking codes . awaiting_collection when in fact the items were on their vans .
2	however , after a week had passed by and it hadn_'_t turned_up i phoned to find out what was going on .
2	i tried to contact them several_times afterwards but they never responded and never let me know the outcome of their investigation into the detail of the call .
2	no problem , we have received them and a refund is on it '_s way .
2	i like the choices you have and the fact that i can find what i want here .
2	i saved a lot of money by parking within walking_distance of kings cross !
0	i decided to add two stars as after talking to the only reliable person in babydino - adam my problem has been professionally resolved .
0	however - update
0	i would not recommend using skype paid for services , it is a rip_off
2	my order was accepted & payment made on the basis of next_day delivery , therefore a contract is in place & the company is required to deliver in line with that which was agreed , the company failed to do so and is therefore in clear breach of contract , and in my view should have made amends swiftly & openly .
0	the packaging was also a bit flimsy and not very protective so i ' d think_twice before ordering any fragile items or breakable items .
0	the pair of stools i bought are in pride of place under my bar in the mancave !
2	we are extremely pleased with the quality of the workmanship in the constructed units far better_than any flat - pack installation and at a very competitive price .
2	if the venue insists on matching names on the tickets with photo id at the point of entry then you will not get in .
2	i would like to say that it was a fantastic service from your company .
0	myself . had to talk your agent through simple first line checks after him asking me to walk back and forth to reboot my router and tv box for 00_minutes .
0	my previous order took them a month to restock , even_though i paid £ 0 for two business day delivery .
2	my appointment had already been booked , but there were others who were going for their first consultation who appeared to be treated with more priority .
0	!
0	the new card i received was not working or even being detected it was brand_new though still in box , so i contacted cyberpower again , they responded almost_instantly again and suggested to send the pc back to see if something else was the problem .
2	i ordered 0 items with the same company and wanted to leave different reviews for each .
0	another pointer for coolshop - i wasnt aware that the plug would be foreign three point , therefore needed an adapter to use in the uk luckily i checked the product before wrapping
2	would not_hesitate to do_business with jules_b again .
2	no one answers the phone - they don_'_t respond to feedback - frankly avoid at all costs if possible .
0	very happy !
2	i submitted the order and within in seconds realised that the address '_s postcode was incorrect .
0	close this company down .
2	people beware !
2	i was worried that it would not be the right one delivered , but it was .
2	so so overrated :-)
0	my phone was sent off in good condition , followed all of the critieria for a fully working phone iphone_0s in good condition and i was quoted £_000 . 00 - i have received ( although its not actually in my account yet ) £_000 because it was locked to o0 - this was not made clear to me when i entered the contract and i can see from reviews on here that they have only just changed their website this week to say that .
2	had to go away - fitter found a hole in bottom of shower_cubicle box when he lifted it off the pallet with glass pieces trickling out - photographed it and rang and to ask about returning easy plumb tray - told to ring back monday - went through rigmoroll again and eventually the following friday another cubicle delivered .
2	great , will use again for sure .
2	on calling and discussing with paypal they adised me they had recieved numerous_calls regarding escapade today !

2	made a complaint and the mixer was delivered two days_later .
0	i paid for a quick delivery and it arrived when expected .
0	0 .
2	there is a lack of padding around the mixer - as mixers come in different dimensions . the delivery service before_xmas was very good .
0	so good in fact that i ' ve ordered other items from them .
0	after contacting tripsta by e_- mail a few_times , i got a couple of messages saying that " we are still_waiting for the airline ' s contact " and i even got an_email with a booking change that should have been sent to another person .

0	ordered on the 0th_oct 0000 , still havnt received my order .
0	i have proof that i wrote down my postage and billing_address right as i double_checked what i had sent her .
0	i can ' t really afford £_00 extra ontop of what i already pay and all i kept getting told by your customer_service was ' theres nothing we can do sir ' later when i phoned back to ask if they could match a price i have found they told me a load of bs about how theres are a little more_expensive due to the customer_service they offer and putting their money in to that .
2	the villa itself was superb , large and in an excellent position easy access to beach and town
0	a lot of these issues ( spec wise ) could have been avoided by updating and putting in some time and effort into their website .
0	honestly don ' t bother , if you like watching movies from this decade or the last , get something like netflix , they actually have stuff worth watching .
2	i have just checked my credit_card account and a refund is yet to be made .
0	i tracked the delivery most of the day and it said the order was out for delivery it got to about 0pm and this changed to delivery changed by recipient !
2	as a youtube creator who makes a living from monetising my videos , i am too nervous_about purchasing and using their royalty free music any more , because i have used it in the past and it has_been flagged for copyright .
0	keep up the good work and will_continue to use for many years .
0	staff was ok and accomodation also .
2	i am obliged to use them for business , but i will no_longer use them for private use .
2	took orders then said lost in transit , im abit wairy to order now
2	easy to order and the covers arrived quickly and are performing the job entirely to my satisfaction .

2	eventually i went to the depot and collected the delivery myself .
0	we were in venice for one week , and we had not booked any hostels in_advance .
0	lack of information in the website .
0	waited the two week advised period , chased the new delivery date only to be told it will be another three_weeks !. this is a supplier issue , so to some extent beyond dawsons control . but its very frustrating !
2	many reviewers on the site complained ( i did but review didn_'_t show up on the site ).
0	she not only said that the screenshot that i send them wasn ' t from the website she wanted to see .
2	i have now had 0 expensive items smashed by them and these were not fragile items but they still managed to smash them and of course the scam comes into place and no compensation .
2	i have already identifies further work which i will be asking them to do .
0	=)
0	being an internet shopper for well over ten years i ' m always a bit_dubious_about buying from sites that don ' t have a massive reputation , but so glad i did !

2	we also found that we could have put the same deal together ourselves by going direct to the theatre and would have got much_better seats for less money .
2	when i enquired , i was told some products were missing .
2	now given up expecting any reply and have switched to another supplier - life '_s too short !
2	they really don_'_t care and the people you speak are robots who have zero ability to get things done .
0	shame that sometimes mostly everything i want is out of stock .
0	0nd - no one ever saw anyone from dpd .
0	i especially like the reviews and ratings !
0	i told her at the time of booking the hen_party that i doubt they will deliver everything as good as they promise for that low price , but to my amazement they delivered everything brilliantly .
0	other_reviewers are correct its rubbish .
2	have just purchased an ipad0 and think the technology superb but overpriced for what it is .
0	absolutely amazing band !
2	the only thing i can complain_about is the they give you the option of free delivery when you choose collect +, which i have always done , however i am ' always charged delivery the fee which is not good and not too happy about !!
0	never never never please .
2	with caution and try to find independent review_sites like this one .
2	key messages 0 . always check independant feedback before ordering and 0 . purchase using a credit_card so you have section 00 consumer credit act protection for purchases of over £_000 in value .
2	after 00 days i still hadn_'_t arrived nor any communication as to its whereabouts .
2	i got them to send me a dispute form as i have wasted enough time calling redhill , who will just lie and lie again to you as i have found out by reading your reviews today .

0	i asked for a blanket and pillow for my baby boy , as he was tired , and they said we stopped doing those along time ago .
2	picking_up at a box office on the day can be a hassle but i have always been emailed letters of authorization from the original purchaser to take with me .
2	it is just a ripp off .
2	i initially called the number on the website .
0	at the end of april the bill was late being paid and the phone was disconnected , we paid it and customer_services said they could not re connect my accounts as there was an outstanding bill for a repair to the phone , we explained to them what had happened and was told a manager would call me back .
0	my tickets are already here and they tell me what area and row i will be sitting in , so camera at the ready .

0	but , i ordered it on monday lunchtime , and it arrived wednesday lunchtime !
0	the staff , james and claire were doing their best to help but their hands were tied as it was up to customer_services to sort it out .

2	i ordered some stuff almost a month_ago .
0	i tried to book tickets for a comedy gig at the hammersmith apollo .
2	be careful before paying for a top up , it may be better to go directly to your service provider .
0	i even got an_email the day before the collection confirming i needed to stay in for 00_hours the following_day .
2	!

2	after wearing glsses for over 00 years , took the plunge to have the lasik procedure on 0th_june_0000 .
0	the facts are :
2	the operator then said ok - i will check for you .
2	the company does not have a postal_address ( because it is clearly not a uk company ) and its customer_services are a sham .
2	this is the second item i have purchased from this company , and again excellent service and customer_care , have already_recommended to friends and family .
0	i await your explanation in reply .
0	ordered my new guitar , paid for next_day delivery .

2	i travelled overseas and returned in late march when i realised that no refund was paid into my credit account .
2	i had by this time taken 00_minutes chasing answers .
0	the first problem i had was a lack of signal - a month later the merger with orange was announced , and soon after i was able to use orange signal too .
0	but , you ' re there to have a ' good time ', and your friends are looking on , and maybe you even have a date so it would look weird if you didn ' t get a drink .
0	ok it takes two_weeks but definitely worth it
0	i would suggest digital calling_cards to everyone who want to stay connected with friends without burdening their pockets .

0	will_continue to use them as they are exactly_what i would expect from a top web business .
0	in cancelling , we formally requested a full_refund , but despite numerous further emails and phonecalls ( definately some more later !)
0	this saturday i met same delivery man , he said to me that he is gonna hit me once he finishes delivering , i simply called police and this delivery man disappeared quickly , i need to file proper complain in police station as the company doesnt care , so be carefull

0	christina was very helpful !
2	it looks_like maximizing your profits today is your only interest .

0	always search here for the items im looking to buy .
0	absolutely_shocking service and i warn anyone away from using this website !
0	in summary , their product quality is below_average , measurements are out , and delivery and service is shoddy .

2	always efficient and the time and attention they have putting into their online service is obvious .
2	we ordered a bottle of champagne at a great price .
2	• always check a sellers feedback
0	we had not heard from them after a week so logged on to tracker to see that they had reduced the offer to £_00 due to lcd_screen split / phone not working .
0	a simple order confirmation and an order receipt will suffice .
2	no sign of taxi .
0	!
2	efficient floral delivery service that keeps you informed every_step of the way .
0	had a long wait for the item to be delivered , but , was given a small discount .
2	the car was not sold through pistonheads but it was advertised elsewhere and sold , i did have a few emails from people through pistonheads asking for info that was in the advert so they obviously hadn_'_t read it properly !
2	monday 00th , 0 weeks into the 0 day fit and french_polisher arrives and spends a lot of time and effort trying to fix things but despite his efforts we are still left with a door that due to it being squashed somewhen has a very noticeable damaged area and a dented cornice that any professional fitter would not have fitted in the first place so still trying to get a resolution .
2	for those that like cheap then you can '_t complain , but i find the staff slightly aggressive at the airports and the seats on the planes so cramped that you certainly shouldn_'_t expect to move after you sit down .
2	i moved_house on 0th_oct_0000 and it took until the middle of feb_0000 to receive all the money they owed me as i was in credit when i moved , after many expensive phone_calls and being on hold for a ridiculous amount of time i was almost reduced to tears of frustration after they credited the wrong account and said i couldnt have my money until they found out where the money had gone , if i wasnt so stubborn i would have given up , but why should they keep my money , please_please dont use them i just wish i had seen this site earlier .

0	i ordered a pair of oakley_sunglasses that displayed they were in stock .

0	i rang up to tell them that the corners of the picture frame were damaged , as i felt i couldn ' t give someone a damaged gift !
2	it is , in my opinion , total over priced rubbish that can '_t be removed once your " free " updates expire and thus prevents installing free anti_virus alternative software .
2	however after telling them the boot_liner doesn_'_t fit my 00 plate astra they have gone silent apart_from 0 pointless emails asking for photos and telling_me their supplier says it is the correct liner .
2	!!
0	even_though they have reimbursed me , this was an absolutely_ridiculous service .

0	the website was clear and easy to use , choice and prices were very good .
0	the delivery is always quick and free which is always good .
2	the outward_journey was fine , apart_from being initially dropped at a hotel in hurghada instead of el gouna - i needed to call the number provided on our paperwork and ask them to send the driver back to pick us up !
2	eventually got through again to be told the tickets had already been dispatched !
2	after promising a delivery slot for yesterday and staying in , tracking said they couldn_'_t find my address , even_though postcode was clearly on it !!!
0	would i buy again ?

2	get it delivered tomorrow !!
2	they are not prepared to refund the short_stay car_parking charges as they say they contacted us - which is a lie !
2	regards ,
2	when i rang , the girl said that we owed less_than what i said , it appeared that their site was not updated , so no its not the best , that '_s why they ' re cheap !
0	i ' m not sure why they don ' t provide these things .
2	very vast delivery , and easy to deal with online or by phone , also hold great events
2	one star but should be less !
2	animed excuse is that " express " only counts for the delivery method , not how they process the order before dispatch and it seems 0 days to dispatch is considered ok by them .
2	this is the best people to get when booking your place to stay , they are so helpful , i have booked through other company '_s , but this is far the best one yet , take my word
2	this was because our usual hotel had once again raised its prices .
2	i then had to get past their " help " section to ask for a refund .

0	not cheap knock - offs either !
2	i had a phone_call from a lovely_lady explaining when my order would arrive and when it arrived on time , i was delighted to discover that it did fit my barbeque .

0	we were suggested as liars on 0different times and my mother was basically called a thief !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	had no issues , although sometimes a little_slow with delivery , until today , out of the blue , they have decided to discontinue all brands of dog_food except their own_brand and they expect me to buy that instead !
2	i then found mpb_photographic via a quick google_search , read the feedback and decided that getting a quote wasn_'_t going to hurt .
2	!!!!
2	then i asked if he had put them on next_day delivery .
0	while we understand there is a variation with natural wood products , this was a significant difference .
0	i did so , answered what was asked , was then told that my order would be canceled and i would have to order again and pay by bank_transfer because of a " security issue ".
0	i am greatly disappointed , especially after_reading all the great reviews on this website .
2	booked this at 00 . 00 and courier never showed up .
0	first time ive ever bought a cd_key , i play tera on a f0p account and im part of the tera club i wanted to make a third character but im restricted to 0 characters soooo i looked for a serial key to get the 0 slots instead of buying from the store which would have cost me a stupid amount of money .

0	0 month later i got the response " we have completed the order for the full value and you should receive an_email in the next 00_hours to confirm that the cheque is due for dispatch ."
2	or sell in huge volume ( gillette , duracell ; etc ).
0	i signed_up with this invoicing service a few_months_ago and was positively_surprised as it is very easy and fast to send invoices .
2	purchase : simple task , 00 / 00 .
2	apart_from losing my custom there is the impact of word of mouth as if anyone asks my views apropos sky they are not tinged with any real positive glow .
0	received item via ups within a week which is good i suppose at this time of year .
0	i asked for a refund .
2	once i saw the reviews i thought it a good idea to contact by email to see when my order was to be fulfilled as it had been 0 days and no communication .
2	rang the second time to be told to go to the car_park and the driver would be there shortly , 00_minutes later he arrived hurriedly gave me the keys and said they were late because they had tried to get ahead of themselves and rushed off .
0	ordered an item online with next_day delivery , received texts confirming the times etc_., waited whole day for the parcel only to receive a text late in a day that the driver tried to deliver it but there was nobody at premises and he left a card which was an_absolute lie .
2	engineer who_knows little about your machine and just goes through the

2	this is not acceptable especially if i were to have planned the installation the day after delivery .
0	i received no contact or an_apology when i queried this second failure .
2	i intend to keep_up the good work as long as you do .
0	eventually my case arrived 0 days_later as i was heading home , and still 0 weeks on nobody from tap in brazil , the uk or in portugal will reply to my emails .
0	signed_up for an account on sunday - all ok , credit account accepted .
2	update_: hmm have had a dodgy experience with them since this review .
2	when i started asking where they were i was told there was a delay .
0	my initial thoughts were ' why are you still selling this component if it has a history of terrible reliability ?'.
0	it has become a victim of its own success , over charging its users on a daily_basis !
2	also , they attempt to make out that it '_s the fault of the consumer , particularly galling with me , as a highly qualified oxford graduate .

2	i had trouble logging in to my account .
0	!
0	however my buyer used their solicitors and i must_say it was stressful , they needed constant chasing up by the buyer and my solicitors .
0	had quite a pushy conversation with one of their sales personnel as he was more_than eager to get the call finished once i ' d shown an interest in the offered insurance but . they did get me the best price for what seems like a pretty comprehensive policy so just needed to ignore his fast talking , ask the questions that i wanted answered and repeat them if he tried moving on without giving a proper answer .
0	one other thing .
2	and this was declined which i consider unfortunate .
0	the website is very helpful , as you can not only sort through all the categories , but you can sort through all the different categories based upon what is on offer , so you can save a lot of money !

0	i found this out the hard way after paying them £_000 .
0	guess_what !!
0	this company shouldn ' t exists as it ' s a disgrace .
2	i have used dialtosave for a while now and it is great , i save pounds on my overseas phone_calls , one can use it with their mobile too .
2	customer_services gave precise measurements which meant that i knew_exactly how to place the printers which meant that i didn_'_t have the hassle of wondering whether the printer would fit on the bottom shelf .

2	in the end me and my friend had to resort to renting a car from the airport which ended_up costing us a lot .

2	in the end i left it and decided that of any phone arrived , i would refuse delivery and send it back .
2	no interest at all in helping a well spoken young lad with a question about his entertainment system .
0	naturally they will not refund the booking or postage fees , and had the cheek to claim that it was because they are making them available for collection at the last_minute , and that collection fees are the same as postage (£. 000 ).

2	hi at the moment i am on a dmp and enquired_about an iva .
2	i found victor by chance and cannot_believe the choice of tours and the excellent value .
2	loading up a wet basket of washing to take to hang out on the line means not only do i have a means of transporting it outside , i also have the bar to help my balance when hanging it out .
2	lost items .
0	do not order from them !!!
2	the guy also took a 000_euro deposit .
0	pretty steep , considering the entire return_flight was only about £_000 !
2	there was no order update received .
0	so annoying !
0	fast despatch and delivery despite the time of year and weather !

0	less_than gruntled .
0	the ordering_process is quick and simple and products arrive quickly and in great packaging .
0	thank_you for helping me with my car .
2	simon said that their terms and conditions clearly_stated that parts that had been fitted but not used would not be refunded .
0	after a non delivery you would think they would contact us , but i guess that ' s why they ' re cheap !

0	pleasure to deal with thanks shaz
2	i ordered an aeg dishwasher on 0 march_0000 and was told it was not in stock but it should only take 0 to 00 days .
2	luckily , we sorted this out at the resort and the fault seems to have been with the accomodation providers , who change our booking !
0	everything about this experience points to bad practice and working under - hand and certainly false deals / advertisements .
0	after spending 00_minutes on the phone to multiple advisors and being hung_up on twice !!
2	she answered again with more or less standard answer and asked me to wait_till 00th ( like ten days !!!)
0	it gets better , they have taken payment in full !
2	however in an_email from a different yodel employee i was told the latest for collections was 0pm so as far as operating times is concerned with this lot it '_s anyone '_s guess .
2	!
2	and this will cost them . at_least my future business unless they post a phone number on the homepage of their website and answer calls promptly and courteously , respecting their high - paying customers .
2	in fact i now wish i played golf , so i could show off by looking very smart on the golf_course !
0	great service - i would recommend this company to anyone .
2	great company to deal with . many a bargain to be had . able to buy quality items at bargain prices . super quick enquiry responses .
0	but for books i recommend amazon .
0	i am so disappointed and upset .
2	what '_s not to like ?
2	now tried the carpet_cleaner - nope it didnt do what it said on the box .
2	the pick_up and delivery went very well .
0	these_guys think they are the best when they are in actual fact the worst delivery company i have ever come_across .
0	a must use company .
0	the salesman was very patient , helpful and friendly , which of course always helps .
0	deals for djs .
2	we were informed by email of every_stage of the process .
2	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail from gumtree saying this guy was a suspected fraudster so don_'_t take this further .
2	i was given a full explanation of the fraud scoring system and ideas how to prevent repeat occurrences .
2	also the restaurant attached fantastic for both breakfast and evening_meal .
2	so beware the sneaks at carphone_warehouse / vodafone !
2	my last ghd '_s lasted at_least 0 years with every day use .
0	they seem to fail to understand that self - employed people cannot_afford to stay at home all day for something not to arrive as they are not able to be out earning .
2	mrs worden
0	delivery was stated as next_day 0am - 0pm , but i did not receive news of dispatch until 0pm with the recipient finally getting the bouquet at around 00pm .
0	i know digitalrev mainly from their youtube_channel , and was actually suprised to learn that they have an online shop .
0	i was reading the reviews whilst waiting for my tesco ' s shopping to be delivered .
0	so i decided i ' ll give it till moday and if nothing arrives i ' ll phone their customer_service , hopefully they ' d be more reliable than their email service .
2	nice to be able to get uk tea bags etc that you can '_t get in greece , but be prepared pay .
2	delivery was carefully planned and happened , as agreed .
0	i then asked to take this further and the manager was asked to call me back .
0	will certainly be using echo_supplements again and recommend them to all who read this review .
2	i would carefully consider_using this company again .
2	i have been reluctant to write a poor review about this company , because i was sure they would resolve my problems .
0	the company can do better .
0	i will never ever buy again from you
2	although the free delivery is understandably not speedy !
2	ordered flowers 0 weeks in advance for my mother '_s birthday .
2	item was delivered two days after being ordered with normal delivery cost .
2	i am satisfied with the result , just a little cheesed off with the cost !
0	a flight is meant to be a pleasurable experience , and the simple things matter !
2	!
0	0 . watch out for " other people bought with " list as some of this can be totally mad - i have noticed it when the wrong memory upgrade was listed against a netbook - if you had bought the netbook with the upgrade , you had the wrong one !
2	i have learnt not to order my fresh_fruit and veg as i always get substandard and in one case mouldy product .
2	any information i need , then google_search_engine has rarely let me down .
0	in summary , im happy with the shed and ' offer price ' from elbec , but they really need to employ customer_service staff with better customer_service skills and take extra care when loading products to be delivered .
2	disappointed that i had to trim the width of the blind to get it to roll !!
2	most reviews were good about them so i placed the order ( using the 0 month interest free finance option ).
2	storage_boxes were exactly_what i wanted good quality at a very good price
2	the same server asked me how the breakfast was and i mentioned the eggs and hash brown , she apologised and immediately offered replacements for both but by this time i was in a quite a hurry to check out as i had an_appointment , so had to decline .
0	it was really easy , printing out labels to put on the box and left it with collect +.
0	aku harap konfirmasi ke email , facebook , atau twitter datang secepatnya .
0	also item was very good value for money .
2	easy ordering_process , quick feedback on dispatch schedule and tracking .
2	then the icing on the cake was that within 0 hours they rang me to get feedback on my experience with the delivery so they could feedback to their staff .
0	all the staff were helpful and accessible at all times , and i was very happy with the results .
2	if i want anything_else i be using them again
2	when i ordered i chose the delivery date and although it was about 0 weeks in the future i was happy to wait as the tables looked nice and the price was reasonable .
2	i bought the vacuum which is great .
2	i would not buy my main evening wear or other casuals here .
2	in the past they refused to refund me my money , £_000 , when malev went_bust .
2	i ordered a go kart from join0buy on 0th_september for £_000 . 00 with a delivery date of 00 to 00 days .
0	i ordered two dresses from boohoo as normal i received an_email to say my parcel has been shipped and then an_email asking me to write a review on the dresses .
0	i ordered 00 drawing mannequins from this website , i ' d never_heard of it before so didn ' t know what to expect but the low price and great delivery promises caught my eye .
2	very expensive
2	however this was nothing more than a very slight inconvenience .
0	there ’_s a number of mini supermarkets to stock up on booze nearby as well .
0	but , when viewing prices after entering your details a prominent message is displayed stating that your quote will not be cheaper by going directly to the insurer . got my suspicions raised straight_away , so i went direct to admiral and guess_what , almost £_00 cheaper !
0	fast appointment after being_able to book quickly and easily online .
2	therefore i had to send it back which was an irritation and disappointment .
0	i love supplementwarehouse . com and have been using them for almost a year now .
0	i was searching for the best prices on various bits of kit for a triathlon and found mytriathlon with the best deals .
0	love the variety now of items on play . dvds , clothing , books and now second_hand items .
2	has anyone_else had to wait this long or do i have the record ?
2	i immediately contacted iflorist and spoke to a customer_services rep , who could provide no explanation , no satisfactory solution to the problem .
2	out of 0 pairs of shoes , only one has_been not as_described , in that they are a very narrow fit .
0	the only_downside is they don ' t always seem to know what is in stock and have let me down twice now and the website can do ' strange ' things that make purchases time - consuming .
2	after purchasing , i had a query in relation to nano - sim and micro - sims .
2	my sister has had a recent bereavement and i wanted to send her some flowers as a little surprise to help cheer_her up .
0	the monitor did not arrive on the second day .
2	the bed is super comfy and i highly_recommend the service .
0	will_definitely make my booking from hostelbookers from now on !
0	they even not yet charge total payment from my credit_card and refuse to give some money back .
0	our_guide was awful , he didn ' t come over as friendly and i thought some of his comments were insensitive to other nations such as telling us that the americans should come and learn about building towns around water so they had less flooding .
2	a great buy , thoroughly_recommended .
2	i wanted to order kerastase shampoo .
2	i phoned pet prescription in the end as my dog had run out of tablets and i was getting concerned .
2	james_villas have some great properties but if you have a problem with a property they do not help in any way as you will see from other review_sites .
0	their customer_service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
2	bei der rückgabe wurden die schäden allerdings nicht beanstandet .
0	otherwise i would have chosen another courier .
0	the flowers were dispatched on time so the issue may have been the company they put their delivery trust in - yodel , who are fairly garbage .
0	so i went to another laptop fix shop , they checked , the motherboard haven ' t been changed .
2	in order to proceed getting the size we had originally paid for , we would have to pay extra .
0	the protein is delicious but the shaker is poor .
0	she ordered two items with them , both listed as in stock .
0	the colour was ( just about ) right , but the material quality is very poor .
0	i recommend phones0cash to all my friends and they all come back and thank me .
2	i suspect like many people , i nevertheless remained a customer through lack of inertia .
2	my only niggles are that their range is not as good as cheapsmells and the website is more fiddly too .
2	booking was easy , website great , and very clear and informative email_confirmation .
2	alan phoned me early in morning and gave window of eta for fitting .
0	although it does the job , i would not say it is as good value as a similar sprung mattress and i would say it is only worth around 0 / 0 of the price .
2	they have excellent prices and an amazing selection .
2	i havd tried to call them several_times on saturday_morning ( as i have today at 0 . 00pm ) but simply get a constant unanswered ringing .
2	thank_you for letting me feedback .
2	online site easy to use & liked the few sample choices . the items arrived very quickly & i am_delighted with the mascara which does all it promised , not sure whether the primer is as good but will persevere !
0	that was a complete bust because i didn ' t feel_like paying $ 0 per bottle .
2	excellent value for money , no hassle_free delivery .
0	but it didnt shows up any money in my account .
0	i get the idea of amigo , but charging such high interest with a guarantor i feel is unwarranted .
2	i never got a straight answer to that question and that '_s when the real nightmare_began .
2	whatch the prices however - other_companys often have the same stuff cheaper .
2	the catalogue is brilliant .
2	keith ward southampton uk
0	the delivery guy did hammer the door a bit too loudly but was friendly enough and handed my parcel after signing for it .
0	overall i must stress that the product i got looked great - better in most ways than i could have hoped and once i ' ve found a replacement for the frosted plastic it will look better still .
2	flight centre are very helpful and definitely try to get you the best deal possible .
2	i really think that this was something they should have done as part of their customer service to me , my transaction was with them after all .
0	i then had to book somewhere_else to stay .
2	so in summary three are great for the business side of things - a strong network with eye watering deals .
0	i have bought many items and they have all been good and fast delivery aswell
0	lazy
0	hands_down best place to buy anything you need for your workout .
2	the pure silk duvet is absolute heaven .
0	they responded to my emails quickly which was the only good thing .
0	i paid a £ 0 . 00 extra delivery charge to get them there for mothers_day .
2	( sorry my mistake yorkshire not hell !)
2	problems raised were instantly resolved .
0	what more could you ask for ?
2	the breakfast was good except for the poached eggs which were ' hard boiled ' and the hash brown which was soggy and inedible and i did not eat either .
2	the most biased propaganda machine ever , like a chinese water torture the bbc '_s drip drip is fed to the poor audience , who '_s propaganda is it ?
0	their " order and collect next_day in store " option is a lie .
0	i would say that ' s pretty bad customer_service !
2	eight emails and three phone_calls later they have still not managed to send a final_bill , let_alone credit me with £_000 that they owe me .
0	day 0 - no parcel
2	they go around using all possible ways to suck your money out .
2	the web - site is easy to use and delivery is within a couple of days .
2	i advise everyone out there not to deal with this company or with [_name_removed ].
0	it has been 0 years now and we have used parcels0go regular each week .
0	i did receive an_apology but would have preferred it didn ' t come to that .
2	only small order but very quick in delivering .
2	it took another week before they resolved the issues and the mattress was delivered .
2	very quick delivery .
0	hassel free transactions , i recommend all the time to friends and family !
2	£_00 was a bit_steep to make a change to the booking though .
2	the only issues i have had is with their admin / website which was not sending me confirmation emails / invoices every time i booked a delivery online .
2	had trouble on the phone it took 0 calls to get an answer and at 0 am with 0 kids didnt need the hastle . also didnt expect to need a £ 0 coin to get out of the car_park after paying £_000 for our two cars
2	alan from bilston
2	yodel : im very sorry to hear this david .
2	also had issues with receiving items not as_described and damaged .
0	please use this as a recommendation .
2	pricing and delivery very good , however beware of signing_up for their automatic re - ordering !
2	honestly , i have never come_across any organization who has such a total disregard towards its customers !!!
2	the containers were exactly_what i needed although half the size i was looking for . when the delivery man arrived the package was very badly_damaged but the contents were fine .
0	it took me about 0 hours to build on my own .
2	took my details , looked at the screen and saw that it was in the depot awaiting the next step for refunding .
2	no mention of the hotel or car_hire so we contacted them again .
2	by the way , we have managed to read the name and address crossed out on the tickets !
2	they only conned £_00 . 00 out of me but i am still pursuing them through trading_standards .
2	far too much packaging for the tiny watch_strap i bought .
2	i bought them ( 0x face_value by the way ) and then tried to contact them to advise of our travel_plans .
0	so be warned
0	this company may be cheaper_than the high_street but more chance of wining the lottery that receiveing proper timely help when delivery you pay for is not received nor refunded .
0	i ordered 0 pairs of contact_lenses as it was the first time i had used lenstore .
0	i booked my mot online and it was really quick and easy .

0	pathetic service .
0	as with others , i ordered the big_boy beanbag on 0th_november as a christmas_present for my daughter , delivery date of week 00 which has just been put back until week 0 !
0	i shall begin with some background first .
0	good products but i ' m getting pissed_off with the fact that you use couriers even for small items .
0	the sofa itself is of good quality for the price paid , however due to taking a morning off work unpaid due to a failed delivery the total cost is not as appealing .
0	i found the bed i wanted online , on sale , however i decided to go to my local_branch to order as i was hoping to see one on display ( which it wasn ' t unfortunately ).
0	used megashopbot looking for a new tv and found this site offering very competitive_pricing .

2	as a business i would recommend that no one use carphone_warehouse for business contracts .
2	i should state in fairness that the service that i received from the retail side of this company in specfic relation to this situation and their attempts to try & resolve matters , was entirely decent & genuine , a shame this cant be reflected to the web side of this company .

0	i wouldn ' t recommend it unless you know where your drop box is and have the small 00_hours in which to collect it ( upon_receipt of an_email while i was at work ).
2	being a sole traveler , the whole_experience did not inspire confidence in any future bookings i may wish to make .
0	their customer_services is second to none , the design work is excellent and the finished products of mine are still receiving compliments and feedback months after creation .
0	will be using again .
0	i ' m quite geeky so when i caught them out at each point they finally , after many calls over 0 months offered to upgrade my service and send a new modem - all i ' d have to do was sign_up to a new contract .
0	i ' m telling all my friends about myprotein . co . uk , 0 star service and products !
2	i was told that they would rebook it for the next_day but were not prepared to do anything to placate me or to try and retain me as a customer .
2	mattress measured 0inches short of 0ft so i have 0inch gap all around my bed not good sizing uncomfortable
2	o0 gave me poor reception , vodafone gave me sleepless nights over their customer_services , so i was in the mood for a change .
0	maybe the staff need some extra training or the store needs to be consistent with the food standards agency

0	will def use again .
2	asda should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves with this service - it '_s appalling .

0	we waren jarenlang vaste klant .
0	" yes , by going through the change of journey option .
0	i have now done this and am awaiting a response .
2	either pay online or when you ghetto store .
2	i use the word apparently a lot here because its a bit of a guessing game as at no point have i been emailed or texted or rang to say the delivery is on its way .
0	their ' live_chat ' has been particularly unhelpful too , just saying ' sorry we ' ll get it there when we can '.
2	they said i could not because i had had it longer then 00 days , - i had bought it in advance of his_birthday and then it was a week before we actually tried to use it .
0	i am now going to take some type legal_action_against them to stop them getting away with this with other people .
2	now it clearly_states on ao that this appliance , well i '_ve copied and pasted it " to offer peace of mind the siemens sn00m000gb free standing dishwasher also comes with 0 years warranty "
2	i rang up and had this confirmed by a member of staff .
0	even at christmas the delivery was really fast
2	did you read my review ?
0	the bad you never get the films from your list you want its always the ones you pick to make up the numbers , some of the films will skip making them unwatchable , i got defiance from them and i swear i got so fed_up with the jumps i must of missed 00_mins of the film .
0	previous problems include : no attempt , no card , late delivery , unprofessional conduct ( delivery after 0pm in an unmarked car by the agent obviously taking his son somewhere ), etc , etc , etc .
2	wednesday 00th demand for final payment has arrived in post obviously this is being ignored until we are fully happy with the office .
0	the service was ok , apart_from sending a phone size box and envelope for an ipad - bit sloppy .
2	one for long disrtance & one for vdu & reading .
2	after a few email '_s back and forth , my radio actually shipped 0 days after_placing the order .
0	i spoke to customer_services and they said it was a " business decision ".

0	so not quite sure why it is the opposite now !
2	recommended .
2	the price was very competitive , the lady on the sales line friendly and helpful , and the speed of delivery was fantastic .
2	way too much time we had to spent emailing to get reimbursement .
0	they have good prices too , would recommend !
2	part of order was not worth the money . i . e .
0	as alot of people know this is a stalkers paradise when privacy settings aren ' t scanned and changed .
2	part . arrived broken .
0	i asked why it said i had changed the delivery when i clearly hadn ' t and explained that i had taken a day off specially to wait in !
2	this is a charge which should be waived when placing a order
0	i ' ve met many bright happy people in primark , but i ' ve also met some seriously rude and angry people who need to learn that when you come to work , you put your game face on and just deal with it .
2	i have used this company several_times and have found it to be an all_round satisfactory process .
2	would now purchase further items from the complete care catalogue instead of going to a mobility store and having_difficulty parking - just wait for the postman - it '_s almost as quick .
0	was not happy on the time it took as it said it was next_day delivery so expected it tuesday but when it arrived it was in excellent condition and worth waiting for :) thanks
0	i would never recommend o0 service to my friends or anyone .
2	would and have recommended to lots of friends and family .
2	the item was not delivered in the advertised time and i had all the usual problems with yodel .
0	brilliant service all_round , online sh !
0	don ' t get me wrong they do have some good products though
0	i booked a hostel on hostelworld . com and the hostel itself informed me that they overbooked .
0	.
2	• always pay via escrow facility such as paypal .
0	me : " just a minute … every day ?
0	e_- mailed the company several_times , 00 days_later and still no response , no indication of whether i ' ll be getting a refund or replacement for the cheapo charger they provide .
0	you will not just regret it , it will frustrate you for the entire length of your contract !!!
2	i have been more than happy and i am into my 0th year with them .
0	0 ) damage to the house
0	so for the sake of £_00 i accepted the new price as they left me little choice !
0	if only people listened to the bad_reviews this company would be longer running , i used beginning of the year when my parcel never arrived i was told the label had probably come off , with lots of rude messages from an ebay buyer i refunded fully , it took another 0 weeks of constant emails to get refunded and that wasn ' t even in full even_though i had paid more to cover it , so last wed i thought i would give them another try and again low and behold my parcel has gone wallows again . was collected so the tracking says and that ' s it .
0	those 00 working_days have passed , and yet the order status is still ' on time '.
2	we '_ll see
0	i know peoples , their lives are ruined because they borrowed money from that thieves .
2	it is the centre point of conversations .
0	last time i checked the corners of an iphone box were pointed , that well know corner shape , but after yodel took my brand_new £_000 iphone 0 on board , they seemed intent on reshaping the box into , let ' s say a more rounded design .
0	i ' ve used this co for some time and everything is top_notch , except the courier left a package with the neighbours which was embarrassing as it obviously contained tablets
0	the tickets arrived after 00 days of waiting , and 0 days after i recieved a message that they had been dispatched .
0	have been using , juno for many years .
2	product was of good quality and competitive price .
0	they also send you a photo of your product packed with your name and address on it , which is also a nice_touch .
2	they don_'_t actualy employ proper drivers with vans , any old herbet turns up in their old banger , no wonder everything gets broke or ' lost '.
2	its a real shame that they can '_t read though , as i requested the delivery for after 0 pm to welcome a friend into her new home .
0	a year later i noticed excessive_wear on the jacket around the waist draw - cord .
2	there is a much_better selection than in the shops , and very quick delivery - thank_you .
2	please give me my package
2	anyway , i called the courier and they said that they had it marked for delivery on monday , and it had never been intended to deliver it on friday .
0	whenever i chat to someone , i need to close the browser and reopen it every 0 or 0 minutes , because its crashed the process .
2	i was quite happy to put the record straight and write a decent review about sofia . oh sofia you have let me down so badly .
2	0 calls later , hours on the phone , being told it was my fault for contacting them half hour after they had paid the airline ( this was within one hour of receiving my economy email tickets ).
0	rather excessive i thought but at_least it should guarantee good service .
2	fraud .
2	after investigation i found that it was the heater causing this .
2	i even had 0 notifications from the po to let me know item had been posted and that it was in the post_office ready for delivery which i have never had before .
0	luckily i have the money to place an order elsewhere .
0	0 item in particular was over £_00 more_expensive .
2	delivery was slow as ordered over xmas_period .
2	it was posted reasonably promptly ( if i believe the seller ) but at high cost (£ 0 : 00 for " standard " postage ) at christmas .
2	the item arrived damaged and to be honest it didn_'_t appear to be of good quality in the first place which was disappointing as i had purchased a similar item in the past with no_problems .
2	they arrived very promptly but . it was the wrong tap .
0	avoid using orange !
0	site is easy to navigate and the selection of cloths is really good !
0	recently spent some time in hospital and came home 0 days before my son ' s birthday .
2	i felt so humble and embarressed as all the office staff stared at me while i tried to put the mess right .
2	but : delivery it took 0 , 0 weeks ( 00 business days ) for the glasses to arrive .
2	you won_'_t be surprised to learn i am now being billed for 0 lines , but wait , i notified them and they apologised for the error , promised me a refund against my new account , and promptly billed me again .
2	the fact that i have no such insurance makes this kind of cold call based on a downright lie as welcome as a new delhi call regarding my computer .
0	no text as promised the day before to inform me of time_slot so had to log on internet to get given this after 0pm the night before .
0	i pay the £ 0 a year ( although you can opt for the free membership ) as it is nice to be able to receive my cashback quicker .
2	i ' m having to resort to talking to my bank now to cancel payment .
2	rang customer_services sunday and was asked to send pictures of damage . rang customer_services services yesterday they said pictures received and that she would inform the person dealing and get them to ring me back , still no phone_call .
0	this is the crap bad as shit network i have ever come through dont ever get three network that will be your biggest_mistake honestly .

2	but would not use again until new ' checking out system ' is updated .
2	0 .
0	we have investigated your price_match request and unfortunately cannot fulfil it as , although a valid competitors price has been quoted , it is below our buying in price for the item ( s ).
2	no problem with product - took 00 days to arrive , with no updates or notifications on late delivery .
2	lot from vio_vet and have never had a problem with any of the orders . most of the orders have been delivered within 0 days of ordering .
0	and finally , when you try to cancel their services - they are not helpful by making you stay for another 00 days as cancellation period - so you must pay them even_though the service is not used .
2	also they would not confirm that the same thing would not happen the next_day .
0	a fast friendly service wich cater to the needs of the individual , no_problems no_fuss and if there is then it ' s easy to talk to them , great team and i will recommend v0 in the future thanks again

0	thanks to lee for making easy .
0	fijne webshop , heb er al vaker besteld en wordt altijd top geholpen !
2	they want to add to their stash of cash and vouchers collected from friends and relatives at christmas .
0	however , the import_tax was over double than what i was required to pay .
0	very , very few surveys in comparison with other survey sites like valued opinions or mysurvey .
0	to be honest , and this might not be a popular opinion , their service has always been pretty good .
0	cooks amazing with literally no fat drip too .
0	i ordered flower to be delivered before 0pm on valentines_day !
2	i telephoned their nottingham store to ask if they were still in business , apparently they were , and the very helpful chap gave me another number to call , not all bad . could have just been me !
2	not only that but why dont yodel reply to your complaint emails either ?
2	this has however changed once reasonable weight ( i . e .

2	i contacted customer_services about a problem with my order on the day of recieving it cannot just have faulty pump part for 0000ml shampoo replaced as it was faulty i have to return the 00ooml bottle , what an inconvenience and expense
0	if you can get kwikfit out ' kwik ,' do so .
2	for that i always go to a little estate_agent and find a hidden_gem ( s ) that perhaps foxtons can not be bothered with or the seller thinks their commision is too steep .
0	dont think i will be using easyjet again in the near_future .
2	my one minor complaint . i couldn_'_t get a job there . which i really wanted as it was walking_distance from home & would save me a fortune in bus fares & i would get even more fab benefits being a tesco employee & a great goodwill ambassador for tesco .
2	when it arrived the strings were worn , well - use and very highly mounted .
2	quality hard back cover , and good quality paper .
2	i was contacted by sarah who was excellent in explaining an iva to me , but decided at this moment in time it was not in my best interest to have an iva and i am satisfied with carrying on with my dmp .
0	great weekend in chester , started with quad_biking at catton hall , which was a good laugh !
0	so i had to write an_email to thier customer_service email address and hope for the best .
2	i was able to get all the information i needed , negotiated an even better price on the phone and it was delivered promptly .
2	i recommend paying a bit more to get better .
0	i have purchased a number of items from alpkit and i have always been very happy with the price , speed of postage and after sales service .
2	i believe that my original review below failed to make clear how endemic the poor management and customer service at wren is .
2	i certainly will be trying to get my money back or go to trading_standards .
0	trainline is good if you just want to go to one place to get your booking done quickly - but doesn ' t seem to be the cheapest - if you have time to book the different stages of your trip through different operators then this probably would work out best for you but if - like me - you only allow yourself 0 minutes to do any task then trainline is good to get it all done in one go !
2	!
2	then when we moved to a better area , with driveway , cul - de - sac etc i contacted ecar to change the details ( needless to say i haven_'_t rung them once as their call charges are just unrealistic !)
2	but we were hit by a car which knocked the wing mirror of both cars pulled onto hard shoulder we took down there number_plate details got out of our car and the other car sped of we tried to phone police but they couldn_'_t understand us so we phoned the customer advise line to be told all is fine we have no need to go to police just fill all the details of accident on the claim form including the number_plate which we did .
2	this of course was untrue .
0	strongvpn ' s speed is good , all depend your internet speed after you change your ip ' s location to near your real location , all is ok , no pro !!!

0	fair car were the cheapest car_rental by_far and we were very happy with the service .
2	excellent product , brilliant prices , speedy despatch .
2	have bought many items and been happy with all but one . non sticky fly tapes !!
0	i would still recommend for anyone_looking for a custom_built_pc but with a warning not to expect much helpful after - sales customer support .
2	both are excellent products and delivery has_been first_class .
2	i don_'_t any more .
2	david
0	i placed my order at 0pm , product was dispatched at 0pm , and delivered to me the next_day .
2	so if you want to hoover you car carpets stay_clear even the velcro is also very thin .
0	if they do not have something that you ordered in stock , they are very sensible about what they give you as a replacement .
2	my advise is always check reevoo for reviews on products and not appliance reviews ; before you buy .
2	updated review 00 . 00 . 00
2	you only really know how good a company is when things go_wrong and unfortunately they have failed on this .
2	as i lived locally topfurniture were happy for me to pick_up the chairs to save delivery costs .
0	i made sure i was home by 00 . 00pm and they had already been and gone again !
2	cancelled order and still not got a refund 0 weeks after that point .

0	a +!
0	0 weeks_later and nothing has happened .
0	i have had enough now , and need advice on what i can do .
0	their reply was that they have 00 days to do the refund .
0	why are people selling off their stuff ?
0	they didn ' t leave a message or contact me by email , and since i didn ' t recognise the number i didn ' t think anything of it ( thought it was a spam call ).
0	when my box arrived i excitedly opened it up , not knowing what to expect .
0	i was amazed !
2	!
0	also the protein shaker itself was so dusty !
0	failing that they could make them available for immediate collection at the venue and refund their fees .
0	the team at cambridge printing . com are more_than 0_stars in our opinion .
0	still don ' t know what company it is bacause of its all in french .
2	have used this site 0 times for my tyres for the past 0 years with no_problems .
0	you ' d think amazon would be concerned_about how much money they are losing due to this but it clearly doesn ' t seem to bother them at all .

2	no customer service .
0	good delivery service but i have noticed that they started to have problems with new_releases .
2	so , the new ceo john cleland plans to invest £ 00m in maplins does he , well , he ' d better consider spending a good chunk of that on staff training , my recent visit to cannock left a lot to be desired , no greeting no smile , just a look , yes that look when you walk into a strange pub from all the regulars .
2	thought i would give openeo a try and was very glad that i did .
2	are lovely ( but masses of new development up the hill , where many of the apartments are located ), but our welcome was less_than warm !
2	if you want to be robbed , misery and grief , then go_ahead and use this atrocious attempt of a company .
0	news for you guys - most people are only available on weekends , and this extra £_00 charge makes some of your mattresses less affordable than another company .
0	miss samantha .
0	!
0	however , when i opened a support ticket to find out about the release_date i had a default response with no date , only a note to tell me to look at the product page .
0	this shows how well visualsoft are at making a well astablished looking website and how it links in well with search_engines to increase its customer base .
0	customer_service was friendly , and our items were delivered in pristine_condition and packaged well .
0	not have a returns or refund policy is beyond me - unless they had found it was more trouble than it was worth and everyone was returning items they were dissatisfied with .
0	quick , affordable , reliable !
2	thanks
0	0 .
0	during this period , i write many e_- mail to them .
2	good cheap prices very fast delivery and a0 service would recommend .
0	it had obviously been stuck on a shelf somewhere gathering dust for quite some time .
2	it looks lovely , the gentle sounds are very welcoming , and the led light provides a soft glow in the evening .
0	the delivery charge is pretty ridiculous for such a large company / brand .
0	they should have dealt_with my situation whereby we had an agreement , but they did not .
0	i am used to buy on line and i never ever had any problem until i found smartbuyglasses uk .
2	the choice of predefined layouts was good and i enjoyed choosing and pasting photos .
0	the pub_crawl was we organised and thanks to the kristina for keeping use together and then apparently saving me from a beating from a group of bouncers ( at trafo night club ) for being far to drunk .
2	if i had to describe the service in a few words i ' d call it " an american standard of service in the uk ".
2	it seemed to have everything i required - however it was all french !
0	this march , my brother has sent me the iphone_0s to me from america .
2	unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances i had to cancel the order on 00 / 0 / 00 , but was told the item hadn_'_t been shipped so all was ok .
0	i was told it wouldn ' t be a problem .
2	sheet etc it '_s better to turn the machine off ( noting how much roll is
0	also , they have not contacted me to update me , i ' ve had to call both_times to find out what ' s going on .
0	if the tickets are pricey for a particular gig then the same gig tickets seem pricey on other_sites too .
2	if you lead an active outdoor life but need some support , i would recommend this product without a blink of the eye .
0	every_single time i ' ve used them , they couldn ' t have been better .
2	felt that was misleading
0	at checkout i paid £ 0 . 00 pp each .
2	just took an age for them to arrive .
2	got what i ordered
0	really pleased with my purchase as i ' ve been looking for some replacement running glasses for months !

0	the female called vivien , said that a manager was going to call me back on the 0th of june , there was nothing she could do and if the bill had been paid that morning then it will take up to 00_hours to reconnect and i had to wait for a manager to call .
2	quick delivery and good prices - will use again

0	wrong decision !!!
0	i ' m now with tesco who have much cheaper packages and only english call_centres .
2	( incidentally , the receptionist was the same one who checked me in the day before who had made a big point of explaining their premier_inn ' good night guarantee ').
0	i have sent yet another email today in order to get my money back .
2	steve maybury was the fitter and i am very happy with the end product .
2	they said they could send it that day , then that it had missed the van .
0	it may be a long work in progress but watch this space .
0	what did not impress me was the fact that the money was taken as soon as i placed the order , regardless that there was no stock to send .
0	want to be lied to just so you sign a lengthy contract ?
2	this company is 00th out of 00 in their list of recycling firms so to have no negative_reviews showing is a farce .
2	i settled on the superking origins pocket 0000 and every_single guest has commented on what a fabulous bed it is .
2	manager as useful as a chocolate teapot .
2	i can see that i shall have to sue them for the credit as they clearly have no_intention of accepting the fact that i have moved_house nor that i am owed money .
0	the clothes came very fast !
2	you get an honest opinion from real customers rather_than marketing speak .
2	next an e_- mail cancelling one order and confirming the second .
2	your reference to " we believe you normally work from home ?
0	will_definitely use again !
0	and we do so with a smile !
0	customer_service is dyer - " its the time of year " and " the courier has to deliver them " - er well try the correct house and maybe that would happen .
0	!
2	i would use them again solely because of price and their knowledge .
0	it has been over two_weeks since they took payment , and they haven ' t replied to emails or telephone call ever .

2	the following_day we received a phone_call saying delivery would be between 0 and 0 and someone would ring 00_minutes before delivery sunday_afternoon arrived and along came a white van which turned_out to be our delivery .
0	as well as the competitive_prices the quality of the produce is always better_than the supermarket .
2	the items i ordered were a good price and delivered quickly , but when i tried to checkout and get the free delivery , i wasn_'_t able to click on the free option - it said i needed to spend a certain_amount to get the service free , but then changed the amount and even when i had spent that amount , wouldn_'_t let me put the discount on .
0	det ar megabra .
0	they were also able to sort the issue and sent a replacement on my request .

0	i saw that an_email address was recommended by members of the company on here - i thought great , that should provide some answers .
0	thanks !
0	if you can find what you want at the price you like , just go for it .
2	i guess you get what you pay for , but there are other better budget alternatives .
0	if you hardly use the internet and just want it for loading very basic webpages with no flash / media content on it then maybe its the one for you .
0	hahah .
0	i had all of the below problems with bravofly ; however i did receive an e_- mail from sofia @ bravofly . com apologising for the way i was treated by the company .
2	as you can imagine it takes a great deal of thought about leaving a negative_review - however despite_repeated attempts to contact this company to make changes to an existing document - they made no attempt to either acknowledge or respond to our request .
0	although , for the price , i might order more !
0	delivery is prompt too .
2	just interested in your money , not had any_problems with them , but the odds are not the best generally
2	with regard to my having bough a spare - i purchased two complete swinging gate arms ( seperately ) which cost £_000 each - not what i would call a " spare_part ".
2	what can i say , brilliant , i will_definately now use this company from now on and please everybody , spread the grippy word , you find a decent company nowadays hang on and don_'_t let go !!
0	the follow_up call was brilliant and fast .
0	so i rang the depot and she rang the driver , who told her that he had run out of cards but did knock .
0	they are number one in my opinion and the fact that they charge no booking_fees makes everything so much_better !
2	i have asked her to pass my complaints onto the regional manager who will address hopefully some of the issues i have had with xdp .
0	been waiting now for weeks to unlock my iphone , tried_contacting the company because one day the website says im waiting to be unlocked and then the next_day it says that there is no record of my order , not only that the company has charged me twice and will not contact me to tell me if this issue has been resolved , all im asking for is someone to tell me whats_going on is that to much to ask ?
2	unfortunately the language barrier takes a long time to explain .
2	you can look at your product in full size whenever you want and the preview option allows you to see exactly how it will look when printed at anytime .
2	why have a part on the booking form for requests when there is no chance of getting what you request .
2	their website also has a forum that is bang up to date .
0	few_days_later , the insurance called me again and ask why i didn ' t put the ip0s to the blacklist , they ask me to call to the o0 together so they can talk directly to o0 .
2	very quick delivery , well_packaged .
0	i was planning a trip to las_vegas with my boyfriend for my 00th_birthday in 0000 .

2	this collection worry for me ,( having faithfully promised the addressee , that the parcel would be with her , the following_day ).
0	problem started when i asked xln to transfer the broadband from one line to another ( i had 0 phone_lines from xln ).
2	however they say the refund will take 0 weeks ( something to do with international banking ?).

2	decoration , card , service - everything were just perfect !
0	faultless .

0	they also kept a parcel for over a month , taking it out for delivery every other day but never actually delivering .
2	i would have purchased the dress_shirts , but found it hard to see how they looked close up .
0	easy to check in easy to spot where the check in area is and which gate you are going to thanks to the orange logo , nice staff , horrible food but what do you expect on a plane , comfy seats and although there was no assigned seating we still managed to get seats together .

2	ps .
2	lovefilm viewing window is totally rubbish , i cannot express how disappointed i was with the choice to view through a tiny little on - screen box or to go to ' full screen ' which distorted the picture so badly as to render it un - viewable !
2	i had within the last_year had the tracking carried_out and i have not hit a kerb or pot hole or had any track rod ends wear so this was another lie .
2	i have today paid off the whole amount to the finance company .
0	great selection of glasses - i ordered 0 pairs of vivienne westwood glasses , they were excellent value .
0	sometimes things come through bang on time but as it ' s a shared pot of keys if you ' re not fast you ' ll have to wait_until more are uploaded .
2	all the flexy pipes included .
0	at that time one of the kits was out of stock , due in on the 0th_october .
0	although i won ' t complain with the features , and how sony has the decency to not region - lock downloads as microsoft does ( causing me issues from purchases when in the usa for months ), it has the audacity to have unfair pricing in europe whilst impeding access to multiple / other accounts on the vita easily for international users who travel regularly ( to viably take advantageous prices which should be normal ).
2	ironically the plants are coming from a company called gardening_express !
2	the ordering experience was good , easy to understand and make the order .
2	eg talktalk switchover was delayed by talktalk so it seems the transaction didnt qualify in time for a cashback .

0	i am simply being told to ignore them , but to anyone who understands what persistent eye floaters are , you will know that is simply not a option .
2	dale exchanged the goods and once again apologised for the error but what upset me was that the company never offered any sort of compensation for the error that they made or the inconvenience that it caused me .
0	many ' money off ' offers ( which all nutrition supplement websites have right ?
2	i ordered a camera from simply_electronics 0nd_april and like the bulk of the reviewers on trustpilot have had the same appalling experience with non delivery , even_though there was always stock showing on their web_site .
0	we do pride ourselves on providing excellent customer_service and , although we are by no means perfect and we will look_into the problem and get back to you .
2	once i read the manual , i realised it should have come with a bioplug , for the cutting deck , also missed on the pdi .
2	i have discovered that i like direct contact and showing them over my house and i get instant feedback from them .
0	paid the amount , instantly received an_email about booking with their booking number and itinerary but they didnt send me an e_- ticket .

0	there us no phone contact with customer_services , only a faulty email .
0	the other shirt was very sheer , the elastic in the shirt loosened off to the point that it is way to big and most of the dye came out after 0 wash .

0	i do not know why they drag their heels .
0	purchased a jacket in december from this website , a day or two later they email me and tell me i will not be receiving it as it is out of stock .
0	it is like having a postal service that advertises the collection and delivery of mail sent to and from your address ( as this site does when it stats that membership allows the user to ' send and receive email '), however never saying that to do this to other party has to pay a fee , or that the range is limited to a 000km radius
2	the website photo indicates this but on receipt the panel has a right angle return on the ends and bottom .

2	i was a bit disappointed with some of the flowers though , the pink carnations were already tinged with brown and didnt look like they would last long

2	the taxi never showed up and when i called they had no record of this booking - they still took the £_00 from my account even through the taxi never arrived and have not replied to my emails since .

0	i had to call to get the order speeded up .
0	this company is the worst to be experienced since a long time :

2	the lid bearing for the processor accessories is also a weak component , which cannot be purchased on its own , as you need to buy the whole lid .
0	the best company i ever_dealt_with !!!!
2	managing_director
0	yes we all know its a big company but that then leads the customer support to be horrendous and it really is useless !

0	just ordered some kids headphones .
2	ha_ha .
0	overall it is a good website to use and very reliable !
0	maar wat gebeurt er ?
2	fast , efficient and reliable but not the best rate around - and charge of £ 0 to transfer below £ 0 , 000 makes it not particularly good value .
0	excellent service , my items got delivered the morning after i ordered them .
2	mondays flowers were very nice and delivered in the morning .
0	the phone was reconnected .
2	but if it says " 00_% of orders shipped within 0 days !
2	of course i could see in the computer and noticed that the psu had no internal fan but i assumed that this was just a feature of this unit , i could not open the case to check as it would have nullified the warranty .
2	the original delivery date was not for a full 0 days ( 0 days for checking the monitor + 0 days for delivery ), but the monitor was delivered today , just 0 working_days after ordering .
2	i have been using simpygames now for about 0 years and they have never let me down .
2	what !!!!!!!
2	the drawback of this : potential_customers are led to believe a product is good when maybe it is not so good .
2	?
2	i ordered some ray_ban glasses with prescription lenses , glasses came and they were perfect - the lenses were not .
0	great customer_service !
0	i am considering taking further_action if i do not hear i response soon .
2	this has put me in a predicament , which could of been avoided if levels of organisation and customer_care within the cotsworld company were at a satisfactory level ; in this time i could have had the product designed and built from scratch .
2	i have been in touch with mighty_deals over the last month ( since 00th_march ) but so far although they have promised to send me a remote_control nothing has arrived and as far as the 00 piece cutlery set goes i have heard absolutely nothing .
0	when you do get yourself a good item , you often can bag yourself a bargain , however when you encounter problems it causes all_sorts of headaches to the point i have given up buying secondhand tools on ebay now .
0	do not ; i repeat do not under any circumstance think of dealing_with these_jokers .
0	radio 0 is good for the essential mix once a weeks and the specials from clubs and festivals , but after its recent sell out to dub - step i don ' t think i would bother listening any other time than when the essential mix is on .
0	even the delivery driver that collected the item said it was a common complaint that the goods were used - even_though advertised as new .
0	used terence paul for the first time a few weeks_ago as they offered my regular hair products much much lower in price than any other online_retailer .
2	very happy !
0	don ' t use wren , this was the 0nd mistake and the worker i hired to fix the wardrobes charged me extra for having to use his own !
0	---------
0	never answer the phone - didn ' t have the stock .
2	so pleased with everything i purchased - we definitely return !
0	sold as working , and only got the non - working price for it :(.
0	in the afternoon we did a pub treasure_hunt , this was great fun and set the rest of the days drinking up well !
0	they sent the wrong projector and it was terrible then they sent out the one i asked for , so i thought until i opened the box and had received another rubbish product and they told me it was exactly the same , no it wasnt it was rubbish .
0	until the next time i went abroad .
0	!
2	excellent company to deal with . able to get good advice prior to ordering . very quick delivery . super value for extra high_spec . laptop . to be recommended .
0	i also think the delivery charges are too high , considering what the item is , i think that delivery should be included in the price , or additional for short_notice .
2	i found lindy '_s online store and the product in no time .
2	?
0	sold for faulty price .
0	it gets you to your destination in one piece so thats fine by me .
2	for - very fast broadband ( at a price )
2	however , the website is first_class and allowed me to personalise the pc to the specification that i wanted and gave useful_information about the components .
2	when the guy who answered realised i had a query and was not placing an order he curtly told me he could not help and that he would put me on hold and i should dial 0 or 0 and speak to someone !
2	i will not be silenced .
0	we sent email to as sufficient response to ask what was happening and received automated email few minutes later reassuring that my issue will be look at by 0ourhouse . co . uk customer_service .
2	we had ti sit it out in the cafe .
0	my business broadband is been even slower then a dial up connection . been trying to get hold of the xln broadband team for the past 0 hours .
0	for repeat_custom , it ' s good .
0	i have decided to take this to bbc_watchdog now something i had no_intention of doing until i was accused of lying .
0	however one of them is a let_down .
2	in future i will check this site and look for telephone_numbers .
2	surprisingly the range is limited and i did experience probelms with my first order red wine replaced with white and vice_versa .
0	not only is an amount charged double but also the wrong amount ( higher ).
2	i never thought of giving 0_stars .
0	i never use them but its good to know .
2	black_circles is so easy , great web_site you can '_t go_wrong .
2	the staff are a bit miserable looking though , so they need a bit of training on the customer service side .
0	order turned_up fast .
0	quote from their site " your flowers are with our trusty couriers ".
2	thank - you
0	which is wrong , if you are buying from a seller then they are meant to leave_feedback for you first and then once your item has came then you leave_feedback for them .
0	to anyone in and around the derby area , buy your clubs from here !
2	the whole selection of goods and buying process was uncomplicated .
0	i recently went on kiddicare and found a pram i liked but could not pay because i didn ' t have a credit_card i e mailed them for help on the 00th of january for help and i am yet to receive a reply .
0	i have to call the sender .
2	just received call from mark at rattan_direct .
0	have lost the broadband_connection only half a dozen_times in that time and never for more_than a few hours max .
2	just select currency , enter the amount you want to exchange , travelex do the conversion , you decide on your method of payment you can either pick it up at the airport or have it delivered to your door .
2	this was my first order from mdp , actually my first time buying vinyl !
2	not particularly customer orientated .
0	easy to book and easy to find !
2	we were kept_informed_throughout , the delivery was on time and the delivery_men were extremely polite and helpful .
2	very satisfied .
0	welldone perfume shop ( owned by superdrug ) as i won ' t be using your site again may be it about time you pick_up phone and speak with your customer than relying too much on your systems !
0	really looking_forward to next week now ( 0 days to go )
0	so i phoned them up .
2	one whole week with collection being promised every day .
0	i paid 00 . 00gbp :(((
0	!
2	good coverage not bad pricing only_gripe is 00 month contracts but been with them since it was cellnet 00 years so they must be doing something right
2	i have used opodo , bought tickets from the airlines and also read the many negative feedbacks .
0	since i don ' t have a phone line installed , getting broadband with talktalk required a visit by an openbt ( or a name like that ) technician .
0	they were offering it at a good price and so we ordered on 00 june_0000 .
2	it is ridiculous that this company has no telephone_number , at the very least it should have ' live_chat ' customer service .
0	i adore this company , and feel that the only reason people can possibly be buying the more_expensive brand - name products has to be either a magpie - like attraction to colourful labels , or that they simply have not yet been directed to myprotein . com .
2	here i am practically a month later and am still_waiting !
2	why can '_t tesco be a bit more organized .
0	as i guess most people are , i was a little_dubious at first when a friend_recommended this site to me .
2	explain_why i should check your stock_levels ?
2	i ordered a black tablet in december ready for a christmas_present but it never arrived .
0	the white faux_leather is white and not off white , look brilliant in my white gloss white and oak kitchen .
2	one failed within the 0 year_guarantee period .
0	0 hours in one bar drinking pints and vodka red bulls came to about l00 each .
0	customer_service : brilliant
0	i immediately rang through and spoke to a respectful individual who informed me that the handset i had sent in would not work with a wifi network and listed one or two other faults .
0	bought suunto watch . great price .
0	!
0	i don ' t wanna sound like a cliche automated script , but ok , i ordered a bag from them , it was totally to my liking , dispatched and arrived quickly by dpd , and came with a free gift , and that was despite the fact it was a good £_00 less_than elsewhere !
0	and the reviews , absolutely trustworthy .
2	do not use this company !
0	i got my dispatch email yesterday from both dino_pc and the courier and it arrived this morning directly on time !
2	i have taken vitamins from simplysupplements for nearly 00 yrs now and think they are very good value .
0	thoroughly_recommended .
2	their customer service is the best i have encountered on the internet , full stop .
2	basically whether you are spending over £ 0 , 000 . 00 or just £_000 . 00 with cookersandovens , cookersandovens charge the same for 0 man delivery , in total £_00 . 00 !
2	so i ask them why , only to be told that the person who came out wasnt the right person to take the measurements ?
0	i ordered 0 items for christmas_presents ; sjp nyc x0 , halle berry gift set , oo0 spray with gift .
0	you can find various things you might need and with a great price .
2	what a joy to have good old_fashioned service with a smile from a delivery driver who was friendly and efficient .
2	the support i receive from one . com is always fantastic .
2	arrived really quickly .
0	i live in central_london and have no signal in my house .
2	i have bought & sold so many items on ebay over the last 00 + years that it is hard to know where to start .
2	easyjet wins on price on this occasion but the hidden value parts that ba offer are 0 . no jam packed waiting areas / cues to check - in 0 . flights leave on time 0 . you get a drink and a snack included .
0	highly_recommended !
2	ordered a karcher , washer and hose , no delivery or order history on my account , have not received items so cancelled order 00 / 00 /_0000
2	they have even stopped_replying to our complaints on their site .
2	extra_charge for this but total_cost very reasonable .
2	as i drove home i realised that i had focused vision only in front of me and simple task of negotiating round abouts and looking in the side mirrors with blurred vision was impossible and i had to turn my head round so much that my neck started hurting me .
0	this website has the best prices , and gives you that ease of comfort in knowing that you are getting the best price for the product , with their price_matching box !
2	maybe this will provoke a response and preferably some recompense .
2	its good to know when a site accepts paypal as i know my payments are completely protected and its also quick and easy to use .
0	nightmare to get a refund and useless when you have to use a credit note on store
0	good price and fast service , but had the item delivered to my parents as it was a gift , and they informed me that the package was just left on the doorstep for anyone to steal !
2	heard_nothing so wrote to nicecans . co . uk on 00th .
2	i wanted tickets for prince igor at the london coliseum and somehow got onto this website instead of the official coliseum website .
2	he was just plain rude .
0	the product i ordered ticked every box . it was very good quality was very good value and came within 0 days . very satisfied customer !
0	like any big company , its all about how much they can milk out of the consumer and unfortunately many consumers don ' t use their brains and simple buy from game because of the brand name , rather_than shopping around .
0	fast_shipping with one low flat_rate , i couldn ' t be more happy .
2	arrived in tenerife followed the instructions given .
0	thank_you .
2	fast delivery by an excellent courier which delivered when i wanted in a specific one hour time_slot and supplied at a great price .
0	i was furious with the second quote they had offered of £_000 .
0	we ordered our internet online .
2	but twice now , i '_ve had damage to the wheels of my porsche .
0	came the very next_day !!
2	i purchased a panasonic wv - sw000 to replace a fixed bullet camera , on the understanding that this camera did everything my bullet did .
2	be prepared for frustration !!!!!
2	oh hang on , you have , that is , it '_s all ' protocol ' couched in your favour !
0	stupid drivers and even stupider depot managers who are a waste of space .
0	i am now looking at transferring my services elsewhere .
0	the belt was so fragile that it actually broke right after i wore it .
2	to date ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i am still waitng for my goods .
0	i was extremely impressed with the service i received - my furniture was delivered ahead of schedule and i was really pleased with the quality .
0	overall disappointing delivery service , ok customer_service .
2	!
0	they never reply to emails , i have to ring them up to contact them .
0	i ' m not gonna do the math on that because ill feel bad about it , but hey its a habit im not gonna break anytime_soon and im staying in shape .
2	sometimes too often and eventually give up .
2	grace has agreed to call me to make arrangements on my return .
2	by this stage i felt it was totally_unacceptable to wait any longer .
0	this kind of customer_service is unheard of in australia and i have recommended pretavoir to a number of friends and colleagues for its good prices and exceptional service .
2	we now have our e_- tickets and have been e_- mailed and telephoned and kept_updated throughout the process ( barry is still working on our actual seat reservations - which he will double_check nearer the time when more have released - to try to get our preference ).
0	the only thing i would change is to put montgomery cherry extract on the list of products .
2	below you '_ll see an unitelligible reply posted by simply_electronics .
2	they did rectify the errors but we could have done without the extra time on our part contacting them .
2	easy to order , and followed up immediately with telephone confirmation .
0	i would ' ve tried to return it if their had been time and if their had been any other stock available .
0	eastenders is utter trife on the other hand , how on earth this crap is still broadcast is beyond me .
2	i hope that oe will change their practice .
2	- did i mention it is expensive ?
0	transglobal depend on successful rate but are not prepared for a complex case which is the worst thing for a company . a small issue can not be solved and it takes months .
2	occasionally one plug drops off the network and has to be reconfigured .
0	0 minutes later i provided my paypal payment confirmation details and was then told that there had been a mistake between paypal and yourselves but confirmed i had actually paid for the product and it would be dispatched the next_day as a priority .
0	recently used the site to buy a running gilet and they price matched a price i found on another store .
2	it can sometimes be difficult to find what you are looking for .
2	good value , originals , excellent service , will use this site in the future as where else can you buy named perfumes as cheap as this , i looked and i found cheap_smells .
2	i could hardly see the image even when held up to bright sunlight .
2	rang c / s twice , had delivery charge refunded and was told i would have to wait for depot to confirm receipt of collection from wrong_address .
2	i have noticed in the past that the website closes for weeks at a time which seems strange .
0	i have been with talk_talk two years and throughout this period i have had consistant problems with the router disconnecting from the internet .
2	unfortunately i did not get the name of the driver / delivery man so i can not name him when i say he was brilliant .
2	i received an_email which i think was very rude , from customer_services after complaining an order was a completre waste as photograh was on half of the front and half of the back of welcome card !
2	i recently tried to review the same company again - a different issue from before , but was advised i was unable to post another review and would have to edit my previous one .
2	they said that they hadn_'_t called me and asked whether i gave out my orange password to which i said i hadn_'_t been asked for it !
0	which i have to add . is also awesome =).
2	after 00 days i have not got a single reply , all i want is to know_whats going on . looks_like i will have to cancel my credit_card just to stop the transaction .
2	i put it away last winter when it got really cold , but really don_'_t think i needed to .
0	tried_emailing , no replied , no phone number to actually talk to anyone !
0	i was told i then had to ring back in the morning if i wanted a refund .
0	it only messes up my business feedback but somehow parcel0go can never compensate for there mistakes i pay for a service and i lose . 00_% time i have made orders i have had problems and i can say ive spent a lot of money via parcel0go and as new websites are coming along i may take custom else where if my orders keep getting messed_up .
0	ordered 0 pairs of glasses on the free home_trial until i found the right pair .
0	i will not use again until the site is improved .
0	i called into branch where i bought it to ( con ) front them ( worksop branch ).
0	i thought yodel were the worst but uk mail take some beating .
0	i guess i should have known though with the price i paid ( very cheap ).
2	fast delivery , good price , lovely looking wellies and decent quality unfortunately they are too small !
2	was then told they dont give refunds and had to have credit_note what a load of rubbish i do not need to buy anything from this shop again .
2	dont see them to survive for a long time .
2	on receiving both of the above after numerous call re delivery i may add , i received the goods but minus several parts to build the coffee_table with .
2	i am still totally unsatisfied with the most dreadful service i have had from your company
0	didn ' t really give me enough time to eat them !
2	anyway the car was big enough for the 0 of us and economical to run .
0	this chap although very pleasant would not actually answer any of my questions as in i asked why my parcel hadn ' t been sent out for delivery ?
0	they have no clue_what to do , are unwilling to escalate and their two main functions are to :
0	i am hopeful that i can update this review to 0_stars .
2	would not_hesitate in recommending this company to anyone looking to do diy repairs on ipads / iphones .
2	delivery was much_faster_than_anticipated 00_hours_later & the courier company did not have me waiting home all day , tyres arrived at 0 . 00am .
0	the problem was that they needed to match and i needed two of them !
0	i asked on a number of occasions for a refund !
0	thats quicker_than amazon !
0	please reply eflorist ?
2	i thought itunes were quick ,
0	they kept telling_me they ' d send me the details i needed via text , and they ' d never come through .
2	i recently had a parcel picked_up and delivered to me after i purchased it on ebay .
2	delivery was super_fast .
0	never_fails to disappoint me , amazing service !!!!
0	i would always recommend them to anyone , you pay for what you get .
2	around 0 : 00 yesterday evening when i had not seen a cancellation confirmation i emailed them , to which no reply !
2	i crossed my fingers , ordered one and waited .
0	i was hoping third time lucky but this time they thought it was suitable sending an expensive piece of hardware through the post in a plastic_bag instead of a box so the retail packaging was crushed again .
0	the flowers i ordered were not delivered on the specified day which was a real disappointment as they were for a sick friend just out of hospital .
0	now sat here waiting for another attempt , but judging on the time i am not expecting it to arrive .
2	publish a number for customer support and then let your customers decide what channel to use to contact you .
2	utter and complete_shambles of a company .
2	their pre_- sales and after_sales service is impeccable .
0	!
2	being very shortsighted (- 0 . 00 ) i have learned the glasses must be 000_% right if i am to see properly .
2	a company you can trust .
0	in march , my galaxy_s0 stopped_working .
2	they delivered a double .
2	every email ends ' we consider this matter closed ', and if you provide reqired proof they just stop replying
0	then he collected item but didn ' t contact me to arrange delivery date , again i had to call him .
0	i ' ve been appalled by the service provided by cash_generator .
2	quick , cheaper_than other_companies and everything up to expectations for my recent holiday in maspalomas
0	i closed my scottish_power account over 0 months_ago due to moving out of rented accommodation .
0	however when i received the printed invitations i was a little disappointed in the print quality .
0	there ' s a great service called flubit which gets better deals on products , which are already at competitive_prices .
2	both shower_trays arrived damaged , this was only discovered when all the packaging was removed to fit the trays .
2	00 / 00
2	wow !
2	you are creating unnecessary hassle for both yourself and your customers .
2	paid about £_00 for a pair of reading_glasses that are useable .
0	results : stunning .
0	the customer_service is fine but the delivery company they use - yodel , is very poor .
2	tried to buy a tv , recieved conformation of order and then nothing , no reply to emails and phone no is to an orange answer service to whitch no - one replies .
0	when arriving at the hotel i was told that i had to pay £_000 to make up the full bill so £_000_+ £_000 = £_000 an extra £_00 more then when i actually booked the hotel on the website !
0	i expected dpi much more but they failed to deliver
2	have e_- mailed many_times but they do not respond , tried their phone number - message_saying voicemail full and you cannot leave a message .
2	but if lastminure . com employed a call_centre that had people speaking decent english , the transaction could have been conducted quicker , meaning i would have got my flights .
2	they also stock the stuff i use , and have a website and newsletter that leads to new discoveries and so many temptations .
2	the whole proposition based on good yorkshire broadband with yorkshire values is a joke .
2	older houses often lose out becasue items do not fit a tap or the plumbing ceases to work with a bag sitting in the cystern .
2	great service , great furniture .
2	absolutely perfect in all_respects .
2	i can somrtimes struggle to get the right fit but this suit was perfect .
0	i also find their prices are almost always cheaper_than hostelworld ' s .
2	the only moan i have had up to now about this firm was that bought a hubsan helicopter whose transmitter battery box had a loose terminal so i rang up and told them .
0	fair value for money but will not exchange faulty mobiles for different type just same model .
0	to conclude , frankly it isn ' t about the money .
2	it sounds_like a little niggle but i was 000_miles_away and i wanted to know that everything was alright .
2	cannot keep being at home so extremely fed_up with poor customer service
0	a couple of good experiences coupled_with a few confusing and irritating ones
0	would recommend it to any first timers .
2	i can '_t even begin to describe the experience of these utter idiots .
0	i instantly rang the customer care line back and demanded that they find my phone , provide me with my original_quote and that i was utterly appalled that they had potentially funded some other person with the value of my handset .
0	new mats were sent out straight_away and they let us keep the old ones too so we could use them for our camping_trip that weekend as intended .
2	a great place to shop because not only do you get great deals on products you can also find things that arent available anywhere_else .
2	what a shower !
0	the chillisauce organised activities were fun to take part in , would recommend them to all stag_do organisers !
0	i have had some bad buffering experiences in the past and a few_times when ' lovefilm instant is not available right now ' which did really annoy me at the time as obviously if you are paying for something you should be able to use it .
2	a quick phone_call and this was sorted , a new box was sent .
0	ease of looking for hostels , brilliant prices and good acceptance of the deals by hostels creates a wonderful easy to use system .
0	it would have perhaps been better to delay delivery of the whole order rather_than have to wait nearly one month for it all to arrive .
2	wow , i was excited to find just what we needed , with more than one choice for each supplement !
2	i also notice that because they do not search low_cost airlines a bit of independent research on jet star ( australia ) and air asia ( asia ) will yield better deals especially if trying to get from a hub airport to regional centres .
2	take my advice , get ccl on your favourites_list and make_sure its your first_port of call for all your tech requirements , plus you will most_likely save a lot of money on the top name brands as well .
0	the service was very good considering the flight was full .
2	lo and behold , as a previous review mentioned , i got an_email that 0 of the 0 goods i ordered were out of stock .
2	that was months_ago and had a call the week before last asking them to ring them .
0	good product for the money but the wait made me realise i didn ' t really love the items quite as much as i had thought when purchased - took over a month .
0	0 broke_down due to poor wood .
0	having initially tested my brand_new blackberry to make_sure i hadn ' t been sent a dud phone , i found the device to be working immaculately as it should , so i decided to send the unit via special delivery in order to fast track and secure this brilliant service everyone had reviewing .
2	all i bought was a diary for next year , but it is beautiful !
0	they will allow you to get the product back but will charge you for this so you will feel , like i did , backed into a corner to accept or face losing money by paying for your property back .
2	my rad was supposed to be delivered 0 weeks after i ordered it , however a week after the delivery date , i still had not received it , contacted plumbnation who said they would email me the following_day to let me know what was happening , no email , so i cancelled my order , pity they couldn_'_t be as quick at refunding my money as they were at taking it .
0	unlike some shops in central_london were their pride and ego has chased a lot of customers away , dino ' s company is an exception .
2	this was at gatwick not at heathrow .
2	my money is in their bank_account earning interest when it should be in mine , which is tantamount to theft .
0	the waitress explained that we entitled to a main course from the rapido menu and a glass of house wine or soft drink .
0	the website is good to use , love the live feed which tells you when it is being prepared and whatnot .
0	as i ' m very happy with firefox i have given up with asda .
2	the products ordered were of good quality but the delivery is so slow .
0	ease of purchase was good , and then when tickets were dispatched i had a voicemail to let me know they were on the way which i was impressed with .
2	the p0g customer service reps are helpful via the livechat function on the p0g website , and the problem gets resolved in due course , but the business could be conducted in 0 / 0 of the time if it was possible to speak direct by phone !!
2	as well as the recent memory purchased for a laptop , we have had numerous modules from your business .
0	they are almost always one of the cheapest suppliers i come_across , and my recent pre_- order of the wiiu premium pack couldn ' t have gone smoother - they kept me updated with the process constantly , and i received it before the release_date !
2	they said i must pay £_000 . 00 , but would not say why .
0	excellent service highly_recommended .
0	i love how you can find anything , from an obscure vintage toy to the latest gadgets .
0	on an extra note , like the reviewer below posted , stay clear from nightgear : dodgy folk they are , don ' t be_fooled by their flashy discounts and offers .
0	i am waiting for sofia to message me tomorrow , if she doesn ' t i want to form a complaint against the company .
0	i have already_recommended silk_blooms to all my friends !
0	all the protein_bars were in damp boxes .
2	they have now changed their website to show a white machine .
0	so i was not able to use it as an iphone .
0	the delivery was quick , the price was low and the meat was great .
0	i went through the fraud process which is a brill idea but once i got the key code it never worked also got sent another 0 in replace of that 0 still wont work , good job it wasn ' t alot of money as i would of been trying to get my money back
2	travelling alone which was a problem for their website as it seems you can only book in pairs , but to be fair their office in london go it sorted .
2	very quick delivery .
0	i wrote to them and they were unhelpful claiming i got the correct e_- ticket number .
0	they said they would send one out straight_away .
0	they were more_than happy to help me with their latest designs , and i ended_up choosing the miley kimono in grey for her .
0	the price quoted for 0 phones was the best i could find anywhere .
2	really impressed .
0	a top end returns_policy ( i guess you might end up with a company that has one but it ' s pot luck .)
0	why buy else where when you can get the best at best price .
2	one particular cancellation left me hopping all_sorts of random trains , and it took me 0 . 0 hours to get to london ( normally 00 - odd minutes ).
0	now i have been on the phone for the last 00_mins trying to call their customer_service line which costs . 00 cents a minute !!
2	i ordered it with the expectation that they wouldn_'_t have one in stock - but i had little choice ( other than 0nd_hand on e_- bay ).
0	well worth it !
2	however i received first a missed call and then a text_message from the assembly team to ring to arrange assembly , even_though i had not yet received the furniture .
2	if your priority is cost and you are prepared for a long wait for your goods then they may be the suppplier for you .
2	this is in two parts - yesterday '_s and today '_s experience - read on :
2	highly_recommended
0	a simple video explaining what is involved when you order from this company would go a long way . for example :
0	i do however hate that they try their best to get you to sign_up for a credit_card , i almost did by_accident .
2	this is the most unacceptable company i have come_accross .
2	you suck !
2	nigel_o ' hara diamond jewellers
0	so my advice to yodel , stop spraying your vans green and start reinvesting your profits into a good team of people .
2	she was extremely friendly even_though ultimately i wasn_'_t able to send my documents via courier .
2	the courier delivered the package which was undamaged and not open so i guess i was being blamed although i do not know why .
2	used the live_chat service to ask the question but no one replied :(
0	used the site to get home insurance .
2	looking at the other reviews , that seems to be a common story , my experience is far from a one - off .
2	the items i purchased were ok , although the t - shirt would have been better a size bigger .
2	i used the next_day courier option and they arrived before we went .
2	numbergroup '_s t &_cs say that " at_least thirty ( 00 ) days notice will be given prior to suspension for non - payment " but in my case they cut_off my business lines on february 00th after one ( 0 ) days notice for a bill that had been due for payment ( they allege ) within 00 days of february 0st ( previous invoices had allowed 00 days to pay ).
2	this is a warning to anyone_thinking of using this letting agency .
0	for example you cant cancel orders one you ' ve made them , and apparently the return process can be a bit of a biatch lol . however my experience was better , did take more_than the standard working_days it said to come .
2	service quick , delivery quick , contact excellent .
0	set the standard for online purchasing !
0	when he returned , i asked if his office / workshop was far away and he replied it was just down the road .
2	day 0 - received a call from a account manager at natwest , i was in a meeting and could not take the call so she left a message_saying she would call back in 00_minutes and if she could still get hold of me she would call me the following_day .
2	at no time was this mentioned as insurance or extended_warranty as i would not have accepted either as my house insurance would cover the first and after a bitter experience years_ago never accept so called extended_warranties .
0	i will throw a party when this company shuts down .
0	i could not fault her .
0	i would advise against using this site and have amended my star_rating according .
2	it would seem trying to get an_appointment in london is a huge challenge .
2	i asked to speak to the store .
0	but once you add up the constant phone_calls .
2	on 00 december i e_- mailed ihampers to express my displeasure and only received a reply on 0 january offering me a 0 pound voucher off my next purchase - obviously a very safe offer as they are probably only too well aware it will be the last time i use their service .
2	easy website , great telephone service and delivery .
0	the courier wouldn ' t allow me to do this , and instead told me to sign as " unchecked ", which bedzrus advise not to do as it will make returns difficult .
2	posted back and money in my account within 0 days .
0	won ' t be using these again .
0	i ended_up dealing_with three different people .
0	i phoned them up asked what they were playing at that i was a pay & go customer . they put the blame down to switching from british_gas . that british_gas owe me the money .
0	i hope they try to improve these aspects because i believe this will improve the company as a whole .
0	my housemate didn ' t get a call and had to chase up again .
2	items from wowcher are very impressive & good quality , sometimes exceeding expectations .
2	don_'_t touch these sharks !
0	after contacting the supplier , it turned_out that citylink had also lost track of the shipment .
0	never mind the fact that it was the cheapest and , despite this , gave me more reward_points than was being offered by game , for example , even_though it cost more at game !!
0	i couldn ' t like any hotel that will suit as price and rank .
0	thanks a lot , would always take their service & would recommend 000_%.
0	( with exceptions to asda but where i live we don ' t have one ).
2	i sent a small chain away to them the value , the value they gave was some £_00 below my local shop , so i declined the offer it was then as they put it re - offered at £_00 more than the original and still below my high_street .
2	they were very easily installed and work very well .
2	the thing i like most about e_bay is that its easy to get in touch with them if anything_goes_wrong with an order
0	i then emailed a week_later after hearing_nothing else , only to be told that they were waiting to receive them from the supplier in another 0 - 00 days ( very vague ).
2	the ink arrived after a 00 day wait i had tied to contact the company by phone and email on several occassions no answer
2	i do not_hesitate to recommend them to any one wishing to purchase parts or software
0	the lillies were brown too .
2	too little too late , i ' m leaving plus net !
0	they sounded awful and told me to bring it to a store .
2	i ' m so pleased i decided not to choose my new glasses at vision_express , although they had some nice frames it was difficult to decide which ones to choose and the cost for extra thin varifocals was high .
0	terrible customer_service and the worst i have ever_experienced .
2	i think flying with easy jet is one of the best flying experience , no hassle , i have flown with them 0 times and never been delayed
0	i explained they had never requested a return but this was ignored by support .
0	avoid bozowi at all costs , otherwise it will cost you !!!
0	i had been looking for a copy of this book for a long time .
2	fast delivery by royal_mail and none of the all - to - frequent rubbish about not delivering to shetland or charging extra for a carrier who has no proper delivery arrangements within shetland .
0	we will not be using this website again , ordered the pram , it arrived all without problem .
0	after this post i have recieved a lovely email_saying they will deal with this matter by tomorrow and fet back to me wish i am very pleased about , other than my previous comment my change to the has gone_smoothly do instead of 0 star i will at the minute improve my rating and see the outcome .
2	so i ' m still trying to get compensation for everything they did wrong to me & for costs incurred as a result of being suddenly cut_off without_any warning !
0	pre_- ordered items showing up several days after release on several_occasions is the deal_breaker for me .
2	first time i '_ve used this company . it was a breeze .
0	i found other_sites with exact_same price and free shipping , but i liked the complimentary gifts they were boasting about , so went with them , and my product was very light .
2	not this one !
2	help !
0	very happy .
2	tried to buy jewellery at end of nov .
2	look at what i spend , and try to come up with discounts which as i order i can pass on to them .
0	yes , i take the blame for not checking what i had left spare before ordering , but in this day and age of fast paced interwebs stuff should it really have taken someone that long to pick , pack and post two bottles ?
2	the xp part was somewhat unstable - not e cost '_s fault - but quickbooks 0000 would not load .
2	!
0	-----------------------------------------------------
2	i thought they had gathered them all .
2	cannot_believe we found so much choice at the store ,,, really hard to decide what pieces to purchase ,
0	but they are better_than other high - street phone relaters and to their credit i have found them to have the lowest_prices .
2	the first time they said they were arranging for another supplier to provide the product because they didn_'_t have it in stock .
0	as i entered into 0000 , it became_apparent to me that the £ 0 quidco fee would be taking a lot of my cashback .
2	i assume they did not have the correct wheel in stock , but that is not really an excuse for sending something different than ordered without_any discussion .
0	i have called on 0 separate_occasions .
0	this is the best place i have came to find to buy supplements .
0	!
2	did a search , found rottenapples and thought their repair price was reasonable ,
2	i declined the price for the sd_card ( got one much_cheaper via amazon ) but fell for the battery even although the camera comes with battery supplied by canon .
0	this grocery_shopping site is like no other .
0	i am quite happy with the glasses as they are what i expected .
2	“ couldn_'_t ask for a better service and product .
2	i returned an item that was too small 0 days after i bought it i sent it back re ; the courier company use .
0	hope this pleases the review company now !
0	well wrapped as well !
0	would think_twice before ordering from this company again .
2	amazing delivery came next_day !
2	the service is usually problem free , but we find that 0g coverage is really hit and miss .
2	i asked is that date for sure and i was assured it was .
0	called today and spoke to a helpful lady who explained that the reason my order wasn ' t fully accepted yesterday was because the relevant credit_checks had not been completely carried_out ( after the initial credit check for the limit , they won ' t do further until you place an order , to save them time and money i guess = sensible , but not clear to me ).
0	thank_you hostel_bookers !
0	personally nearly bailed out of booking 0 - 0 times , took something like 0 hour 00mins to finally make a booking , i ' m sure this could of been quicker if it hadn ' t been for the poor lowcostpoorvaluewebsite . com .
2	00 / 00 .
2	however the
0	i call to a country and the charges are following : connection fee 0 . 0p and a minute is 0 . 0 total 00 . 0p , but skype charges 00p , they round this into their favor .
0	good prices , quick service , polite and helpful staff - what more could you ask for when ordering online !
0	well i know the cause : you ' re incompetent and would rather go to court than pay a penny to you - for the service i absolutely did not get : no internet , no phone and no customer_service !
2	it '_s now 0 . 00pm and stayed in a third day and nothing here as yet .
2	i cannot_fault serenata for ease of use , delivery etc . the flowers i ordered included roses and hyacinths . both can be difficult to manage .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending this company .
2	well_done gak !

2	i was a little_dubious_about not knowing exactly which manufacturer of ram i was buying but was assured by mr_memory that it would be " one of the top 00 ".
0	i recently ordered a kimono from lovekimono for my girlfriend ’_s birthday , and she absolutely loved it .
2	we were horrified by the side effects of the medication prescribed by the vet , so thought we ' d try this first .
2	i have already done that . all i want is be able to see my booking details .
2	i am still_waiting for something , anything , to happen .
0	i work so i am never at home to receive couriers .
2	i was very surprised at the amazing value for money the products are .
0	i got a knock on my door same week having problems with sp from a new energy supplier economy energy not on comparison_sites because they are guaranteed 00_% cheaper_than all the big 0 rip offs !
2	the only objection i had was a freezer i had delivered with a 0 pin plug on it .
2	if i have needed to contact interparcel they have always been very helpful and provided excellent guidance .
2	ray ( london ) uk
0	i can_honestly say , that even after all this time , i can still ring them up and they will help me through thick and thin .
2	well_done , a lot of big corporations could_learn a lot from you .
0	the only problems were with my perscription when i first ordered and the company ways wonderful at helping me get everything sorted and even rushed through my order so i had lenses to go on my holiday with .
0	netflights or aa or both screwed up and put me on standby for a ticket and seat i paid for .
2	price very competitive .
2	much_better field of view , but felt like i was wearing 0d glasses all the time , getting double vision !
0	i stumbled_across site by mistake on google .
2	firstly , dhgate is an internet portal bringing together sellers ( predominantly chinese ) and buyers like me and you from all over the world .
0	the timescale that they provided for me to complete my training was excellent and i did feel any pressure whilst training with this provider .
0	first ,
0	and i ' d definitely use them again .
2	they have no phone_call and emails responses are automated stating they don_'_t answer on may holidays .
0	they are such good quality !
0	the choice of bars was limited to the same type of music " cheese ".
2	also i would like to say that in my opinion alpharoom clients are given the inferior accomodation that hotels would not offer to guests paying the full price .
0	ridiculous .
0	this was refunded quickly but it was only picked_up via the bank_statement - i didn ' t receive further emails regarding the extra amount .
0	!
0	what i really like to do is shop online .
0	i have been imploring to my superiors to stop using citylink and am hoping that finally we will be looking to use an_alternative courier .
0	i wont hold my breath .
0	i also bought some glowsticks , but when i snapped them they also didn ' t work :(
0	how to explain this company .
0	from the first moment i got in touch with kraft i was provided with an outstanding service and this continued right the way through until the final product was with me !
0	they have lost the price battle especially against amazon - mens razers are 00_% cheaper at amazon than argos .
0	i had serious doubts about using it , it really seemed much like a scam like you regularly get by email , but then i saw two people i know on twitter recommending the service .
2	clearly they need to sort_out their stock numbers so customers are not mis_- led as to when items will be received , further to give really good customer service i should have been told that the item was out of stock as soon as they realised , so i did not have to contact them to find out what the problem was .
0	such a shame as they have an opportunity to step up with their customer care and respond to their users on trustpilot / communicate order statuses clearly before it gets to the trustpilot stage and they are shooting themselves in the foot .
2	the lens was dispatched via_dhl & arrived , safe & sound , a few_days earlier_than_expected .
0	every_single time i have had a yodel delivery there has been a multitude of problems .
0	in response to your comments regarding great communication may i remind you that it was me who demanded an update ; see my email dated 00rd feb . also not all internet companies grab the money regardless as to the stock situation .
0	the shipping amount i paid was £_00 . 00 which was good as it was coming from china but the items were very light .
2	- wildly frustrating experience if you try to sort_out a problem
0	some of the best prices on the net but their stock management is crap .
2	very modern and expensive looking .
0	!
0	disappointing o0 !
0	excellent service and would thoroughly_recommend .
0	this is one of the best digital software sites around .
0	then received and e_- mail saying " we tried to deliver your order from overclockers however there was no one available to sign for the order at the address below ".
0	thieves !
0	), however , echo genuinely seems to be one of , if not the , website offering the best deals .
2	i was looking for a marshall as000d acoustic amp and had some very fishy service from the music equipment retailer i usually use ( if you know what i mean ).
0	0 where amazon isn ' t an autorised dealer you may get a lower_price but you can miss out on cashbacks etc
2	super_fast delivery !
0	she has only just had a so - called engineer out who was unable to fix the issue .
0	however , after i was no_longer a customer , i was still receiving marketing emails and emails reminding me about payment for services i had terminated a long time ago .
2	i received a couple of emails to find out if i still had the remains of the damaged goods & with every email i received i responded .
2	overall , faultless service and an efficient , user - friendly booking process , means that usrentacar are always a pleasure to deal with .
2	don_'_t sell here - give get me in a try - i will next time !
0	i ' m on the tps register to stop marketing calls and also ex - directory !
0	i applied to cash genie and they gave me £_000 , which i then paid off . i applied to them about a week_later asking for £_000 as unexpected direct_debits made my bank overdrawn .
0	my client now has to wait an extra day for his machine to be built completely due to the shambles .
2	when i invisted customer service agent to pass on my complaint to a manager and either speak to me or email his comments i was told
2	i can_assure you that this is not usual practice for us and is purely due to a high_volume of emails and calls being received at present .
0	im terribly disappointed .
0	other than that , i ' ll test the lens when the camera from digitalrev arrives and hope all is well from there on out .
0	so . my order gets shipped , and some arrives , not everything is there though , infact a graphics_card i payed 000 £ for which has been taken from my account , isnt in the delivery , even_though its in the delivery note , i email them and im re - embursed , i take a look at there site and see the graphics_card . whilst iv been waiting for the ssd to come in has gone off offer , so even_though i payed for the item while it was on offer it was taken from my delivery , and then it was me who had to chase them for re - embursment
0	play . com used to be the best shop on the internet by a clear mile , they had the best prices , the best service and a great selection of products , i used them so much that i even have a play . com branded credit_card to earn points to spend there .
0	before i start , i should mention i love sushisushi and will_continue purchasing from them on a regular_basis .
0	if the furniture enters your house faulty they will send out engineers to do repairs .
2	i then rang back as he had not mentioned any price for the expedited delivery - verity answered and i gave my order number and she confirmed it was on fast order and that it was £ 0 . 00 .
2	our area has_gone digital so we recently upgraded our service to include the new tivo box ( more money ) - great box with some really nice features but not as intuitive as the sky box and the fact that you cannot turn off some of the features for example child protection is really frustrating as you cant watch anything during the day that you recorded at night without having to enter a pin number every time such a pain in a household full of adults
2	excellent value , but when tried to contact by phone was told upto 00 minuite wait , with a call back function that would save your place in the queue if you phoned back later , this does not appear to work .
0	on the second day we got picked_up by the party_bus in the afternoon .
0	elbec called me and we arranged a delivery date .
2	very easy to get in touch with .
2	!
2	so after poor product , poor packing , poor response and the " free shaker " being swapped to a poor imitation of the original ones , i am left thinking it may be better to try another company .
0	the print has come out amazing , colours are sharp and vibrant and looks fabulous .
2	this deadline was missed too .
2	on the other hand , when i complained at a tesco store despite polite responses , i had to go in and repeat the complaint to a further polite response .
0	robert was very knowledgable about all the destinations and got back to me very quickly with hotel and flight options ( which were always within our specified budget ).
2	wer bei thrifty mietet , sollte also eine kamera mit blitz bereithalten ( auf dem schwach beleuchteten parkplatz war bei regen kaum was zu sehen ).
2	envelope arrived the next_day .
0	cut_off internet to my phone .
0	thank_you :-)
0	i ' d recommend 00tickets to anyone that is looking for a reliable service and a fair price .
0	in short , delivery times bad , prices bad , postage prices bad , customer_services will just fob you off with a short default reply .
0	the whole_process of choosing glasses and ordering them went quite smoothly .
2	they emailed same day ( tick ) to say though they do stock them , they had run out and it would be " a few_days " .
2	i liked the appliances_online price and the tracking_system , it let you know where the item for delivery was at any given time .
0	i might use bedzrus again if their price is good , but i would prefer to use a more reliable retailer , especially with their unreliable delivery and signing as " damaged " policy which could be a potential problem if you just signed for the goods without thinking .
2	called the support desk once and was very satisfied with the technical_support provided .
2	i ordered some sale items but the sizing was completely random . i could not even get a couple of things on yet others were huge .
2	rang them and managed to get through to a person ( by putting in an incorrect calling_card number ) told them the situation and hey claimed the driver had gone to the wrong_address .
0	i would say that the company and delivery service cant be_faulted .
0	my mother ordered me the james bond skyfall tom fords before the film came out so i definitely got them . now although yes they were delivered this took around 0 - 0 weeks .
2	clearly the company prefers not to take returns and makes doing so very difficult .
0	opened the box , had a question . phoned the company
0	if you are late one day - you are totally screwed .
0	i bought a htc from them about 0 months_ago but the previous_owner presumably did not pay his bills and my phone got blocked , a nightmare scenario after paying so much !
0	it was posted as received when they said it would be .
2	all i want is an ipad which surely should not be too difficult for this " multi - million company " to provide !
2	trimmed the 00 ft grass around the trailer . no problem .
2	have recommended to everyone and will_continue to do so .
2	joined in jan for a smart_meter - was reason i joined
2	i would use it again but with the awareness that the calendar had to be completed in one session .
2	i have experienced all these issues .
2	i am happy to give you a 0 * rating now !
2	reebok were an_absolute nightmare so sweatband replaced the machine with a kettler ( which they recommended ).
0	ordered an item on the 0th of jan for my girlfriends_birthday on the 00th , i thought this would be sufficient time for an item to arrive .
2	regards
0	don ' t think if a certain type of number is free like 0000 (/ 000 from mobile ) it is free on o0 .
2	this is swaying my loyalty from ladbrokes unfortunately .
2	this led to an apologetic explanation that ' some of their drivers were women on their own ' ( so they exploit these women ?).
2	do not book with credit_card , you will be surcharged and they don_'_t tell you until after the booking is confirmed .
0	i ask to other to check if every thing are ok whith windows and whith comodo and only open the comodo main window and says all ok and waste two hours of my time for that .
0	contacted viagogo to no_avail as they blame sellers and only act as an agent .
2	he looked at his schedule and gave us the times .
0	this goes beyond bad customer_service to sheer incompetence .
2	should have a negative star system one star is far too generous for these amazonian muppets
2	sainsburys has a wide_range of delicacy foods , which is great .
2	shopping with ao is a breeze , no long delays waiting for a suitable delivery day .
0	and don ' t get me wrong , netflix is fantastic in it ' s own right .
0	cex ' s policy is , if you have a voucher , you must print it off , and post the voucher to them at your own_risk .
0	you can ' t help but feel that support sometimes have their hands tied by policies they have no control over , but if it came down to it , i would recommend 000reg and i have been very satisfied by the customer_service if not necessarily the reliability of my purchase .
2	it used to be the old_fashioned ' club ' catalogue i remember my mum and her friends using ; buy something and pay for it , interest - free , over a set number of weeks .
0	they hide_behind the fact that they sell online so their photoshopped images hide the shoddy condition of the junk they peddle , and when you try and return it , get ready for the circus .
2	pretty excellent service all in all .
2	lesson_learned .
0	it ' s a small matter to sort out a certificate and secure the site !
0	i spoke with emma on a live_chat , she amended my invoice immediately and emailed it to me within_seconds .
2	in the end they called me back as i put the phone down after 0 minutes on hold and told me that i couldn_'_t fly on the day i wanted because the flight was fully booked .
0	put up a move for some quotes .
0	they ' ve even deleted the email address we had for contacting them .
2	bad management , giving out spurious delivery information , out of date working practises , bargain_basement infrastructure , high staff turn over , cutting own throat with internet parcel firms as customers , and the majority of staff not caring a toss possibly make them the worst courier firm in the world
2	!
2	0 till open with 0 customers in queue , shelves very bare on my shopping day , basics like beans and cheese unavailable , staff doing the home shopping block aisles and got no regard to customers , probably going to give another supermarket a go after writing this
0	needless to say my dog is very happy with the delivery and my purse is happy with how cheap the dog_food is .
2	how can it take more than 00_hours to get some ?
0	paid £_000 for 0 of us to go , only to receive a call from shirley at lastminute stating that the deal did not exist and that i needed to change the date for spa package .
2	and if products are going to turn_up late then tell your customers before they start searching for review_sites .
2	!
2	i think delivery charges could be made clearer .
0	i was told to sort it myself with the delivery company when they called me , a call i am expecting this week .
0	the customer_service is very poor and arrogant .
0	i ordered a holl three seater with chaise in beige max fabric on thursday_evening 00 / 00 / 00 .
2	thriteen days_later i rang and emailed them , was told the item was not available !
0	i purchased myself a garmin product from this site and found the website and service from the staff really helpful .
0	will_continue to use o0 . for now anyway .!
2	thanks alexandalexa .
0	i ' m not sure if the people in there are trained for anything_else than selling because they just told us to phone customer_service , who on this occasion told us that it wasn ' t possible to change the contract that easily .
0	00 / 00 .
2	it didn_'_t appear on their tracking until 00_hours ( or more ) later .
0	iphone 0 smashed front and back with various chips all around .
0	they always deliver really quickly and everything is well_packaged .
2	the service we received from our advisor ian was first_class and in my opinion unbiased .
2	0 days still_awaiting delivery .
2	all unresolved .
2	this saved me a whole lot of trouble , it takes a company that cares to provide such service .
2	its inexpensive and easy to get .
0	!
2	my advice to anyone_thinking of reccomending someone to them for £_00 of false_promises is dont .
0	arrived on time .
0	this then sends a text to your phone with a code which you input .
2	if , however , you or any member of your family enjoys online gaming , streaming online television services ( netflix , etc_.)
2	they are delivering the glasses for me but if i could i would have cancelled the transaction .
0	i can say anymore , other than , i will_continue to use them !
2	please see comments_below
0	########################################################
0	since this is an unlicenced bit of fan art knocked together in some bloke ' s garage this seems a bit pretentious .
2	i am very impressed and would want everyone to open this door as it is like finding the jewels in the crown .
0	too expensive and not enough products , theyve really gone_downhill recently .
2	however , i am not impressed with the delivery times of any of the items i have purchase .
0	highly_recommended .
2	ref_: 0000000
2	i think i must have been charged what i consider to be an excessive amount for this , because of the total that i was required to pay before i could have the car back .
0	i managed to find a phone number which isn ' t used any more , they prompted me to try the live_chat on their website , which doesn ' t exist .
2	i was then told in a loud voice " as you have this receipt i can see you have bought the bag , so i will give you the gift_voucher ".
2	tyre size then loads of choice .
2	update , update , update !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	courier given access to a block of private flats , customer appears not to be in , does not leave card but does decides to ( fraudulently ) sign for it himself and then leaves it somewhere - parcel goes missing .
2	i am writing to you with regards to your comment written on the trustpilot website regarding your booking with bravofly .
0	the sooner party_krakow invest in a secure payment website similar to their british competitors the better for them ( in my opinion ) as everything else they do is absolutely spot on .
2	subsequent to my post i have received a threat of legal_action by the managing_director of this company in which he has attempted to intimidate me into silence .
0	they lost my parcel which worth alot to me after ringing time many_times they promise to redeliver and after 0 weeks they says its lost ?????
0	gamekeys , works a tad differently then other stores .
0	how can a company have a perfect profile on thousands of reviews ?
2	well that was a disaster .
2	the only smooth part of the whole_transaction was the efficient transfer of money from my account to theirs .
0	buying something over the internet really should not be this much hassle and now i have thrown away my money .
0	we got on near our hotel at victoria took red route , live commentary fantastic we enjoyed that much stayed on all the way around then went round again to get off and see sights !
0	will_definitely buy from you again .
0	i haven ' t research about this company until i ordered the fuji finepix s000exr camera .
0	switch to t - mobile !
2	so i immediatley sent and e_- mail giving the correct postcode only to be told ( via_email ) that i can '_t alter anything as the order had been dispatched .
0	then recently either my tastes dramatically changed or their designers had their eyes removed .
2	don_'_t do it . you ' d find doing smoke signals to communicate a lot more efficient .
0	i lost my deposit and booked a much cheaper holiday with a different company .
2	i had previously checked they were in stock , after giving my postcode .
2	claimed they came with a fitted presentation_box .
2	had been with them for many_years , but now they are beyond a joke , always increasing there prices , what for ? more repeats & tell them your leaving well in advance & they try all ways to hit you with extra billing , but thank heaven for good solicitors , for if i get another letter requsting payment for something_else , that is who will be handling it so sky subscribers bewar of what could happen to you if you decide to leave , my advice is always copy any correspondence from day 0 & always keep a diary of who you spoke to , time & date ,& what coversation was about so watch this space over the next couple of weeks ?
2	excellent , and delivered incredibly quickly
0	i phoned up customer_services and they just said
2	great item , will use again , many_thanks .
0	however , their delivery charges are high , particularly when you only have a small order and i had two experiences within one week of their nominated delivery service breaking my tiles .
2	i replied no i wanted my ipad .
0	i also presumed that it would be like getting insurance quotes , put all the details in and it would pop up with the quotes and you would pick the one you wanted , so i guess i was disappointed that after putting my details in it just told me 0 companies would get back to me .
2	awaiting delivery , trying to be patient , have given one star but only to post opinion
0	compensate for ur mistakes parcel0go then id b happy thankyou
0	the sole reason i am with them is that its not about the company its about the useless people they hire .
0	i check this site nearly everyday and if there is something i like i send the user a message but the thing that gets me is 0 times out of 00 the user ( s ) dont get back to you and its very frustrating and its quite off putting .
0	it gave me the option of thu / fri / sat / mon for collection .
0	nobody has updated me with the situation of my order .
0	also , there should be another ' where ' in order for the sentence to make more sense .
2	" please_accept our apologies for the delay of your spectacles , there has_been a delay of the lenses for your spectacles .
2	you said you would update me within 0 working_days and you didn_'_t - that '_s when i went looking for answers .
2	helpful website , good price , prompt service and very helpful staff .
0	i am going to review this company as objectively as i can considering what they have put me through .
0	they guided me through the steps needed to resolve the problem and ensured that it was resolved .
0	i love this website i have used it several_times and each time same great service .
2	this company are a joke , my wife saw red and told them to cancel the order and a refund is now anticipated .
0	would definitely use them again .
2	they dont reply to your emails either .
0	we have written a letter of complaint but are still_waiting for a response .
2	when it asks for paper choose a0 sheet etc .
2	i got the dates wrong ( i forgot to tell them when the flights changed ) - but they didn_'_t charge when we turned_up two days late .
0	clearly groupon ' s processes are poorly organised and not customer friendly .
2	save your money and find a decent company to buy from .
0	the courier made no effort to find my house and my item was left at the depot for me to collect .
0	the company has provided excellent customer_service and i would recommend snugg products to anyone .
2	they are now collecting the defective toaster and have agreed to refund , but they are plainly untrustworthy and i would urge that you do not buy from them .
0	i have recently signed_up for wowcher , as i saw a good deal and thought why not ?
0	for the first time , we found one page with a lot of cheap , good hostels , not just crappy ones !
0	had to freeze it all .
0	have had to make alternative_arrangements now and has turned_out cheaper and better .
0	flowers in general were fine - some wilting on the edges .
0	it ' s also very useful when you ' ve missed the delivery that either they leave a calling_card to say where they have put the parcel safely or that you can go on the website and arrange a new delivery date .
2	used anyvan to find a courier for my range_cooker was put in touch with barry who was excellent delivered the very heavy cooker and his communication was brilliant phoned me to say he was on his way then when he picked_up the cooker .
0	two parcels were collected from the same address for delivery but got split up , only one delivered to me on the 0th_oct .
0	i suffer constant drop outs ; occasional the network stops responding .
0	kumar the manager said no issues send the screenshots over and we will refund the difference if you book the flight with us now , so i did and sent the email explaining everything to the customer_services referred them to the time of the call the kumar etc ( he said the call will be monitored ), i got a very sarcastic response saying they cannot refund difference otherwise they would be out of pocket !!!!
2	initially there was some good communication from their customer_services and they eventually agreed to provide a different model and a small refund .
2	i found the staff both knowledgeable and helpful .
2	it was great because the barn is open plan and by defining areas such as the hallways with persian style runners it was amazing .
0	ok , maybe a minor point but was it just me that thought i had to phone a bloke called tom !
2	great service , price and lovely tax disk holder .
2	so much of it was dented , scratched , chipped etc so even before it was fitted i was told a french_polisher would be out to rectify .
2	they emailed back saying they couldn_'_t take the order by phone and attached two forms which my comuter couldn_'_t open .
2	ordered a new magimix two days_later it was in our kitchen .
2	i see from other reviews that these kind of issues are common all over the country .
0	i had to phone them to find out when it would be delivered .
2	after several emails and tests they couldn_'_t get this to work either .
2	update 00 / 00 / 00 .
2	charged us the wrong amount , took a long time to deliver the goods and when they did they sent us the wrong sizes .
0	zavvi . com as a site has the best prices i have seen they are extremely cheap , yet do not order a game expecting it to arrive till at_least 0 weeks after you ordered , their postage system is the worst i have ever_encountered it is atrocious .
0	the other things are ok , are a comprensive and a trusted security software i can give to comodo the work to mantain my computer safe .
0	the products were good at good price too , the delivery price the same as other supermarkets .
2	the assistant who served me acted like i was putting her out .
2	a simple note would have been helpful
0	what to say about orange , there ' s not a great deal to be honest .
2	no tissue and no soap which is totally_unacceptable in the days of norovirus .
0	( 00year old female and 0year old boy )
2	but it '_s arrived , in perfect_condition , and i ' m really happy !
0	could have been better !
0	upon pitching , i realised it had 0 holes in the groundsheet - i rang up the 0000 number and the women asked me to take photos and email them across .
0	i struggle with phone_calls as my phone will hang_up because of signal lost ; it has done this for my last 0 phones since moving to the area .
2	thank_you for such a professional service , which is very much_appreciated
2	we ' re delighted with our sign .
0	much to our delight the deal was there and ours from the taken which we snapped up .
0	we went to the national archaeological museum near exarchia , athens .
0	des
2	it `_s been a sort of up and down three years .
2	hence i switched and will stay switched well_done serenata .
0	this public traded company called ocado must be writing its own review in my humble opinion .
0	they have some good deals specially with ups .
0	they saved my backside just in time but their international selection is a bit poor and pricey .
2	they all arrived in in a condition consistent with having been dropped on one corner , which made them out of line or wonkey .
0	they didn ' t respond to me until 0 days_later saying it was too_late , 0 hours_later they sent me a tracking_number .
0	there was no click or unclick box to let me know a bundle to software was going to be loaded .
0	it ' s very easy to use the website and information is good .
0	the box was just left in a store room by a staff_member .
2	i was ever so pleased with the great and speedy service that i recieved
2	i '_ve used medic_animal for a while now - recommending them to friends and always having great service - but recently i '_ve had a few minor problems .
2	we visited our local_store and ordered a fridge_freezer which we were assured would be in stock on 00 july and delivered the following week .
2	value for money with very quick postage .
2	do i need a new lamy biro , some turquoise ink , beautiful scandinavian dotted paper - i so do !
0	det_er rigtig godt med privat biludlejning , men de her er altså væsentlig dyrere end gomore
0	kyle
2	what fantastic customer service enhanced by the expertise of jessica who sorted everything expertly in no time at all . many many_thanks jessica
0	now , i have been using them for years , and would not use anybody_else - the quality of their products speak for themselves , and not only are the prices significant lower_than the brand - name supplements , but they come in much larger quantities too !
0	hostelbookers . com has very easy structure to search hostels .
0	need i say more ??
2	?
2	parcel0go have had a few bad_reviews but following my experience with them it could be that customers just aren_'_t approaching them correctly .
0	all this i promptly put in the freezer , very pleased with my decision .
0	there customer_service is just as bad with there rude members off staff that don ' t even seem to bothered to help you when your asking for a little assistants , and most of them cant even speak understandable english with there heavy accents , because it seems like i speaking to someone on the other side of the world .
2	carhire_0000 offered me their collision damage_excess waiver insurance at £_00 , and before i took it i asked them specifically ' if i take your cdw insurance , will that avoid my credit_card being having a big refundable charge taken when i arrive ?'
2	i web chatted again ( now getting very angry ) with a yodel representative , he apologised ,
0	happy new year .
0	the delivery service is very good , in fact i had to change the one of the items ( due to wrong_size ) and the drop_off service is very effective .
0	well thanks for trying i guess guys .
0	0 .
2	i emailed back to clarify if they meant a replacement unit as having paid a lot of money for ready built items i would not expect to have to repair a damaged item myself .
0	so far i ' m happy with evans .
2	item as descibed .
2	have used play a few_times and found them good in the past , however :
0	there is no pressure to purchase ( unlike many other_places in hatton gardens ) and the prices are very good indeed .
2	their prices are very competitive , often beating the other main online_retailers .
2	very quick delivery .
2	i will_definitely be buying another piece to spruce up my bedroom .
0	useful contact information for everyone :
0	i will be using etyres going forward for all my tyre replacement needs .
0	thanks guys , looking_forward to the next project !
2	all automated now then it will cut you off
2	as reliable as ever , looked at a few other battery suppliers but eventually came back to battery_force as their prices are cheaper and the service is excellent .
0	i did mention it though " ( she didn ' t ) " i have been told i speak really fast " was her reply .
0	thanks to jane and harriet
2	i then emailed them asking to chnage the flights and i would pay the £_00 . 00 per_ticket .
0	also car_parking practically non_existent at the hotel - cost me £_00 in the ncp which made my £_00 room deal a much poorer deal .
2	their customer service extension is never manned , it seems , so i then tried choosing the sales extension , and that was when i spoke to a lady_called [_name_removed ], who after hearing my account instructed me to return the motor for a full_refund and said that the part that had not been delivered would also been refunded .
2	well this was over 0 days ago and the last response i had was yesterday morning asking me to respond by 0000 if i wanted delivery today , i responded_immediately but of course nothing .
0	now they tell me they can ' t give me a refund on the gift_card - even_though it ' s missing with royal_mail ( royal_mail didn ' t get it until the 00th ).
0	is impeccably reliable , so much so that i don ' t need to go to the store at all .
0	their console is excellent and so is their software .
0	ordered the tv on tuesday 00th_december and was asked to select a delivery date so i selected next_day delivery which was free .
0	they were more like fluresent .
2	i have had 00_% success with all seeds purchased the 0 % failure being extreme heat last_year frying the young plants , i would personally recomend herbies for services & quality .
2	meanwhile i had checked the tracking and sent off emails to yodel and ps asking where it was .
0	i didnt realise it was plastic but that was my own mistake but the quality of it looks very cheap .
2	i now do not have to struggle with walking poles , carrying a bag , my dog leads , balls , dog poo bags , spare gloves or any of the other things i used to struggle with just to take my dogs to the fields .
0	in fact , i have since persuaded 0 friends from not using freedom0surf when they were considering using them for this very reason .
2	why did the delivery people not ring the doors bell and most disappointing there was no card inside .
0	own branded protein of average to below_average quality .
0	thanks for the dosh !
2	i would prefer to have the option of paying in advance , to avoid potential changes in the price due to variations in the exchange_rate .
0	received a confirmation_email the next_day quoting " this email confirms we will deliver order number ****** on 00 / 00 / 00 " ( saturday ).
2	i hate this .
2	i '_ve given up and have written to the chair
0	they just need to try a stick to what the can offer and not offer something they don ' t have .
0	they are a private company that masquerades as a public entity .
0	trying to speak to them on the phone leads to a long queue lasting nearly half an_hour , and their live_chat is where i just get ignored and never have a response .
0	i ordered almost £ 0000 of furniture .
0	this wepage does not recognize myprotein order number ( 00000000 ). so it had to be edited
0	customer_services polite and helpful and replacement eventually sent next_day delivery using a decent courier and they refunded my postage .
0	i have requested a refund twice , still_waiting now nearly two months , so like their products will probably wait about a year to receive .
0	i am out £_000 with no way of replacing the item !
2	i cannot_believe the bbc have sold out regarding the coverage of formula 0 .
2	would definately recommend buying from merlin_cycles .
0	he advised not to use it , but it ' s just his opinion .
0	i decided to change to another supplier .
2	on both the bike performed very well ( unlike me ) and took everything that was thrown at it .
2	i then saw the reviews on this website which obviously worried me !
0	i ordered the iphone 0 on the first pre_- order day from the apple_store online with a delivery time of 0 - 0 weeks after the release_date of friday 00 september_0000 .
0	makes our standard ikea kitchen look really premium .
0	i purchased one key and passed the anti_fraud checks and was emailed stating all further orders would be instant with no further checks , i purchased the same key again for my brother and was again sent an auto email requesting for anti_fraud checks , of which i replied but unlike the first key i have not yet recieved the 0nd , this is poor as i was told further orders would have no issues , the payment was succesful but i recieved no key , i tried to contact support via skype , facebook , twitter and email , but with no replies , i am not happy with this service .
0	so funds taken , no product , so far no refund ( which when i do eventually get , will be 00days or something ).
2	i ordered product from easygates and the delivery was fine .
2	the pillows were not in the parcel so i tried_ringing them .
2	that day is tomorrow , but since i have again received no reply , despite more messages , i don_'_t know whether to stay in again all day or not .
2	they are rule compared to blooming winner .
0	i purchased a samsung 00 " led_tv from pixmania as the price was very good .
0	rather pay more and get what you pay paid for .
2	highly_recommended .
0	because it ' s not .
0	good , my phone was unlocked but it had delayed too much !
2	firstly i wanted to know if the bulbs were able to be used with a dimmer switch , a email was sent the following_day advising this was possible .
0	great will use again .
0	i will_definitely be using this site again
2	premier_inn provide a ' budget service ', i have to say that i have rarely seen this term so overused .
2	eventually called me back 0 days_later - when i said the price offered it was a bit low , never_heard back .
0	overall , this is the best phone network i have been with , and i ' ve been with all the major ones in my time .
2	take warning prospective buyer that there is no chance to contact the company by telephone and any email sent recieves no reply or response should you receive poor service .
2	had i not been out of the country this company would have had a very nasty phone_call from me and a request to uplift their goods and refund my money .
2	do not use this company
2	tried to call yodel , kept getting disconnected .
2	wrong !
0	both tasted as bad as they looked and we still hadn ' t had our drinks .
2	my choice ).
2	i would recommend everybody to give them a try .
2	the strings were free but obviously , that '_s not practical so i '_ll have to leave it at :
2	der er tit udfald på internettet
0	another added_bonus is they have suggested us to come back the week of the wedding and they will clean all our jewellery we are wearing on the day for free .
0	i would rather spend double the money on a product that is given to me with precious customer_service
2	the furniture looks fantastic ,
2	the invoice shows fedex in fact it yodel .
0	!
0	fast delivery comes within 0 - 0 days of ordering , very efficient !
0	easy website , sharp service and speedy_delivery .
0	we cancelled the agreement with them as we saw many bad_reviews about one of their other_websites and have never , to this day , received a refund .
0	from the moment i spoke to robert ( our holidays_please representative ) my anxieties about booking our dream honeymoon were forgotten .
0	our coach transfers were done by very helpfull staff who lugged all 00 cases in and out of the bus !
2	had to pay for taxi to international terminal .
0	i saw a video of how the games get selected and dispatched and was shocked how the machines get the games out faster_than any other online games company .
0	if they don ' t send me my missing belt , this is definitely something i will be exploring .
0	there is no ability to talk with customer_service over the phone so i will take my loss and go somewhere_else , 0 positive is that it was delivered quickly .
0	but here ' s what i don ' t get : when i buy stuff , i don ' t get all that good a deal .
0	come on that ' s crazy !
2	prompt service & delivery at a competative cost
0	i found lightinthebox through an advertisement on a well_known auction site so i assumed that they were reliable .
0	endless phone_calls and chasing up !
0	so far , so good . now all i have to do is start travelling with the knowledge that everything that might happen can be sorted out !
0	thanks yodel , i hope that i never have to deal with you ever again .
2	brilliant !
2	bought aftermarket from ace and ace is the correct term !
0	or for further cost they can repair it properly .
2	love their products !
2	only after complaints to trading_standards and isis did i get a full_refund 0 weeksl later . they do not answer phone_calls or phone back when they say they will , only because i persisted did i get the refund .
2	after a week i received an e_mail saying one of the items was out of stock ( even_though when i checked on their site it was still available to purchase ).
0	really bad customer_service , store manager rude and not helpful .
0	!
2	i knew they were worn at the edge , but i also knew that the majority of the tread , within the 00_% of the width measured from the centre of the tyre was well in excess of 0 . 0mm .
0	for the love of god people please stop using myherpes !
2	however there was a problem and the next_day i had to arrange for an engineer to return the following_day .
0	i gave 0_stars purely_because of the huge_selection they have
0	i thought ordering " grandissimo " would mean a huge bunch !
0	i ' d say 00_% of dealings i ' ve had on ebay have been good , both buying 00_% and selling 00 %.
0	all in all i am not surprised .
2	delivery was fast with email_confirming dispatch & tracking_number .
0	the product
2	nikki just sorted it out - what more could you want !
2	after resigning myself to a bit of a fight for my £_00 owed , after_reading other reviews , received a reply to my email of 00 . 00 . 00 out of the blue on 00 . 00 . 00 with an_apology and to advise that the funds would be transferred to my bank today .
2	online ordering and service was efficient .
0	i ' ve had 00 + conversations with the letting agents and even made a formal_complaint to the head letting agent about this , but they continue to ask to view the flat without 00_hours notice .
2	they stated that they had the report but just needed to check on what they would do next .
0	only wanted to remove a couple items from my last order , not your exaggeration of every order .
2	i would shop again at ao but i would do my homework elsewhere first before i hit the buy button .
0	so even_though you don ' t have any movies at home they will say " well they ' re on its way ", thiefs i will say , not impressed at all and never again !
0	we were told that the flat was set_up with a smart_meter and we would only be billed for the electricity that we had used .
0	i would recommend cleverboxes via tesco with the proviso that you take the delivery date as an estimate and don ' t try to collect your goods until you receive email confirmation that they have been delivered .
0	its just a waste of time it seems !!
0	look through the statistics it is basically self explanatory .
0	they asked if my other phones did this and i said " no ".
0	when i went there website for first time , i got a great response from their chat system .
2	i was away when the tickets for this concert went on sale , so by the time i checked my emails and went on line it was sold out . luckily i managed to get some good tickets from double0 and they arrived within a couple of days .
0	otherwise alright to buy through
0	the party coming up very soon i had to quickly pick out a different costume with the promise of next_day delivery .
0	just paid an extra £_00 and bought it from [_external link_removed ].
2	got home at 0000 and went outside to leave a note on my front_door to say , could they use the back door but there was a missed delivery note already there .
0	would definitely_recommend .
2	if you ' re wanting to retrieve the parcel , then you can book a collection of the parcel from your customer .
2	would buy these blinds again as arrived in 00_hours . didn_'_t sign for them though as courier placed them over side gate which was locked but they could of been accessed from passers by . thoroughly pleased with them though !
0	the tv arrived 0 days_later , which was good , however i noticed that the tv had been shipped from france , which seemed odd .
2	just want to say , their after_sales service is excellent !
0	great choice of food and restaurants too !
2	the costume is great quality ( she looks great with it on , as well as great with it . oops , nearly got cheeky .) and is much_better_than i '_ve seen in the high_street shops ( not that i spend my time looking at lady '_s swimming_costumes in the shops - honest ).
2	as it was under £_000 , not covered by credit_card , spoke to cab , open a dispute , so lets now wait and see .
0	by this point i was feeling exhausted with having to keep returning to the store , the repeat phone_calls to customer_services , where i had to explain everything over and over again .
0	i provided them with the information that was required and was assured that delivery would be quick .
2	will_definitely_use them again .
2	if they get behind they just leave a card without even trying to ring the doorbell .
0	ordered friday , phone call , text and email on monday telling_me my order was shipped .
0	i am having to try resell them online with no guarantee of a sale !
0	overall disappointed because the flowers i got did not look fresh at all .
2	good service , fast resolution time , no_problems whatsoever .
2	was advised to buy the black one which i did but when it arrived it was very thin and would rip easily .
2	great website with lots of choice and easy to navigate around .
2	disappointing .
2	they also explained that it would be in stock in a few_days . was also told item would be sent by express delivery so i would get it within my revised deadline .
0	just ordered a new bathroom_suite and i love it !
0	i gave them details and told them it needed to be delivered before 000pm to work address .
2	0000 customer service prem rate no ,££ customer service operators work from asia very poor english
0	i was furious . why would i want credits i haven ' t used the voucher it does not expire until december_0000 and it was utterly misleading and disappointing this company should not be allowed to get away with matters like this and i will be taking further_action .
2	they collected , they told me when it had arrived back , and they dispatched another , which arrived swiftly .
0	i ' m not convinced the delivery driver called at the house at all as there was someone in all day .
2	annoyingly if they don_'_t have something , you have then paid for delivery and could have used the space for something_else .
2	by this time , tests and assessments of your service will be performed outside of peak hours and an_email will follow asking for you to provide more information as they ‘ cannot see a problem from their end ’.
2	i recommend you try them , you maynot want biosthetique products but they also have salon professional products as well and electrical appliances for very good value .
2	do not go near this company !
2	this may have been the case 00 - 00 years_ago but not today .
0	noting special same info same commercials same same
2	my review was deleted for investigation and they confirmed the authenticity of my review so they told me to open a ticket .
0	expensive , but good service
2	why offer this and then not send it .
2	yeah till you see all the extras you get charged for !
2	i was informed that they could not give me a delivery date until they received full payment , to which i replied that surely they can give a date and then i would happily pay .
0	if you are reading this review do not purchase your insurance with this company .
2	until the company deals with this complexity in a fair manner towards the seller i won_'_t be using it again .
0	the product purchased is extremely good quality as expected after purchasing a high end trampoline .
2	we are a paying trustpilot customer .
0	the staff were slightly unfriendly and i have sadly had to return 0 xbox ' s before the 00 days warrant ended due to faulty items .
0	the fact of the matter is that as soon as they offer the deal they get thousands of orders and they just don ' t have the capacity to cope ( obviously they shouldn ' t be offering next_day delivery if they can ' t comply but who_knows_how many issues they will come_across - maybe 00_% of people who order do get it the next_day ).
2	ordered in stock item with a ten day delivery .
0	i have never ordered prescription medication over the internet before but viovet made it quick and easy .
0	my order was cancelled in less_than 00_hours despite having purchase from there online store already twice before and numerous_times in store , apparently my card did not pass security for which they could have contacted me to confirm any details which i was happy to verify however they didn ' t bother .
2	from shiply i got 00 !!!!
2	i will take this further as i don_'_t see why companies like this should be able to just rip people off and think the won_'_t do anything about it .
0	i waited about 00 days and then sent an_email to the company to chase up the order .
0	arrived very quickly and yes very heavy to put_together .
2	not worth the money and unfair i would have to pay to return the item .
0	all ' s well that ends well though , i asked for my ipad back and then i sent it to carphonewarehouse yesterday and they have just replied by email agreeing the top price of an excellent condition ipad of £_000 . 00 ( which probably would have been more if i hadn ' t have had my time wasted by gadgetpanda !
2	brush up on this & you ' d be 0 star .
