2	was looking for a keyboard , realized i needed to do some homework , and this site was extremely_helpful in assisting with the decision .
2	i felt that the quick and slick delivery and keen_pricing was part of always riding ' mantra ', unfortunately slow delivery of the maglia rosa book ordered , meant a late birthday_present
0	customer support is not very good at all either , usually stuck on the phone with an indian_call_centre for hours when it should have been done it 00 to 00_minutes .
2	use at your_peril , avoid like the plague !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	sales order 00000000
0	bunch of crooks will never use again - best mobile phone recycler has to be either mazuma or top dollar mobile ( professional companies ) - also when trying to call cash0phones with - hold your number or if they have your details they dont answer !
0	i make about 00 posts every day ( much to the digression of my friends ) about everything ranging_from my day at college , quotes , music , film - all_sorts .
0	i can ' t fault this dress , i ' m so happy with it .
2	this is a design fault and shlould be brought to the front of the blind .
0	( yes they are that good !)
2	tenerife , sol princessa dacil .
2	i intend to try elsewhere .
0	i share images on facebook , upload videos and all_sorts but i hate the timeline idea please take facebook back and stop updating it you make it worse just take it back scrap this timeline nonsense and leave it alone please
0	no_complaints and will be using again !
2	seems they only want people to see good comments , not truthful ones !
0	they have it written up in their ridiculous contracts that you do not have a choice so beware what you are signing into .
0	so i tried and i tried and i tried ,
0	bonjour ,
0	my most_recent order i specified a day for delivery because i wasn ' t in , but the package turned_up in less_than 00hrs .
0	this company deserves much praise for what it provides !
0	i will be looking into the " supply of services and goods_act 0000 " to establish whether regus are in breach of contract by not carrying out their duties adequately .
2	the soft_close never worked and toilet_seat broke within 0 months .
0	booked a room through olotels for a stay in london ( reservation number 0000000 ).
2	order dealt_with quickly and efficiently !
0	they seriously need to look in to how they can improve their ordering system as it ' s quite disgusting paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery of a parcel with at_least 00_% of it ' s expected contents missing .
2	refund for returned sink took a while to appear .
2	we had to wait a short time for another flight to arrive for a couple to join our coach but we were dropped_off first .
2	so on day 00 of holding the policy we contacted the warranty shop to start a claim and that '_s when the fun started .
0	they needed me to send them various forms of id etc and then if i passed their checks i would be able to place another order .
2	having said that , this time the price was good and so was the delivery time .
0	called and spoke to their complaints_department who said they wouldn ' t have said that ( awfully nice to be called a liar by a complaints_department !)
2	there is also a little garden just for residents that we liked .
0	huge_selection of products and the prices are very competitive with the other supply stores .
2	i waited 00_mins at 0000 this moring in the cold .
0	as i said this insurance with you guys is a complete con .
0	really helpful customer_services .
0	then i called them again to find out what my other options are and i could have chosen a refund that takes at_least 0 months or a voucher that will be usable for a future booking with them and issued within 00_hours .
2	good initial price but then a booking_fee added .
2	the staff seemed keen that we did not use the restaurant for dinner or breakfast which was odd .
2	hope this review will be helpful to you
2	to sum up , i can definitely recommend printerland whether it is for printers or printer supplies and will use them again in the future .
2	easyjet . cheap flights . you get what you pay for . small seats , & fast turn_around . if money is tight then you can '_t beat them , if you want comfort then this isn_'_t the airline for you . they do " what it says on the tin ", nothing more . having said that crew were bright & chirpy , & helpful .
2	the hdd is also very noisy compared to the previous machines i have ordered from pcspecialist .
2	i have heard from neighbours and a family_members the same situation happened with them with sofa works and they have had to wait several weeks after arranged delivery date for their sofa to arrive .
2	well a tale of two properties here .
0	after trying a few_times i managed to get some and enter my details and paypal details , only after i had completed this the web_page then came up the tickets were no_longer available .
2	they have my utmost_confidence !
0	they couldn ' t understand the original fault with my phone so instead replaced the circuit board which hasn ' t helped the problem at all .
0	what a s !!!!
2	£_000 is low and it shows in the quality of the prorider scooter which is low grade in design & finish .
0	i called every week since december and i think i spoke at_least once with every_single_person that works in customer_service / fault department / cancellation departments .
2	the downside was that the rod didn_'_t arrive in the time that was promised and it was quite some time after when it did eventually arrive .
0	i done all the hard work , the hotel were happy to move the booking no problem .
2	first time completed your questionaaire - was returned not enough information askd to complete it again .
0	fast forward 0 weeks and i got a text from t - mobile saying they ' ve been trying to contact me and this is the last chance to pay my bill .
0	this site was suggested to me by a friend and the amount of trouble i had putting in my information and making_sure everything was correct almost made me not order from here .
0	now i kind of expect it ' ll take a while and order way before i run out .
0	tried to order from vet medic and set_up an account .
2	the worst part was that the smoking area was right outside the entrance so we had to run the gauntlet of smokers to get in / out - not what you want in your best clothes .
2	i told him to send the package back to amazon !
2	i '_ve used ebay for several_years .
2	then when they sent out the missing order they used an unknown delivery company called ' hermes ' who failed to deliver the item !
0	i explained i had bought the ticket from viagogo and he went off to speak to ' ticketing ' at the venue for about 00_minutes , which left me there waiting before he eventually came back and told me that my ticket was fine and i was allowed in .
2	very impressive i thought , then a text and another email_telling_me the date and time to expect my goods and that if this was not convenient please arrange a different time .
0	we never were able to get any refund on the service that we had experienced .
0	d ' où mon inquiétude .
2	i switched my electricity supply from scottish_power to isupply energy on 00 november .
0	update !
0	im offered an_alternative and assured they will be a suitable match to the new tyres purchased previously .
0	at that time the time limit for unlock was 00 business days .
0	it so happened dutch klm experienced had problems with the plane and we were re - booked for a direct flight with ba the same day at approximately 00 : 00 the afternoon .
0	my wife got an ugly necklace as a present from her grandma .
0	polite cabin_crew otherwise but bland food .
2	0 hours passed and guess_what . no call !
0	the site ' s easy to use , has heaps of information , no booking_fees -- i ' ve been very happy using the site and will_continue to do so when looking for a hostel in the future !
0	it all seems quite a lengthy time process !!
0	habituellement la réponse du service client est immédiate , mais là , au bout de plus d ' une semaine et 0 emails , aucune nouvelle .
2	well_done for redeeming yourself serenata .
0	i clearly hadn ' t left the warehouse within 0 minutes when i was ordering at 00 : 00 at night !)
0	cheapest by_far of any retailers .
0	emails for when my phone arrived with them and was tested are good , meaning you are kept in the loop .
0	tracking_system is amazing too , you don ' t need to worry what ' s going on .
2	they were the cheapest , and the next_day i was emailed with a delivery eta .
0	the glasses are slightly thicker than what he has purchased in the past from a high_street store , but that could be down to the frame and tbh is not noticable at all unless you really look .
0	combine that with the ability to set a price range and filter out low - rated places we found the perfect place for us quickly .
2	the option in previous years to exclude them from cover has_been removed .
2	can you imagine the headlines ' child poisoned by poisoned strawberries '.
2	i will use them again !
0	called again today , i want to cancel the contract .
0	i was paying through paypal and both billing and shipping addresses are paypal verified and have been used on numerous_occasions .
2	these were tickets i had bought for my son and husband as a present .
2	i rang shedstore the day before to find out whether it would be a morning or afternoon delivery .
0	every time i contact them i don ' t get an answer as to where the refund is and get told they ' ll contact me but never do .
0	i waited until 0pm for the money but i asked them why i hadn ' t had it .
0	operator is quite rude , a slight apology and thinks that is enough .
2	lovely , good quality products though this most definitely isn ’ t the company to use for the faint hearted or those wanting a stress_free time !
0	i was directed to hostelbookers via a comparison site .
0	not only is it a slap in the face to customers but it is a huge breach of food health and safety and i will be doing everything i can to get this sorted .
0	when i ' d re - ordered , the order was shipped within an_hour , couldn ' t really complain at that .
2	booked .
2	kept me fully_informed of progress - would highly_recommend and use again .
0	fast price_matching , great freebies , and excellent shipping make this site a true winner for anyone_looking to pick_up supplements .
0	once you ' re verified and get used to the purchasing system which is not complicated by any means , you ' re all set to go .
0	the lady on the phone tells_me i will receive it monday or tuesday , today ( tuesday ) it is still not here so i call the customer_service again , an 0000 number which doesn ' t come cheap on my mobile ( and i don ' t have landline ).
0	i looked up on google the best hostel near the full moon party and it came up with hostelbookers first .
0	what surprised me the most though was the price of the watch - i seriously doubt anywhere_else in the uk could have beaten them in this area .
0	the guides with private_kilimanjaro were with us every_step of the way and supported us physically and mentally .
2	their helpline number , 0000 , cost me money .
2	i used to spend hours trawling websites looking for bargain breaks but with dealchecker you have regular_updates on what is available and it takes all the strain and hassle from you .
2	price was good for insinkerator but until i ordered i was given every indiction that delivery would be amost immediate but once you had my order them i was informed that item was a manufactures order and i would have to wait .
2	goods have always arrived so quickly i have never been disappointed .
0	its ok but i wouid just shop for it
2	from start to finish , excellent !
2	we were mis_- sold brightpearl on the basis that it was a product you could implement yourself without little trouble , the main advantage with paying would be the speed in which it would be done but we could not justify paying £_000 / per day for five days works , even_though this was given at a 00_%_discount .
2	they ended_up being too small and i returned them using the address and instructions on the website at the time and sending an_email to let them know .
2	the company are now refusing to refund me what i paid them despite not giving me any service .
2	overall would recommend , but do your_own research on what is being sent .
2	0pm leaves office with no flowers , having to stop at some florist to get flowers !!
0	i have when been a customer of t - mobile been unfortunate to have received poor coverage on my mobile , however with the recent merging of signals with orange then this could really improve their total coverage throughout the uk >
2	love the site , prefer it now to shopping on the high_street .
0	it ' s cheap , it works , who_cares ?
2	i would definately_use them again .
0	was annoyed that i had to proof who i am before i got my code .
0	i said if you arrange a callback it is polite to make that arrangement or at_least get someone to say that they may need to arrange another time .
2	she rang again at lunch_time and was advised the mattress had gone to another warehouse but would be delivered the following_tuesday due to the easter_weekend .
2	just what they offered - right on time - good price - and they sent me a text to say they had been delivered
2	excellent products and first_class delivery
2	everything comes really quickly & i have never had anything damaged or broken because they pack things so well .
2	anita pickering .
0	they have an amazing range of beauty products as well which is great for a makeup addict like me .
0	the ticket looked genuine but i still wasn ' t getting my hopes up after_reading some of the reviews .
0	0gb free data seemed like a good thing .
0	thus i did not receive emails when they queried my order , amongst the problems ( generated by them ) was the fact that the image of my vet prescription did not upload .
0	i feel as though the frontline customer care let olotels down .
2	i have had a lot of building items delivered , timber , flooring , tiles .
0	i go to supplement_warehouse for all my supplements they have the best prices and biggest_selection not to mention all the free_stuff when you check out .
2	- a ' designer chiminea ' i would say its a rip_off basically .
2	reluctantly i phoned santander ’_s helpline to unblock it .
2	but the down_side was the first guy that was sent out with just a plunger couldn_'_t unblock the toilet , the second guy sent out the same day with a jetting machine couldn_'_t unblock it ( but he had a remote_control ) the next_day sent billy who was the best but was limited as the equipment that he had wasn_'_t as good as the second guy & had to jet from the drain to the toilet .
2	no !!!!!!!!
2	i paid for a ' queue jump ' service but the company had my ipad for over 0 weeks and kept using the excuse that they were waiting for supplies of screens to arrive !
0	then_proceeded to tell me the room was gone ( twin was showing as 0 available and double had " green " availability ) and when i ran another search the room was available again , this time at £_000 .
2	the lack of any customer service , delay in canvas arriving despite paying the extra for next_day delivery has taken the edge of my first experience with this company .
2	regards
0	i mean , the ordering was easy .
2	if you request tesco bank to collect a payment , confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request .
0	at this weight royal_mail becomes ridiculously_expensive , so i looked to couriers for help .
2	meantime i will now have to go and buy my goods elsewhere , which i wish i had done in the first place .
0	i was only told today that there has been a problem for 0 weeks .
2	0 emails later i get informed will look into it .
2	told them in store we needed a 0 hour_slot for delivery in order to book time off - told certainly however no chance you have to wait in all day - in my opinion we were thoroughly misled - would i recommend - no not unless you have your wits about you
2	i was at the checkout stage when i got suspicious - no mention of vat .
2	i would imagine local trading_standards would have something to say about that .
0	my partner brought me a pair of shoes from " new look " on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	unfortunately the airline did change their billing requirements which meant we had to pay early but trailfinders kept us updated and managed the issue .
2	no_problems
2	i ' m sorry to have to submit the lowest rating so far , but i must be truthful in my opinion .
2	delivered on time and by very pleasant driver .
0	still no one has replied !
2	my son andrew knows quite a bit about computers , unlike my self , and when i told him i wished to buy a good laptop for his mother '_s 00th_birthday he also recommended pc_specialist .
2	dear_sirs ,
0	this means when i want my sons judo money i have to take out £_00 , go overdrawn and be charged , just so i can pay it , and pay the change back into the account .
0	if you are in the supermarket and the till breaks , once they fix it they dont send you to the back of the queue , you serve them as soon as possible .
0	perfect price , service , usability , perfect in every way .
0	great website , and i still buy from there regularly , but selling is something i find myself doing a lot less lately .
2	paid £_000 for a 00gb iphone_0s sim free .
2	ordered friday and delivered monday .
0	i normally cannot_afford to shop here and usually shop at asda or sburys , but i like to try waitrose food now and again so i ' m willing to spend the money .
0	really happy with the phone , arrived the next_day , contract all setup and cheap as chips .
2	i then received a further email_stating that the watch is no_longer available .
2	on the day of receipt , i wrote to advise you that i had ordered the wrong item .
0	i tried on several different computers and got the same issue .
0	i wrote an earlier , rather negative_review based entirely on the fact that i hadn ' t received my order after 0 weeks .
2	plus each time i have to reset my privacy settings , they should just stay the same .
2	0 .
2	great service , thanks .
0	so glad i have one in my high_street :_p
2	well happy :)
2	following pixmanias ' reply to this review i have been in touch with emma and all is well , i would up their rating to 0_stars if i knew how .
0	i dont mind the look but the categories are all over the place .
2	due from my past order i requested the driver went through the shopping with me so as to verify what was missing .
2	!
2	i am still reciving estimated gas bills and because of their mix_up i had a massive bill in jan_0000 of over £_000 .
2	i cannot be the only one fleeced in this way - the beauty challenge customer service department answered no phone_calls from any of the various numbers i called from in the 00 days prior to christmas - why was that ?
2	also , i know breakfast is served at the hotel but breakfast was not an option with trustpilot .
0	i checked the cctv , there was no attempted delivery .
2	will purchase from kenable again .
2	the people at trueshopping were super , and tried their best to help us when their delivery company failed to arrive in time , we waited in all day until 0 . 00 pm and had to go on holiday without the generator we had purchased , and it was eventually delivered a day late , the delivery company failed to telephone before arriving , it was lucky my neighbour was around when they eventually showed up .
2	good prices and the chocolate treat a nice_touch .
2	they advertise very cheap goods that they do not have , just to get people '_s orders of £_00 or more when they offer free delivery .
2	cheeky virgin_mobile has quietly reduced my mobile signal in my local area to 0g , while many of their competitors have upgraded to 0g for their networks .
0	i created a photobook as a christmas_present and was very impressed with the ability to create the book offline where the programme linked to the pictures folder on my computer and displayed thumbnails allowing me to put the book together easily .
2	it was purchased as a birthday_present for my wife .
0	- hidden_charges .
0	now they are adding fees to the account and threatening me with their legal team who will apparently pursue me .
2	not sure that we ' d order them again !
0	i believe that a reduction of that much was unfair .
0	makes it a bit frustrating to navigate , but the prices do make it worth it .
2	my experience with iconic_watches has therefore been a negative one and i would have second and third and forth thoughts before i place another order with them in other words never again .
2	good idea and easy to use website .
0	cool stuffs with cool price
0	** regardless of wether the 0000 number is national or premium_rate you fail to acknowledge the fact that i have incurred further charges as a result of your customer_service department leaving my calls unanswered .
2	first_class from start to finish , down to placing my order and the help i received because i had made a mistake and was helped through it by your staff , to receiving the finished item which was beyond what i had expected , it was fantastic and i will recommend you to anyone and will be a great idea for a few christmas_presents next year .
0	it doesn ' t matter if its to build muscle , lose_weight , stay focused or anything in between you can find it at supplement_warehouse !
0	infact they even display their live ( real time ) statistic on their website for you to see .
0	i got a good price on my ticket , but bad online reviews made me a bit_worried_about whether i ' d perhaps even been scammed !
0	since being referred to this company i will never even look at another supplement company .
0	in terms of managing an account they do a reasonable job but continued up selling becomes tiresome quickly ( esp mobile_broadband ).
0	those hostels came with prices , making it so easy for me to see what was the cheapest and what was recommended by others .
0	we literally paid £_00 for nothing !!
0	i would 000_% recommend this company , they are fantastic !
0	we ' re with bt at the moment , have been for around 0 years .
0	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
0	i think their emails should be more targeted and specific .
0	we ' ll certainly never use interparcel again !
0	00_minutes later i received an_email_saying that the tickets had been brought and the funds were leaving my account !!
2	numerous attempts later & lost credit & finally reaching my dialled destination .
0	based on that i only paid 00_% of the regular price on an item .
0	as if it takes this long .
0	they have about 0 websites all delivering in 0 - 0 weeks and only half the products0 the owners not a nice bloke and has threatened many customers !
0	i phoned today and had the same problem phoning , saying they were closed etc .
0	going round the products are good , good range of choices for a cheaper supermaket , even a few brand_names .
0	i have no_hesitation in reccommending them to anyone .
0	turned_out to be someone from fitness first who sounded just like ali g ( rudeboy accent ?)
2	friendly response when i phoned in my order - arrived the next_day and was excellently_packaged .
0	i got a quote and it turned_out to be £_00 each for 00 of us to play .
2	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
0	they did turn_up with my phone at 00 : 00 , it was a relief .
2	d . kane
0	absolutely rubbish !
0	epic company
2	thank_you for returning the payment and for the polite update .
2	my latest order has_been a bit dissapointing .
2	i had paid £_00 for the tickets there and back , using my debit_card , supposedly saving £ 0 .
0	the price is right !
0	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd .
0	i contacted the salon and arranged an_appointment for a consultation , which i attended .
0	the company i work for also has a trade account with aria and our account_manager is always friendly and helpful , even_though he supports liverpool fc and not everton fc lol .
2	in spite of myself , i keep shopping online with them although i know i will have problems with delivery .
0	the delivery is actually pretty good and i have had no issues there .
2	once again kenable has delivered in more than one way .
2	i then changed the order and was due a refund - this was never sent .
2	but when you realise you '_ve spent £_00 in the last month for four weekly boxes , it is just too expensive for the tiny amount you receive .
0	but overall , i have bought things from them in the past .
2	how can so many errors be made every time ?
2	thank_you so very much !
2	i have discovered today via a competitor that balance optics are no_longer trading but their website is still up and they are taking orders and people '_s money , but have no_intention of for filling any orders therefore do not buy from this company
0	their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price , with the cheapest line installation around .
0	that was , until i got the email .
2	using this company illustrates just why public services often maintain such a poor public image .
0	outsourcing requirements for components .
0	en 00 , og et_par var nærmere en str .
2	most users expect a decent business to provide a fast service .
0	impressive in my standards .
2	i pointed_out that the gloves were needed for a trip very soon and after more telephone_calls they agreed to send a pair but said they would cut_off the cardboard so i could get them quicker .
2	thank_you !
2	just to make_sure we '_ve revisited those bed shops and checked our short list again and this mattress is by far the most comfortable of all .
0	needless to say this was more_than concerning so when i decided to call the spa to make_sure they had our booking , surprise_surprise , they didn ' t either !
2	would use this company again without_hesitation .
2	villa rudi , cala d ' or
2	i won_'_t be going back to o0 at the end of my contract .
0	makes me wonder if i hadn ' t have phoned , would anything have been said to me ?
0	again there was no explanation .
2	have been with flogas since 0000 and dealt_with the huttoft branch in lincolnshire things have gone from bad to worse . my husband has_been ill and had not checked the gas levels so we ran_out of gas 00 jan rag the huttoft number and explained the situation that my husband had been ill ( he is also disabled and cannot get around ) the man of the telephone said there was no chance of getting any gas today as he could not contact the depot as they were not answering their phone i explained this was an_emergency we had no hot_water of use of our cooker without it he said that he was sorry but he could not do anything about it .
0	im told by grippy that there is " nothing that they can do " which is the most useless , bailout of a phrase .
2	this is false marketing as i see it .
2	the shopping_basket had such a poor fitting it fell_off at the first small bump in the pavement .
2	and , trying to speak to someone on the phone . again aha hahahaha , on an 0000 number , they answerd the phone and left me hanging before the call was disconnected .
0	( the phone is barely even worth that new now ).
0	ordered a couple of times and a complete_waste of time .
2	come on sainsburys , time to put the care back in customer_care .
2	i needed a new printer , thought i would give ebuyer a bite of the cherry this time .
2	received an_email the following_morning to say my funds and been received , then a further mail to advise it was being shipped .
2	i wouln '_t hesitate to use their services again and would hoghly recommend them to anyone looking for excellent quality at a fantastic price .
2	the £_00 voucher is not the way forward .
0	i have been using various web_hosting_companies since 0000 .
0	nothing but trouble , keep thining ill try again but always some issue !!
0	haven ' t had a huge_amount of history with them , but they have a fairly good site and i haven ' t run into any_problems ( yet ).
0	very good site and great prices !
0	i look_forward to continuing to use the hostelbookers website in the future !
0	i bought a ibiza 0 . 0 pa sound system which was a real let_down as it was faulty - on new years_eve !!!!
2	would definitely recommend optical_express for this operation .
0	as all the other reviews say this company is definatly a scam !
0	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
2	this is the parcel service to use , 000_% success rate with collection and delivery .
0	despite this , i ' m not too disappointed , because indeed , ' quality costs more ' and boohoo . com is one of the many who reinforce this creed .
0	its too_late valentines has been and gone so the flowers are useless and the day has been ruined !
2	using the chat support , ' john ' got me access to the control_panel but the mailboxes were not there .
0	when they did eventually arrive a month later than promised , they were lovely cards .
2	thanks , dave justice
0	they do have some good writers , but they ' re just not given enough free will .
2	confirmation of order but no dispatch note .
2	in brief , you order and then you wait . one week , two_weeks , three_weeks , four weeks . and the goods might suddenly appear .
2	ocado computer could not distinguish the two toothpaste when both were doing promotion .
2	will have to contact my credit_card company for a refund .
0	bought a number_plate from speedy reg after shopping around .
0	after much frustration i ' m finally sitting here with the angry birds game i ordered as a present almost a month_ago just in time for christmas .
0	i had the surgery at finchley road clinic in london , professional service , very supportive stuff and excellent surgeon !
2	prices take the proverbial and often full of kids
2	many_thanks again regards paul morris
2	i '_ve booked several_times with alpharooms and my only complaint is with the the shuttlebus service .
0	shipping_costs are terrible .
2	the same thing happended back in may .
0	not sure if viagogo can help here but i ordered the tickets in july & the event is in 0 weeks & i haven ' t heard_anything from them since .
2	this is far too long .
2	after christmas0 . 0 hours on " chat " did not resolve this so decided i would visit the o0 shop when i had time .
2	to my horror , a credit agency , experian , used by santander has not been informed that i was a santander customer .
2	they told me this would take 00 - 00 working_days .
0	i have been ordering from supplement_warehouse for a while now and will_continue to use them .
2	i ' m very happy - excellent service
0	eventually we went in , didnt even ask for party name , as they werent expecting us , i enquired_about booking a table as i noticed some had been reserved , to which the manager explained that she didn ' t know what had been promised by hen_heaven , but it was extra for a table reservation and she didn ' t have any available , so instead gave us a wristband each for an exclusive part of the club - whcih she , didn ' t have to do .
2	i changed networks 0 months after purchase and found out carphone_warehouse had locked the phone and are unwilling to replace it .
0	the only potential word of caution is that they get by with no import_duty by claiming the value to by £_00 or so .
0	they rang me back first thing the next morning and that day sent me a new box .
2	it appears to be a good policy but the proof is in the pudding .
0	fuming with rage does not cover it .
2	at_least there was no problem cancelling once i ' d discovered the real pricing .
0	so now i have to explain to them that any extras i purchased were debited outside of this and the exchange_rate has barely moved .
0	it seems like an awful lot of time before i can be certain that this mistake is rectified !
2	dear_sir / madam
2	since then i have phoned debenhams several_times .
2	my husband and i are very used to doing this , being frequent travellers .
0	i ordered flowers for valentines_day , which arrived looking nothing like the flowers that i had ordered .
0	we had issues with our phone line that took several weeks to sort and we were also advised by a virgin_media member of staff to purchase a new telephone as it was our problem .
0	next time i will purchase items from a different supplier .
0	i learned the basics of sailing while on board , and am for sure going back for more !
2	brilliant service all_round , our son is so pleased with his ultra thin laptop for uni . company highly_recommended .
2	complained to first utiltiy , no response until i chased them because the obilgitory 0 weeks for a response had gone way past but all i got was that they were still looking at it and was given energy ombudsman contact details .
0	i think everyone should be on it , there ' s literally no reason not to be !
2	initially sent without fittings or instructions .
0	got bf0 ( russian ed ) for 00 £ it was not instant delivery despite the advertising saying it was , i got it after 0 + hours but i did get it in the end .
2	katriina and valentino ( weimaraner )
2	a present for me !
0	they are a fraud and are stealing peoples money .
2	there was a bit of a delay in receiving the refund but after a reminder from me i received the refund via_paypal .
0	they were a beautiful bouquet , and even looked better_than the picture on their website .
0	yes they do price , yes great pieces . but i have been waiting for my order for over 00 days !!!
0	in the end i could only get my money back through my bank in a long and painful process , since hostelbookers failed to provide any of the documents the visa company requested :-(.
2	they were extremely rude to me when i rang them and hung_up on me .
0	there are so many hostels , hotels , b_& bs , etc .
0	once i figured out what i was doing wrong it was plain_sailing and enjoying the ease of sending all my parcel out
2	after having the opportunity to view several appliances and even watch interesting videos the process of ordering and paying was simple .
0	this is more the brand ' s fault than outdoorgb . com but they could have put more detailed pictures .
0	low_prices and top customer_service ( special mention to rich who sorted the cancellation out for me ).
2	this scam is a disgrace and you should be_ashamed of yourself .
2	hotel was spotlessly_clean .
0	ebay takes such a huge cut , it ' s almost not worth selling on it .
2	double 0 are a reliable company that deliver what they say .
2	ease of on - line ordering and price highly competative .
0	i am furious .
2	so by giving me the money back it in three or four days this is not suitable as your offer may have expired .
2	today i chased them again and they say they have contacted me and i had to inform them that first_utility have never contacted me and the only way i have had an update is when i have chased them .
2	when speaking to customer service it was obvious that they did not have a means of tracking order .
0	we understand that these issues might sometimes arise and that to make alternative_arrangements for them requires allot of skill and patience from understandably irate customers .
0	anyway i eventually got hold of the owner and was able to text his mobile , he explained the situation , but i still did get a few false_promises , but at_least i was able to communicate , anyway after all the snow had buggered off , i did get my tracking_number and finally my item , yes it was frustrating having to wait that long but i also understand they have to be made as it does state .
2	it took 00 days for delivery , when order acknowledgement said 0 - 0 days , and when it arrived the packaging was crazy .
0	the next email says its out for delivery , and it gets delivered usually around 00am .
0	afterward they will tell you what add - on you can purchase however you have already made the payment .
0	after a week in our new " dedicated_server " we requested for login_details and root access . we were told that “ we do not grant root access and login_details in our managed dedicated servers ” which clearly suggest that they lied and we weren ’ t given a dedicated_server in the first place .
0	in the end a wonderful sales agent , simon thomas from the wigan branch provided a solution .
0	in addition , i stopped being_able to make card payments temporarily and when i called up my bank , they said that there was a discrepancy and possible fraud on my account which when we looked closer was caused by the fragrance_direct transaction which failed to pass full security because the addresses didn ' t match .
2	it '_s a shame , though , that this had to happen as they were out of stock of the unit ordered and the next best unit of its type so were not actually able to rectify the problem
2	description my sage_pay refund request by furniture

0	to sum it up , it ' s just market quality crap .
2	i ordered my appliances on thursday and they were delivered on saturday .
0	my bank_account however had been debited with £ 0000 however they claim the macbook has been lost in between their warehouse and the courier firm . not my fault !!
2	whilst i have received payment via bank_account for transactions without_any fuss , i was very surprised that you are more than twice as long in acknowledging , processing and paying out than webuydvds .

0	really quick & reasonably_priced !
2	i have had bariatric surgery and depend on an excellent protein_powder as part of my daily nutritional needs .
0	once they ' ve taken your money , they will not be any help to you .
2	i told the assistant that i would have to cancel the order in that case as i needed to order it urgently from somewhere_else and she told me that i would not receive a refund for about 00 days despite the fact that they took the payment from my account the day after i ordered it .
2	tickets are always delivered on time and the process is hassle_free .
2	this was a replica of the previous order where they were keen to identify exactly_what product is most suitable .
0	i had my first real problem with virginmedia when i upgraded my broadband and ordered a tivo box ( standard v + box is god_awful slow after being used to a skyhd box ) i haggled a deal with their indian_call_centre where i ' d only pay £_00 instead of £_00
0	courses covered all content required along with additional content , not expected .
2	i closed my account with talk_talk and yet they still kept billing me - despite_numerous complaints .
0	the description was relatively detailed , could have done with a bit more on the specific application of each model .
0	i was waiting for the first payment to be processed she came back on the phone and informed me that the prices have gone up .
0	customer_service is also money , they have fixed every issue i ' ve had and always respond within hours of my emails .
0	when i was told someone would call me back in a specific timeframe , no one did , i kept having to chase them up .
2	love the lights ; glitters during the day and so pretty at night .

2	i ' m_sure many of them are not used and left empty , in this case they should still be cleaned and dusted inside regularly to avoid nasty odours .
2	after the last email about how to look after the rubbish bouquet i received i went out to a high_street florist and bought a replacement for myself so i could throw the rubbish flowers in the bin

2	landed at 00 . 00 , got cases , 00 . 00 booked in with alpharooms for transfer and arrived at our hotel 0 . 00am , now i think this is unacceptable for what should be a 00 min journey .
0	they sent the correct one out the next_day , after i rang them , and i have sent back the wrong mask .
0	however the only reason for the three star_rating and not five is that the products build_quality is decreasing rapidly .
2	despite_being in all day , and my partner being in and out ( in her car ) all day , i was sup prised to read on the tracking website that the yodel driver ' could not gain_access ' - were they in a jumbo jet ?

2	all my shopping_experiences with viovet are fantastic , if i want just one small thing or a large order !
2	this company is a joke and everything bad in an internet business , ignorant , rude and offer zero customer service !!!
2	this service is absolutely terrible , i would not recommend anyone buying from this site .
2	later that morning i received a missed call alert from my mobile_phone and listened to a message to call back .
0	fastest way to assemble a personalised gift package at a very reasonable_price .

0	i did notice 0 different sets of flowers with £_00 difference in the price_tag both had the same picture - which made things confusing .
0	as i ' ve states previously my handset was indeed in a used condition and not pristine , hence_why i did not request a " brand_new " quote .
0	so many sites like this look so dodgy and are but this site is the exception .
0	i ' ve been in tears trying to explain that it ' s not my fault .
0	trustpilot are now asking for further verification
2	i asked for an earlier delivery which was sorted_out very quickly .
2	the only thing they do well is take your money !!
0	no offer was made of a partial_refund or other recompense , which was disappointing , and i got no further reply when i emailed to complain .
2	the item arrived on time as advised .
2	i chose to have a blank pc with no os as i had some spare windows 0 pro licenses .
0	just check the size before placing an order to avoid disappointment .
0	generally the stuff is good .
0	although the shipping can be expensive it usually still comes out cheaper_than most competitors .
2	got interest credit back immediately , after costly 0000 phone_call to tesco credit_card call_centre .
2	i looked online and compared prices to other_sites and stores and appliance direct was far cheaper by far ,
2	the day before the delivery , i received a call to say that the delivery was on and to ask if if was all ok .
2	the price has always been good compared to other_companys and alterations to the itnerary have always been promt and fully explained .
2	really pleased with the site i been getting some great deals and with work im all over the country and have found it so easy to get booked up .

0	i did not enjoy my experience with this company and will not be using them again .
0	good range to choose from and delivered as requested .
2	same as just about everybody_else .
2	emails just seem to go into a black_hole and get ignored .
0	i had to return the book they sent in error at my own cost , which i wasn ' t happy about , because it what they sent me was a hardback and it weighed a lot .
2	i was able to have the delivery when i wanted it , the 0 hour_slot helped_me to plan and the guys were great - my central_london flat is in the middle of lots of building development and they had a very short time_slot to reverse into the site , get the bed and mattress out of the van , up some stairs , into a lift , 00 floors to the flat , and then remove the old mattress via the same process in reverse .
2	well he would have had one from us , and one form the other supplier .
2	all of the family enjoyed these exellent steaks would definetly reccomend .

0	will always use julesb over other stocklists all because of the ease of this transaction .
2	something in the paperwork to say whats required before opening the box , or a cheap spanner in the bag .
2	not really quick to assemble but you need to take your time and get it right .
2	the service was excellent .
2	avoid !
2	far better enjoyable_experience in my opinion .
2	having made my order i was then informed that glasses i had ordered were no_longer instock and should not have been showing .

2	free delivery fine , game etc do the same butt game send out 0 days beforew at 0st_class , whereas play send out 0 days before and we still dont get it for 0 - 0 weeks !
2	i am also told that they have brought in specialist resource to look at improving the way they do things from a customers perspective .
0	we had one of our account - entire reseller disabled because they claim some domains within a cpanel / subscription overused resources ( clearly not an unlimited hosting as claimed ).
0	but yet they still sent it out 0 days_later ( it now being 0 day since it should have been delivered ).
0	i ' d buy stocks or invest if i could .
2	how dare you charge for the full 00 litres when nobody can or would risk driving to empty ?
2	i certainly wont return and would advise others against this company .
0	it seems like an amazing site but just be wary and check it out for yourself .
0	pc wold is sucks
2	have taken it apart and refitted ourselves so that we can turn on and get using the thing that we paid for fives weeks_ago .
0	i have stayed in all day and my items have not been collected .
2	gardens0less is a great site for some of the greatest deals you could hope for , supper fast delivery and great customer service .
0	it took two months to finally get a refund emailing them everyday !!!
0	after a month of using it the phone started to crackle and pop while we were on it , the internet was intermittent and to be honest it wasnt worth us having it , then we started getting bills for the dissconnected numbers and charges for call outs and dissconnection charges . of course i went up the wall at them and everytime i phoned i got the line ' we are sorry for inconvenience_caused ' you guessed it foreign call_centres !
0	i was a little_nervous when i ordered my dress after i read some bad_reviews .
0	i ordered some bolle sunglasses via sportpursuit last month .
0	the order was for the following_day , for my 00 year_old grandmas birthday ; no delivery took place and no notification of attempted delivery was left .
0	products are cheap , but there are a lot of fake , replica , poor quality products .

0	without a doubt my go - to music shop .
2	0 months later i receive a letter from a debt agency advising i owe £ 0000 - called them explained i had no contract with o0 and explained what had happened with the fraud dept , it was advised they would take this up with o0 .
2	i got annoyed with the guy , who then checked the account and admitted that he was wrong .
0	another area amazon excel at is refunding purchases , they offer a no questions_asked 00 day guarantee on everything they sell , which they actually keep to ( again much_better_than the competition ).

0	good service over all and very fast , however i won ' t be recommending them .
2	contacted after 0 days with great difficulty 0000 number - told not in stock awaiting delivery ( still showed in stock online ).

2	bugbear : i wish all families with babies were put in the same area of the plane , so those of us without children don_'_t have to endure ( bit harsh ' endure ' but can '_t think of another word ) ' surround_sound ' baby crying .
0	their website openly advertises the difference_between next_day ( 00h ) and two day ( 00h ) consignments on their inviting website , what they don ' t tell you is that if you pay a premium for a 00h service , you shouldn ' t apparently expect a next_day delivery .
0	the down sides are quite considerable and have been mentioned by others , namely the packaging needs a lot of improvement ( i ' m sure that will come , given they ' re a new brand ) but more worryingly my nespresso machine ' s pump seems to need to work a lot harder to get the job_done .
0	their worldwide number only works if you provide your card number but after_reading other person ' s experience of facing card fraud afterwards i don ' t feel_like doing this .
0	easy to book
0	and not acceptable .
0	needless to say that a few items were badly_damaged and dates were terrible . so i rang up my local_store and one of the girls were extremely rude , i ordered to speak to the store manager and he ordered the forgot shopping back to my house and also gave me a full_refund .

2	tracked parcel the day after ( 00th_dec ) to find that the goods had been refused by addressee and returned to sender !!
2	the answer came back quickly and it was just what i wanted .
2	on the afternoon of the arrival , we received email_confirmation of the approx time of delivery .
2	the problem was sorted_out within no time .
2	i found the cover set i wanted but the postage was nearly as much as the item .
2	order received was incorrect .

0	fast delivery to the netherlands
0	work overpriced ( more_than double local companies ), engineers did not turn_up ( i waited more_than 0 weeks and they missed four appointments ) and they were extremely rude when they did actualy contact me .
2	the item was exactly as i expected .
0	i spoke to one of their representatives who told me not to log on to internet_banking for 00_minutes whilst he " did a reset ".
0	so to round off , this is the worse shopping_experience i have ever had !
0	however one has to wonder about quality when the first ring was evaluated at a higher price ( more_than 000_pounds difference ) than the second even - though the quality was supposedly higher .
0	because they dont send to cyprus , i had to send them to a friend of mine i uk and then him , to send them to me .
0	0nd agent was more helpful , he apologises for the mix_up , and offers to refund the money .
0	wouldnt touch these with a barge_pole unless it is the only way you could pay for an item , id recommend using a credit_card though so you can do a chargeback if you get ripped_off from a seller of an item .
0	there was no attempt made to take his details so i couldn ' t follow_up on his visit .
0	the website does not show the true condition of the watch ; i order an omega constellation from watch finders , it was far from the 00 / 00 quality they promised .
2	after waiting 00 weeks not for the refund , and after emailing them for the 00th time to find out what is going on , i just received an_email_saying they are only refunding a quarter of what they quoted .
2	the lady on the phone was very helpful .

0	i personally think p0g should not use them as a supplier .
0	my order was despatched promptly , arrived the next_day and was well_packaged .
2	my review is however still valid but i feel it only fair to note nevadas response in order to highlight that they are prompt to offer assistance if a customer requires it .
0	the recommended retail price is £_00 . 00 so this is very good .
2	many_thanks for a all_round brilliant service
0	overall , i couldn ' t ask for more from a courier !

2	pc_specialist was recommended to me by a good friend who purchased a desktop_pc a couple of years_ago and was able to give me the benefit of his experience with pc_specialist .
2	with the finest quality sunflowers , yellow_roses and a selection of complimenting blooms , this pretty arrangement is finished with an edging of funky green foliage .
0	they also have a daily free game you can do and collect eggs till the end of the month for guaranteed free_spins and / or cash but you only ever get 0 egg which = a spin .
2	but there is no common_sense in trustpilot .
0	i can ' t believe_how fast the game got to me .
2	was very happy with the service , bought netbook for my son to help with his ' a ' levels .

0	i deceided to take a cool off from the site at the start of the year as the chat_host i was speaking too was very rude and unprofessional .

0	so far all the support from cdkeys has been awesome !

0	i know that a lot of hostels / hotels ask for 000_% of the money up front and don ' t give a refund within a certain cancellation_policy .

0	filled the online form , received the freepost_bag the next_day .
2	delivery was great - on the day got a text giving me a one hour_slot when it would be delivered , and it was .
0	they were very helpful and friendly when i rang up so that was great as i was expecting to get some rubbish excuse to try and get out of it so top_marks on that one .
2	the front page looks very spammy , i can not even check my emails or use the search without reading about the latest robert pattinson trash .
2	again i replied immediately to inform them they severely underestimated how angry , disappointed and upset i was .
0	i tried to ring customer_service but the line was dead .
0	i will not be ordering from this company again , their customer_service is ridiculous and their products can be found cheaper elsewhere .
2	fantastic !
2	!
0	i cannot not recommend them enough .
2	ordered online on the 00th_december for delivery to a collect_plus location the next_day .
0	some of the imagery is not sufficient for you to see the product .
0	!
0	so they have told me an order has been made and taken the money from my account and no order . the reason was given that they were having issues with the system and the checks were not being made , surely you wont take a payment form us if the credit check was not accepted ?
0	i then decided a week_later not to cancel i spoke to them and they were extremely happy i was keeping the adviser on the other end said that will be fine the contract will_continue as normal and will end in0000 .
0	i have only ever ordered items through other_companies but apparently you can buy things direct ?
2	i would certainly add this company to my list of outdoor websites as they are brilliantly organised and know their stuff .
2	got an_email this morning to say the courier would come today which they duly did , but yesterday was a totally wasted day when it needn_'_t have been .
2	the company called after i made my order to check that i ' d made the right decision , they then called a few_days_later as the mattress was ready !
2	wrongly labelled ( size ) item returned and customer charged for it .
0	sometimes things are in stock and you get good service ( guildford branch ) othertimes things are out of stock ( including their warehouse ) and the service is lousy or the product is damaged and has to be returned .
2	the manufacturers price was on the container at £_00 . 00 .
2	update .
2	thanks to your slow lumbering system i will be without a cooker for 00 days instead of my planned 0 day as my gas oven an hob were removed and disconnected ready for my new electric_cooker .
0	bearing in mind the contract is 00 months .
2	so , we visited the website which was unresponsive .
0	our lead guide didn ' t bombard us with information , but discussed what was needed at the right time enabling us to enjoy the moments on the mountain .

2	fast efficient service but unfortunately wrong shirt sent it didn_'_t even match the shirt on the delivery note .
0	after writing a few more angry messages and promising to never use / buy steelseries again they sent me a better keyboard than the model i had .

2	suggestion , your more professional opposition have systems which advise if there is no stock when ordering or at_least will email you the next_day .
0	the delivery came on the right time but only with wrong_size .
2	never in my life experienced_such bad service or poor attitude .
2	however , the items i ordered were received by me the next_day .
0	0 weeks and 0 follow_up calls later , and i ' m still unable to make online payments ( the form said it would take 0 - 0 working_days ).
2	at the same time , i don_'_t get too many cold calls and have never had a real nuisance call .
2	ok it '_s easy and worthwhile going via their site to do purchases and get the credits , but a bit of a hassle actually trying to get " cash " back .
2	each extra transaction attracts a charge upon tesco from the card_issuer so they actually ended_up making less money than they would have done if they didn_'_t have the silly rule in the first place !
0	gear0music is a great company where i have always purchased my music equipment from , and will_continue to buy from them in the future .
2	we have had similar problems with our broadband ( very slow speeds ) which was also with them .
2	room for improvement in your processing times .

0	after giving up on trying to communicate the inconvenience to cpw i unfortunately decided to write up a letter of rejection ( after about 0 phone_calls & 0 store visits ) asking for a full_refund ( as_opposed to a better loan phone or replacement ) which will be with cpw soon .
2	ordered many items over bank_holiday and reserved online , said to collect on sunday 00 / 0 / 00 , however store closed when i arrived . so i then went and placed order online only to find now my account debited and no items received , they gave very poor excuse saying " problems with web orders " be warned do not purchase from the homebase website . will now be taking up refund to my card thru my credit_card_provider , simply unacceptable customer service .
0	surprised ?
0	i am really out of pocket due to the inflexibility of this old_fashioned insurance offered by trailfinders and it has quite put me off them .
0	i ' ve recently set_up a standard business account , but despite having another business account and 0 personal accounts already with hsbc , the process was far from smooth .

0	before i finish , i just remembered that on my last order which had items ' out - of - stock ', the items were refunded ( as i requested ) but the refund was issued by cash enclosed inside an envelope - which i think speaks_volumes about their professionalism , or lack of .
0	daniel was open and honest about the mistake and even upgraded my order to special deliver as soon as the watch that i had ordered arrived with them .
0	busuu lacks in one major area which is grammar lessons .
0	the price is very competitive , however , when i arrived in cancun , there was no driver with a large sign waiting .
0	today , 00 / 0 / 00 , still nothing received so i checked the tracking online and nothing was found so i called up and was told that the order placed last_week did not go through properly at their end and i ' ll need to go back online an re - order .
2	in addition , its prices are comparable with the cheapest ( for genuine goods ) on ebay .
0	this course was so easy to access and complete , everything is given to you and you don ' t need to search for materials .

2	great products back by outstanding service .
2	was horrified to find that two payments had been taken for my recent order to hungry_house , now yes e_- mail of apology sent to me explaining it would be back in my account in 0 working_days but i am on income support & on a very limited_budget so to treat_myself to a take away is a rarity and of real importance to me as in quality of food and service as i don_'_t have money to waste !!!
2	talk_talk tried to charge me for the four months beyond my last usage of their service and in the end i have paid two of the four months having had threats of sending debt_collectors to my home .

0	great service !
0	i have always been one to hunt around for the best deal but nearly all of the time coolblades has the lowest_price_tag .
2	however , if this company wishes to achieve as they themselves say , ' 000_% customer_satisfaction ' they need to be far more open and honest about who they are , where they are , and exactly_what the product they are selling is .
2	i urge_anyone_thinking_about joining ee , save your money and go_elsewhere they are a complete digrace ; i have complained to ofcom and will be contacting_trading_standards first thing on monday - i would actually like a full_refund of my credit so i don_'_t have to deal with this company again !

0	can ' t say better_than that .
2	then after one week i was converted .
0	check out was quick and easy , they first take money out therefore you have no way back .

0	i will_continue to use supplement_warehouse as my supplement company .
0	ordered 0 bouquets for relatives .
0	an overhaul is needed of their commenting system , which is poorly implemented and usually just serves the purpose of breeding criticism and arguments between users .
2	i would defiantly recommend appliance direct for excellent service and cheap prices , i saved a total £_000 by buying from appliance direct .
0	absoutely no data was included in that .
0	since receiving the watch , i have recommended iconic_watches to a number of close friends who are considering purchasing a luxury watch , and i shall continue to do so .

0	små detaljer har dog været irriterende :
0	ordered it right away .
2	it was also great to have 00_hours in which to fully inspect the goods , rather_than having to do so while the delivery man was present .
2	great for keeping in touch and finding old friends but the changes without my choice are annoying , why cant the new styles just be a choice ?
2	washing_machine delivered to where we needed it and old one taken away .
2	i asked on what grounds our claim wouldn_'_t be honoured and one of them was " wear and tear ", so with cynical head on now , i said that i expected that this would be the conclusion of the engineer , especially as the dishwasher is nearly 0 years old .
0	i raised the complaint and to their credit i was contacted back by phone , unfortunately i was told that there was no way the car had been driven fast and that the reduced mpg was normal , i ’ m a professional automotive engineer who designs engines for a living , including parts of the one in the car i dropped_off so i wasn ' t completely convinced .
2	i have contacted the ombudsman .
2	excellent value for money and fantastic customer service .
0	shopto is definitely the best place to buy new games .
0	yesstyle is a great company , everything always comes fast with no trouble !
0	even as i write this now , they are still taking orders on the watch and it ' s still out of stock !
2	before i continue , i ask that in any response to me you don_’ t insult me by saving it is nothing to do with you and it ’_s your suppliers .
2	hand over your money to them in good faith .
2	excellent service i received my dvd_player the very next_day .

2	the other £_00 had been claimed by this greedy bunch as a £_00 ' admin ' fee for each ticket .
0	i will send updates as things progress .
2	of course i have told them i consider their reply to be totally_unacceptable .
0	the offers they have from time to time are good also but you always find that the stores near you either arnt running the offer or never get alot in of the products on offer .
2	my advice would be steer_clear !!!
0	then this should be displayed wen purchasing the insurance at checkout - and not hidden in your booklet .
2	was the parcel even delivered or did the guy just think " screw it they don_'_t really need this ".
0	je_ne souhaite pas fusiller l ' enseigne et abonder dans tous les forums avec_des commentaires négatifs et ne demande qu ' un règlement à_l ' amiable , comme avec toute enseigne sérieuse et respectueuse de ses clients et de_la législation .
2	many_thanks for a great service !
2	this company provided me with a very good service and the delivery was prompt .
0	and deliveries not made on time !
2	the first two options are fine but try finding a specific tip type is not something axminster think you need to worry_about ??????
0	il n ' est_pas dans leur intérêt de jouer comme ça avec les nerfs et l ' argent des clients qui leur font confiance , et_je_suis prête à comprendre que des délais de fabrication peuvent être très allongés , qu ' ils_ont beaucoup de commandes ( et certainement de réclamations ) à traiter et qu ' ils sont débordés .
2	i did send them an old pair of glasses to aid measurement .
2	i will recommend globalwebpay to everyone i know .
0	discount gaming for gamers , for those of us that love to indulge in gaming but don ' t have a pool of funds it makes things a lot_easier .

0	somehow , and i have no_idea how , the order itself just disappeared from the system , called hmv and they claimed they never got it , yet the money easily went from her account . naturally one very p * ssed off sister .

0	!
2	their prices and service are excellent compared to most main street jewellers .

0	however , i then had to contact them about the dog_food that was in stock , and asked if it was being delivered , as i had not realised they were holding it to despatch both items together , & the food was needed .
2	the furniture is lovely and worth the wait .
0	i wish i could rate the review 0 . 0_stars as the only thing that let it down was the fact they had been sent standard post instead of recorded and it ' s unfair to mark it down when they did send the new items as per their website details .

0	i had the services installed and they were fine , however plusnet then had issues and they had a message about it on the phone , they came to check the line and said that they had found an old master socket under the carpets and they need to access that , however we said that wont be possible unless they want to pay the damages , which they said they wont do , they did not want to even send another router to check if that was the problem , however the connection was on fibre and dropped out so many_times that i was unable to use the net , so i went to orange ,

2	the hotel has 0 restaurants , the main one always serves buffet style food with wide and varied_selection .

2	as i said above their website stated that they had " plenty " in stock , which was obviously wrong , and i ' m not sure the correct item will come with the power_supply cable as the website doesn_'_t give any indication of this one way or the other .

0	the other great feature is that you only need to pay 00_% of your total hostel fees when you book , which means if anything happens i . e .
2	the price was the cheapest i could find and with free_postage that made it a double bargain .
0	it is easy to navigate , yet packs in plenty of detail .
0	reading the reviews themselves is very helpful , because they give different ratings based on what you care about and why they ' re traveling - so if you ' re crashing for the night , access to a lot of showers might not be priority , but a higher safety rating might be .
0	we ' ve cancelled your order ".
0	this is the first time i have used this company and i am very impressed . they keep you informed every_step of the way and i received my item the next_day . highly_recommended to all .

2	could not fault this company way excellent service and first thing delivery next_day
2	ideal for budget - conscious travellers , but don_'_t use them if you are one of life '_s moaners and complainers .
2	somehow people seem to have lost interest on bidding and ebaying .
2	however , with the increasing prices , i really do expect the vessel to be ready on time .
0	all websites technical problems have always been resolved within minutes , and i was always updated whilst they resolve them .
2	will_definately_use again .
2	very very slow delivery and thank_god i have amazon_prime .
2	so a very good company to deal with , thank_you rich .
2	absolutely disgusting !!
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending viovet .
0	they have everything i am looking for .
0	i repeatedly tried to contact the courier with no luck .
0	they seem to answer peoples questions on there and have a great customer support .
0	not much more to say other than i will buy from them again .
0	i had no clue about what had happened about the review order as i have no option to take any print out of it from the website after the booking .
0	it was the best price i could find at £_00 . 00 and arrived in four days .

2	after trying to implement we came_across numerous issues and raised tickets which went_unanswered and were later told that ticket system was not there for implementation issues and we should have opted for paid implementation .
2	so i have wasted money .
0	slightly annoyed with the courier as they left the parcel outside our door , no attempt made to ring the doorbell or knock on the door .
2	woolovers tell me that this is why it was a ' second ' but that '_s not what the website says !
0	they need to do proper stock checks - idiots , staff unhelpful and lack knowledge !
0	guess_what ?.
0	+ their internet speed and coverage just dreadful .
0	as my wife and i work full time i paid the extra money for the tv to be delivered on the saturday .
2	overall it would have to be price that bought me back as after_reading other comments i suspect that many more_expensive items that are advertised as in stock are actually only ordered from the suppliers after receiving payment from the buyer . maybe i ' m wrong but it seems that many other buyers have had a similar experience .
2	i have purchased toppers before so i feel qualified to comment on this one .
0	competitions , free deliveries ( certain_amount of posts ), help and advice from the staff via the forums .
2	great price , but . they took about 0 weeks to come , and then they werent the right fitting .
0	called hovells to check the website was correct and was told it was in stock .
2	i used boiler_juice several_times now , i use it simply cause its the easy way to get fairly cheap oil . i know by ring around i can get it cheaper . but normally with group discount etc it works out about the same .
2	this is a great site , easy to use and has most things you need .
0	my first experience with this company was quiete shocking .
2	the sooner this bunch of jokers are sold to a competent company the better .
2	i contacted very and was told they were sorry the item was not as expected and offered me 00_%_off but i would have to keep it !
2	ordered a petzl attache 0d carabiner .
0	after 0 emails to customer_services and 0 months on i am still_waiting on my product i paid for .
0	they need to see almost perfect english / german / italian / whatever the language may be , if not it can be very easy to get confused .
2	they have not replied .
0	prices are fairer than fair , and most_importantly , the staff are honest and know what they are talking_about . meaning you don ' t get fobbed_off with some piece of crap instrument that ' s clogging up warehouse space .
0	the casing is not dry with beads falling_off and the pink shimmering powder stained my pants and hands .
2	today the parcel arrived on time .
0	where have you been all my life
2	i thought " great , i should get it by friday or saturday at_least " and nothing could go_wrong right ?
2	when it arrived it was well_packed and there was no damage but windows 0 would not load after several_attempts so i had to do a clean install . since then things have been fine .
2	in summary , products seem fine and cheap .
2	that said , i will always check them out first because they are usually cheapest ( need to check quality sometimes though ).
0	we have used sky and virgin and from my experiences with both , i would highly_recommend sky over virgin_media any day of the week .
0	but if there is no tires available in stock , they should inform about that on website , not jusk ask you to pay for what they haven ' t actually got .
2	so in summary - everything_went well and swiftly until the delivery company made a complete mess of it .
0	i first thought the " gold package " includes " registered office service " therefore they will forward the important document to me free of charge , but apparently when i fill in the details they ask if i want to use their redirect services otherwise my residential address will be shown as the services address .
2	alors soyez tres prudent en louant un vehicule surtout chez eux ,
2	i was telephoned on monday to confirm delivery on tuesday , no online_retailer has ever done this before .
0	helt suveren service , og meget gode_priser !
2	through car del mar booked with avis who had a very nice med size toyota corolla at micro car price
2	definitely_use for future requirements .
0	no where near the screen .
2	this caused the toilet to overflow as he couldn_'_t see what was going on . if he had a " mate " with him or a remote_control it would have avoided this . after having to sleep on the settee for 0 nights with the smell , a contractor came around ( rentokil ) too remove & sanitize the floor .
2	if you are thinking of buying from them , telephone them first .
2	do not do_business with this company - they supplied faulty goods and when returned did nothing to replace or refund - they dont answer their customer service telephone line nor do they respond to email enquiries .
0	the lungo pull takes a good while longer_than with regular nespresso pods , with the coffee coming out at a much slower trickle , and so far 00_% of the pods i ' ve used haven ' t ejected properly , leaving the nespresso machine flashing its lights in protest !
2	more than 00 days after_placing an order it still_hasn_'_t arrived yet i have been charged twice for the same item .
0	the battery stopped holding a charge just after 0 weeks .
2	the window i was given was from 0am to 0pm ( even_though it says 0pm if you go to the " track my order " page ).
2	so , i immediately reminded them that new and better smart phones coming out every few_months .
0	i love the ebay concept and making pocket money from the site is always great .
2	0nd phone_call to find out why it hadn_'_t happened - was told puk had been requested but transfer had not been actioned ; was promised the transfer of credit and number would be done within 00_hours .
0	for a company that tell lies in their website -: 00 . 00_% uptime , " our cloud platform enables us to deliver a totally unlimited reseller hosting_package with no limits or restrictions ."
2	a table and chairs and a jacuzzi .
0	!
0	£ 0000 . money most definately not well spent .
0	their products are a great quality and value .
2	had a thief smash my window this afternoon , i called my insurance who said i must use autoglass .
2	i bought a netgear wireless range extender .
0	be sure to send your phone as special delivery as this covers you up to £_000 .
0	the images on the website were detailed enough to get a good impression of what the glasses looked like .
0	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
2	don_'_t bother with this company .
2	some curriers practically throw the parcels at you and then hurry off but not this man , he made sure i got the parcel in my house ok and commented on the traffic in the street ( building site over the road and road surfacing being done so lots of delivery wagons .
2	very happy to recommend to others and will_certainly be back for more .
2	i have found both the service and support from seiretto first_class .
0	thanks for a great shopping_experience !
2	i love their products and their animal paks price cannot be beat !
2	i ordered a samsung camera as a gift for christmas and it arrived within the specified lead time ( shipped direct from hong_kong ) but with the wrong plug on the battery_charger - it had a european plug instead of the uk one .
2	delivery was fast and everything was in good order , for an excellent price .
0	there was no requirement to sign .
0	got a call back from a manager on the day we ad a chat about what went wrong and the company then shipped my order for next_day delivery which did arrive on time thankfully hopefully the incident i referred to in the paragraph above is a blip and a one off incident as the company appear to have fixed their customer_service . issues
2	they look great on the car so i ' m very pleased .
0	during this entire time , they were still accepting orders on the watch i ordered which is what i find most disturbing .
0	beware of wanna be topdog web_hosting company .
0	i chose to get payment by bank_transfer and it showed up two days after they received my phone .
0	!
0	i used to use ebay all the time , but it appears nowadays the majority of auctions are set by companies and ebay businesses .
2	found celebrity cruises much_better value for money and nicer shp
2	now i am saving up for some of their goose_down pillows !
2	i '_ve found cpc very handy for those normally hard to find gizmos and gadgets that i use for both work and personal use .
0	i never had a worse experience with a booking system !
0	however , after another email to nicecans , they replied_saying they were very sorry and that they ' d been overwhelmed with how many orders they ' d got and they were really sorry that they hadn ' t got in touch before .
0	i will probably use the website again .
0	hostels are not that easy to find and in general the number of clicks required to get done with booking are more_than competing sites like hostelbookers
2	ordered a ergo - tek mesh manager chair lunchtime yesterday .
0	not the 00 red_roses i had paid for , but three roses and a handful of carnations .
0	i ordered an item from amazon on saturday and chose the free super_saver delivery option . on sunday i got an_email_stating that the item had been dispatched to yodel for delivery and i should expect to receive my item on thursday .
0	unfortunately due to events outside and inside their control i was less_than impressed with their service at heathrow airport on 00 june_0000 .
2	in may £ 0 . 00 ex - vat to tesco credit_card call_centre .
2	containers take days to arrive so surely they would have known well in advance but failed to inform their customers .
0	by the way , i managed to buy some extra flowers at the wild heart , at liberty ' s and coated me 00 £ - gorgeous huge flower_arrangement !
0	!
2	will_definitely go back again even the weather was brilliant , hot and sunny didn_'_t want to come home
2	love this site , it '_s service is quick and efficient and also a lot_cheaper_than vet '_s prices .
2	update 0
2	excellent service and excellent products
2	zzzzzzzzzz
0	yes , their sizes are quite small .
2	i asked them why they never let me know about the stock issue and delays , but they just ignored the question and said it ' d be sent as soon as possible .
0	i can ' t understand_why they would scam people this way saying it ' s going to arrive in 0 - 0 working_days for my country .
0	every time i ' ve sent in an_email i ' ve always got a response by the next_day , often just a few hours_later on the same day .
2	however , the case was not the case advertised being a cheaper alternative ( not good ).
0	since i never gave them my card_details , only hostelbookers could have done it -- even_though they supposedly make the booking by paying the 00_% and not the credit_card .
2	always surprised at the quality of the goods and the up to date styles .
2	normally buy the ear cleanser from the vets but with 0 dogs and at £_00 a bottle it is quite costly .
0	had a few letters go missing in the post this year , they offer no compensation for missing items apart_from some stamps !
2	thank_you smd - can '_t fault your excellent products and service
2	however they assured me that i would receive the 0000 item as_described if that was what they were offering on their site , and if it was not so i could return it for a refund .
0	will buy there more because it ' s so cheap !
0	the gentleman on the phone was also very helpful , but a fair amount of hassle all things considered .
2	i used to use pharmacy_0u for a lot of my online purchases because historically they never used to charge for delivery . but now that they charge for delivery they are just the same as any other online pharmacy !
0	quality products and fast delivery .
0	bank is not involved at all .
2	( supposed to be 00 year_warranty ) they have no pictures of the damage and they have thrown out the bracket or so they say .
0	thanks perfume - click . full_marks !
2	prices are very good , communication and delivery first_rate .
2	0_0
2	service very good and prompt , however after purchasing over £_000 of balloons / goods and whilst awaiting the helium ( one week before the party ) only to be phoned to say that there is a shortage of helium and consequently my order could not be fulfilled .
0	brilliant service highly_recommended
0	all the disputes iv head with them as a buyer and seller have been handled very well , and they can not be held_responsible for the conduct of all there users , though it would be nice if sellers could go back to leaving negative_feedback where necessary .
0	sheryl .
2	nevertheless , because 0 ) they are still a good company to do_business with ( i have no_complaints about the purchasing and delivery experience at all ), 0 ) acted swiftly to contact me and 0 ) have apologised , i am upgrading my rating from a 0 to a 0 .
0	!
2	visited 0 shops looking for a certain lamp with no one having the right one in stock .
2	they ' re a business , in it to turn a profit .
2	my oh dropped me off at a course in london and had to speed home on the friday because i received a text stating delivery would be friday between 00 . 00 & 00 . 00 .
2	how could this be when the same week they were still telling_me that no one had looked at it yet ?
0	one of my items was out of stock and they let me know the morning i placed the order .
2	whenvever i find out that yodel are delivering my parcel ( of which i have many ) my heart sinks .
2	as he is unwell , and would not have wanted people to know that this is what was being delivered , he was very upset that the package had no wrapper .
2	on purchasing the bass_guitar , the guitar itself was what i wanted and good value , however the included amplifier was not up to the job .
0	called up a couple of time to have to wait 00minutes for somebody in india to pick_up .
0	now , let me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
0	also upgraded with them to infinity , to then get a bill for over £_000 for leaving the previous contract early and £_00 for the existing hub which i refused to pay .
2	i have had no reply from any of these systems .
0	i would and do recommend aria all of the time !
2	ordered over the weekend arrived on the tuesday !
2	delivery prompt and very efficient .
2	one was a delivery for a fridge ( 00000000 ) where they decided to leave a card but felt they didn_'_t have the time to bother buzzing my door .
0	like the price and we got a free gift !
2	would i purchase from this supplier again ?
0	now olotels have left it 00 days when this could have been sorted in 0 phone call .
2	he said that we must have spoken to a new member of the sales_team ( spoke to the same person for a 0 - 00 month period ) and that the literature should be updated ( which is still as it was two months_ago , today !! )
0	i was kept up to date on my order and emailed details all the way .
0	outrageous .
0	i was told that they could not send a replacement , as they only had large packing boxes , and was offered a refund of 00p as this was the price of the product .
0	i can understand this if size was the only problem and that was my fault , but the colour was their fault , so i think they could at_least have given me a full_refund , even if not covering my return_postage cost .
0	it was like what it said in the details
0	well_done to the customer_service team . i think you deserve another 0_stars .
0	maximuscle please lower prices in order to keep my custom .
0	on tuesday 0th_january i used music_magpie ' s mobile_app to scan a load of dvds and then used the site to add some clothing items to complete the order .
0	very pleased with the service at perfume - click , great value , well_packaged and delivered super_quick .
2	to get disconnect of old machine £ 0 . 00
2	considering i ' d spent £_000 on this machine i was rather peeved that they didn_'_t want to know about helping sort this problem .
2	cut the cost or remove the deliver cost and one might consider returning .
2	it has very innovative design features , wheel removal , handle bar adjustment and folding mechanism are just one click operations .
0	this was a prospective customer who i have since never_heard from and presumably he has chosen to use a different company .
2	my past experience with pcspecialist has always been positive .
2	he claimed that the damage was sufficient that they would take £_000 off the price paid .
0	last friday i was trying to purchase eminem tickets for wembley stadium .
2	i was worried_about something and asked a question via the web_site .
0	all was ok to start with , signup was painless and their delivery company dpd were spot on .
0	from the minute i click send , i have no doubt that my order will be shipped in an expeditious manner .
2	an excellent initial service , easy to navigate website and an enjoyable_experience .
0	i find some of the clothes a little chavvy at times and a bit dated .
0	advice to all others avoid like this company at all costs .
2	i would not have bought from datakits if i had seen all the bad_reviews beforehand , but my experience was not bad .
2	lenor spring awakening 0 . 00 lt x 0
0	item appeared to be in stock until i ordered it .
0	on their website they say that they reply within 00_hours , still no reply ( 00_hours passed )
0	so it was picked_up , and i tracked the delivery .
0	no email was received to confirm this from bowozi however as they advise they will .
0	so after countless emails and a few telephone_calls chess are still claiming that i have never contacted them and that i owe them money ( which they are adding fees to despite their claims of no small_print )
0	very easy to use and straight_forward to use with the latest deal going on .
0	unfortunately , the faqs on their site did not match up with my experience .
0	what a great welcome present for the arrival of my niece .
2	placed order with woolworth for some canvas_prints .
0	0000000000000
2	!
2	the first order i places was fine , but the next one was awful .
0	but this is usual nonsense from estate_agents and you can at_least console yourself with the fact they are cheap .
0	very poor service .
2	delivered exactly in the 0 hour time_slot .
2	my only complaint with lovefilm is that they say " unlimited ", but it is actually limited by their poor turnaround time .
0	i was given 0 options , pay a £_000 early disconnection charge or pay £_00 a month for a poor service .
2	a very happy customer .
0	to tell you the truth when i had the new glasses i decided to put new lenses for my old ones ,, from the store in my home town , and guess_what .
2	done my first order online with ocado .
0	highly_recommend .
2	delivery attempted , we will reschedule
0	never rated a company before on the web .

0	i was then told a few_days_later that it wasnt in stock and would be in in a few_days .
0	i ' ve recently started doing my free games again and it ' s been 0 - 0 weeks .
2	?
2	great site , easy to use and great delivery times .
0	i am now 00 weeks pregnant and have been without a washing_machine for 0 weeks because of this company !
2	since 0000 and at last i have seen what can be done , by good people
0	now i ' m addicted !
0	this company is a waste of space , they leave calling_cards but dont knock on the door or ring the bell , trying to call someone is not going to happen , its all automated and has limited options , i emailed them asking that they call my mobile to make_sure i dont miss the item again , they responded with ' its not our drivers job to call you , make_sure you are home '.
2	did not have any worry '_s .
2	the tone of messages was friendly and helpful .
0	i am an_avid amateur videographer and so to make the best of a bad situation i wanted to take some video_footage from heathrow terminal 0 from where we departed .
2	i just cannot_fault them for their service .
2	my father was then stuck on the scooter which was firmly stuck having grounded itself on its two stabiliser wheels !
0	as stated , they are genuine and exactly as the picture shows .
2	this is the most easiet diet to stick to that i have ever started .
0	!
2	they were great with the follow thru info and tips for getting to the hostel .
0	eventually , late on the 00th the flowers were delivered .
0	soffan kom snabbt dock tappar den formen och så fattades det skruvar .
2	so what happens when you receive a fault item ?
2	leaving the screws loose certainly helps at this stage .
0	scammers !
2	i had to write to them asking about their online job application forms !
2	it was in a bad state of disrepair and needs to be changed .
2	thanks
0	i am told , that they will message the driver , the parcel is on a van and i will have it before 0 : 00 that day .
2	good service - no_complaints

0	the crack has resulted_in about 000 - 000g spillage .
0	get an_email late last_night that they are cancelling my oder as sony has increased the price to over £_000 .
2	terrible service with no apology at any stage .
2	unfortunately late but that was prob down to my local postie not knowing when valentines_day was
0	at this moment i ’ m not convinced that if i was to park with them again my car would not be driven hard as it was in this instance .
2	first prob .
0	next morning called and have to wait for 0 hour and 0 min .
0	i didn ' t see this possible . on friday i checked again and to no surprise my product had not been shipped .

2	i eventually got sent a link to a ticket that had been opened on 00 . 00 . 00 morning and i have asked three_times since then whether the order has_been cancelled as i requested .
2	easy to book , best price i could find .
2	the stuff we '_ve had from graze is ok , no_complaints about quality .
0	i email the company and wowcher , to not hear_anything back bar an_automated email_saying they would get in touch ." great ".
2	they answered my call once ( after 0 weeks ) and promised delivery within the next 0 days , i am still_waiting on 0th_september .
0	please be advised avoid them at all cost , i now need to get my money back ,
0	______________________________________________
0	poor me , so no sale after all that & i ' ll have to go somewhere_else now .
2	tracking it today and the data has_been removed from the tracking yodel data base so i have no_idea when to expect it .
2	the complexities of all the annuity options_available were not only very clearly expained by my contact , steve craven , he took time to understand my financial requirements and objectives in retirement to assist me in making my choice .
2	this is the only online comapny i deal with now !
2	about three_weeks after paying the fridge_freezer , which actually requires some on site construction , was delivered and assembled by a separate courier company who could not have cared_less ( amazing for such an expensive product ).
2	would recommend everyone steers clear of their shoddy service .
0	why ?
2	interestingly the payment was taken immediately from my card --- not good enough i think !
2	oven broke whilst i was cooking dinner on thursday , finshed of in second oven .
2	i have been personally assured that my credit will be transferred and that he will make_sure it happens . in 0 to 00_hours !

2	with a crossing of only an_hour and a half we were happy to sit and read until land was in sight .
0	rep told me yes thats fine and sent the money ,
0	does nt matter whos fault is it you will end up on losing side
2	the short distance flights were both delayed and the boarding was very weird , at first i thought wow this is superquick but then everybody was cramped in the dark tunnel in front of the plane and standing around for at_least 00_minutes instead of still staying in the boarding hall and doing it properly , with back seats first and so on .
0	faaaar from the best service i should be expecting .
2	emailed me to inform me my tickets were being dispatched one day , received them within 00_hours .
0	good prices and one of the few places i ' ve found that sells black dress shirts .
0	arrived on monday .
0	tant pis pour_le_prix intéressant , cela fait 0 mois que_nous attendons des chaises pour compléter le salon , nos travaux sont finis et on arrête de rigoler .
2	yodel have obviously made a good sales_pitch to secure the contract but can '_t fulfil any of it .
2	further to the above apparently negative_comments : an unsolicited refund of the additional postage_charges has_been received .
2	unfortunately i wouldn_'_t be home .
2	my wife and i assembled it in an_hour .
0	the customer_service and internet_connection was collectively terrible .
0	otherwise google would just host youtube on a cheap unlimited shared account
2	we stayed at the kresten royal at rhodes for a week in early june_0000 and had a fab time .
2	no customer service and i will not buy from them again or recommend .
0	these_guys are gonna be big - watch this space @ rorybrown000
2	misinformation was given regarding motifs , the print colour of our order of service ’_s was wrong and then finally we received an a0 table plan when an a0 was ordered .
0	so my order couldn ' t be cancelled .
2	the process was fairly_straightforward if a little longwinded .
2	ordered a cowgirl outfit and two six guns - it arrived very quickly and was excellent .
2	if the review has the slightest mention of a service complaint , the review stands , even if it is illegal or just wrong .
0	i read a few of the reviews and decided to go with them .
2	without a doubt the worst company i have ever had to deal with .
2	!
2	i would not use them again purely because in this day and age there is no excuse for not processing and sending an order out in just one or two days following the order instead of 00 days especially as there are so many other_companies to choose from out there .
2	i have went down this road as it '_s still ok but i would have preferred to actually get " cash " xxx
0	topped off with a fast delivery , it ' s now my go - to website for e_- cigs .
2	duly did and was told by another helpful lady the goods would be delivered in approx 00 minites , and they were .
0	my item was ment to be delivered yesterday which apparently it has been left in a secure place ( why couldn ' t you knock on the door ?)
2	fantastic company , first_rate from start to finish .
2	the first was simply awful and i have an issue with the way in which the property was advertised by blue_chip , this will be followed up under another framework .
2	would use again though .
0	tatiana was great
2	nothing has turned_up and have emailed them again several_times , no response , phoned them , no answer .
0	based on a single order this site is excellent , good price and timely delivery especially given i ordered on a weekend nothing but good stuff to say .
2	in the past you have said that some customers prefer to do it this way , well firstly i have never spoken to anybody who has said that , and secondly , if that is true you should allow customers to choose .
0	autant d attente et surtout de retard , ca n est_pas possible .
0	yeah , really handy .
0	nice and easy to book , very good deal for those on a budget and only a few pounds to secure booking .
0	this time i was promised a call within 00_hrs .
2	one of the best sites i have played on .
0	i kind of doubt the truth of this .
2	buy loads of stuff from ebuyer - always had a great service from them , with absolutely no_complaints whatsoever - highly_recommended online trader
0	i have emailed customer support twice now but still not got a reply back .
0	just sat on hold for an_hour to be told that they could not give me any time scale of when my final_bill would be prepared even_though we left in december .
2	tonight i found it !
0	i ordered the digital version of pes0000 and they sent me the serial_number after 00_hours !!
0	on a positive note your complaints team have been quick and efficient , i just think you should be more selective with who you chose to work with .
0	however i wasn ' t as impressed as i had hoped i would be as they didn ' t look like the photo on the webpage .
2	carrier assumed he was at the right house , actually he was trying to deliver to an unoccupied house and kept leaving cards there .
0	daniel evans
0	there is the only the odd product i will go elsewhere for now .
0	just try to compare sw ' s prices to those found on other online_retailers and around town and you ' ll see that sw is superior when it comes to the sports_nutrition business .
2	the poorest customer service i '_ve had in 00 years as customer of goods & services !
2	bought some picks .
0	will buy from again !
0	not made a claim so can ' t comment on that but the sign_up was easy and they tell you what documents you will need if you ever claim and give you the option of emailing a digital_copy to them to put on your file from the start .
2	kim beadle
2	absolutely mortified when my mother in law sent me a pic of it !
2	i rang the company and was able to send the lady an_email and then order the goods over the phone .
0	while people were cashing in by selling them on ebay , coolshop sold it for a very reasonable_price .
0	highly_recomended !
2	i ordered a samsung_galaxy_s0 on the 0th_dec expecting it to be here for my daughters xmas_present , after a number of calls and emails i still havent had a answer to where it is , i feel i have been_scammed
0	i ' ve purchased suits in store and the customer_service and quality has been fantastic .
2	for example :
0	i then phoned them up asking if i could just add the extra cash to upgrade it to the next_day delivery , they said no , so i asked for a refund .
0	i was told it isn ' t same day and loads of people had also said the same_thing i did to them .
2	somebody was telling porky pies as my wife goes and picks up the tower unit and i plug it in guess_what nothing had been done .
0	after two_weeks from my order , i had not received any shipping confirmation and the order was still showing as " processing " in my account .
2	amen " i '_ve said it ten times along with 0 our fathers and hope my soul has now been cleansed !!
0	stay_away !
2	this site has never ever answered a question correctly and i really do wonder what it '_s purpose is .
2	to the directors of laptops_direct - you need to do an " undercover boss " episode .
0	staff was well prepared .
2	when my phone needed repair , it was astonishingly expensive , and my queries about why were ignored .
2	from that date non of my bills have been accurate and i found out that my gas smart_meter has not in fact has ever worked since i had it and i have been receiving estimated bills .
2	the gun case was as i hoped , and it was packed very securely in bubble_wrap and corrugated cardboard , so arrived in perfect_condition .
2	i have ordered much over the years and will again , but i am miffed that i ordered a guitar for next_day delivery , and then tracked the order to find it will arrive in two_weeks .
2	*****
2	once they have your money you ' re irrevelent .
0	they really need to look_into ways of streamlining this collection process at all of their collection stores to encourage people to use this method .
2	i was then told that there had been problems with their website .
0	the layout of the website took a little_bit of getting used to , and it would be nice to be able to narrow_down the searches to " own - brand " or list by cheapest . but perhaps they are included features i ' m just missing how to use ?
2	will use them again without_doubt
2	anyway , they stood by their decision , not to refund me the quarterly bill we had already paid as they had upheld their part of the t &_c and are still adament that we were not lied to by the sales_team and everyone after that , even james had lied to me within the communications we have had .
2	please avoid this company like the plague !!!
2	!
0	very good product , with very fast delivery .
0	overall , very disappointed , never again order from them !!
0	no voucher after 0 days so i called again , explained all what happened again just to be told , that it will take longer because of the bank that doesn ' t work on weekend .
0	i had an attachment to my order saying it would be shipped when in stock .
2	if only all companies were like this .
2	i feel much_better buying from these_guys rather_than am * z * n too .
0	i sent my phone to them last monday and by wednesday the sale was complete with the funds in my account .
0	thankyou guys :)
0	also , as a result of the image transfer process , the t - shirt looked slightly faded already when it arrived .
2	customer service is also good , though once booked , the hard work is being done by the company you book with .
0	i can see myself purchasing stuff here many years to come .
0	the whole_thing is geared for stag groups and caused no_problems at all .
0	i gave 0_stars because you know what your getting with them !
2	fitted to my printer and all is now well .
2	cannot recommend highly_enough !
2	i messed_up entering the code and was therefor charged the pre promotional rate .
0	no need to send anything to them .
0	i don ' t want either of these methods due to the damage they do to your hair which is why i bought a deal for the micro loops .
0	i was not happy about this so i decided to book it via expedia website .
2	emailed firstly but it was the weekend .
2	i said that i wanted a full_refund .
2	it is unfair that late charge fees are put on to the account even if you are 0 day late .
0	on the day of the appointment i was 00_minutes late due to an accident on the motorway .
2	comfy bed , the bath had jacuzzi in it with quite powerful jets as well .
2	both have crystal_clear waters .
2	the scam that has really got me angry this time is arriving to pick_up my car , after paying for everything i wanted on line to be hit with additional costs of 000_euros ( in case you think this is a typo , you are right one hundred and ninety six euros .)
0	after 0 days i was extremely concerned and had the same customer_service rep telling_me " your product will arrive by friday ."
2	is first direct really a subsidiary of hsbc ?
0	didn ' t hear_anything back so i rang up .
0	good customer_service and reliable .
2	be aware that paying out bonuses is discretionary ( read small_print )
0	absolute_joke - supposed free brightsparks visit who found no fault my end but changed the faceplate anyway , even_though he told me mine was fine i then received the brightsparks bill for £_00 which sent me overdrawn as i wasnt expecting it so got another £_00 bill from the bank - rang up 0 times to be told by " manager " rahul singh that i will be getting no refund or help will billing because he changed the faceplate !
0	again i called and pretty_much started the proceedings again .
2	star or gate ) to make another call after finishing with the earlier one .
2	q - quality of service , second to none .
0	asked why i am leaving and can he address my problems , explained to him , then said i need to speak to manager , gets put through to manager after a 00mins wait , who asked me why i am calling doh ' you called me ' !
0	first very frustrating thing were their emails sent to me in german ( booked flight through uk website , payed with cc registered in uk , gave uk contact number ).
0	this shop is excellent .
2	after more calls and emails i called the oft and am now taking them to court .
0	i had spent over £_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
2	no was the answer they would not !
0	she informed me that there is nothing she can do and even a manager cant help .
2	my main gripe though is the bracelet !
2	we then went through a early_termination review , lol !!
2	item came before lunch yesterday .
2	i stated that i wanted a call today and that i wasn ’ t prepared to wait a week again for my shopping .
2	good company , the service was very straightforward .
2	excellent goods , and excellent service .
2	buy anywhere_else and don_'_t trust the reviews - they are very selected and does not give a true picture .
2	another collection was arranged and the woodshed was still the alternative collection point .
0	the lady said not to worry as the delivery time is never longer_than two_weeks .
2	i have heard staff aggressively effing and blinding on the shop floor without a care that customers are walking around .
0	yodel are a joke .
0	i can ' t fault this dress , i ' m so happy with it .
0	it never happened , i had to call them every time .
2	it leads me to believe they were never sent in the first place ).
0	until now .
0	but this time i got an_email_saying i need to wait a week for a responce . im still_waiting .
0	yes its wednesday so 0 full working_days since my order but as tilting brackets for 00 " tv ' s usually go for around £_000 . who_cares ?
0	i feel glad be a customer of this company .
0	i ' ve not had any previous communication , so this seemed a bit weird .
0	a few_times on arriving at the office , i noticed that the lights were already on before entering ( and sometimes late at night when i decided to pop in to do a bit of work out of hours ) so i questioned the center manager , sharon , about this .
2	the paperwork says twenty_minutes , ha_ha !, no chance !
2	i even got failed delivery messages to some emails .
0	very easy website to use .
0	!
2	waited and waited , phoned the emergency number , only to be asked for directions !
2	the shoes were advertised as new and in perfect_condition .
0	i ' ve seen plenty of cases where someone has tried to correct an english exercise but the correction was riddled with errors .
2	i have only just started to check the amount spent to quantity since i had lenor delivered and realise later the amount i paid i was a nearly a litre down on quantity .
2	otherwise i like quidco very much - getting paid for doing your usual shopping , it '_s win , win .
2	basically dont be conned like me .
0	even the supervisors don ’ t care .
0	thanks !
0	we would not use city_link ever again worse company in our all aspects .
2	this is the first really bad_experience of on - line ordering for me .
2	site stated dispatched in 00hrs and items were in stock ?
0	very pretty
2	a further call followed while i was still at work , wanting to speak to me as the card_holder and then promising to call later , when i returned .
2	another present for me and for more friends !!
0	i thought how lovely they looked online ,
0	first i acturely phoned to check items where in stock and got a lot of help on the phone on the items i wanted and how they would sound ( speakers ) and all questions i had where answerd very well i acturely orderd after 0 and i still got my items next_day cant get any better really .
0	my only complaint would be the added cost to shipping when you select free items , but really it is a small price to pay .
0	have used musikding 0 times now , and each order has got from germany to england in under a week , well_packed and with email_updates !
2	brenda clarkson
2	timely emails
2	couldn_'_t get any answer by ringing or by email from e_- outdoor .
0	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
2	after i refused , they replied stating this is in the terms & conditions that they can replace any item won with another and its not based on rrp , just an upgrade .
2	i was initially attracted_by the good prices however they were great on service too , the staff when i called for advice were so helpful and i was updated with every_stage of the packages progress , i found the products reviews useful and my guinea pigs are very happy in their home !
2	i ordered a top - of - the - range washer / dryer from electricshop .
0	eventually there will be no local_shops for our kids to get jobs , and our town centres will be boarded up .
2	by the way , i am not married to , related to , or a friend of any delivery driver , i have just had a delivery from yodel and found the driver so cheerful that he has really brightened up my day .
2	bouquet was for a dear friend '_s 00st_birthday .
0	this particular client has quite a high spend with me and i may lose a considerable_amount of business as a result of this .
2	i recommend this company to a friend after buying our ottoman base from them .
0	at no point did regus head_office or centre management acknowledge the referral .
2	thanks iflorist - you saved the day and made someone very happy too !
0	if you have a so - so prescription or lower_than go for it , if your eye sight is relatively bad than give it a miss .
0	i just want to say the prices are great , there are a lot of discounts , free_stuff which is a plus for me and the price_match option makes it even better .
2	salesperson recommendation over the phone excellent and very helpful .
2	the dressing_table and bedside_cabinets , were in a thousand bits , and took forever to put_together .
0	the problem with facebook is it keeps wanting to ' tamper ' with itself - which is just making it worse , and terrible to use .
2	i am presuming he was the one that told me it was out for delivery in the first place .
0	you ' d think ordering a simple beverage would be as simple as either opening a can or filling the glass up from a dispenser .
2	sevice excellent
2	like many living in scotland i suffer from an iv postcode which means a postage surcharge when a courier is used even_though i don_'_t live in the highlands !
0	.
2	excellent service .
0	a quick couple of taps on the lungo button resolved the issue , but there certainly isn ' t full compatibility there yet and i have no_idea if this is causing any damage to the machine .
2	also communication only followed when a query was placed .
0	the prices can ' t be beat and i love the free mixers that come with your order .
0	the site was great and the process was easy from start to finish .
0	thank_you once again flora_queen , you helped make this difficult transition in our lives easier and the beautiful flowers helped make our family ' s day a little_bit brighter .
2	order no .
2	i cancelled as soon as i had the first four week '_s worth .
0	0 weeks in total wasted waiting and no headphones .
0	i mean they really saved me a lot of money and i ' m_glad for it !
0	and great prices too !
0	the online support was not very helpful so far .
2	i asked why was this ?
0	first lie from the driver .
2	the first one was £_00 total , i took it , slightly worried i might get poor service .
2	overall i can say from my experience they won_'_t rip you off , its just a shame that when you buy a game in good faith the keys are already in use and its not an_immediate replacement , you have to wait a couple of days .
2	bad for selling because of ebay rules which are highly stacked against you , you need a lot of luck with your buyers as i can tell you that all of the idiots in the world also go to ebay just to mess things up and because that you do need a lot of luck not to be dealing_with one of them and if you do you cannot rely_on ebay to help you out .
2	i phoned the customer service dept and was told a new pack would be out to me within 0 working_days - fabulous - but after making a little bit more of a fuss , someone managed to get the pack out to us 0 days_later .
0	de plus ils s ' excusent , font un geste commercial en créditant notre_compte client ( pas notre_compte en banque , on est d ' accord .) de 00_% du montant de_notre commande ( à utiliser comme bon nous semble sur_le site ).
2	the one time i received a faulty product ( not their fault ) it was replaced within 0 days , no_fuss and faultless customer service .
0	my t - shirt was a good fit and very funny , the best t - shirt i ' ve ever bought i think .
2	the item is ok .
0	before you buy from grippy ask yourself the question " once ive bought these tyres and arranged time off work - will i mind when they dont turn_up and offer me a slot 0 days_later so i can do it all again ?".
2	it was so easy to arrange my tickets for rod_stewart .
2	very quick delivery
0	great to compare different hotels , hostels and etc .
2	overall an ace site .
0	even a second response days_later sounds_like the customer_service could not be bothered to read the problem details correctly !
0	best to shop
2	i think the fees on ebay are way too high ( 0 %!!!
0	rude personal !
0	firstly , they send a lot of marketing emails ( an_email every 0 - 0 days ).
2	what a total load of b *** ocks !!
0	they replied to my first email and said the order had been dispatched and was probably delayed .
2	however having inadvertently entered the wrong dates , i felt it was a little_steep to charge me an admin_fee of £_00 on a £_00 transaction .
0	had problems with an interface i purchased from here a few_years_ago .
0	if you know a place that offers a product at a lesser price they automatically adjust and discount their price to beat their competitor .
0	i love the service they provide and the signal is fantastic for where i live ( in the sticks ) however , the crazy expensive contracts are beginning to wind me up and the repair service is incredibly_frustrating .
2	it '_s a good idea , but the " sell ' em a tiny amount so they '_ll buy more " ethos they seem to have is too transparent .
2	they look great , arrived within 0 days and at last i have a perfect pair of prescription_sunglasses .
0	my experience is very unique and trustpilot has deceived me .
2	its not put me off using them again .
2	review edited 00 jan .
0	job_done in 00mins .
2	we needed a replacement for a dated mira_shower fitting and ordered this one afternoon and it arrived the next .

2	out of 0 deliveries i have had problems with 0 .
0	had a pair of adidas gazelle trainers that tore on the inside of the heel after a few hours use , after returning them i was told it was not a manufacturing_fault and they would not replace them .
2	i got a delivery a few_days_later and all arrived in one package , which made it easy to store until i started work .
0	when paying for 0 full years family insurance - it should have clearly_stated that it does not cover trips more_than 00 days .
2	use them at your_own risk .
2	my telephone enquiries , twice , to a friendly natalie ( there are two natalies there apparently ) who , despite_being friendly , " couldn_'_t " get any information from the suppliers about delivery timescales .
0	then had to wait about 00_mins for the van .
2	appauling service from both the shop and tellysales staff .
2	unfortunately as we assembled the unit we were unable to return it so have had to put it somewhere different to where we wanted to , it is a great unit just not matching as stated , so a complete_waste of £_000 .
0	a good time save but no cheaper_than high_street stores .
0	and we had it upstairs in no time .
2	joy !
0	instead i got an old megan reno , a very long car which i am not used to driving .
0	i ordered a t - shirt in the evening , they posted it the next_day , it arrived the day after that .

0	simple to understand and i have now used it twice so they ' re doing something right .
0	clever service but reward is poor
0	payment was sent and completed the day i placed the order .

2	had my son on as a person to speak on my behalf for over 0 years then all of a sudden he is taken off and i have to fill all the paper_work out again .
2	i did not receive a response to my subsequent email .
0	my pc arrived dead on time and any follow - up queries i had were dealt_with via_email in a matter of minutes .
0	the customer_service has been ok , just a shame the product was faulty upon purchase causing a lot of un - needed stress and dissapointment .
0	crap .
2	i rang and spoke to another sales staff_member [_name ], who said the scooter “ should ” be ok for the intended use .
2	i had to return the sunglassses pair after 0 months due to the outer surface coming off away from the lens , and glasses_direct brilliantly honoured their guarantee for these glasses and they were duly returned for repair .
0	didnt recieve items on day i was expecting was just sat in depot for few_days ( weather not an excuse ) also did not get any information about products arriving late or when i will be recieving the rest of what i had ordered ??
0	not only did they lose my suitcase , but even with a luggage receipt they could not tell me where my suitcase was or when i was likely to get it back .
2	when the rod did eventually come in to stock the actually delivery side was very good as i received an_email to let me know that it would be delivered the following_day and i was given a number to check with the delivery company so that i could get a time as well .
0	sort of like banging your head against a wall and expecting an outcome to pain .
0	my husband used to work for the listening company who dealt_with calls for debenhams who i believe use hermes and people would say they had items thrown over their garden walls , left on window sills and all_sorts !
2	however , prior to ordering , i did contact world_stores by phone , to ask about the amount of self_assembly there would be on these items , and he said " there is an element of self_assembly ".
2	i therefore packed it myself and arranged for a courier at a cost to us of £_00 . 00 to deliver it back to proridermobility . com
0	i ordered a optimus 0 laptop with exactly the spec i wanted but none of the usual fluff ( i had my own copy of windows , security software and didn ' t want a dvd drive )
2	don_'_t use them .
2	simple to navigate website and quite intuitive to work through .
2	so easy to do and arrived within a couple of days .
0	don ' t act surprised when you get your tickets .
2	how this company makes money is a wonder .
0	i explained to the agent that we were a party of 0 and the money will be paid on two cards .
2	if you cannot deliver in the time you say , you should change the offer .
2	i will never be using comet again .
0	love the target deals , but i don ' t love the organization of the site .
0	i became a chess telecom customer through the virtual phone number company around 00 months_ago .
0	i upgraded to a new phone with o0 unaware that they were using yodel as their courier service .
0	looking to add to my collection so i will see you soon .
0	they paid the most for my phone by a good 00 or 00_% i ' d say .
2	i had thought it would take three or four days as quoted , so was delighted at the speedy service .
2	we took_advantage of a brilliant cheap 00 hour return deal to see some of the countryside and beaches near calais .
0	not the best site ive looked at and not many promotions or loyalty schemes like skybet or betfair unfortunately
0	made an other order last thursday money was removed from account 0 hour later then my account on ebuyer updated to items wont be sent until 00th for delivery on 00th .

0	they then say they ' ll write a note on the system and the charge will be reversed ( which doesn ' t actually appear to happen ).
2	cut and paste previous one accepted .
2	i had to contact the online sales support who sorted_out my query efficiently without_any fuss .
2	people like andrea today who instantly understood the problem , was intuitive about my dissatisfaction and made a beautifully timed upgrade gesture to smooth things .
2	was told the scratch could be ' buffed / polished out ' stated i wanted the window pain replaced repeatedly .
0	i can ' t recommend them enough !
2	however i was disappointed that the worming_tablets i purchased have a very short use by date .
0	the one thing that bothered me initially was that shipping to my particular residence was $_00 and i believed this was absurd .
0	can ' t complain !
2	obviously can '_t believe they are that cheap .
2	prices are still the best i have found and quality of items match .
2	if i had been able to find this anywhere_else i would probably have bought it elsewhere .
0	everything was very well_organised , we followed all of their advise and were 000_% satisfied .
2	for an expensive product ( over £_000 ) the packaging ( just a plastic_bag ) was not really sufficient , but it arrived_safely .
0	to top the whole ordeal off they tryed to deliver the washing_machine on thursday but forgot to put it on the delivery van !
2	didnt even bring out his tool box .
0	i have been using website for around 0 . 0 years and i am happy with it .
0	great site to get anything you want
2	bubble_wrap - quick and efficient service will buy from them again
0	trustpilot , this is a customer review , and i can supply receipts and other records to support my review .

2	i explained why i felt that they should be to cover the consequential loss of expenses and compensate me for the day off i had to take and the 000 mile_round_trip to sort this out .
0	when i order from topshop , next , boots i get the same lady , she says hello , we chat quickly and shes friendly .

0	i was trying to keep costs down for my brothers stag_do and thought dodgeball looked cheap and pretty fun .
0	just a small thing but this ment so much to all the group after the last few hours .

2	i would also like wowcher to say what they propose to do about merchants who fail to honour their commitments and then fail to respond to either the customer or wowcher .
0	i was no wiser when it arrived .
2	until then , please continue to pay your account in the usual way .”
2	so basically you pays your money , you takes your chance .
0	had a card from moonpig , poor quality card , almost paper - like .
2	[ original review ]
2	the only disappointment we had was the amount of money we were able to release , but this was because of the age of the younger of the two of us , and a report from the gp which didn_'_t show the full nature of my husband '_s illness .
0	i also just recently found them on facebook .
0	i will not be using them ever again and will make_sure all the contacts i know who also buy dj & sound equipment know to avoid this company .
0	it wasn ' t as i have cctv and nobody came to my house or entered the cul - de - sac .
2	would use this again , highly_recommended .
2	i use illumi to buy delicious meals for my elderly_parents . they are quick to prepare and easy to store as they do not require refigeration .
0	being the skeptical person i am , i was expecting it to be sent by economy post and take a week or more to arrive with me .
2	we had previously had appliance cover with british_gas but when they increased our premiums by about 00_% despite us not having made any claims we shopped_around and settled for the silver package from the warranty shop .
0	its the cheapest way and best way to buy any pc games listed on the site .
0	!
0	after selling a product and receiving payment through paypal i shipped it confidently .
2	eventually got through to their customer_services agents , what a joke that is !!
2	service , marvellous , cards unbeatable , convenience , unavailable !!!
0	i am considering a visit to the premises to inquire on this further .
2	apart_from the helium incident very good service , nice website and helpful staff .
2	andrew was able to sit with me and together we agreed a specification for the laptop .
2	over a month later i have no refund !
2	this is the second time i have used this site , and would recommend it fully .
0	we used the website for the first time to book alicia keys tickets .
2	breakfast at 00 . 00 .
0	it was in cardiff and cost a fortune for us to hire a mini_bus for the day !
2	i have used holiday_autos for more years than i care to remember and this year they placed my business with airauto and the experience was not great .
0	i arranged for someone to wait in today ( monday ) to accept delivery , i received a call at 0 - 00pm and a voicemail saying " oh we are on our way miss . jones we will be with you in 00_minutes " when i get home ( excited !)
2	eventually got through by phone , told not despatched as awaiting final parts - why then email me saying it was with a tracking no ?
0	expedia owe me a refund on an airport transfer that didn ' t show up .
2	on the last occasion , experienced delays with pickup and delivery - required to complete several custom forms in great detail , would have liked to have information on this beforehand .
0	tried it on and it was true to its sizing .
0	absolutely_useless .
0	i ' m on their mailing_list and i got sent some really good offers for free prints .
0	two of my friends bought their tablets on other_websites for cheaper price than mine and got theirs after two to four days .
0	however the account pages where you sell , pay etc is far to complicated .
2	most people expect a bit of a surcharge when they are part of a captive audience but when faced with pricing like this , if they are anything like me they become stubborn and refuse to buy virtually anything .
0	( a night ' s reservation deposit is never more_than 0 pounds for me .)
0	so i was glad to find bclc , who seemed to be well thought of in reviews and came_across professionally from their website .
2	my favourite after shave at an excellent price , delivered on time as promised .
2	kiddisave need to get their act_together and be honest about what is in stock and what isn_'_t .
0	leaving us £_00 out of pocket .
2	unfortunately they are unable to deliver the missing goods so would we accept a refund bearing in mind we paid for delivery for all the goods in question .
0	however in september they introduced a " handling charge " of £ 0 . 00 on small orders , with no warning .
2	car audi ignored emails , unavailable on phone .
0	i still order from them , i ' m just not too surprised if they cancel the order .
0	anyway i am certainely a bit too paranoid about mosquitos .
2	i phoned them and was told in no uncertain terms either pay or leave it where it is .
2	seems that most people have had the same or similar experience with this rubbish , i always seem to be in the area 0 % they reckon they don_'_t cover , now like so many others stuck with a contract i cant get out of without paying through the nose to buy out despite the fact they do not fulfil their part of said contract by providing a service . they do not . i live in an area that according to their coverage map should have an excellent signal , i rarely get more than one bar up on my s0 and almost never get anything other than basic net connectivity if any !
2	zero_stars avaoid like the plague !
2	bit disappointing considering the great feedback given through the trust_pilot site .

0	i could rate less but it has been a little while since i used hmv and i don ' t want to be completely biased based on family experiences but i still hear the same issues being raised , especially with the slow delivery .
0	personally , i ' ve never had an issue .
0	they took my money , and me , for a fool !
2	an_hour later i was phoning them again .
0	however , there wasn ' t even a comment or e_- mail to apologise for the inconvenience .
0	everything went really smoothly and i ' m going to use it again .
2	in the end i had to leave or miss my flight .

2	i have bought a few items from webtogs over the last 0 years .
0	also bad if you have to return damaged goods , its at your own_expense and in most_cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded_delivery so the item is traceable in the mail .
0	customer_service and communication could be improved and maybe if they checked there emails once in a while .
2	easy to handle and move around , very good pressure , substantial and robust .
2	a best seller , and with good reason .
2	the ordering service online was easy and email information and confirmation of the order were prompt and useful for tracking my order .
0	everything that was requested was there and definitely worth the money .
0	the very few_times i have contacted customer_service they have been on the ball .
2	the free pillows that came with it were a real_bonus as although i already had similar pillows they were not such good quality as these and certainly they are far more comfortable as they are a bit softer to lie on .
2	it is just an extra way of making money .
0	thank_you
0	:)
2	the next_day i did come home to a card simply saying they had shouted everywhere , obviously some clever take on their name .
2	why wasn_'_t i contacted and advised that they didn_'_t have the correct item ?
0	we got there at about 0 . 00pm only to be find no queue and the club not opening until 00pm , so we hung around like a load of desparados !

0	placed an order with tekshop000 on 00th_jan_0000 - for sony htsa 0 . 0 home cinema kit £_000 . 00 .
2	over the years purchased many things from oka .
0	stuff takes a few_days to arrive , not a next_day outfit so if you do want it quick maybe look_elsewhere .
2	not a problem , i went_onto myyodal and rearranged delivery for the 00th_april .
0	the product is great .
0	after 0weeks same again ( king_size ), same process waited and after 0delivery it was again the same .
0	ordered the pump on friday_morning and it arrived monday .
0	that ' s why i ' ve since flown with easyjet or monarch !
2	the company should really check who they are putting on the phone because this gives me a bad image of the company that really doesn_'_t have to be .
2	on my experience they are a company who are happy to take your money but when things turn out like those we experienced they don_’ t want to know or help and will then find a way to not refund in full .
0	i order three bras from this company , had my bank card debited for all three , yet only two arrived and a note saying the other one was out of stock .
0	the other products i got were very good quality , the order process was easy and the delivery was quick .
0	well , what can i say ?
2	- £_00 delivery felt like a lot . but the product was reasonable so we swallowed it and went_ahead .
0	good service , my computer was really fast now used the 0 gig . good job mr_memory . :)
0	what else am i supposed to do to get in contact with you ?
0	i could have got it from another supplier for £_00 more .
2	sorry , had real bad problems with their service and when you try to sort , you speak to someone going through the questions on the card , like an eastern robot . moved to o0 .
2	( name_removed ) stated after a few_minutes that the manager was unavailable at this time but she would contact the store again .
2	great service speedy despatch of goods .
2	so the parcel arrived at about 00 . 00 !
2	went with anglian as a respected long established company to have all upvc windows replaced .
2	bn00 0ql seaford , east sussex tel 00000_000000 called to take a look .
2	i needed a pair of prescription_sunglasses in a hurry .
0	thank_you optimax for new life !
2	always very helpful .
0	it doesn ' t really feel_like it was worth the money .
0	facebook should be for sharing with who you want .
2	very easy to order with this company , and as i '_ve said i would reccomd them without_hesitation .
0	but i spent more_than 000_pounds , they didn ' t offer any discount or gift , :(
0	i hoped it was only my imagination and ran to the jewelers nearby .
0	given the amount they gave for my phone , and ignoring the envelope and delayed payment issues , i would definitely_recommend these_guys .
0	however the item itself was new and in excellent condition as ordered .
2	it '_s really refreshing to find a team who care about setting things right .
0	lucky_enough i paid through paypal and have now opened a dispute .
0	they answered a question i had before i made the order and delivered quickly afterwards .
2	all i would say is that if you did not deliver an excellent service , i would not keep returning to your site .
0	trust me , they got it from me at that point .
2	previously used for washer_dryer - excellent also , aswell as microwave ( admit didn_'_t both with fitting on that one . lol )
0	terrible service , incredibily difficult to get hold of there person in charge of service department ( sam ) and all_round bad_experience !
2	however , this time things were different .
0	website is easy to use and find the right tickets for you .
2	i asked for photos as i said that the scooter was clean and had only been ridden for a few yards .
0	if they need more information , is it too much to expect that they would contact me and ask for it instead of just cancelling my order with no explanation ?
2	the following_tuesday i called again only to be told that they did not have the amp in stock .
0	of all the places i ' ve searched for good quality furniture at a reasonable_price , pine_solutions is the best , after my brother and sister recommended the site to me i am now on to my third purchase .
0	0 provides almost acceptable network quality in central_london but intermittent cut outs become frustrating during peak_times .
0	i ' ve called customer_service three times and every time they promise me they are working on it .
0	will recommend to all my friends :)
2	they arrived when they said they would , it makes a change .
0	for two different order i initially got both orders cancelled when i used paypal to pay .
0	the porters worked tirelessly and deserve so much credit .
0	great company - we arrived earlier_than arranged and they were there to meet us .
2	buyer_beware - although i still only have half a desk , the customer service that i have since received has_been excellent .
0	on time .
0	i think there needs to be more originations set_up like this one .
0	in the end it took 0 different computers and downloading a plugin before i could actually order anything at all .
0	it also has limited hotels and b_& b ' s . considering i tried to register my bandb and they said i was out of their limit , even_though the place down the road is on the site only 0 miles_away !
2	thanks
0	i ' ve looked online for ages now and wasn ' t until recently i took a risk and purchased some keys online .
0	i had two packages to send to two different locations and it couldn ' t have been easier .
2	i heard they keep gps logs so i wonder what story the evidence tells ?
2	i would have no_hesitation in using easyanimal again , or in recommending them to others .
2	isme you have no customer service !
2	i still think they need to look at their 0st line customer_services as the standard answer is " it is in the terms and conditions " if they took the time to look into something i would have been happier even if it hadn_'_t have gone my way .
2	in fact we waited in sweltering heat for about an_hour before we set off and received exactly the same service as if i had booked the shared shuttle .
2	one pair was out of stock but still arrived within 0 weeks .
2	i have now put a claim into my credit_card company to get a refund .
0	i have been recommending pc_specialist to family and friends .
0	write letter to head_office in southampton , no reply , send snotty email , then get a call from ' dave ' who sounded very indian to me .
0	i would just like a full_refund now as i just don ' t want anything to do with this now .
2	if you need any information about any movie , it is probably on imdb , regardless of the movie production or country of origin .
0	i doubt i ' d recommend nicecans to a friend or even use it again for something with a deadline , but i might try it at a less busy time ( with something cheap ) to see if they can offer better service when it ' s not christmas .
0	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
2	ordered replacement saute pan lid at beginning of october .
0	a few_months later i order 0 more tyres as the fronts now need doing .
2	i have used this company several_times over the last_year .
2	the truth apparently advanced seen fit ti quote me on the thinking they could make it cheaper themselves by buying the machine that makes a composite door well the machine flopped and no one decided its prudent to me any of this , and into the bargain because of there failure to make it it would now cost £_000 extra to outsource i was offered a cancellation but no movement on price very unfair after some thinking and now 00 weeks_later i decided yes ill pony up the extra , was promised the door within a week still nothing after me chasing them and another cancel threat the door arrived and was duly fitted , is this customer service , !!
2	here is the one they did sent just to prove they lied .
0	when selling my mobile i used a comparison site and mazuma came out as offering the best price .
0	a friend showed me supplement_warehouse a few_months_ago and now it ' s the only place i buy my supplements .
2	cost of phone_calls line_rental etc .
2	if gameseek are this quick with every order i urge you to use this company as they provide great service .
0	something seems to have changed about this company .
2	i phoned them on the 0000 number which cost me and explained that they had the item at their warehouse and it stated the same info on my online account .
2	the topper itself seems to be good quality ( although it hasn_'_t been slept on yet ), and although the service was slower_than promised , i am now happy with my purchase .
2	if they dont like what they hear they fob you off and then pass you to another department .
2	i can '_t afford to carry the cost as my husband is battling cancer and doesn_'_t work .
2	so i have cancelled my order within the hour , and no more online shopping with ocado for me .
2	the package was due to be delivered on friday 00th_april_0000 , so i took this day of work to be at home .
2	what followed was profoundly pathetic .
2	you guessed it , 0th phone_call , this time to the english sales_team to find out what was going on ( again ) - i explained the situation , the guy then read out the message that had been recorded on the system by the indian_call_centre in my previous call and neither he or his manager could understand what it was trying to say , so he is raising another transfer . so it continues !
2	i emailed twice but received no reply .
2	i am so disappointed .
0	no flowers received despite the fact they claim it was delivered .
0	instead he advised me to check a ' which website ' to revise my consumer_rights .
0	i have spoken to a very polite man after a response to this and now have claimed my gift and the other 00 . 00 has been refunded , thank_you would still be a little_weary to use again unaided .
2	i was called back and told that it would be an afternoon delivery .
0	this also included unexpected extra costs as we had received new invoices but they were so unclear that we weren ' t able to follow the changes in the charges .
2	why did this happen ?
0	alertpay ??
0	i only used them once online and that was more_than enough for me .
2	to be fair the product was good and well_packaged and they did respond quickly to queries .
2	thankyou petmeds !
0	no call back received , no email received . now i ' m desperately trying to get hold of bravofly however with no luck .
0	i wouldn ' t think_twice about quitting my job and working for them ( need a multilingual marketing manager ?).
2	the magnets do what is expected of them , and they are robust and powerful .
2	after non delivery of flowers despite their online tracking_system informing_me that they had been delivered , it took them thirteen days to respond .
2	the packing note that came with the delivery implies that the paid for two day delivery had not actually been implemented .
2	i ordered the wrong adhesive but was quickly able to modify my order (& they followed up with a confirmation_email so i felt secure that the change had gone_through ok ) delivery was really quick .
2	it '_s staff are friendly and helpful .
2	ordered 0 . 00 , arrived next_day at lunchtime .
2	i can imagine why the clothing company would tell me of such arrangements and ask for a secure place i would leave the clothing for collection in my absence .
2	he also kept blaming parcelforce , but my problem was not with parcelforce being late just the fact i was waiting for something that was never going to arrive when i was told to expect it before 0pm .
2	i phoned again and asked why i had been told it was out for delivery when it was clearly not and i found i was dealing_with one of the most useless rudest company '_s i had ever delt with .
2	bought an item from their hyde store online .
0	you cant ask for better service and i am very pleased that i chose ipad_recycle .
2	the people i spoke to were polite and as helpful as they were aloud to be and although i wasn_'_t abusive my apologies to them for putting up with an irate customer when their hands are tie by an inflexible system .
2	the package on the whole is great but i do feel deeply angry that i signed_up to the 00mb cable internet just before they decided to choke the life out of it when you use it for anything other than surfing ( what , you ordered 00mb internet and want to actually download something ?!!
2	tried several_times to order one wardrobe and one chest of drawers from argos but the page just hung and i didn_'_t receive any confirmation - well not until i received 0 emails from them confirming 0 orders for the same thing - and they had taken the money from my credit_card !
2	and pushed me towards " love to shop " vouchers .
2	i emailed on 0nd december to find out what was happening only to be told it could take up to 0 weeks .
0	i would be weary of the effectiveness of any close dated product .
0	checkout was extremely easy and in 0 minutes the order was complete .
2	no response .
0	good , but i ' m jealous of the movie deals from orange at the moment
0	so sort it out and make it clear to customers !
0	they looked rather slim and a bit old to be honest .
0	:)
0	so according to her it takes 00 days to get it to customs then once its there they don ' t care what happens to your product if it gets to you or not .
2	took a long time to get the system to change this back to 0 - day free delivery .
2	sainsburys don_'_t seem to have thought beyond the '£ 00 , now shut - up ' stage .
0	i bought a wowcher for a full head of human hair_extensions in march .
2	!
0	i would use them again , but not before trying out other services .
0	and the frustrating thing is often the error can happen just when you need it most , meaning you are stranded .
0	the ordering_process was very unclear since the website states they have stock and the managers in the company are unaware of stock_levels saying that they did not have it in stock at the time of purchase , but they had stock now so i would need to reorder again , he was unaware of how to cancel and order or even send anything out .
2	thank_you .
0	also , there seems to be no option to pay the amount straight_away - it seems you need to wait for a statement .
2	the one that hated it is still really thin and is off her food , this is now 0 days_later , not sure how long it takes to be effective but i think i should take her to the vets as it may even be something_else .
0	no explanation .
2	the service is disgusting as i was told i would receive a call this morning guess_what nothing .
0	another round of testing for 00_minutes ( took a nap while doing them ) and now , no faults anywhere , dont know , let me send you another engineer ( lucky me , there is one available in 0 weeks time !)
0	so basically their delivery times in my area are from 0pm to 0 . 00pm !?!
0	dont intend to use again !
0	all other photo priting companies i have used do both of these things .
2	i am certain that sofa works would have been informed well before the day before delivery that it was not arriving on time .
0	even after this response it was just to tell me the same information of problems that i had reported .
2	my experience with the company was good a few_years_ago and my order came quickly .
0	my rate would be minus 0 !!
0	i wouldn ' t trust anything these_guys say , i also doubt some of the other comments on here that are just being used to boost the scores up .
0	naturally i was excited .
0	i personally would nt use them again , on the website it states to allow up to 00 days for them to receive items but after that it takes up to another 0 days for the items to be processed in the warehouse then you receive an_email asking to verify your bank_details and states payment can take up to another 0 days .
2	at this point , we were out of both items and desperately required replenishment , therefore i cancelled the order , requested my paypal credit and that all my personal_data was removed from their system to prevent any unwanted correspondance , with a confirmation_email when complete .
2	i had them taken out and replaced with ' dummy ' meters but am still being sent estimated bills that relate to the smart_meters removed 0 months_ago .
0	most times my deposits are gone within 0 - 00_minutes .
2	£_000 flushed down the toilet .
0	i ordered two items for my girlfriend in october ( for christmas !)
2	phone query on monday_evening .
2	judging_by the reviews i can expect to receive a terrible service .
2	what a coincidence .
0	no explanation was given so i checked the website and saw again that it had simply been cancelled .
2	it is slow to start when you press the activation button , the lcd is difficult to read and it seems underpowered .
2	what happened to ' breakfast only '?
0	however , this was down to the post_office either not delivering it or delivering the card to the wrong_address .
0	there are videos as well as written units so if you learn best through either option , they are both presented to you and easy to use !
2	the meals were enjoyable with a variety of choices each day .
0	the online billing services is fairly good .
2	i anticipate that the online experience will be just as positive .
0	tuesday_morning i checked the tracking_number to find the parcel was in my area and out for delivery . i thought , great . around 0 :_00pm knock at the door . it ' s here problem free .
2	don_'_t they realise that baby goods are very often urgently_needed ?
2	i have now used shima_uma on two occasions and both times have found them to be cheapest on price , good at communication and fast on delivery .
0	again this was a while back but i still won ' t buy anything online from them .
2	starting using them this year for my gardening needs .
0	but that didn ' t stop us from browsing around at other great deals and hotels way out of our price range .
2	unfortunately nobody could promise delivery in time so i went to the internet and did a search for ovens .
0	i ordered some boots and to be fair they tried to deliver them 0 times ; all within the same hour each day .
0	coolshop . co . uk was the only place to get more stock in .
0	very fast and reliable service .
0	terrible service !
2	i was in the market for a few pc '_s for my business but their attitude has probably lost them £ 0 , 000 in sales .
0	did the job and for a a cheap flight and i had a great holiday .
2	the delivery man rang my doorbell and then gave a knock on the door .
2	i reported this via their online foms , where it is possible to attach an image to show any damage .
0	you will never get answer to your emails if you have questions such as delivery time etc .
2	as others , i placed an order and paid for it , but the have not goods arrived - and i needed them for a deadline .
2	the jacket was in perfect_condition and just as per its decription online .
2	as the shirt is usually under a suit or dinner jacket i have not bothered sending it back but the ' niggle ' is there when i wear it .
0	agent informed me that it should be done as 0 booking .
0	becky
2	it '_s really fast and a joy to use .
2	these are the people on the front line so thank_goodness they are solid , it is so often not the case !
2	this has come and gone , and when i spoke to the agent on the phone , they said they were having trouble processing refunds , and couldn_'_t say when it would be , although it was now ' expedited ' which is meaningless .
2	ordered the hauck malibu travel system ( caviar / silver ) around 0pm and it was delivered by 0 . 00pm next_day , now tbats sbat i call speedy service , it was very well_packaged too .
0	i believe this would help in overall sales proffits , and helping the consumer to find the best supplement for them , seeing how supplements are different for every body type .
0	company should accept_responsibility for their incompentence .
0	except this everything was fine but is not a good attitude for a big company !
0	i don ' t know why i agreed - i must be slow thinking over the phone .
2	contact information : order number :
2	watch shop have great products and i have never experienced any_problems with them .
2	ordered a sewing_machine 0 july_0000 , today , 0th_august nothing has yet appeared .
0	best_wishes .
2	i always send flowers to my lovely auntie and they always make her smile and that smile lasts while the flowers bloom . her smile didnt not last long with your flowers sad to say wont be sending flower this way again .
0	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .
2	the only place on the high where you can get those elusive electronic items .
0	great company .
0	lets_see what happens .
0	they have taken a lot of peoples money and do not send you any keys .
2	what are the children making them getting paid ???
0	some products are worth purchasing trough this website such as the specials they be having .
2	going to keep it in for a bit longer and see if once he gets used to be relaxed he may learn to stay calm .
2	can be daunting on new customers , so best to look into any glitches and not get complacent .
2	the price of the synth was very good , in fact the cheapest i could find at the time .
2	p - price , most competitive on the web , includes postage so no_hidden_charges .
0	but rather_than try to help me , they have given me a list of possible reasons_why this may be ( purchase extras and exchange_rate differences ) and asked me to refer to terms and conditions .
2	over the weekend no one came either .
0	none of the flowers have been delivered up to yet so yeah getting really worried .
2	this is a company that takes customer_care seriously .
2	fantastic company 0 star
2	saying it pushes the payment to the bank - so what ?
0	the major issue i have with the company is that almost every time i place an order i find that when i open my parcel there are multiple items missing as they , according to the company , have become out - of - stock ( or in some circumstances were found broken in the warehouse ) since placing the order .
2	it did not fit me , i needed to make it bigger but there were no instructions in how to do that .
2	as i said in the title
0	never had any_issues with them , very quick delivery and allways accurate
2	in addition they were offering a one off further discount if you entered a promotional code .
2	what a horrible experiance .
0	the driver did not wait to see if the door was answered , leave with a neighbour or hide it behind an available large rose tub .
0	i don ' t want to have to sift through tens of offers to find the ones most suited to me .
0	you can ' t buy everything u like because they dissapear from your basket before checkout .
2	and it is a quality garment superbly made , fits 000_%, is quality material & looks the part .
2	so why post six days_later for next_day delivery ?.
0	they refused .
2	helpful and concise .
0	0 month later i receive £_000 three mobile charge along with a new broadband sim which i never asked for and signed me up to another 0 year contract .
2	gave it a go . and to my amazement within 00_hours i had an unlocked iphone 0 .
2	festive_lights had a huge_selection of beautiful garden solar_lights .
2	so simple , everything as promised , will_definitely_use again in the future !
2	why is the customer service department not authorised to make special delivery arrangements in cases where a complaint has_been made .
2	?
0	the navigation on the site looks good , but makes it difficult to see the difference_between certain products .
2	well_done , fastlec .
2	after buying a phone case from a well_known supermarket returned as rubbish found mobilefun on the web ordered and received , first_class service and the phone case for my lovely wife , s samsung_galaxy its top quality superb service in all department
0	can ' t fault it !
2	new delivery sunday 00 dec_0000
2	why no email , i would have settled for the piano and pedals and waited for the bench to be delivered at a later date .
2	highly_recommended !
2	sammie_taylor helped_me out today and got my parcel sent .
0	a friend_recommended this to me and we both bought wildstar on here for cheaper_than it was currently on site !
0	just a good business .
2	a couple of days_later i had a text saying i owed money , now i couldnot make phone_calls .
0	bit of a nightmare .
2	early deliver meant the washing could be done on sunday and after an easy installation the samsung was so easy to use , quiet and looks good .
0	i used to shop at river_island quite_often however started to notice that the clothes i bought from there ( in particular the tshirts ) got holes in them .
2	they confirmed that a £_00 admin_fee per_ticket is listed in their terms and conditions , that the fee is system generated and automatically charged and they therefore cannot refund it .
2	i placed an order for two items - syringes and melolin pads ( basic medical items ).
0	for the way that their customer_service team handled the situation , i have altered the rating from being a one star to a three star_review .
2	when i called them they said they had issued another invoice and the goods would be with me within a few_days .
2	they ' re not my " mates " and they ' re not doing me favours .
2	i felt like walking out and going elsewhere !
2	the speed of delivery was superfast and the topper was very well_wrapped and packed , had there been any damage it would have been very easy to see before opening the inner packaging .
0	very impressed with your product descriptions .
0	as we walked we saw other groups who ' s guide was well ahead of them and people struggling with an injury .
2	lovely people to talk to .
0	so again 0 / 00 terrible company .
2	so now i need a refund for £_00 to me that '_s a lot of money i am waiting for .
0	may have a professional comedian in training .
0	just waiting for more flavours . i never thought gluten_free dinners where so yummy , wow .
0	the restaurant is not even busy and i have no_idea what the chefs in the kitchen are doing , but a bunch of meatballs and some rice surely can ' t take that long to cook ?
2	i like speedy things so this is good .
0	the call_centre staff are nice ( except the last one , who just sounded bored to tears but then i can ' t really blame her ) but despite message after message left with them were unable to let the driver know ( which a 0 year_old could probably work out after 0 failed tries ) that since they deliver between_0am and 0pm , perhaps they could try any other time other than the 0pm hour .
2	on nov 0 0000 i bought a compressor via_ebay for £_00 . 00 gbp .
0	as soon as i went to check out , they automatically add £_00 worth of rubbish i didnt ask for or want to the basket .
2	would recommend .
2	never !
2	we shall see !!
2	the staff are always amazingly helpful and the holidays are so relaxing , i can_honestly say i have not had a better holiday than a james_villa holiday
2	and before you try , in your usual way , of distancing yourself from all your responsibilities , i would also like to mention that friends on the same flight as us who booked their car through another company , not holiday_autos , were not charged this 00 euros .
2	final update
2	pps arrived on 00th , well - packaged and good quality , so i will amend my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
0	a little annoying to receive newsletters / specials a few_times a week .
2	we all have enough frustration in our day to day lives without getting it from bt .
0	my favourite things about hb though , was that in my confirmation_email they provided information on the best way to get to / from the airport to / from the hostel - which is second to none , we otherwise would have ended_up forking_out for a taxi and paying way over the odds !
0	when i drove past 00 miles per hour , car was shaking and by the end of the journey i had a headache .
0	my order was apparently delivered by the infamous and notoriously crap , hermes ( google it ).
0	i would highly_recommend rattan direct to anyone .
2	i recently bought a briefcase and after a few_weeks the stitching developed a small fault .
2	i received no txt so decided when i was going out on the thursday to leave the wrapped item in the designated woodshed .
0	i have used supplementwarehouse . com multiple_times for my supplement_needs , and i ' ve never been disappointed .
0	customer_service staff are not too clever by the responses i get , they appear to fail at the basics of reading an_email .
2	everyone was helpful , courteous and generous .
0	i ordered a kit for christmas prezzie and it came within a few_days .
0	when i cancelled my contract the person was trying to sell me another one . rediculous .
2	rubbish communication jet_0 .
0	i contacted them about my insurance_policy and they didn ' t even have me registered as their customer .
2	to great surprise my order was delivered on the friday_afternoon !
2	excellent service at a really good price
2	the order was confirmed and payment taken .
2	recommended by a friend as i ' d not heard of scan before .
2	00th_november finally recieved an_email from g0m stating i would recieve the item wednesday . wouldn_'_t mind so much but at the time of ordering they had 000 of the item i wanted in stock - its taken 0 days to post out something that should have been with me in one .
2	she spoke very rapidly and seemed as if she just couldn ’ t wait to deal with us and move on .
0	i ' ve made many complaints to them , but nothing seems to get done .
2	looks_like a deliberate series of delays to me .
2	ordered item for a christmas_present .
2	although there are a lot of night clubs in the area it was well policed so we felt safe .
0	however quality is great and items are reasonably prices .
2	( please_note i do not want my money back , i do not want a refund - i am so disgusted with your company & what they have done today that you can keep it , thank_you !! )
0	we ' re happy with the windows but when we replace the future ones i ' m not sure we will use ventrolla as the experience was not a pleasant one .
2	however , the company '_s reputation is almost saved by the live help , very professional people , all female so far , who have all been helpful , friendly and done their absolute best in a clear and efficient manner .
0	i ' ve made so many great friends on this site .
2	oh and i too think 0 star is too much but it '_s the minimum .
0	and you have spend ages to prove that what they sent you was wrong - emails , sending pictures , phone_calls . customer_service is yuck .
0	keep up the good work guys !
2	my requirement ( for several reasons ) was for an identical replacement and there were several such items on the web including some cheap new ones on ebay , but i chose the tradeworks item as i could get it quickly and with ( or so i thought ) the 00v power cable and adapter included .
0	everything went very smoothly and the ticket arrived in good time .
0	i will_definitely_recommend this to all of my friends to use with their iphones !
0	this happened multiple time , and their manager defended them .
2	no doubt they take out their frustration at their gross incompetence on the parcels in their care ?
2	jm
0	not only are their products great but so is their customer_service .
2	colour was not in stock , but louise immediately sorted an_alternative out and the chair arrived before 0000 this morning already .
2	delivery quick and efficient .
2	i have a love - hate relationship with damart : their goods are excellent quality but the service is really bad .
0	i placed a considerable order with digitalrev , paying through paypal .
2	easy site to use , very well explained .
2	this was the first time i ordered from davpack and i have to say that the service and the products have been excellent .
2	couldn_'_t have the goods delivered during the working week because nobody would be home so i paid the extra for a saturday_morning delivery .
2	they recommended a mattress and i took the plunge - after all , why on earth would i buy a mattress i can test for two minutes in a shop , surrounded by onlookers , when i could love it or return it within a month ?
0	they never accepted that their servers are have problems .
0	i am very disappointed in plumbworld and their delivery partner yodel - if it works , then great .
2	having bought one from 0wisemonkeys before there was no need to go_elsewhere as i knew that i would get an excellent product and an excellent service with next_day delivery .
2	normally i would have given 0_stars , but not on this occasion .
2	great quality goods , expertly packed and very quickly delivered .
2	having said all that , we had a really good time , enjoyed it very much .
2	a great price metal shed that fitted together really well .
0	i literally couldn ' t have done it without him . lloyd you are my angel !!!
2	p_&_p was reasonable and it was much_cheaper_than going to the shops .
2	yes , if and when the need_arises .
2	no tv , no loud background noises , in a rural_area where all you can hear are the birds tweeting and the odd car .
2	it is really good .
0	they have agreed to the refund but just aren ' t paying back the money .
0	quidco are friendly and happy to help with any_questions .
0	i was also impressed with the competitive_prices offered .
0	just to add , it ' s been 0 weeks since them promising my refund within 00_hours and i have still not received it even after contacting them .
2	i would now like a full_refund - can wowcher confirm how they would like me to do this - given that their merchant does not respond ?
0	it ' s now friday and i have them .
0	just another printed note for another customer . no love or feeling involved .
0	i placed an order with precious_little ones on the 00st december_0000 for an east_coast cot mattress , i rang on the 0nd jan_0000 to delay the dispatch due to not being at the delivery address by the time it was expected to be delivered .
2	will_definitely_use simply_games again .
2	they will do their up most not to do an exchange or a refund , reciept or no reciept .
2	they fit perfect , the leather is lovely and soft and they are very comfortable .
2	this is only my second order from pixmania and i won_'_t be making any more purchases with this company .
2	i was actually happy with the price quoted for 0 dunlop_tyres only to be left with a sour_taste after clicking the accept customer survey button after making my purchase .
0	he has put me on hold and i know he is just waiting for me to disconnect the call .
2	an all_round good experience .
0	easy to use website , good deals , no credit_card charge .
0	however , this courier showed it ' s quality when i wanted to return an item also bought on amazon , they come to your house and collect it straight from you .
0	der opstod ingen_problemer , mine varer kom i fin stand , og de var hjemme ved mig indenfor 0 - 0 dage .
0	however , one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing_customers , they no_longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small amount meaning they are no_longer benefiting their existing_customers , who may now decide to leave .
0	i call back to find out what is going on .
0	i will not be recommending this place to anyone though .
2	i have recommended it to several friends all of who are as thrilled as i am as they can now afford the best for their pets .
0	very prompt delivery and very high_quality good as always .
2	lucky that ferries ( both_ways ) were relatively quiet , so plenty of space to sit and get around .
0	this is the 0th watch and counting i have bought from iconic over the last 0 months .
0	paid in full for valentines flowers and on the day they decide to change the delivery date !!!!!
2	0 parcel came around 00 . 00hrs .
0	my advice , go elsewhere for your mobile needs .
2	i find my nearest three stores , twickenham , hanwell , ealing , dull and dreary to walk around ( poor lighting ).
2	if you want sunglasses go hear .
2	so far , it all tastes nice enough , and i feel that i got my money '_s worth , but there '_s no way that three_times as much would be worth £_000 .
2	0 days_later i received a call from an outfit called dvs .
0	sam was a pleasure working with and when i accidentally provided the wrong number he helped_me correct the mistake and get the funds transferred quick !
0	i have used this company many_times , the items i have ordered have arrived quickly but packaging can be lacking .
2	first_class product ,
2	racking seems ok but :-
2	my first impression was honestly i would not touch them again with a barge_pole !
0	no problem , i thought , mistakes_happen .
2	i always check prices with the competition before ordering .
2	we have previously written to advise you that your account exceeded its mailbox quota and that unless addressed , some of your email_addresses would be suspended after 00 days and deleted after 00 "
2	wow a delivery company that delivers on time , politely , parcel was undamaged .
0	i bought a samsung phone 00 june in £_000 . 00 .
0	i think lastminute . com not only have some awesome deals , but they are really helpful on the other end of the phone .
2	thank_you , will recommend to friends and family .
2	unfortunately i couldn_'_t get my purchase to work on my ipad so had to reprocess it on my pc ( due to the online help being offline .).
2	for the first time i see such extreme fast and accurate delivery !
0	best price i could find for my item and delivery so quick it showed up the day before_release !
2	i would definitely_use them again .
0	it was missing all but one type of flower that it should have and in the other flowers place was just green leaves .
0	the trip to riga was really well_organised we had bobsleigh and shooting range activities both were great and again well_organised .
2	i emailed gadget_panda back but was told that at_least two people check each phone received and they were adamant that one of the water indicators was red .
2	always a pleasure to deal with .
0	i wouldn ' t expect this from an established , large company like amazon .
2	low quality service by undertrained staff .
2	i bought a mobile case and received a case the next_day ( very good ).
0	i don ' t know - maybe it ' s just me - but any xbox game i order seems to spin and not run - due to the ' lovefilm ' sticker on the middle - maybe rethink this .
2	refunds against this transaction
2	i will have to think very hard before ordering again , i think i would rather pay a couple of quid difference knowing my item would be delivered in a reasonable time
0	unfortunately , the costume was too big for me so i put it back in the packet ( folded and sealed again ) and contacted jokers ' straight_away .
0	will_defo use this site again
0	good stuff wd !
0	very useful service but customer_service is generally pretty bad .
2	and the speed of delivery astounds me .
2	just a few_clicks and the job is done , if only all web_sites were as easy to use .
0	bodybuildingwarehouse is cheaper with free delivery and same quality .
2	get all your printing done here , as well as other goodies .
2	await delivery of the correct one .
0	however using google translator i managed .
2	it was the best packaged product i have ever received .
2	grest waiting
0	the speeds , even with the firewall and chiense authorities bothering you around , are the best so far i ' ve been able to experience here , plus , the it support is superb .
2	all i can say is avoid them like the plague if you value your hard_earned cash .

0	will use again !
0	i would highly_recommend them .
0	.
2	unfortunately my father has_become too ill to travel .
0	i don ' t see how having the code upside_down adds to security .
0	i am greatly distressed right now because the budgetair company has taken money out of the university account without us confirming the booking .
2	i urge any supplier to desist from using yodel and i will never do_business with anyone that uses them as a courier :
2	finally silicone cooking tongs these are so easy to use !
2	no response so phoned .
2	they even went so far as to try and blame me ?
2	theres_nothing off about offtek .
2	buy with confidence .
0	there are other_websites that are just as good that don ' t charge anything , like europe ' s famous hostels and hostelbookers .
2	i now need to explain this whole sorry story to my credit_card company totry and get the money refunded by them , but my advice to any potential clients of either company is totally avoid like the plague .
0	made an order for £_00 . 00 with an other company and selected free delivery , got email telling_me delivery is 0 - 00 days . then got an_email 00_mins later telling_me parcel has been collected by parcel_force to track item click this link after 00pm .
0	they finally after pissing and moaning about it , arranged for pick_up from my house , as the nearest store is 0 hours away , and i am 0 months pregnant and didn ' t fancy driving all that way to replace something that was faulty on their behalf .
2	have to click onto homepage then go back to check my basket again then i can see the products i picked .
0	will not be using this company again .
2	very good company , would recommend to any one , and will use again .
0	i had my baby registry at babies r us in the u . k , and everything was fine with it .
2	i had a line only contract for several_years with bt / o0 for my mobile_phone , my phone broke so i chose a new phone and 0 year contract in the local o0 shop .
2	we tried a four wheeled rollator which was fine in the house and in town where it was smooth but useless elsewhere and had to be lifted over kerbs and door threshholds , not the best for someone without balance .
2	this suppler provides a fast and ost effecitive serives .
2	thank_you very much .
0	or its off to the papers i ' ll go !!
2	our rep . sally was efficient but i found her unfriendly and uptight .
2	this the first place that i look when looking for items that seem to be discontinued in the shops . no hassle . everything sent for just one price in one package .
2	really good service .
2	the delivery was very fast and the man was friendly .
2	i give them one star because it is not possible to give less .
2	. what happened to the other £_00 you owe me ?
2	he felt that it lacked something - a bit bland in fact .
0	now , once i placed my order my phone actually arrived very quickly which i was pleased about , and i ' m pleased with the phone .
2	hi , i have a bit of girlie gossip to share with you , do check out fragrance_direct online .
0	however the price of all the products are cheap but when you get to the final price which includes shipping / handling it adds up to the same / around price the you would most_likely pay at gnc .
2	london
2	i would recommend anyone buying from this company if you are looking for safety signs .
0	when purchasing on - line however , the customer_service is non_existent .
2	every time i have ordered from next_day coffee i have been more than happy with the service , its fast , accurate and always top quality .
2	by 0 : 00 i still had not received the goods or a call from the store to inform me to what was happening .
2	it '_s not right - they should be delivered by a florist ( not a courier ) and should be open to the light and the air .
0	also very good value for money , unlimited calls for less_than $_00 . 00 per_month or just pay as you go .
0	and it worked_fine , but it has made me think_twice about using them again .
0	it is just not worth the hassle , next time i will just look for deals somewhere_else .
2	i ' d even taken a few_days off work to enjoy my birthday_present so what could go_wrong ?
2	despite_repeated calls and letters even to the ceo they refused to discuss or fix the rattling .
0	i ' ve used cjs around 0 times now , and each time gets better and better , the keys come bang on time or early , and i just love it , the prices are amazing , the time it takes to receive a cd_key is amazing , cjs does it right !!
0	you pay with paypal so you know your money is safe .
2	reasonably_priced too .

2	other_providers offer this .
2	i said it was not and said we wanted to reject it and could they arrange to collect it .
0	as i expected no goods turned_up .
2	dear_mr duddy
0	i certainly didnt just want to put my personal details onto any old website so it took me a while to do , but after seeing 00k facebook likes and plenty of good feed_back i decided to go for it .
0	both are on a 00 day rolling agreement .
0	stay well clear regardless of their deals you will pay more in the end .
0	few orders placed from them never arrived due to poor courier service , however if you dint receive your goods , next will make_sure you keep waiting for good few weeks before outcome .
0	it would be too rude to state what we really think of them .
0	have never had a problem getting media or games for play , but a couple of times orders from their gifts and gadgets have taken longer then the cds / dvds to arrive , and once was not in stock despite taking the order online .
2	i told them not to bother !!!
0	of course noone bothered to tell me this ; only by checking the website myself and having to ring them did i eventually find this out .
2	as it happened the flight was late in boarding and my checked bag was able to be accepted through security .
2	i have already tweeted @ whichuk and @ bbcwatchdog to ask them to investigate .
0	enjoy your new camera kit from digitalrev !
0	so affordable for the amount you get .
2	the guy on the end of the phone kept telling_me no one would have said that to me if it was not the case and refused to let me speak to a some one higher up in the company .
0	unlimitedwebhosting . co . uk will suspend your entire reseller account and begin to play around . for someone who resells , it means your business with be adversely affected .
0	a week has passed and i still have not received them .
0	i am seriosuly considering funky_pigeon .
0	another comment : the website is confusing to use if you want to book one way transfers out of resort as the boxes refer to inbound flights and the wording swaps around between pages - maybe look_into it .
2	the staff were fantastic - so friendly and nothing was too much_trouble .
0	so i ' m not satisfied with your turnaround in getting new games to me .
0	really easy , sent my ipad on thursday had the money in my bank wednesday_morning , seems much_quicker_than alternative companies and a much_better price , deffinetly recommend .
2	bought lg washing_machine for £_000 now on site for over £_000 ahhh now i see why you cancelled delivery 0 times , cunning plan , so i would cancel my order , well that worked for you as you had my money for over five weeks !

0	it ' s ok to say mazuma will send a bank_transfer the day they receive the phone , but if the courier fails to deliver timely then it ' s an inconvenience .

0	to this day ( 00th_may ) i still don ' t have it .
2	correspondence was second to non and the tracked number was supplied so i knew_exactly where it was every_step of the way .
2	i cancelled my contract due to them not being to match a deal with t - mobile , that ’_s where the problems started !
0	i was particularly impressed by their technical_support and how quickly any_issues were dealt_with .
2	i investigated this further and can put it down to the hitachi 0tb hdd having a write speed of 00mb / s and a read speed of 000mb / s .
2	only when my bank intervened did this happen .
2	i was sent a royal_mail tracking_number but it was not valid on the royal_mail website a week_later , so they did not appear to have been posted .

0	i have been with them since 0000 and i can confidently tell anyone to use these_guys .
2	!
2	blissfully easy to access info and buy policy .
2	i always buy from refreshcartridges .
0	the free products seem great but if you put them in and then check with the shipping it will add $ 0 . 00 or 00 cents for the " free " item .
2	very easy to book a room at this site .
2	it arrived right on time

0	delivery time is good or ok .
0	will recommend site to my friends , and will order goods again .
2	at other_sites , i was paying as much for shipping as i would pay for each bottle , but supplementwarehouse . com was much less for both .
2	overall , i could not be_happier with the service and the product .
2	this year bought my daughter a watch that she was thrilled with .
2	i have just left another message on their answer phone asking them to get back to me , i doubt they will but it ’_s worth a try .
2	harassed customer service person was rushing me .
2	well i wait a bit more to speak to the man in charge only to be told we can only offer a replacement ,, oh and now the same tablet is cheaper and to add_insult to injury you dont get the difference back in what you paid and what we now sell it at ,,,,, so i now have same tablet but for more money plus i know it will be going back cos its rubbish and will break again , so i came home made a complaint to their customer service department on the phone but she was reading from the same script ,,,, lesson to be learned , if your buying from them they cant do enough for you , in - between the yawns and the texting their mates , but if you want to take back a faulty item take a flask and a blanket cos you will be there a while , and dont expect them to adhere to the law cos its not there policy ,,,,,, the end ( well for now anyway )
2	i ordered 0 items on april 0 and eventually received second item today ( 0 / 00 ).
2	having placed an order for food and cystease , i realised that 0 days had past and that i had recieved nothing .
0	stems were snapped , a few of the flowers looked as if they were dying already and the arrangement was poor .
2	rapid delivery and old_fashioned service .
0	ordered bred 00 from the site and they gave me a box with a huge crease in it like it was on the bottom of a heavy stack
0	by the end of my 0 year normal warranty , i would have already paid a third of the appliance ' s cost !
2	however , when they eventually did wake_up to the fact that i was getting desperate , they were efficient and the flowers arrived when they said they would !
2	i am getting quite concerned - the customer service officials are polite but can offer no assistance of any kind .
2	by the time the other one had got the first quote to me shiply had sent 0 !
0	we changed provider from scottish_power to npower in november_0000 .
2	they arrived at around 0pm .

2	!
2	paul christie
2	don_'_t think you could beat that for service .
2	bt should learn that customers don_'_t want to wait hours trying to speak to someone in india !
2	after another shop let me down with no stock , taunton_leisure wer able to confirm that they had stock and i got my new boots 0 days_later .
2	they are a quality fast clean professional friendly service .
0	i guess you are working on the fact that people may forget to pay for their goods , allowing you to charge interest ?
0	i will be ordering a lot more from them in future !
0	however when the buyer received it they decided they wanted it cheaper and paypal removed the whole amount from my account .
2	also they hide_behind emails and not on the phone .
0	needless to say , my patience was wearing pretty thin at this point .
0	easy and simple to navigate through the web_site and easy to purchase with a speedy_delivery , would definitely_recommend
0	item then goes out of stock and awaiting new stock .
2	just annoys the customer !
0	they have now arrived , only to be the wrong_size and damaged .
0	i highly_recommend this company .
2	ok , you pay postage , but you will with most sites .
0	the only reason that we did not use sky this time around was that we are in an apartment that we were not allowed by the building owners to put a dish on it .
0	how do you know they are real ?- as it is now , they are real only when they give positive_reviews and become unreal when they give negative_reviews .
0	receieved within two days of order .
0	didn ' t receive product , so emailed customer_service .

0	finally got through in the afternoon .
2	assured it was so purchased .
0	je dis que ok , je veux bien attendre un mois de plus mais plus de blagues , cette_fois je_n ' accepterai pas d ' autre retard .
0	they describe it as being natural looking , which it isn ' t as it is very shimmery .
2	if more companies worked as good as this the economy would soon recovery .
2	customer service is unknown to this company and after 00 years with them i have had enough .
0	yes i would use again but by then hopefully delivery issues will be sorted .
2	we would never use this company again , will never recommend them and will tell anyone that asks the truth !!!!!
2	items are beefing sent from hong_kong , they only posted them today according to dhl for delivery tomorrow !.
2	where i use to wake_up with back ache and neck ache , i now wake_up refreshed and rested .
2	so if you if you find what you want on spartoo do not_hesitate to order from them , you will not be disappointed !!
0	the extremely_helpful know their stuff team offered me a full_refund with a next shop voucher or an_alternative product completely in my favour worth alot more which is what i took . i would strongly_recommend this irish company and will_definitely only use them from now on and will be back soon .
2	we have given up on the courier company .
2	so , i '_ve had not one but two issues this morning with dpd .
0	the agent informed me that she works on a live system and prices can change .
0	so i spoke to ee as i have pre ordered with them too online and canceled as i had the better deal with carphone_warehouse , however the ee person said there was nothing on the system from carphone_warehouse saying that my order had been placed and advised me to speak to them just to check .
2	didn_'_t happen of course .
2	i therefore went out in the morning and came back just before 00 : 00 to find the shed part stacked in the drive .
0	also ordered a fan controller on a seperate order and this arrived in the given time but on closer_inspection i can see that the courier has manhandled the item and all the knobs were slightly bent , again no reason to get it replaced as the item works and unless your really looking you wont see it .
0	look out for their free_sample , try and you will be hooked .
0	i thought the preview section worked really well and liked the fact we could play with fonts and phrasing .
2	is it a plot to get us to give up shopping online ?
0	paper craft .
0	in this case the pump was ok but why risk it !
2	very much the good and equally the bad in my experiiences .
2	you can '_t ring them so have to just use ' chat ' and all they do is rebook for the following_day , which is what we have done .
0	to add_insult to injury chess have ignored my cancellation and have continued to send bills .
0	i ' d recommend them to anyone_looking to book !
0	great service
0	chess are amongst the most dishonest companies i have ever_encountered .
0	this is just for hk , never used them in other cities .

0	- extremely poor reception , call answering and mail service .
2	we are now ordering the high capacity cartridges and will see how long they last
0	poundland is cheap because everything is 0 pound but the reason i only put it three star is because of the quality of the products isnt that good but they have alot of things in store and good if you just need something quickly and dont have enough money
2	they have a big variety of everything “ birdie ”
2	appalling customer service , if i could give zero_stars i would have done so .
0	if you are looking for a web_hosting company - read my honest reviews and make a wise decision
2	i was emailed after delivery to ensure there were no_problems .
0	from reading the reviews of this company by other customers , it seems that all have complaints of a similar nature , and i would highly advise the director to take these issues onboard if they wish to keep customers .
0	apparently the customer is not right at all here and the management is beyond poor and could not have sounded more disinterested if she tried .

2	the crossing was very good would like to see them start there sailing a little earlier each day , the food on board was very good hot and fresh if i have one complaint is we arrived at the port for our 0 . 00 sailing but due to the boarder agency only have one lane open we were late getting to the berth but the ship was still in but were not allowed to board so we had to wait_till 0 . 00 for the next one .
0	i talked to the customer_service manager , called [_name ], she was extremely unpolite with me , asked me : " what do you want me to do ?
0	i don ' t reccomend to anyone !
0	i will never shop with you again .
2	at_least comet knew what customer service was .
2	they process the payment through a company called skrill ltd , which are also used by valuebasket . com ( yes , when i cancelled my order i ordered another camera ) who are as difficult to deal with , saying they have a backlog and won_'_t give a delivery date either , although claim to have 00 camera '_s in stock .

0	i had ordered a bag to send the phone in but it took 0 or 0 days to arrive , before which i ' d requested another ( which also turned_up in about the same amount of time ).
0	that was a good while ago and still no reply , usually customer_services are reliable and fast , so now i don ' t know what to do with my item !
2	the guy i spoke to on the phone was polite and apologised for the error , hence me awarding 0_stars instead of 0 !
0	i ordered a lot of things before_christmas and most of it arrived without any problem , the jewellery i ordered took quite a while and i was really disappointed with the quality , i feel some some companies are making up the retail prices .
2	i wouldn_'_t use this company again as i spent too much time trying to actually get the goods that had been paid for ,
0	order no 00000
2	( although the date says 00th_jan )
2	i checked on their website and was supposed to arrive today .

0	i found rattan direct on google , their easy to use website was vey formative .
0	original review - i would not purchase from ebuyer again ( after spending c . £ 0 , 000 over the last 0 - 0 years ) based on their response to my recent return under the distance_selling regulations , where their trained squirrel quoted an oftguidance document and beleived it to take precedence over the actual legislation !
0	their response was simply " your parcel has been dispatched and therefore we can amend any prices ".
2	proridermobility . com are not a customer service focused company – by any stretch .
0	i accepted payment as i was already massively out of pocket and at this point i was willing to accept defeat and write off my entire experience with this dreadful company and even this took 0 days before funds where received in my account .
2	they have promised to look into this further .
2	how ridiculous , we were home all day waiting , have 0 dogs who bark loudly when anyone comes through the front gate so there is no way we would miss anyone calling at our house .
2	very good product would defo recommend no more pulling .
2	negative points :
0	we are refusing all bookings from wimdu now !
2	just ordered a controller for bosch_dishwasher .
0	after waiting on the phone for over half an_hour i went through to an agent that muted their headset , they accidently took it off mute and i said " i know someone ' s there because you just took me off mute " then they hung_up the phone .
0	dealing_with company has been extremely frustrating .
0	very simple and easy process !
0	0st expeirnce will be my last of this cowboy outfit , stick with divers_warehouse , kent diving or simply_scuba who will price_match any item on deep - poos website .
2	they suggested to me a form of words for a letter to be sent by recorded delivery .
2	on tuesday it had been deleted from your system and when i finally got through on the instant help i was told it would definitely be collected today .
2	the one time i '_ve had to return something for a refund ( i ordered the wrong_size ) that was processed quickly too .

2	they should be the first thing you see on your web_site .
0	i did write to their company support email , because is the only florist company which does not provide a phone line , so if something_goes_wrong , like in my situation , the only you can relay on is their email , they don ' t even care to check , as this morning the only answer to my emails of complain i got was this survey , asking for satisfactory review and five_star rate .
2	in and out in about 00 min .
2	they never bothered to offer any replacement and / or compensation .
2	now , raher than being the best , with actual news rather_than dramatised gossip , they have decided to try to compete with the other channels for worst programmes transmitted , oh and then repeated .
2	i look at their web_page and strangely_enough they are on a fourth floor in a building in london .
0	i have ordered decadent e_- liquid both for myself and for friends , and we have all been delighted with the quality of the product .

0	chiquitos has to be the worst dining experience i ' ve ever had .
2	i am not a happy customer & if this is not resolved in a satisfactory way i will be going to trading_standards with my complaint as the boots were not just useless but not as shown on site either and the other ones left scars on my feet :-(

0	in fact , it was not until having spent_hundreds of hours playing online poker that i felt_comfortable enough to go to a casino on land and sit with other human beings , totally vulnerable to their intimidating looks and talks on the table .
2	you can not buy it in stores , so i am always looking for the best deal .
2	later in the afternoon i received a text which said my parcel would be delivered between 00 . 00hrs and 00 . 00hrs .
0	i also received neither of the refunds .
2	we never had an enquiry as a result and they then took a full subscription from my credit_card for the following year .

0	their service is friendly , efficient and i really don ' t have a bad_word to say about them .
2	phoned to confirm the actual version they were offering but they were either unwilling or unable to check for me - had a look on his system and told me he could only see much earlier versions available .
2	affordable_supplements to their credit do then act quickly by either refunding or using another courier .
2	no problem too small or too large .
2	will never order online again . i am gutted , have lost money i have worked hard for all year .:(
2	bought these chennille cushions , and i love them , got a great bargain in the sale . havent been disappointed with anything i '_ve bought from this company . so the future is bright for linens limited .

2	this is not the first time i have been sent wrong items , recieved goods in a second rate manner ( dirty and marked ), have suggested on each_occasion for them to have a word with the warehouse staff who do the picking .
0	also i have had trouble with shipping and even just paying for the orders .
2	so it seems that not only i have to pay a regular monthly_fee for a current account , but also i need to pay extra phone bill .
0	busuu is great for meeting and getting to speak with natives of the language you are trying to learn .
0	still fighting for a refund !
0	i like the idea of natives and speakers of the language marking your exercises as you can get fast feedback but it ' s not always trustworthy .
2	i rang the payment difficuilties phone number and asked them to explain the notice , all i heard was i owed £_00 . 00 .
2	really good customer experience .
0	why this mess ???????
0	so angry .

0	my only complaint would be that the finishing fold is not perfect .
2	i checked the tracking and it says " unable to locate " but they have my phone number and only needed to phone and ask for directions .
2	apart_from that slightly unnerving experience it was a great trip and terrific value for money .
2	the name on the card is patricia and the number given is 00000000000 however the only facility is to send a text which has not been answered .
2	they dont stock many brands , or they are " out " of everything you need .

0	i have since had my cards printed elsewhere but i do appreciate the response .
0	!
0	it was a more complaicated order as i was paying from overseas but they made no effort to try and find a solution .
2	we list the following as missing :

2	what can i say , music matter were fabulous and lee was terrific .
0	i thought nothing of it , and and was looking_forward to receiving the mattress , however , i received an_email on the 0th_jan saying that there had been a stock error and that it would be another week until the mattress arrived in the warehouse .

0	even_though it wasn ' t their fault that she had to continue with the contract they were no help what so ever .
0	i recommend you try this company if this a course you are interested in studying !
0	i wouldnt recommend the site to anyone .
0	this will help force more repetition and more learning rather_than writing a few poor sentences that get badly marked and then proceeding to the next unit without actually learning anything .
2	at_least easyjet make me feel like a human_being rather_than an animal being hearded in a cattle pen !
2	haveing tried for almost a month on a similar site call the garden shop to be totally let_down twice and ill never go back garden for less will_definately get my custom again
0	even if it was in basket and i ' ve paid . i didn ' t get one item because of an internal error :( also in trousers sizes i can ' t find any measurements and i ' m stuck with 0 pair tooo tight for me that i ' ve ordered in my normal size .
0	they even refused to provide information about their company , even their address .
0	the courier said " oh i ' m new to this round , and i don ' t know the area , so i didn ' t come ".
0	i ' m very satisfied i found your web_page . reasonable prices , all accessible parts , quick response from suppliers and experienced customer_service . i recommended it to all my friends .
2	so they basically charged me double .
0	companies don ' t want any bad_reviews as it will stop people from paying them for rubbish service .

2	the reviews also warned the instructions for set_up were in french - they were .
2	so i have paid the same for less this meaning i have ended_up paying the same for a lesser amount this is not what your substitute service offer states .
0	i just did not get out of it what i wanted - great 00 / 00 vision .
2	during this process i have spoken consistently to two case handlers from cr on a number of occasions .

0	good but a bit more expinsive than go direct sometims .
0	thank_you !
0	they ' ll probably stay on top for a long time , but the way that they ' re running things is giving plenty of opportunities for better sites to swiftly take away their users .
0	the service has been ok , until i lost my phone .
0	but after_reading some of the reviews here on trustpilot , i gave gcrc a go .
2	ended_up having to cancel my direct_debit with the bank
2	i have used serenata time and time again and thought i would carry on doing so , until this mothers_day when i ordered 0 lots of flowers for delivery on the saturday .
2	i will update further once the issue has_been resolved .
0	the technical_support of the staff is a complete_joke .
0	the staff are very friendly and very helpful .

0	!
2	this company have absolutly no after_sales support . i purchased helium balloons and a helium cylinder and it was the biggest mistake i made in years . after just half an_hour the balloons started to drop and within an_hour they were all on the floor . i called partyrama and asked for help and advice to be told there was nothing they could do as they did not do a same day delivery and that i was to blame even if they could deliver i would have to pay for a new cylinder because i should of inflated the balloons at the party not at home hours before . just as well i did do them at home can you imagin the embarrasment of helium balloons on the floor at the party . i suggest you stay_clear of this company . i will never use them ever again .

0	now ill get the same message as everyone_else which probably wont work and receive no explanation .
0	a company based around quality not quantity - seriously competitive_prices and amazing service .
2	i understand the co - op has quite_frankly ended_up in the creek .
0	buying from amazon may save you a couple of pounds initially but if they continue to close down small_businesses , causing the loss of permanent , skilled and enjoyable employment , and only providing unskilled temporary warehouse employment , then i think we will all suffer in the long_term .
2	!
0	lets_hope i ' m wrong
2	i was fed_up with the usual spring type mattresses that you can buy as , after a very short time , they would end up with hollows where you laid and become quite uncomfortable .
2	on the whole , disappointing .
0	don ' t hesitate to use it !
2	products good quality but service let_down by not taking ownership of the mistakes made .
2	it was a good price , although not the cheapest we found on the web , but we thought it looked a professional outfit , and assumed that aeg would vet suppliers .
0	kept up to date right throughout the process from purchase to delivery and on top of that they gave us an upgrade to our seats for the one direction concert at no extra_cost !
2	website said 0 units in stock .
0	was promised that my number will be ported over on friday before midnight .
0	customer_service at crystal itself was pretty hopeless , they just wanted to get off the phone as quickly as possible .
0	this company doesn ' t care for normal uk trading laws or debt_collection regulations .
0	always been used to using steam , but now i think i ' ll go to cjs_cd_keys first before i go anywhere_else .
2	we have problems every year with rats in the chicken shed .
0	i am a true apple fanboy and the products get better and better .

2	i have had more than one problem with this branch .
2	i could of at the time of placing my deposit with iconic_watches obtained the exact_same watch from an other company guaranteed in stock albeit at a cost of £_00 more but in hindsight £_00 on a watch costing over £ 0000 would have been worth it .
2	ordered a pair of biom shoes first time and have been so impressed with speed of service and the price !
0	easy to use , i booked with them and then found the room £_00 cheaper elsewhere . luckily the hotel refunded the difference .
0	he only had the office for 0 months but since leaving , he has had numerous issues with regus ( major accounting errors , false charges etc_.)
0	suffice to say ( fortunately i am in the legal profession so my fees will be coming out of ebuyers pocket ) taking them to small_claims court as it is a principal that amazon , play , and other good e_- tailers don ' t abuse .
2	thank_you .
2	for example , there was no queue in the restaurant , so we went for some food .
0	so i selected today ( saturday 00th ) for the items to be collected .
0	the photos i have been left with do not fit in a standard 0 x 0 photo frame and so are mostly useless to me .
2	i ordered tbis system for my pregnant daughter and she_loves it .
2	the forms that i ' d paid for were useless as they showed divorce - online as my legal representative .
2	i will be buying more from medicanimal in the future .

2	what more can we ask for ?
2	apologising and offering to make ammends to the way i was treated by there p . r customer team .
0	after completing the payment everything went down_hill , i first received a emessage ( their msging system ) saying we are sorry , but due to unforeseen_circumstances your goods have not been despatched for delivery .
2	as a trainer , i enjoy recommending this site to my clients .
0	i first liked hostelbookers . com because of their blog and regularly updated twitter account but using them to book my stay for a busy_period ( rio de janeiro carnival ) proved - with a lot of price comparing - that they have the cheapest rates and really are the only site without booking_fees .
0	i returned home , my wife travelled onto see her family in another country .
2	have bought from this site and found the good '_s suitable for the older members of the family , nice stuff though , postage fast and return '_s are no problem .
2	0 days_later i received an_email_confirming it had been delivered - long_story short and numerous_calls later i was assured they had cancelled the contract , they were aware a new phone had been fraudulently obtained by another person and i would hear nothing further .
0	fast response from their twitter account .
2	any questions i had were answered immediately .
2	two years_ago i would have given them 0_stars without_hesitation .
0	their pricing is always very competitive , to the point where you have to look second_hand to get items cheaper ; they offer a great free ' super_saver ' delivery option on all their products which is as speedy as many other_companies paid - for alternatives .
0	wow why did i not find this website sooner before i wasted so much money on store bought products ??
0	we all paid £_000 for two_nights dorm accomodation in bristol , night club_entry and deep sea fishing .
0	event thought the masuri titanium cricket helmet was in new unopened packing , the helmet was stained , there was dirt marks on the helmet , it looked like it could have been a display model instead of being new , i paid £_00 for the masuri titanium cricket helmet and i wasn ' t impressed by the condition .
0	it fits like a glove , although it is a tiny_bit long .
2	i ordered at about 00 : 00 in the afternoon and they had it with the courier by 0pm !
2	i traded an iphone0c with cex on saturday for a lumia 0000 which was faulty so i took it back on sunday as no other way to contact them , they offered me a replacement phone coming from s different shop , said it would be delivered tues / wed well post has_been and no phone also i dont have any receipts as the blackpool shop kept them i need someone to ring me or im contacting the police as im out of pocket to the tune of £_000 this is just stupid no way of getting intouch other than having to go into_town to the shop , getting the feeling i have been ripped_off big time i have given them until 0pm today to contact me or im going to have the iphone blocked
2	just come back from benidorm booking with alpharooms .
2	i received excellent service in my recent_purchase of james_wellbeloved puppy food .
0	hopefully you read this review this review , and those below , prior to engaging with this company .
0	also no refund when you are not happy with the products and send them back .
2	got my stanley level at a good price and quickly .
0	as for the night club_entry we did take_advantage of this but we had to be there before 00 which , i ' m sure , you can get for free anyway .
0	i then contacted their help_desk , they replied promptly , and i then stated the correct info they were lacking .
0	through which it become easy to transaction through online .
2	this will probably be the last_year i use them .
2	i thought that the service and the quick delivery of my product was second to none .
2	i was told as it was sent second class i should give it another week before i email them again .
2	i ordered a watch from iconic_watches as advertised on their website i paid my deposit and received an_email_stating 00 - 00 days for delivery i anxiously waited 00 days then got in touch with iconic_watches to find out what was going on .
2	why can '_t they take it off the price i have already paid for my tyres ?
2	item delivered when promised ; hifi_tower sent useful dpd parcel tracking link which announced arrival to a one - hour_window .
2	( i ask you ): and , secondly , the parcel arrived a day earlier_than stated .
2	!
2	not for me .
2	me and my wife both sold our phones and we both got the price we were quoted very quick and prompt service would use again .
2	i am so angry surely my contract is with talktalk and they should find out when it will be sorted when i said this i was told they could not contact vodafone it was up to me !!
2	takes the gloss off somewhat .
0	i then asked to make a formal_complaint about the wait on the phones , the misinformation and the fact that they are sitting on hundreds of pounds of my money and was put on hold for another ten_minutes to be told that i couldn ' t make a complaint because no - one was available and that they would phone me back within 00_hours .
0	most forums are highly moderated but trustpilot appears not to be , except when a company report negative_reviews .
2	its prices are compeitive and it is proactive when making_sure its customers know where their order are at all times .
0	bored girl informed me that they have a set route and even_though their only job is to deliver parcels and they must have known this would not be fulfilled , they won ' t change the time .
0	i was to receive a call from manchester depot that morning .
2	personally i don_'_t think they will last if they don_'_t sort_out there loading times as most of there ships leave ten_minutes before the booked time .
0	i couldn ' t find a box big enough for all the items so packed everything into 0 boxes .
2	i visited braodband choices and found all i needed to know in less_than 0 minutes .
0	however , the food quality doesn ' t seem to be the best .

0	i bought tickets to monty python at the o0 a few_days before the show .
2	i ordered a coffee_table on the saturday_morning , received an_email by the time i got home , had it delivered by wednesday .
2	far from it , the courier liam uses an ipad on 0g so can ( and does ) respond to emails regularly , from anywhere .
2	both times the products have arrived well_packed and arrived within a couple of days of payment .
2	anyhow , i have got a 000 current account , paying £ 0 monthly_fee .
0	they tried to stich me up by reducing the price for each phone to nearly 0rd of the value .
0	items arrived when expected .
0	because that was your problem not mine !
0	i was acturely put off after_reading the bad review on this page but i decided no i will go for it .
0	the following week , the order ' s status on their site was still " being prepared ".
2	the company obviously did not have the item in stock and would return the money to me .
2	it seems to me that this is a potential weakness in an otherwise promising model .
2	the bed was comfortable but a bit short and there were hard and soft pillows .
2	only shop_here for supplements for myself , my friends and my family_members .
2	this is the most perfect company to do_business with .
0	i was emailed this morning to say it had been received , then lunch time to say it had been checked , then this afternoon to say they had paid me .
0	awful !!
2	as long as they have your money , they dont give a toss about customer_satisfaction !
2	as in the uk we always tell everyone about the bad_experiences , this one will be told for a very long time !!!!
0	now i can ' t be bothered to top up my phone just to waste money on a customer_service of a tablet that i bought because it was supposed to be over 00_%_off the original price .
0	thanks cjs !
0	simply the best company i have used
0	being somewhat of a penny pincher i always check multiple websites for the best rates and hostelbookers . com has never let me down !
0	since we are in south_africa , it was not enough time to attend the funeral but we did order flowers online and within the next_day flora_queen delivered them .
0	in the end it took them 0 months to get my parcel back , and i had to pay 00 pounds extra for it to be returned to me .
0	thank_you !
2	the stores can be dated and tired looking .
0	this was complied with , and the food was delivered a few_days_later .
2	tried them on straight_away and couldn ` t stop laughing .
0	i informed her that i am not happy about this as you were just about to take payment for a agreed amount .
2	then they said it would be half an_hour .
0	i would like to thank e_- careers for giving me the opportunity to learn for very little amount of money and giving me the knowledge and skills for life .
0	the next_day i received an_email " confirming ' that my order had " successfully " been cancelled .
0	i new look wont even refund us delivery charge as we are supposedly the ones at fault .
2	but , when the meal packs arrived and i unpacked the boxes , i couldn_'_t believe that all these wonderful labled dishes were for me to try .
2	being an only child , and having lived on my own at certain times of my life , i appreciate having knowing that i can now be connected easily to everyone_else .
0	their abuse of trust is morally and ethically disgusting and i hope they are investigated for their deception .
0	i ' m new to the e_cig world and tried my first try of e liquid from you guys , firstly , express delivery next_day to the isle of wight !
2	paid extra 0 . 00 for a cake .
2	brilliant service , wonderful bouqets , what you see is what you get , pick a pic .
0	it ' s like shopping at the supermarket and have a employee sneakily put another product in your basket .
0	there were in stock when i placed my order .
0	when you arrive on time or within about ten_minutes ryanair play this awful fanfare . talk about blowing your own trumpet .
0	my experience is exactly the same as everyone elses , i ordered from them , few weeks_later order is still ' pending ' and have had no replys from my numerous attemps of contacting them .
2	lovely machine and a real_bargain at £_00 - delighted with the free gift - 00 reels of quality cottons !
2	it is so nice to see this company finally getting the caning it deserves on the web - my advice is to read the reviews and then walk_away .
2	i told them that this was not the case as i had booked tradesmen in around the delivery date and that i most certainly would not have ordered out of stock items .
0	i strongly_recommend that you avoid purchasing a bed with dreams .
0	website crashes / times out often which is a little annoying .
0	i have two main things to complain_about .
0	easy online , stock arrives in store on time , but the service received in the poole store has really put me off .
0	not sent until a month after ordering ( ordered on 00 jan , sent on 00 feb ).
0	bought an extra hard_disk drive for our main computer at home ( western digital 0tb hard_disk drive ).
0	i had to drive for 000_miles to get to my destination .
0	as for the main course , it took a good 00 or so minutes to arrive .
0	i bought my books once time with webuybooks and feel satisfied with the service .
2	mens range is awful though .
0	i ordered the television on boxing_day , and had no less_than 0 phone_calls between then and delivery ( on the 00th_december ) to confirm the order and delivery timeframe .
0	vigila si contratas wimdu .
0	i am absolutely_disgusted in the service i have received , i ordered a dining_table on the monday , was told i would receive it by wednesday if i paid extra .
2	no call came , despite my waiting in , so i went elsewhere for my new printer - a lost opportunity for the company .
0	wouldn ' t use this company again
0	i won ' t be holding my breath for the goods .
0	last time i ever set foot in any of their branches .
0	if humax ship their products like this , then so should resellers of their products .
2	well i would not buy from them if they gave a holiday for £_00 .
2	pleased with outdoorgb quick delivery would use them again .
2	brilliant company to deal with , very helpful .
2	!
0	buying tyres via telephone is pointless as you cant actually check them straight_away to know what they are offering to you .
0	i purchased the maxfactor natural minerals foundation and i phoned up to complain_about it .
2	excellent cooker at a very good price , delivered by helpful and friendly delivery contractor , delivered exactly when they said it would be .
0	do not use this website .
2	they refused to return them , as they had been " recycled responsibly ".
2	i have never been so disappointed by a companies customer service like this before .
0	i was greeted_by the reps at the aiport with no_problems , signed some paper work and the car was mine .
0	however , i believe that as a newcomer to the game there are some differences that separate me from those who have been in this arena for a long time .
0	they were brilliant in responding and even took the initiative to offer all the people queuing water .
2	believe me this is the last time i will ever use the store again and i will be putting this account of errors on the review_sites as well as face book etc .
2	wrong !
2	guess_what - 0 :_00pm arrived and no sign of the bike .
2	great speakers , well packagesd , exactly as_described and good value
0	we changed our party size from 0 to 0 to 0 to 0 to 0 then back to 0 , and everytime he was more_than happy to get yet another quote up , work out how it would be cheapest and best value for money .
0	it stated on their website , delivery within 0 - 0 days which wasn ' t a problem .
2	this price was not including the £_00 cost of sand and cement that i had to provide .
2	i never received the promised call to tell me the item was ready for collection but had to call a couple of times myself .
2	the end product was wonderful and i would certainly use the service again .
2	monday and i have finally received the missing goods .
2	e_- bay messages were responded to reasonably quickly and issue was resolved .
0	also , the free return shipping is wonderful .
0	i have been using amazon for years . usually the cheapest on the net for most things , quick to dispatch and always keep you updated on your orders . the free delivery service is a big plus if you don ' t mind waiting a couple of days extra for your items .
2	we didn_'_t take the option of the installation service .
2	the guy on the chat - window said he ' d leave a message for the depot manager , but this took two attempts without_success . i finally phoned customer support and they eventually collected the parcel on friday , one week_later .
0	i ordered an akai mpd00 online from fairdeal music .
0	in comparison to other major outlets , such as play . com , amazon etc they are often overpriced for the majority of things they sell and have been criticised several_times for not even having the correct price on their in - store items ( my dad got a cheaper cd when the cashier informed him the price was wrong but still gave him the lower_price but besides the point , surely this isn ' t how a business should actually operate ).
2	was kept_informed by text and was able to track my order from 0am on morning of delivery and was kept up to date with the time slots .
2	perhaps they will have to be patient for their payment !
2	will no be using them again and would not recommend .
0	je me suis donc renseignée , ai consulté différents forums et suis encore plus inquiète !
0	i have been with bt for many years and although i had little problems with them , i find that it becomes more trouble when you are calling them .
2	all good just slightly worrying that the web - site booking gives no details at all of the room except that it is a double .
0	my husband and i planned a trip and spent 0 hours on this website .
0	yes .
2	i fell in love with braeburn fabric whe .
0	the staff are very helpful and recommended some great nearby restaurants - a casual one for lunch ( churrasqueira do infante ) and o mercado for a nice evening_meal - both were very good .
0	so i was recommended to purchase it online .
2	so not at all impressed
0	if you find a really good bargain , just don ' t be too surprised to get a cancel order email a few_days_later .
0	casino would how ever benefit from afew more games to choose from .
2	i received emails saying all were delivered when in fact only 0 lots where and the other arrived on the sunday .
2	i only got my money back once my credit_card company took money back off them .
0	not only did they call me to say the tickets were on their way but all sent me a text with the tracking_number .
2	without a doubt , one of the best customer service based companies out there . great range of e_- cig '_s and extras , best prices , best forum members and a great team led by abe and matt . hightly recommend doing_business with this company if your giving up smoking . im using them weekly
0	i went for the voucher option as three passengers needed to travel and even_though i ' d have preferred not to use bravofly again .
2	clearly this was not the same bouquet i had ordered that was inspired by midsummer sunshine .
2	day 0 : 0 . 00am ordered flowers for same day delivery to office address ( 0 . 00am email_confirmation of order ).
2	!
2	children at the pre_- school really like it .
0	however , they never confirmed my update nor my order status , so i have no_idea if my order went through or not .
2	talk_talk get a lot of flak but other than changing my contract without telling_me i have found their service ok
2	we required a dimplex controller urgently , after contacting jay at fastlec
0	i usually don ' t panic but i spent a serious amount of cash on these tickets so i ' m starting to worry !
0	i had to sit in miserable airport when i could have been in my hotel enjoying the final couple of hours of my break .
2	this gave me time to find alternative .
2	no response in 00_hours and their online_chat is a total_joke .
0	finally 0th delivery and thank_god after more_than 0months we got the right size bed - frame .
2	however hermes tracking tells_me that on several_occasions they have failed to deliver because of access problems .
2	i think boiler_juice you need to get your act_together . refund please in the email you promised but that did not arrive .
0	a sepa ( euro payment in eu ) transaction costs 0 . 00 €, transferwise charges 0 . 00 €.
2	beware when renewing your credit , do not just buy credit or it gets used up in no time !
0	charging shipping on a £_000 order is a bit cheeky .
2	paid £_000 up front to get our neff dishwasher fixed , their local engineer a j p dom app ser of 0 the courtyard , saxon lane
2	thanks
0	so stay clear , the previous reviews don ' t lie as well .
0	i also reset the fuel computer and gear shifting monitor .
2	thu 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 : your order has_been scanned at the origin depot for export .
0	then it went_downhill with messages not passed between made and the delivery company .
2	it '_s only next week for goodness_sake !
2	it was a very stressful last day of my holiday and left me feeling very bitter about the car_hire experience .
2	well i must_say the title no how is about right for the service dept as they have no_idea of how to deal with a customer or tell the truth about a repair .
2	i always check wickes first because they are always cheaper_than homebase and b_& q .
2	very much looking_forward to wearing it out !
2	i did not feel this was made clear enough as a new customer and cost me £_00 worth of ' credit ' in a week !!
2	one also wonders , given the nature of what they are delivering whether there is actually intent to get you to pay for delivery ?
2	there was no sign of the gloves i ordered for about 00 days .
0	infact when we continued to complain they said our sites / scripts were badly coded , which appears to suggest that wordpress script is badly coded !
0	i explained i was only in st tropez for 0 days and that i had no clothing / toiletries with me .
0	this went_smoothly with the yodel van turning_up on the correct day and the driver being very helpful , telling_me about how long it would take for my package to be returned to amazon .
2	one at present concerns fruit teas .
0	regards
0	highly_recommended .
0	will shop at amazon or dabs from now on as always had excellent service and well trained staff .
0	the site ' s tricky to navigate if you don ' t know what you ' re looking for , so it ' s best to browse somewhere_else and then come here with the exact product you want in mind .
0	but , price was good ; service was good , arrived on time .
2	will_certainly recommend !
2	update 0jan 0000

0	they have put me off citadel miniatures for life now .
2	not fantastic .
2	if you ' re thinking of shopping here i fully recommend it , one of the best online services you '_ll get .
2	perhaps i '_ve been lucky , but i suspect this company is fairly small and can '_t cope with the demand .
2	their website indicated the item was in stock and so i ordered .
2	if you ( like at my company ) did not agree with the terms of a supplier then you can either get them to change the way they operate or you could drop them as a supplier , from this i conclude that you have sat down with them at formal meetings and agreed all charges and ways of working , you have therefore agreed to these scams .
2	best rate , easy ordering_process and amazing service .
2	they arrived the next_day well_packaged
0	highly_reccomended
0	you dont put customers back to the end of the queue because you failed to deliver first time around .

0	it was money well spent and we have since told a few family_members and friends to use flora_queen next time for excellent quality and professionalism .
0	many quidco reviews state they never recieved their cashback from this company , but i guess i ' ll have to wait and see for myself .
0	they have consistently overcharged me line_rental and despite numerous attempt to get them to rectify the situation they have simply ignored me .
2	i have experienced difficulties in the method of payment but the online_chat was really effective .
0	the box was a bit bashed but the sender had packed the items well so no_problems there .
2	if i was buying again , i ' d be reluctant to use trueshopping because their despatch company lets them down .
2	staff at local shop are very helpful .
2	during the process debenhams reorganised a separate delivery .
2	when we got back this morning i was told we are very busy and only have one driver and you are 0rd in the queue .
2	the tap in the utility room needs changing , it fell_off on use , and i got drenched !
2	the slate house name received this week was as good as we had hoped , the white word depth was better and deeper than_expected .
2	reluctantly i spent another £_00 and purchased the new tickets .
0	how many other customer ' s money is sitting in their bank_account .
0	a little something back is always nice .

0	i ' ve just started using aria but i will be sticking around !
2	ref_: customer number ( number removed )
0	worst customer_service ever - imagine this was your £_000 photobook .
2	the goods came in good time and were of excellent quality .
0	also , hotel vouchers were sent in an attachment called " invoice . pdf " - i did ' t open it , as you would have expected the file to be named appropriately .
0	despite the fact that , under the data_protection act , they ' re legally obligated to remove my details if i request it , they felt out refused .
2	i immediately sent a photograph .
0	00 / 00 : j ai reçu un appel de jeremie de infurn .

2	we purchased the veloped recently for my husband who suffers from progressive neuropathy meaning that he cannot walk unaided as he has no balance .
0	should have been confused . com
2	use them and you will see why . customer service as it should be 0st_class .
0	!
0	however , i would recommend doing your homework first and writing an itinery of the places you want to see as once the card is activated , no matter what time of day , that is classed_as your first day and then its consecutive .
2	the flowers were already dead or dying .
0	do yourself a favour , don ' t buy from uksweets .
2	i very rarely hope that a company goes bust , but the sooner it happens to vodafone the happier i will be !
0	this delayed the flight about an_hour in total .
0	many bigger retail sites can take a lot longer_than that .
2	the web shop is user_friendly .
2	the company was very apologetic about the situation and i hope they will improve their customer service .
0	thanks
0	seuls défauts : pas autant de choix que chez les concurrents et protection de paiement assez élevée .
0	the turnaround from ordering to appearing at my door was 0 days .
0	in the end i had to request a chargeback from my credit_card company to get my money back .
0	my brand_new locked_iphone 0 was unlocked in less_than 00_hours
0	lying robbing scum !
0	so i called and registered my new number and done everything they asked to do .
2	i can only assume that this claimed call did not take place .
2	delivery was spot on . all items were delivered next_day by fedex and were tracked all the way .
0	i was contacted the next_day with many apologies that they were out of stock of the chews .
0	i have called their costumer services many_times during different days and no one pick the phone up .
0	the pay the best money , send money quick and if you do have any_queries they sort them out without any funny delays .
0	i ' ve placed 0 orders with them , after about 0 weeks only 0 of them has tracked so have had to lodge claims for the sake of about 00p an item :
0	handy having someone_else sort out money .
0	when i ordered the game at the end of november i pretty confident their 0 working_days delivery would leave me with plenty of time to get it wrapped up and sorted out and when i didn ' t receive the email to confirm it had been despatched after two days as they said i would , i didn ' t think any of it .
0	a new shipment was issued the same day , and arrived two days after .
2	with good cutomer service they could have turned the situation to their advantage , resolved the issues quickly and they would still have me as a customer .
0	you can build the perfect pc for yourself from them with a huge_amount of reliable high end products for sale and gain good advice from their forums .
0	overall , i ' d say that the hut is acceptable , but it is rarely my first choice when it comes to buying books , dvds , or games .
2	when it is about virtual items ( in game items etc .
0	it took two months to finally get a refund !!!
0	- damaged reputation .
0	i received an e_- mail about a monitor that had gone on offer and when i had a look it was too good to pass up and if i ordered that same day , there was the option of free , next - day delivery
0	the windows are excellent , however , the whole_process was arduous and frustrating .
0	in addition i was not compensated for the cost of this trip .
2	orders are easy to place and delivered quickly and they keep you informed by email with each_step of the process .
2	i was expecting a parcel on 00 december .
0	the flight itself was on time .
2	delivery was prompt .
2	good for buying if you know your prices .
0	but muubaa understand this and make the process so easy and pleasant if you need to swap a size or return etc .
2	!
2	i want this 00 euros refunding to me .
0	door - deals are refusing to repair the damage or replace the door !!
0	phoning the customer_service team over a period of three days led to no response .
0	i checked out when it was put back in my basket , only to find out when i got the confirmation_email .
0	finally - nothing !!
2	they trade under cresentdirect on amazon - you have been_warned
0	do you really think a sample_pack ( 0 pills ) really costs anything when shipping 0 lbs of protein or 00 lbs of drinks ?
0	i was told 0 working_days plus to get the phone .
2	price seems a bargain .
2	on this occasion it was a pair of flip_flops that took two delivery attempts !

0	the prices are similar to steam sale prices , and most of the cd_keys are for steam .
0	i waited 0 weeks only to receive the wrong book .
0	just one flaw , you must travel off_peak , which is really not convenient .
0	my office was centrally_located in the building so i had no windows to help cool down .
0	quick ( the camera arrived within a few_days of ordering )
2	couldn ` t believe_how quickly the outfits arrived !
2	i would give five_stars to whittard , if the shipping cost to norway were lower .
0	i placed my order at 0pm and was shocked to find it delivered the following_morning !
0	we have been with them for 0 months , and we have decided to exercise our consumer right to write about our experience with unlimiedwebhosting . co . uk . the aim is to share our experience with others who use web_hosting_companies .
2	i was shocked to hear this as i hadn_'_t even tested the waterproof capabilities of the phone and it had never even been anywhere_near water .
2	!
2	i have signed_up to topcashback , the idea is good but i can not find any offers worth taking part in .
0	my iphone works very fine , this service is very fast .
0	signed for mail i believe is only £_00 .
0	i had placed an order online for my partner ' s birthday as she only likes this one type of flower .
2	great choice , ease of purchase and excellent service as well
0	update_: after a week of nothing i have received the code .
2	such a pleasure to have contact with and so much_nicer_than shop assistants who mostly can '_t be bothered .
2	so the moral is if you want a cheap multi - appliance policy then the warranty shop will tick your box .
2	please see attached refund receipt to show refund has_been processed :
0	i will never use this company again and would advice others to avoid like the plague !
2	placed an order .
0	i purchased products on next_day delivery - paying a premium to be delivered to a business address .
2	i was sceptical at first , but i ' m_glad to say i was pleasantly_surprised by how good panamoz was .
2	in addition i have spent an exorbitant £_00 . 00 on postage for three featherlight boxes crammed in one a0 envelope .
2	they came quicker_than i expected so it was a nice surprise .
2	i have also found them to be the cheapest place to buy some brands and items
2	domestos citrus fresh bleach x 0
0	it is pointless getting the flowers delivered now as mothers_day as been and gone
2	in addition have made a complaint to consumer direct ( i was referred there by trading_standards ) on 00000_000000 and recommend others to do the same .
0	will_definitely_recommend and use again !
0	ebay is a wonderful website that i use every day , thinks to the site i have been able to start my own business with very few overheads , and find their pricing very reasonable as a seller .
2	summary : don_'_t waste your time and money on same day delivery as it will become an expensive mistake as i ended_up paying nearly_£_00 for flowers in total .
2	on other occasions i have connected to the same number i always ring 0000000 ** 00 ** 0 , & an auto attendant then some prostitute chat line on many occasions telling_me what bikini she had on , & what she was prepared to do to me .!!?!
2	carphone_warehouse sent me a locked phone .
0	i also paid for the tracking service and like everyone_else have not had a tracking link , my girlfriend just text me to say they have still not arrived and she finished work at 0 - 00 .
0	if i don ' t hear_anything i will get my refund via visa .
2	however , i have demanded a refund of £ 0 .
0	the holiday deal was with a ' low_cost airline '.
0	prices are significant savings compared to other_websites , but delivery is very slow .
0	the replacement card was faulty , failed under load which seemed to be a known fault from looking on random forums ( amd 0000 ).
2	the scooter arrived in packaging that needed to be cut open to gain_access .
2	unbelievably i am reluctant to switch suppliers because for me , given my postcode , first_utility remains on a cost basis , the cheapest .
0	svarer like godt på kveld og helg som midt på dagen .
2	the new check - in is a great idea if only it worked !
2	took a while to understand all the rating marks on the tyre , but overall happy with the tyres i have chosen .
0	the instructions said i could pack everything in one box and i was sent one label in the email .
2	there was not as much noise from other rooms as we have experienced in other budget hotels which was good .
0	please have a better sign_up option box ( maybe unchecked by default )
2	they have also ignored written communication .
0	shame they couldn ' t keep up with facebook . wonder where it went wrong ?
2	!
2	delivery was later than initialty forecast - said 0 days then gave a range covering 0 days .
0	i was so wrong !
0	after ordering my first purchase with beauty - bay a couple of months_ago , it ' s now my first point if call for any beauty product .
2	it really means all_inclusive , drinks as well ( perhaps not alcohol , but we don_’ t drink alcohol anyway ), and hot food is served in one restaurant or another almost all day long .
0	when game console repair_centre quoted me just £_00 . 00 for a next - day service and 0 month warranty , i must_admit i thought it was too good to be true .
0	the product description showed the same features as the standard apple adapter - support for charging , sync , analog audio , usb audio , and yet the product did not work as designed with a docking station or fm transmitter .
0	very good value for money .
0	!
0	my only_suggestion would be to make the website a little more streamlined for product ordering ( the scrolling through supplements and multiple pages is a bit tedious , but it certainly isn ' t a deal_breaker ).
0	please continue to monitor your emails for tracking_details .
2	my husband then opened the door to find his parcel being handed_over to a neighbour with no wrapping on it , so that everyone could see that it was a sad daylight therapy lamp !!
2	around half of the items i have trouble with , several never came and paypal were a pain to get the money back .
2	i found it very easy to order , the communication quick and to the point and the delivery very fast , so that makes me very happy .
2	because i can '_t even get a response from their so called customer service team .
2	the desktop is exactly_what i wanted , it is perfect , i only had one issue i bought a new 00 " monitor with my purchase and they probably unknowingly sent it with a 0 pin plug , which luckily wasn_'_t an issue for me as i had an adapter , but others may not be as fortunate .
0	funnily_enough no reply until today , where they have now sent me and email with the refund details on it , stating 0 - 0 days to receive these into my account , and taking off nearly £_000 less_than the original purchase price , i have already replied with the fact that this is illegal and have now left in the hands of my credit_card company to get the full_amount back .
2	no issues .
2	but do not expect the flowers you ordered to be the ones that are delivered ?
2	however , the one and only time i forgot , with no warning whatsoever , vodafone disconnected the number and i lost all the credit .
2	next_day 00 / 00 / 00 the courier sent me their first contact , a ' no reply accepted ' email " your dell order is scheduled to arrive between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	i have had few issues , but all have been resolved extremely quick and in a very efficient way .
2	i would spend the money on the phone_call if i thought it would get me anywhere but i ' m_sure i will be told that once the item is with the courier there is nothing they can do so why waste money .
0	eventually he realised it was actually possible to leave his chair and go and look in the warehouse for my order .
2	i will be using cartridge_shop again .
2	000000000
0	i use transferwise monthly to move my pension from uk sterling to euros in cyprus and it ' s easy to do on line with the money arriving in 0 days .
0	you have to cancel then you ' ve only lost 00_% of what you would have paid .
0	i only went with envirofone because i had read they pay you the same day as soon as the phone has been checked over .
0	for that reason i wont be using again or recommending as it has put me off .
2	in fact i was absolutely_delighted with the whole courier experience as i had been previously very let_down by parcelforce .
0	phone me up on the friday late , but had wonderful news to tell me .
0	ordered a pair of rayban rare prints wayfarer and has the title_says received the next_day !
0	i highly_recommend supplement_warehouse to all my friends !
0	i assume happy people on this site are from america because uk orders . pointless .
0	cheap ( better value than anywhere i could find in the uk or us )
0	after summiting we were met half way back to the camp by the waiters with orange juice .
2	couldn_'_t access webmail for several accounts under one domain .
2	it has it uses but it has its down sides also
2	please_note that the company is a bit_slow when it comes to refunding payments .
0	a lot of the stores don ' t have a dedicated collection desk so you end up having to queue at a normal till only to be told that they are too busy and you should go to a different department .
2	i ordered a telephone ( 00pds plus ) which was faulty on delivery - i returned it but have not been paid a refund ( over 00 months now ) despite many requests and reminders - they also trade as sales @ ezstyle . co . uk
2	item arrived day after order .
0	strawberry and chocolate are my absolute favourite flavours on the market .
2	it was a really lengthy process and i whilst i would recommend you to people who could_afford to wait longer , as you pay slightly_higher amounts overall ( not always ), if they want their money quicker and are prepared to forgo a few_quid , i would recommend they use webuydvd who '_s two cheques were with me before you had even finished processing my first order and they were collected only 0 day before yours . so 0_stars from me .
0	the average response time of their servers is nothing to write home about . again our record showed 0000ms , which is not acceptable by the majority of webhosting company . some webhost believes 000ms should be the min .
0	good company and customer_service . but don ' t always add on your voucher from previous 00_% shop guarantee
0	the shipping is very fast and the products have never been missing or misplaced .
2	after weeks of getting_nowhere and passed from one person to another , i landed up with , james scott – senior vice president , customer service , believe me , a grand title really did not account for anything .
0	keep up the good work !
0	everyones story is the same with this company , they offer a big amount then cut it down to pennies , then they try to charge you £ 0 . 00 to return the handset - but on mensioning trading_standards or bbc_watchdog they say they ' ll re - look at the handset and give original offer .
2	ordered on tuesday for delivery on friday unfortunately goods were not delivered from manufacturer until friday so order was delayed till the saturday but that was suitable anyway .
0	it ' s not a real mccoy clothes site .
2	it '_s a shame that the delivery company you use delivered it to the right number wrong street .
2	the only way we could get our excess back was to cancel the engineer '_s visit .
0	!
0	very good nice and absolutly perfect i like to say other to come and play .
2	another small thing is that you say you have frozen prices since last_year but despite the loyalty_discount i still paid about £ 0 more than last_year .
2	although the website said delivery 0 - 00 days , topclass were able to find one at one of their stockists and get it delivered the next_day .
0	even the security personnel asked the ba staff lady to have a look at the footage , to which she declined to .
2	it turns_out they are based in hong_kong , masquerading as a uk company .
0	out of the last 0 orders , 0 have been delayed , one of them upto nearly 0 weeks .
2	since others had this common item in stock i am surprised that an oganisation as big as yours did not .
2	first lot of shelves - some the wrong depth and all damaged by courier .
2	but as the title states i would rate the actual kit and price as 0_stars only gave three due to timescales , being told i would get free saturday delivery and not and being told no o / s would be installed when it was but overall very happy and would reccomend them if you do not mind waiting a month .
2	arrived next_day as promised and the price was very keen . already_recommended to friends .
0	its brilliant .
2	i realise that i could return the unit but i am not taking up that option as the synth itself is not faulty or badly marked in any way ( ish !
0	quality and customer_service are consistent and we will definitaly purchase again !
2	ordering was simply , delivery was speedy and on time .
2	i find it unbelievable that a business can operate in this manner , let_alone be successful !
0	cuando hagas una queja te diran que van a investigar y a los pocos minutos te diran que ya te han retirado todo el dinero de tu cuenta .

0	i definitely will not use them again .

2	meter_readings finally accepted on 00 november , but account is still open and no refund cheque issued .
0	i must_say i am happy with the quality of the delivery .
2	a branch of primark recently opened near to where i live , i bought a 0 pack of underpants " jersey slip " but was unable to actually see them properly because of the packaging they were much skimpier than the picture on packaging showed and subsequently a very poor and uncomfortable fit .
0	they also maintain contact with customers , even speaking to me on twitter .
0	this was with the free 0st_class delivery option .
2	when i say how much it cost and where i got it from they ask ' are they secondhand ?'
0	e_- careers are fantastic , both in material content and in value for money .
2	one battery lasted a full 00_hours of working and then some .
2	i am thinking of cancelling my account and direct_debit with them .
2	second lot of shelves - not damaged but still some wrong_size .
2	the goods delivered were perfect and exactly as ordered .
0	tonight i spoke to a lady ( katya ) on the live_chat team and she was brilliant , extremely friendly and definitely made me feel a valued customer .
0	i love what this organisation is doing for these dogs .

0	excellent service , would definitely use again .
0	also they sent me sweeties in my package .
2	geoff webb .
0	hh do 00_%_off offers sometimes , and pay cash back through sites like quidco .
2	no problem , great communication and great service .
2	also if they don_'_t have the perfume you want you can ask them to stock it , this may take a few_months but when they get it the price is always very good .
2	so by the time the glass is replaced it will be six_months down the road .
0	day later ive received a phone call with information that tyres i ' ve choice are out of stock ( why there was no information on website just asked me ro pay for them ???)
2	!

0	ets were the only company out of the five companies i approached for a quote for a new exhaust system and they were the only one who didn ' t over exaggerate the problem or unscrupulously con me into unrequired work .

0	when i tried to return it they tried to make out that i had dropped it !!

2	so i ordered an snes super scope from ebay last_week to use as a prop for a convention this coming weekend and it was dispatched quite quickly .
2	i would have no_hesitation in both recommending them to my friends or using them again to sell on a no_longer needed phone .
2	overall i would try them again if i was looking to rent again .
2	.
2	the gm wanted to speak to me which we did the next_day .
2	0 - 0 is a very big window too . lot '_s of waiting in the house .

2	when he is left for even a few_minutes , he howls and barks .
2	mistakes were corrected quickly , quibble - free and courteously – however there were far too many and they really shouldn ’ t have happened .
2	then you could in theory go through it all again .
0	some of my favourite flavours come from their range ( the lemon meringue , blackcurrant ice and green giant all come with my hearty recommendation ) and the delivery service from the website is reasonably swift , even on large orders .
0	overall , i ' m very impressed and i will_definitely use them again despite the little hiccup but these things_happen and at_least they wanted to help and get the issue resolved which is more_than some other sellers .
0	it is extremely easy to use , and the best part about this website is that they will match the price of any other website with an additional 0 %_off the competitors price .
2	always seem to have great offers but never at the time that suits me .

0	had no issues with purchase and delivery and was pleased with the company at the time but when the card developed a fault after about a year ( 0 year_warranty ) so i had to post back , at my expense with no offer or refund there , and the replacement time was 0 weeks with zero word from them during .
2	it was out of stock , but they were excellent in keeping me updated and responding to emails .
2	there is so much choice i just had to tell you about it & their low_prices make shopping with them even better !
0	i ' m sure they deal with millions of transactions without a fault , but when a serious fault happens , like it did for me , they don ' t care .
2	meg kent worcestershire
2	i spent a considerable time and effort to spell out all the inaccuracies in his ridiculous email .
0	when things go right with paypal its pretty good , as soon as it goes_wrong though you find that all paypals promises are just lies and loads of extra terms kick in to protect them and make them even more money but give you no protection at all .
2	the staff no customer friendly .
2	or is it ageism you are now applying co - op ?
0	i ordered at around 00am , and it was in my hands by noon the next_day ( free delivery too )!

2	sadly the rad had suffered damage in transit , being dented and scratched on the bottom rail and the packaging & tape was hardly pristine , suggesting it had done the rounds well and truly before reaching me . and the valve set sent was the angled variety .

2	still_awaiting a report , the courier in question is citylink .
2	the ferry was a little late going out but we didn_'_t mind that .
2	in the end i felt that it was my fault for every ordering from these no florist manager would not speak to me and when i complaied about the quality i got a long email about how to look after flowers well i have learned my lesson do not use this company .
2	i was delighted with the selection ( obviously they don_'_t have every_single pen under the sun but a very very good selection anyway ) and the prices but the real surprise came when i received the delivery the very next_day .
2	item arrived quickly and price was acceptable

2	my father told him he was happy with that .
2	trustpilot should accept this and in some ways take some accolades for it , as they have helped true retailers raise the game but to punish the retailer with a reduction in score for being good is stupid .
0	i also am still fighting to get a refund for an item i have not received , it was ordered 0 weeks_ago and i thought it would be the highlight of my boyfriends christmas , but sugarush love have been slow and difficult , not to mention unapologetic !
2	and that roads around here are badly flooded so it ' d be an idea for them to ring us anyway to discuss access .
2	otherwise , things went pretty_much smoothly and we enjoyed our late break on the broads .

2	delivery was terrible !
2	if your reading this chances are your thinking of getting this company to do some home improvements of which , they offer many .

2	they have got to realise if just one person is put off buying from them because of reviews such as this then they are losing a vast amount of money , a fact which i find unbelievable .
0	when my order arrived poorly packaged and late from a company i had never_heard of , i wasn ' t very happy !
0	i feel as though i am paying way too much for broadband etc but can ' t face calling them because i don ; t have half a day to waste on the phone on hold to then be put through to someone i struggle to understand .

0	yes they are cheap , but you get what you pay for !

0	i ' ve been shopping at aria . co . uk for about 0 or 0 years now , buying various parts for my computers , and those of my family and friends .

2	all my orders have had a delay of some sort .
0	i asked for my account to be closed and for my personal details to be removed from amazon , as , obviously , i couldn ' t trust them anymore .
2	now to put this into context , only one person can drive the car at a time and my wife driving is no more likely to have an accident than me so why were we charged a rate equivalent to 0 , 000_euros a year .
2	i then started telephoning them .
0	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back £_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was £_00 . 00 for me ).
2	is a fantastic service and especial moment por unlock my iphone .
0	rude mechanics who dont know their stuff , a flaky supply chain where stock is checked after an order has been placed and paid for , staff and business policy that have a " cant do " attitude .
2	just the job !
0	i ' ve paid more_than 000pounds for them , and waited for delivery .
0	i ordered a bunch of flowers on 00 march for mothers_day to be delivered on the 00th it is now tuesday 0st april and the flowers still have not been delivered .

0	service was so good iv place 0 orders in the last 0 weeks , and they saved me weeks of tracking down vintage parts .
2	very disappointed indeed at this bad service and what a wasted day considering it is so near christmas and we could have spent our time getting the bits of shopping . the driver obviously went home early or couldn_'_t be bothered to do all his deliveried .
2	i finally got through at 0am the next_day , even_though the website says they are open from 0am to be told i would still have to pay as they will be charged by their suppliers but they didn_'_t seem interested in contacting their suppliers to look into this .

0	i needed something urgent for the weekend and it was thursday , so i called the vendor and he assured me it would be sent out strait away .

0	i can appreciate that the card is pretty thick meaning that a crease fold would be difficult but i do feel this could be completed a little better .
0	and just so you know i wasnt going like a wee old lady , i was actually getting things together pretty fast .
0	red_hot are arguably the best dealership online !
2	if i had been informed immediately i would have arranged for delivery on my next_day off but as they did not seem too worried that no emails had been received informing_me what was happening i just cancelled the order
0	i ordered the t - shirt with express delivery and it was very fast indeed - i received it before 00pm the next_day .
0	whereas this is big lie
2	ordered my new canon 000mm macro lens on the monday and did a bank_transfer of the funds during monday night to save a further 0 % on the already outstanding price .
2	i also bought some solar_lights for my garden .
0	was sold out everywhere [ still is to this day ], however ,
0	it turned_out there was a problem with the phone line that the experts at virgin_media did not pick_up .
0	i can see that there is a problem with the balance of burden on the seller in conflicts , though have been lucky_enough to not deal with dishonest buyers .
2	please advise .
0	for over a month , i have a horribly slow sometimes disconnecting internet_connection .
2	prices apear cheaper on comparison_sites but level of protection advertised does not see to tally up with any schemes i found on the companies own web_site .
0	i have managed to convince her that its only a week to resize and shine but hopefully she can have it before the weekend .
0	found the tyres i wanted at a good price , paid my money , booked a time , turned_up .
2	( max £ 0 postage ).
2	they do say you pay the same postage for whatever you order but i find this a bit of a cop out as most people i suspect do not want anything other than the item they are looking for .
0	but the guys who delivered our sofa refused to unpack it and take the cardboard away as was part of the deal when we bought them .
2	i love looking around poundland but sometimes wonder about the sources of their merchandice .
2	it just made us feel very undervalued as clients of yours .
0	they charged her £_00 per_month just for 0000 minutes and unlimited texting .
0	a great sight , and i will_definitely use this one again .
2	notwithstanding this and my wasted day , i waited in again 0 days_later for a technician .
2	why are there so many breakdowns in the printout ?
2	ordered 0 squeaky balls for my dog .
0	ordered on 0 / 0 / 00 and got goods on 00 / 0 / 00 !
2	delivery was exceptionally quick .
2	i purchased a suede men '_s jacket & was duly told of a 0 week backorder .
2	had to fight to get my money back .
0	just super easy .
2	i then called wowcher on the phone and was told to wait for the other two to arrive as they had been redeemed on different dates - they weren_'_t !
0	good service
2	complete rip_off !
0	i ' ve heard horror_stories about paypal .
2	they ' re selling a product .
0	0 / 00 terrible company .
0	our beautiful new furniture arrived today .
0	item was out of stock once i had paid for it .
0	the mere fact that google is set as my home page says it all .
0	£_00 delivery charge for our order and they don ' t even deliver to your flat .
2	however , i had a ' shipping confirmation ' reply the next_day , and my topper arrived the day after .
0	the accommodation was actually quite good , much_better_than i expected .
0	quality of the products were good .
0	full_refund received !
2	i was told they would submit a report and we ' d hear the outcome within " 0 - 0 working_days ".
0	bought products from lyco direct were sent by fed - ex next_day arrived at 00 . 00 next morning .
0	thanks guys colin
0	however in my case it was not a significant delay , and may be it was more due to post delays rather_than highlandtitles fault .
2	avoid at all costs !
0	i will be switching in the new year when i have the energy for it .
0	the 0 %_off competitors preices is nice if you have all day to commpare every_single product . believe it or not i like the site ok but even when i inquired about how a free_sample really costs money they send back an almost pissed_off response about how cheap all their stuff is and how it really costs and other nonesense .
2	you really find out about a company when there are problems and cult_pens have been utterly terrific .
2	excited i opened up the email .
2	the managers and directors really need replacing with someone who_cares_about making the business healthy .
2	there is a huge_variety of items to choose from , but my son chose for 0 of his friends for his d of e . he said the food was very good plus the snacks were tasty and there were lots of useful items in there as well .
0	the products i did recieve were fine on arrival .
2	very disappointing .
0	you wont be disappointed .
0	i ordered waited 0 hour 00_mins .
2	i needed a replacement pair of crocs cleo sandals after someone '_s dog chewed mine .
0	no tv arrived and i received no phone call .
2	worked it out between us that i would get the tyre done at my home address ( which the call_centre said i was out of the postcode zone ).
0	they offered me an_alternative - instead of a direct , up to 0 hrs flight a full day connection with a change .
2	of course , their customer service team only work from 00am to 0pm whilst their customers are potentially still_waiting for their goods .
0	imvu has come along way since i first joined .
0	no apology , no investigation , no reassurance that my personal details weren ' t sent to another customer .
2	for instance_:
0	spent_ages uploading photos to an album and when i clicked on ' order prints ' it wanted to me to upload them again .
0	bizarrely long waits for the courier ( who have no phone number , web_site or contact address ) to bother to call you to inform you when , in the next few_months , they might do their job to try to deliver the goods .
0	hopefully this problem will be sorted promptly without hassle .
0	all the staff are really helpful if you ever have queries .
2	thank_you for my topper zleeps , and good luck to everyone_else who has ordered - you may just need to be patient !
2	advantages ;
2	i am still_waiting !
0	i have recommended strongvpn to a number of friends who have gotten the service and are also very impressed .
2	by the time my boots had arrived ( very quickly ) they had credited me with the extra discount .
0	to sort out , we then left bt . 0 years later we moved_into our current property , there was a telephone line here that bt stated was not in use , they came in and re - connected it .
2	in a service sector plagued by unhappy clients who engage with unreliable rental companies , carhire0000 proved themselves to be extremely efficient , helpful ( on the phone ) and able to offer excellent prices .
2	would recomend to anyone looking a few_pounds for a phone they no_longer need :-)
0	however , way too expensive .
2	a couple of days_later i rang lee again to ask about a sub - woofer , i could not afford the matching focal sub so asked lee for advice on alternatives .
2	now the status of my order has_been changed to order held and i have had to send yet another email via their website simply asking for my money back .
2	why was it not sent out on the 0 january ?
2	matirx should be 0_stars neutral , 0_stars increases your score and 0 , 0 , 0 downgrades .
2	the items i bought were keenly_priced and were delivered very quickly .
0	viagogo does have a disclaimer on the website saying that times are subject to change but im sure this does not count when they out the wrong time in the first place and the actual venue has never changed the time !!!!
0	however , the rub was advertised as costing 0 . 00 !
2	i then received another email_stating the refund would only be processed if there is a defect with the size of the shoes reneging on the earlier agreement .
2	fab !
2	but despite_being in stock , it still took a week to deliver .
2	no need to repeat all that has_gone before , enough to mention
0	then she finally understood and promised to call me back that day after she investigates the matter .
0	the buses are regular to pick you up and take you to the airport .
2	i ' m not really sure what i expected from ready - prepared food .
0	the goods i ordered came in just two days .
0	well they are not the quickest in processing orders .
0	in short great customer_service , made everything smooth and easy and good value for money .
0	0 with tesco which has also not tracked
0	in any way i cannot imagine what can be done to fix this situation !
0	since i would soon be travelling abroad , i decided to hand over my contact details to them for more information about membership in the future , which turned_out to be my biggest_mistake .
0	i was told that it might not be perfect and its not .
0	they sold me a £_000 cage for the degus which turned_out to be way too small .
2	apparently this is not a voucher and my voucher will arrive in the next 00_hours otherwise i can email somewhere .
2	!
2	i have no issues with the booking process , however due to the late arrival of the chauffer on my departure i nearly missed my flight .
2	i have been using parcel0go for about a year now using either my hermes or tnt depending on the length of the item i wish to send .
2	as we live on a farm it still left him unable to get any essential exercise .
0	impressive service !!
2	we were very surprised he had them in stock , as promised , the controller arrived the next evening at about 00 . 00hrs .
2	sorry this is so long but to highlight the comedy of errors i have to endure and to ensure you know how bad the company is i have added what all happened me and what i did .
2	i would return for another holiday .
2	everybody uses social_media now , its becoming boring , especially when you don_'_t know half the people that connect with you !
2	he promised some of his best cherries when they were in season as goodwill .
0	also interested in how / why cpw complaints staff put themselves forward as legal professionals offering biased legal_advice and opinions on behalf of cpw .
2	the one miinor thing that is not very good is when they send orders by royal_mail over whom they have no control and who are particulary bad in my area .
0	as i wanted to have everything ready at the same time , thats why i have ordered them online .
0	the repayments are great but the price of the products are very expensive compared to other shops .
0	!
2	a sweet , chemically nothing , with no " berry " flavour .
0	!
0	very quick , efficient , helpful service .
2	so at this point i tried the find out how to contact head_office this time i called dixon group who own pixmania they put me on the the know how group which does delivery and installation with 00_mins they contacted pixmania and i had an_email from pixmania they will deliver the cooker in 0 day result at last .
2	due to exorbitant price of food & beverage i treated this as method of getting from a - b instead of enjoying a relaxing cruise with a nice meal and glass of wine .
0	the silver lining .
2	this is a totally unreasonable .
2	another delivery wrong .
0	they have really changed my life and they where fun taking them on a camping_trip , just open poor in a pot heat and eat , so quick .
0	i don ' t think trustpilot are writing reviews for companies , but i do think stores pay reputable_companies to blast reviews for them . i think trust_pilot should watch out for this !
2	apparently even if you give the proper notice to switch line provider , and after they have given you a mac_code , if the new provider takes over the service even 0 day early , they hit you with this charge .
2	i hope now that the ceo jason . tyldesley @ csl - furniture . co . uk does the decent thing and returns my deposit as requested and have a word with your suppliers they are giving you a bad_reputation !!!
2	i would not recommend this store to anyone .
0	i can thus recommend them based on my own experience .
2	packed quite well but ripped where slight bulge in cardboard where bag of components were - no damage though .
0	i ordered it and paid in full .
0	when i told her how important it is for me to have this ring , she says she cant guarantee the ring to be delivered on time , she looked in her system and she found same ring but . one size smaller in other branch in reading .
0	bought a newly_released game the deluxe special_edition for over half the price from elsewhere , and i ' m really happy with my purchase .
2	sent complaint to first_utility but no response .
2	my recipient was thrilled with the speed too and i have used them ever_since .
2	again sunbeds were provided here as well .
0	inconvenient for me as i need my order asap .
2	hopeless service , no phone number , no response to e_- mails .
2	es - wilts .
2	after some to and froing and significant delays in mail responses this was accepted but far from the original next_day delivery expected !
0	au vu des dernières reviews ( infurn . fr et infurn . com ) je_suis assez inquiète concernant notre première commande chez infurn ( au 000000 ) datant de tout début avril 0000 .
2	doesn_'_t bode well if you are listed on page 00 !
2	the reason i am upset with the missed appointment is because my wife and i had decided to go to our caravan for the remainder of the week and wanted to get the windscreen repaired before we traveled .
2	if i ' m not mistaken a pint of beer was in the region of 0 - 0 euro .
0	could not wait to see them for real .
2	on enquiring with jessops i was told that the package was in the hands of parcelfarce - had i known this at first , that would have been enough to make me take my custom elsewhere .
2	for customer service , ease of use etc our experience is that the post_office is best organisation to receive parcels from - the flexibility in picking_up your parcel you get if you are out at work is great with po ,
2	keep_up he good work viking signs .
2	i have used viovet on three or four occasions over the last_year and will happily continue to do so .
2	phoned up to confrim that my parcel was out for delivery the next_day after ordering i was told it was tracked as " out for delivery " so i stayed in .
2	i must have made 0 - 0 phone_calls to them .
0	very disappointing
2	they made a big deal about their "£ 00 for our 00 - week plan " offer .
0	the tyres have since dissapeared from the grippy website !
0	no_complaints
0	horrible dire faced woman .
0	the following is my opinion of iflorist , based on my experiences .
2	another email was sent next_day with tracking_information and the day after they where delivered
0	does any act or law give cpw the legal right to change what i thought was six_years ( reasonable time ) to 00 days ?
0	we had a good relationship with our previous manager and the team are useless and only open minimal hours .
0	i have to say i was happy with the delivery charge too ;)
2	holiday last june , almost a year in advance , to get what we wanted . yesterday went to pay on line . a difference in price . so i had to ring up to find out what was the correct price . our extra leg_room seats had been taken off ."
2	maybe they don_'_t want to give that away to a complaining customer !
2	ordered on monday night 00 / 0 / 00 delivered monday 0 / 0 / 00 in spain in good order very fast and efficient
0	: i have now been contacted by someone from chess telecom .
0	if you haven ' t tried you don ' t know what your missing .
2	so many things wrong - if using subtitles sometimes the subtitles start again mid programme so you ' re trying to read current subtitles and subtitles from before the break .
0	hmv just needs to focus there , as well as on their pricing strategies .
2	have used interparcel 0 times in recent times - first 0 times evryting went_smoothly , no hitches .
0	i got the size wrong , which is my fault , but the product that arrived was the wrong_colour .
0	its a ' vs0 g 0 . 00ct egl solitare ring ' right size .
2	very quick dispatch and delivery - and stopped the ever increasing wait for things to respond on my computer
0	everything about the company is faultless .
2	they are based in america but use the co . uk tag presumably to fool people in the uk .
2	very pushy with insurance_cover sales staff need to know no means no .
0	we finally ended_up getting them to send her out a new one just to find out that that phone didn ' t work either !
0	also , they have mis_- advertised sizing of products that i have purchased resulting in too little area of an acoustic tiles product arriving ( by a long margin !)
0	that happened for just over two and a half months !!
2	i have made countless purchases through lenstore and that is testament to how good you are .
0	if they cannot make a courier paid delivery by 0 - 00 when i ordered last_week for valentines_day then what is the point in buying the flowers ?
2	brilliant prices .
0	they were competitively_priced in comparison to other similar companies and delivery was spot on .
0	i was impressed with the speed of delivery .
2	i will use printerland again and again !
0	according to them " trustpilot is the largest review portal in europe , supported by a passionate community of real people .

0	!
2	delivery exceptional - arrived on time and on the day requested .
2	i have been in the electrical contracting business
2	wrong !!
0	although i only compared the certain products i was buying , i bet this is true for a large variety of items on their site .
0	number 0 in customer_satisfaction .
0	the news was that for the delay and me having to waite for the sub to be delivered to them , they will send me a brand_new subwoofer instead of the graded one on the monday then it to be delivered on the tuesday .
0	an added perk was that there were no booking_fees , so you would only be paying exactly the amount you saw quoted on the website and not a penny more .
0	i have also visited the number six store in east london and it is beautiful .
2	first lets get something very clear i have had 0 triple glazed windows fitted that were fitted to perfection and the units themselves i cant recommend highly_enough .
2	delighted with the prompt service and the politeness of the staff .
0	i sent my samsung_galaxy_s0 on monday april 0nd via first_class delivery after being quoted £_000 .
0	they match prices and ship super_fast .
2	rubbish on the shelves , with misserable desperate people doing their weekly_shop , for anything cheap .
2	comparing you to the average us hire company leaves you in the bad place .
0	messaging no_longer works at 000_% sometimes you send a message more_than once or not at all .
2	recently however i have found their pricing much less competitive , so much so i am beginning to question if my membership is value for money .
2	you will have to chase them .
2	most reps . are usually cheery and friendly .
0	thank_you sw for making my life that much_easier !
0	i was promised a call within_00hrs .
2	i thought i would give parcel_hero a try .
0	thanks again
0	and you ' re better off looking elsewhere .
2	the warranty they offered on parts was 0 year , yet the manufacturers_warranty on new product was 0 , upon querying she didnt know why that was . selling refurbished product perhaps i suggested . hmmm
2	very prompt and helpful reply far more so than nec !!
2	rest_assured i won_'_t be using them again
2	tracking was accurate .
0	this boy is amazing !
0	food is good and reasnoble if you use a voucher but it never seems hot enough .
2	bit_slow at start but item eventually arrived ok
0	overall sportsbikeshop offers a reasonable selection of products at a competitive price .
0	i ordered a product but picked the wrong_size so contacted them and was able to resolve the issue easily with no complications or delay .
2	recieved our order within two days .
2	late_afternoon as it had not arrived i phoned again and asked for the tracking_number which they gave me , but when i tracked the parcel it showed it had not even left the hub in london .
2	sure_enough it '_s loud enough i can hear it from outside , so i can only assume the driver doesn_'_t know how buttons work - god_knows_how they figured out how to operate a vehicle .
2	no apologies given until i asked for one !
2	i even tried reporting the problem to rotary without effect .
0	all in all though , we ended_up paying chillisauce over £_000 to hire a sports hall and send a rep with a few balls to referee the games .
2	i have tried to post a review for an item three_times on the website but very do not post it !
2	brilliant !

2	asda house ,
0	felt doubtful of the product at first considering that these boots were going off for a steal price .
2	ordered task lights & turned_up on time .
0	we were supposed to start our journey at 0 :_00am on june 00th 0000 via dutch klm .
2	so i wasted money on postage sending my perfectly ok phone to gadget_panda only to be told a lie as to the received condition .
0	my 0 year_old_son is now without his present , regret ordering from them .
0	further , i have the piece of mind that there will not be a lower_price , thanks to their price beating system .
0	transferwise is absolutely_brilliant .
0	they were due to arrive between_0am and 0pm today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
0	the order arrived within four days which is good .

2	mike came to the rescue again and sorted_out technical problem !
2	i would like to see some reviews from customers who have had to make claims .
2	she ordered an ottoman base and mattress .
0	we are like so many other families . always on the go and looking to save money !
2	and to top it all , they have now protected their facebook and twitter pages so i cant ( and others ) from contacting them that way .
0	but then tell me this before the whole day has gone !
0	i have been boots customer for over 0 years .
0	the security personnel did arrive on the scene and after explaining to him why i do not understand her concerns he gave me a very valid security reason for not filming the footage that i wanted which was totally different from the way the ba staff lady explained to me .
2	turned_out all right in the end and dealt_with politely and efficiently .
2	excellent next_day delivery service who deliver when they say they will !

0	emily howell
0	just got a call from dpd who appologised and said they are going to send someone with the parcel tonight and will call me when they are outside .
0	i only hope npower is better !
0	im not the only one to think this .
0	this is an average site .
0	thankfully my dress is 000_% perfect !
2	over a month later and they sent me letters stating that i owe them £_00 . 00 for the item and 00p interest and that if i didn_'_t pay then it would be taken further .
0	i found that three had a decent price for the iphone .
2	if you want to know about an item or not sure that the medication will suit you . just ask .
0	i have used other_companies in the uk whose technical supports were just kids and mediocres ( read my other reviews ) . currently we have over 0 accounts with them including their fantastic clouding hosting and we don ' t plan leaving them .
0	only ever had one problem which was resolved by the customer_service team !
0	also they do not reply to our mails .
0	not to bad .
0	but anyway the point is that whatever item you need to try and get it in stock within like a week of it being out of stock .
0	i love play . com
2	that '_s the best way he said he could describe it - ok but nothing special .
0	buying a domain is an_absolute bargain .
2	i would look around for a better designed product next time , hence i can '_t recommend this company .
2	perhaps some rugs , maybe pictures or something ….
0	i heard_nothing back but a few_days_later i had my cd ' s on my doorstep with the word priority written all over them , make of that as you will .
2	what they hadn_'_t done was on any occasion texted to say which day they were collecting or paid any attention to the note for my collection that they could access the woodshed to find the trousers .
0	im aware that ' reasonable within available method ' is a bit_confusing . what i mean by that is that a company who relies on another company to complete it ' s business , and in this case mazuma relies on royal_mail or independent couriers , can only really provide a standard of service reflective of a standard set by the postal / courier service . and on this occasion that was very slow , so indirectly mazuma didn ' t send me my bank_transfer for a long time , nearly 0 weeks !
2	looked the transport people up in the yellow pages ( la redoute guy had no phone number ) but they are not responding .
2	ok if you assemble every day you will be ok , but the instructions were poor but i did like the numbered bags to determine the correct fxings .
2	i am still_waiting for 00 . 00 pounds .
0	then just as i was about to pay for a holiday with another airline , a confirmation_email came through followed_by several emails saying my item is still in the basket !!
2	it is a family run hotel but the children were a nuisance with their screams at sunset .
0	never bought flowers to deliver online before and even as a novice i managed to find what i wanted and add / change bits to suit .
2	once again , thank_you for an excellent slate sign .
0	late on the evening before valentines_day , i received as email_saying my flowers would not be delivered on valetines day , and would actually be delivered on the 00th .
0	nevertheless , their products are generally quality !
0	prices are always very competitive but past customer offers are unbeatable !
2	imagine my disappointment when i got email to say my order was dispatched but not the free dress !!!!
2	the sofas were very grubby , we could not sit on them without towels .
2	box got wet in the rain and became tatty
2	the flowers my mother recieved was a disgrace for the money i paid . have used this company before for sending flowers , but will not use again . was proper mugged this time . never again .
2	so as far as i ' m concerned my credit worthiness is rock solid .
0	hh doesn ' t accept the order live like je does ; you have to wait for an_email .
2	here is the email where the said they has passed the refund lies
2	it looks_like i will have to take this down the legal route
0	visa dispute will has been opened !
0	cette_fois la date de_livraison est garantie mais si je veux annuler ma_commande je_n ' ai qu ' à le confirmer .
0	0 / 00 from me .
0	saved_myself a bundle of money over the years .
2	fast delivery but i thought the product was a bit over priced .
0	we contacted the seller and they made yodel come back to collect the rubbish .
0	i couldn ' t believe the prices compared with the last pair i bought from vision_express .
0	no_idea what the staff were doing as the drinks took around 0 minutes to arrive which probaly isn ' t that long to wait . had it not been us as 0 of the only 0 tables occupied in the entire restaurant .
2	from ordering and recieveing the goods i had recieved 0 emails to comfirm and status of order the goods recieved in 00 days the driver rang the day befor to confirm the delivery date and time was ok , the driver was brilliant very helpful and curtious i cannot_praise them enough will_defo buy from this company again
0	i cannot_believe the speed and efficiency in which my order was processesd .
0	it ' s a pain to have to go through various frames of what is effectively a flash banner just to get to the correct product .
2	richmond thick sausages they sent richmond ’_s skinless thin .
2	we have hundreds of deliveries every day .
0	grunden til at nelly får tre stjerner , er den gratis og hurtige levering og at deres produkter i knap halvdelen af tilfældene lever op_til forventningerne .
2	furniture arrived a day late , which cost us two days in time .
2	instead you have to post the prescription to them and wait for as long as it takes for the prescription to arrive before they send out the medication .
2	you wont find better , nuff_said .
2	i got several emails before the " attempt " saying " be sure you ' re in !"
2	when you order and order the correct no of items / wowcher codes you want its brilliant .
2	tesco direct should be_ashamed to be associated with this company .
0	delivery was 00_minutes late and ever since placing my order i get annoying text_messages about offers !
0	no hassle , just plain quick deliverly .
0	firstly , the website has a slightly seedy vibe about it which i can only say comes from experience if you have been on any malware ridden sites offering ' free games ' or whatever .
2	the paste went everywhere but in the mouth !
0	i actually phoned when i had an_email_saying they had my phone .
0	because amazon sell many of their products through third_party sellers , you never know if you ' re actually ordering from amazon themselves or someone_else .
0	now a repeat customer !
2	when goodybag is paid for then all seems to work fine .

0	what more could you want ?!
2	all seemed fine .
2	the whole villa desperately_needed updating , especially the bathrooms .
0	hopefully they will have learnt from the customer_service experience .
0	this company has disgusting customer_service i receive an_email_saying my order has been dispatched , so i take today off work to await my order , i call citylink who have stated that my order has not arrived , i then phone the drink shop to which the receptionist who has no_idea about customer_service casually remarks with no hint of sympathy or regret that yea they received an_email this morning and it was he fault that i had not been informed , i await my call back from a manager with great anticipation .
2	i immediately contacted shedstore who emailed me the instructions and asked for a photpograph of the damaged felt .

2	i only wish i had looked out for the reviews before i used them .
0	it was only because i had been in store that i knew what the product actually looked like .
0	with regards to the tv , the pause , rewind and fast forward facility is no way nearly as good as what sky + offers , it ' s slow and the screen often blurs .
0	in this situation a bit of humility would have been the better way to address this concern , rather_than going on the offensive and telling the customer they were wrong despite the evidence .
2	as it was , it was several days_later when i finally got my goods , having wasted a whole saturday at home being assured by jessops that the parcel would arrive and having had to ask someone to wait at home the following week rather_than risk the package disappearing into the black whole known as parcelfarce .
2	despite me telling them i am not interested in taking out additional cover etc and never will be ( my father is a senior trading_standards officer so knows these things are an outrageous con ) they continue to harass me .
2	they can '_t tell me when because apparently their system isn_'_t showing august dates yet !

2	the distance to my address from yorkshire is about the same as the distance to cornwall yet that doesn_'_t incur this charge .

2	they know us and stuff turns up ok . pixmania are conservative in their delivery promises and usually beat their date .
0	i do like pizza from the hut so can knock the food for what it is . but the website seems to always have problems with the page timing out at checkout , resulting in having to try and re order 0 or 0 times before it goes though .
2	it would be a 0 minute job to add to the website the fuel_policy choice to enable people to return the car full or empty , the fact that you don_’ t provide this choice proves to me you are part of this fuel rip_off and profiting from it .
2	what a shambles and the quicker i can leave their service the happier i will be .

2	i bought the cleaner from you and paid for delivery . having_read the instructions i saw that you had to buy cleaning fluid to use the machine and it could not be used with any other products . your website should be designed offering the detergent as an optional extra and it was ridiculous having paid for delivery that i then had to go to the store to buy the cleaning fluid . the operator kept on repeating the same information as_opposed to taking it on board and advising your buyers and website .
0	i can understand this extra layer of security when its an expensive product like electronics but it ' s a very low ticket item .
