2	delivery was great and on time by a good guy .
0	i had published my review about the company called roompaddy about tricking their customers in booking a room to rent which doesn ’ t exist and then charge full sum of money from their accounts in_advance without them even knowing about it , then refuse to refund it trying to buy the time for the money to sit on their accounts .
0	better_than royal_mail !

0	both_times spoke to friendly staff who explained they can come the day before the event , it ' s the individual who has sold viagogo the ticket who hasn ' t sent them to me yet ( they contacted the seller on the 00st may to ship them to me , so i dont understand_why the seller holds on to them for so long ).
2	prices are not exactly cheap , but you get what you pay for and the quality of their second - hand cameras and lenses is hard to beat .

2	items would regularly disappear , text_messages saying they had tried to deliver but there was noone home ( i had been in all day ).
0	i ' ve checked !).
2	i have lost out money i cannot_afford , and learned a lesson .
0	they also say , robert is really busy but this is not an excuse .
0	i contacted them via_email , and they promptly responded , apologised , and popped my missing items in the post first_class !
0	i said as a good will gesture we should be given the shopping for nothing as all the hassle k , kids going without tea , petrol money , phone call and the sheer stress off the stress and frustration in which he smirked !!
2	on the monday i phoned to check the delivery time .
2	finally after a number of complaints to the catalogue and the courier , i resorted to contacting the ceo of both companies .
2	a very smooth on line purchase with delivery the following_day . would recommend to others .
2	transaction was fast & easy & i have great value tyres that will be fitted at my convenience .
2	i had nothing to compare it too .
2	it had been wiped over and looked terrible due to the snow / salt marks on it so i couldnt really examine it for damage .
2	i would never use this company there are other_companies that do exactly the same .
2	but price was not honoured as offer had finished when i contacted them to find out where my laptop was .
0	i am absolutely_disgusted by this company , and would seriously recommend that people steer_clear of them .
2	i just wonder_why it took me so long to find the website , when i was searching for " kilim ".
0	a week_ago i ordered a crocodile costume for my son ' s school assembly .
0	overall value and service . abysmal .
2	now we pay for an over priced service that should be free .
0	unfortunately they are not very good at it and they don ' t really have much control of whats_happening !
2	the order was for some spare bulbs for a bell push .
0	first i received the wrong goods and i had to make arrangements for them to deliver the correct goods and i was offered some loyalty_points to compensate for the mix_up .
2	really pleased with the bars very filling .
0	awful tried to charge me over £_00 for ' not paying on time ' when i had infact paid over a week early .
0	i usually know exactly_what i want from currys so have only had to ask for advice a couple of times .
0	especially with discount coupons .
0	a few_days after the delivery date i emailed and received no reply , i used online_chat and was told it is out of stock , i asked when do they expect stock and was told " i don ' t know i don ' t deal with online orders " i asked why no one had bothered to call or email and let me know and was again told i don ' t deal with online orders ask mike ( i ' v never had any dealings with anyone called mike and had no contact details .
2	i am pleased to see that yodel are making serious efforts to improve their level of service .
2	it is utterly rubbish .
2	often have good deals on alcohol , but i don_'_t drink much .
2	( interestingly it was urgent , by the time i got to kent i had several missed calls from the fraud squad wanting to talk to me relating to possible card misuse , and they had put a stop on the card until i could confirm my identity etc_.)
0	that ' s a lie !
2	i bought a v000 digital_piano but then decided that i preferred the v000
0	not happy at all .
0	i have had a few_times where i have reserved an item and got to shop to find that they are out of stock which is annoying .
2	not any more though .
0	ebay always swing into sort , but it does create extra hassle and is putting me off selling that often on there .
0	after all of these ups and downs with this package the absolute worse thing was that the switch was broken on delivery so totally un - switchable !
0	is that a joke ?!
0	however the stock ran out but staff was corteous enough to call me and let me know and gave me a choice to cancel my order .
0	all items are well_packaged , with plenty of " stuffing " to keep components safe during_transit .
0	service was ok . couldn ' t advise delivery time .
2	another big_mistake !!
0	my phone was locked for 0 months i was looking for online solutions all over the web , this is the only dicent and trustworthy i found .
0	over the years with the growing population the service has suffered in my option .
0	all the stuff is ridiculously over priced compared to other_sites like amazon . co . uk .
2	will still use them again though .
0	they have routinely left very expensive parcels on my door_step .
0	from getting your dvd ' s put in their system for a quote to getting the check in the mail it was all so easy and effortless !
0	these were awesome and will_definitely be buying more in the future .
0	tracking_number and communication through email let ' s you know where your product is and when it will arrive which is well decent .
2	well_done house_network - i am an advocate .
0	i just completed a photoshop cs0 and web_design course with e_- careers , it taught me a lot and i will keep in mind e_- careers if i want to do a course again .
0	completely_satisfied with all aspects of the experience .
2	for the price i was expecting more .
2	so definately not using this depot again !!!
2	being a bit_sceptical i went along with the recommendations , but i have to say they work .
0	anyway . 0 weeks_later we have recieved the tv box ( that we didnt really want ) but the router ( that we needed ) is still not here .
0	what ?
2	used this company many_times without to much bother .
2	i was told that someone would get back to me asap .
0	i can ' t watch anything online , from a youtube video to on demand shows .
0	!
0	obviously mistakes_happen in parcel delivery - but it truly shows what a company is like by how the deal with the mistake .
2	the other thing is that the delivery starts at £ 0 + which for an item of £_00 + is virtually 00_% and makes the whole point of buying online pretty worthless .
0	they also gave thorough descriptions and a floor plan .
0	luckily the hotel staff were very helpful and we were transferred to a much_nicer , larger hotel for free .
0	i was a bit_skeptical_about buying from here due to the amount of cons out there , the item arrived seconds after completing the order .
2	their site guarantees 000_% customer_satisfaction - don_'_t be_fooled !
2	i duly purchsed and was very pleased with both service and delivery time .
0	!
0	everything fits and if there is ever an issue they always sort out there and then .
0	it is terrible .
0	all_round a great service .
0	pleased with the overall service and quality of the products .
0	i was referred this website from a friend and i ' m extremely happy with the pricing and the ease of shopping .
2	didn_'_t stop them upping my usage to 0gb though , and they charged me for it !
2	we used this firm to send some flowers to our relatives in vienna .
2	they insisted that i had to accept a repair rather_than a refund ( on a brand_new item ) and refused to accept the law of the land that states i should have the choice of a full_refund .
2	i ordered my panasonic wall bracket around 0pm on - line and it was delivered next_morning - it was well_packed and of really good quality .
0	i get the impression most people have a better experience than i did from their reviews .
2	within fifteen minutes of arriving at the car_hire yard , we were on our way driving out of the yard in a new seat leon car .
2	ok only 00 days wasted , no email from talk_talk to tell me that they could not provide the service , just please refund my £_000 . 00 back onto my debit_card , sorry sir we cannot make debit_card refunds , will send you a cheque within 00 days .
2	it is rather a blunt instrument which assumes if you '_ve had bad service it was poor customer_relations .
2	i spend 0 days trying to sort this out , over an_hour a day on the phone and on live_chat !
2	i think this company is basically sound but when you hand over several_hundred_pounds it does make you sweat a little when you cannot get hold of a human_being , customer service needs some working on and then they would be a great little company and no doubt pick_up far more business !
2	developed into a cash cow portal for martin_lewis '_s entrepreneurial ambitions .
0	not the best tbh .
2	joined quidco only a few_months_ago , already fast receiving cashback , well_worth joining and only £ 0 per year membership for faster service / payments cheers , well_done quidco shaun .

2	delivered on time and exactly as ordered
2	furniture is stunning , have already ordered more furniture , quality is superb .
2	it was suggested i needed varifocals so as to enable smooth reading of dials & gauges whilst driving & also enable long sight .

2	i am tearing my hair out with frustration , it has now been 00 days without the machine and god_knows_how much longer it will be .
2	i too placed an order in october and was given week 00 to expect delivery , unlike previous reviewers infurn have not been in touch with me , or answered any emails .

0	i requirements changed daily until booking but nothing was to much_trouble .
2	after a month started to wonder where the canvas was and what was the problem .
0	my last four orders have been delivered by this company and even_though the instructions were to leave the box at the reception to my flat complex if i am not in , every_single time the delivery company has just left the boxes outside .
2	a week_later , a ticket opened with customer service , and answered , and one phone_call and a refund agreed without_any quibble .
2	!
2	just one final note .
2	although i had a groupon_voucher i still thought i was getting a good deal .
0	their responsibility is only ' saying sorry ' , ' wait ' ect . always ctrl + c , ctrl + v
0	you get a print out at the end detailing your performance .
2	they are now our airline of choice .
2	i was pulled into facebook by an_email from someone who wanted me to be his ' friend '.
2	great website .
0	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer_service line .
2	fast efficient delivery and service .
2	i told them what i thought and as a gesture of goodwill they cleaned the car ( which should have been included anyway !)
0	this company have proven to be completely unreliable , unhelpful and uncooperative from day 0 .
0	no where in the email or on their website did it give the address of the local_depot or a date to collect by .
0	definitely buying here again .
0	the delivery for boohoo has been great ( ordered twice ).
2	as a result i was left without a landline or broadband for 0 weeks until orange could switch me back to my previous provider .
2	which can make in - store browsing a bit tiresome ( have you considered an lg sir ?).
0	when i asked why no one had been in touch , i was then informed that due to the limited amount of florists in the area the delivery would not be dispatched untill tuesday .
0	would use again

2	0 needed_replacing .
0	the old bed that had been taken apart was not in state to repair , so we just had an old mattress on the floor to sleep on .
0	emails were replied to almost every time with speed .
2	no wonder the tills at asda are constantly ringing .
2	the on - line tracking capability was an additional bonus knowing that the goods would arrive on the day they were expected .
2	there was a short wait before the local minibus collected and conveyed us to the car_hire site - only 0 minutes away .
0	!
2	delivery itself is always prompt .
2	eight boxes sent by collect +, all delivered to mm within 0 days but in some cases not “ received ” by mm for 00 days .
0	it seems to be impossible but is true that official_iphone_unlock team can really unlock iphone s and they have been done 000 unlocks a day !
2	told girl that this was not acceptable .
2	buyer_beware .
2	glasses returned fixed .
2	i waited from 0am to 00pm on saturday and guy did not turn_up .
2	as our existing cooker was not working i was more than happy to have it delivered next_day .
0	just because they are the cheapest way to deliver shouldn ' t mean the likes of amazon , asda and many others use them to deliver .

2	i booked car_rental with car del mar for a trip in december and i had problems .

0	, i took the registration of the cab i was in just in case he wasn ’ t insured , and ended_up getting another cab home , suffice to way this time i was wide awake .
2	however on asking for a refund so as to hire elsewhere they said it was rentalcars who had his money , not them . so he asked rentalcars for a refund and they refused . after a tense conversation with a manager there my friend managed to get £_00 . 00 back . money for old rope and a nasty rip_off , so beware good rental prices but , with a nasty sting in the tail !!
0	total amount again came up to £_00 . 00 including p_& p , just like with the first transaction .
0	needs no star
2	however i had a phone_call the next_day telling_me it was out of stock , but a delivery was expected before the end of the month .
0	the selling fees can be very expensive when you sell an item over £_000 so this can discourage users from selling expensive items on ebay .
0	i hope things have improved since then .
2	i booked a collection via parcelhero .
2	we have used alpha_rooms for years and always an exellent service all the way , the people they used in turkey this year not good the atitude of the english female rep at dalaman airport was at best terrible the bus went without us and all the rep said was you only paid peanuts so i dont know whay your problem is if you have to wait in heat with no shelter or water for a couple of hrs tough we are quite capable people but what if that was someone old / infirm or with disabled children not what i expect from alpharooms

2	some online_retailers just get it right .
2	the goods took over a week to arrive well within the up to 00 days the web_site suggested it could take due to the items coming from a depot in europe .
0	the site is clear and concise in everything it does .
0	i have contacted customer_service twice and they tell me it can take up to 00 days for delivery to ireland , seriously its not the moon .
0	parcels often arrive damaged , which you could put down to the delivery company or the thin boxes that are used .

0	mainly down to incorrect orders unfortunately . often the products are wrong , aren ' t included , wrong sizes etc .
2	best of all their e_- liquids do n ot have that horrible unnatural taste that some have .
2	firstly , there can be very long q '_s at the check - in desk , the last thing you need after a long flight , the tedium of going through passport control , and your bags coming off the carousel last .
2	still_waiting ten days_later .
2	the company showed us no detailed plans ( scale drawings rather_than schematics ), nor a project works plan ( pert / gantt chart ) and we ( the customers ) have found ourselves being resident site managers ( having to explain to workmen what is required and check the standard of work carried_out ).

2	excellent online shopping
2	there isn_'_t enough info about the product and they give no guidance that i can see on the exact lengths of short medium and long for trousers etc which makes_life difficult as the models they use are usually 0 ' 00 so the pictures are no help at all .
0	still they have in stock those beds and keep selling them and i waiting for my bed 000 hours and on the order tracking says - awaiting shipping and nobody telling_me when i get my order , nobody answering the phone , and on my emails just a reply with working hours , it was my last time when i buy something from world stores

0	a trusted seller
2	we '_ve never been in a villa where the cleaners have come in and changed towels so often .
2	so they were trying to fob me off .
0	if you are between the 00 -_000mm and the 00 -_000mm non l series , its definitely worth paying the extra to have this !!
2	paid for next_day delivery .
0	i ordered a silver tuxedo for a cruise .
2	the process is just so smooth and everything seems to flow in a logical sequence .
2	friendly fast efficient service that couldn_'_t be_faulted - highly_recommended .
0	facebook is ranked number one in the world battling between google , if facebook makes an un - warranted decision to display an un - justified message then the herd will believe facebook is right regardless of how wrong facebook is .
2	i wanted a veggie breakfast as advertised but non was on offer .
0	i deal with three different people via_email but each was extremely_helpful and willing and seemed like they were working as a team .

0	but the prices are great , and that ' s what matters .
0	escalated dispute to claim on paypal .
0	however , recently there was a mistake in my completed image and i dismissed it and stated the reason .
0	the website has also now started to sell designer fashion wear which are at the top end price bracket rather_than promote the smaller low key streetwear brands which offer good value and something unique , i guess the unique element has gone_missing somewhere and it feels no different to any other menswear site online , which is not exactly a bad thing but is the reason_why i don ' t really shop at this store anymore .
2	you matched a rival comp on price , you also said you would throw in some firelighters free but did not arrive .
2	and self - righteous gobbledegook would have been fine .
2	i heard_nothing since and therefore decided to call them today .
0	there are always a few hiccups , but it seems to me int keys has their stuff together .

0	it was a thursday and needed it for the weekend so ordered next_day delivery but realised it had to be before 0pm and i placed the ordered at 0 . 00pm but it still came the next_day !!
0	looking at this site by the looks of it not responding is the norm for them .
2	have used mazuma previously and can only say good things about their seamless service - many_thanks .
2	so bad communication , bad record keeping , bad order progressing .
0	he reservado muchos hoteles con esta empresa y nunca he tenido problemas , recomendable 000_%.
2	they are priced very competitively but i guess with that you have to expect a downside and these_guys don_'_t disappoint !

2	and he has_been really pleased with it .
2	really fast service and a great service when sending back a exchange item , paying return postage is part and parcel if you order a incorrect item .
2	the only item we allow customers to return are our best of the best introductory selection .
2	the delivery was prompt and the delivery man very polite , problem was that the fresh items delivered had one or two day shelf_life , many items where looking past the shelf_life .
2	they said on monday they would upgrade it to a 00 hour delivery so i didn_'_t lose out !
2	oliver m
0	i ordered some cultery £_00 + ( inc delivery ) and they looked like i got the from poundland .

2	now with one week to go they say that they are unable to help me further and if i am still not happy to contact the promoters , this is a complete_joke .

0	when i called customer_services they explained that there had been a warehouse issue but it would be shipped and i would receive the following_day .
2	tested the batteries and found them to be fresh and fully_charged .
2	0 weeks_later and still no refund or response and yes we know its halloween and they are busy . but its a " costume company " racking in the money at their busiest time off the year which they should be totally geared up for .
0	it is very obvious the supplement_warehouse strives to offer you the best price for supreme products because of the amazing feature they have which is comparing a competitor ' s price and if a competitor ' s price is lower , supplement_warehouse will automatically make it less_than that lowest_price .
0	you can overide the authorisation code normally by typing in a sequence of numbers ( 000000 ) or letters ( abcdefg0 ).
2	which means i have to source points else where so i don_'_t miss the offer i was hoping to purchase .
0	i ordered it online without a problem and the money was taken out of my account quickly .
2	if that had been left in there and the plastic had melted the metal screws would have fallen all over the internal components and shorted various items out .
2	highly_recommended !
0	i would still use the online shopping service provided but am aware of possible occasional disappointment .
0	really disappointed and has made what should have been a lovely experience that little_bit less special .

2	?
0	instant rns alert .
0	i called them to resolve this , but despite the website advertising delivery within 00_hours , after 00_hours neither order had been processed .
0	they have just turned_up now and and they are a total state .
2	small issue : they managed to mix partsof the invoice address and the delivery address .
0	we noticed the hood catch was faulty so i rang nursery value up and explained the issue and they said to send it back and we ’ ll repair it , i stated we would have no buggy in this time and can ’ t they send another pushchair to us and collect this one , as it would be quicker but they insisted on collecting and repairing the pushchair and said i ’ d have it back next week .
0	no booking_fees and payment protection is the best .
2	they don_'_t seem to be able to decide where to pitch themselves and with shoes for example they offer cheap synthetic heels then jump to decent leather courts at £_000 !
0	ordered at approx mid day and arrived before mid day the following_day already restrung for me at my specifications .
0	as i harassed viagogo on all their phone_lines ( the main one would no_longer give me the option to talk to anyone - how nice !
2	sorry about the lengh of this review , it would have been much shorter for my last car lol but i hope it will help anyone purchasing a vehicle from jennings to know what they could be getting into .
0	and suprise , suprise they got ruined .
2	got into the car - park no problem and found a space immediately .
0	great weekend handled well by chillisauce , didn ' t have any worries . and the hotel was much too fancy for a bunch of hairy ars * d men on a stag_do !
0	ordered a headset which on the site was showing in stock , expected shipping day came and went with no notification .
2	excellent sellers , excellent watch .
2	why can they not communicate ?
2	initially my add on partner paid rental_cars £_00 . 00 to hire a small car from enterprise . however when he got to enterprise they would not let him rent as he didnt have enough utility_bills to show them ( despite tv licence and aletter to him at his current address ).
2	i purchased two flights and was charged in gbp .
0	the perfect website for anyone who_likes to have a bet .
0	0 : 00 goes by - i am ringing to find out the problem but the phone is engaged .
0	everything worked perfect .
0	gosh , it was a crisis of plenty !
2	excellent service and excellent pricing .
2	was i compensated by chess ?
0	kwik_fit gets a lot of flak in the car world . at_least the service was friendly and it was cheaper !
0	as i ' m putting in a replacement order , so the collection can be done with new delivery .
0	as i know these tickets have been released and people on ebay seem to have them in there hands already .
0	sky tour customer support helped_me in solving my problem by providing me a statement stating the release of the money as requested by my bank ' s policy .
0	quick delivery , even gave me a 0 hour time_slot for delivery .
0	i received 0 hours_later an_email confirmation that i would receive the tickets for this smetana prokoviev concert i have no interest in .
0	all in all , i think it ' s a terrible service .
2	also i got 0 licences for the price of one !
2	*****
2	we would definately_use again , don_'_t hesitate they are great value for money .
2	the next_day i spoke to dave in the wigan office .
2	i can always save_money and find what i need and want .
2	very poor service
2	i was getting frustrated at this point and i asked why this was not asked for on the phone as i would have paid by card on the phone .
2	however as there is no list of ingredients i phoned aldi to ask whether there is added sugar or honey .
0	and the product came in mint_condition < 0 super excited and happy with my expierience .
0	i used envirofone many many years_ago when they were the industry leaders and pioneers .
0	i had one salesman continuously try to sell me additional sim_card which would save me some money - but i had to repeat that i did not want this and wanted the mobile_broadband only .
2	my experience : place order mid_afternoon on friday for in stock item ( less_than 00 ).
0	even when i got it wrong , [_name ] fixed my mistake quickly and efficiently .
0	they keep fobbing me off saying they have an issue in fulfillment .
0	i had my money by 00pm , less_than 00_hours from time of postage !
0	it was roughly packaged and covered in mud and dirt .
0	i used twice the service of booking . com and from customers point of view all was good .
2	i would recommend this company to anyone , trade or diy
2	the company . horrid
0	at present do not take an item thats shows in stock to be true but rather email them first before you order and part with your cash .
2	see above : that '_s all there is to say .
2	their staff are helpful , but it would be a good idea if there was a pop up when ordering these slim line shower_trays asking if feet are needed as they are not included .
0	i essentially paid for a promise , the promise that one day , i would receive my guitar , but not any time soon .
0	great service every time :)
0	today again received brilliant support from sammie_taylor .
2	so returned it to my local_store where i purchased it from .
2	if their goods and services were rubbish , they would have been binned a long time ago .
2	thanks
2	very efficient and friendly in the branch .
2	these are indeed great pieces of kit , had one in the previous house , albeit a genuine early victorian one i had reclaimed and restored , i generously left it for the new owner , the thing i find interesting is that this type of airer seems to have more relevance in modern houses that have less usable space for drying clothes during inclement weather , i guess people often just throw money into tumble driers , pulleymaid airers are not only a green alternative but i would guess , as a replacement for a tumble_drier , will repay their initial cost many_times over .
2	i paid for my order on the sunday and therefore expected my order to be prepared ready for the prescription receipt which was marked urgent complete with order number to avoid any delays in matching it with my already paid for order .
0	flight times changed , not informed missed flight , whole holiday ruined .
0	the look and the feel of the 0 items that i ' ve purchased felt cheap .
0	needless to say i came back and emailed them .
2	bought the corner_sofa and separate footstool .
0	a quick google_search using the translation function should prove illuminating !!
2	suggest dpd get more reliable drivers who are prepared to deliver to the door , or at_least advise that they have been .
0	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
0	i am a massive fan of asos and have been for years now .
2	cancelled on 00 / 00 / 00 due to no effective response to my enquiries and despite automatic email assurances and promises i am still_awaiting a refund .
2	morons in city_link ( or deliberately malicious ?)
0	ordered 00 / 00 / 00 and my order was finally completed 00 / 00 / 00 .
2	i '_ve known for ages that i could speed up my old faithful but sluggish laptop by increasing its memory , but i was worried that it would go_wrong if i tried to do it myself .
2	quality / depth of service is certainly better_than hers when we both have signal but she has signal more often than i
2	hampshire
0	i would suggest that you get a map and try and see as much during the day as possible .
2	great price , great service .
0	but to book i have to pay some additional fee to them .
2	sent the phones on monday , money was in my bank tuesday .
0	printed some orders of service for a funeral and while they were extremely_helpful , efficient and had good prices the finished booklets all had a yellowish tint to them .
2	sent my samsung_galaxy_note into regenersis under_warranty .
2	when the tickets had not arrived two days before the concert - we had to fly to the event - we ended_up chasing the courier and had to collect from their office rather then have them delivered .
2	i will be writing to viagogo in the hope of getting a refund of the price difference .
2	also acknowledged .
0	it ' s accessible and helpful to all types of people , weather a novice or a dedicated gym rat .
2	i will not use this service again and cannot recommend them
2	the watch is superb , exactly_what i wanted .
2	arrived on time .
2	hello ,
2	the garage did ' phone in the afternoon to say it had been fixed a i rescheduled for the following_day .
2	i bought a game for my grandson - it had lots of little bits that had to be pushed out and put_together before playing it , so imagine my disappointment and shock when i opened the box and it had all been done - clearly second_hand but i hadn_'_t paid a second_hand price .
2	they took the stress out of moving and gave good advice when asked .
2	i have added londonmagicstore to my list of favourite sellers , and would recommend them to anyone .
2	the village name and last 0 characters of the post_code had been omitted .
2	i had previously bought from frost a can of gasket remover , which had been delivered .
0	try laithwaites wines instead , for instance , i ' ve only had very positive experience with them .
0	there cannot be a card put through my door because there is no letterbox .
0	delivery is always on time , the driver is polite and understanding , and they take a number of cards including electron and solo !!!
2	no phone_call was received .
2	on tuesday the 00th_august i noticed £_00 had been taken out of my account by avis .
0	my main problem with my order was that in ups .
0	if you cant handle the busy day orders then dont take any more !
2	apart_from these the pc is great , just struggling to use it with this rubbish windows server os
0	as advised i checked the garden shed whilst on the phone and found it soaking_wet ( was suppose to be signature needed and no card was left at my door ).
2	prices are fair , i order a pair of cycling bib and went by their sizing chart but the fit was not accurate .
0	i told them to phone me .
0	we ' ll see how that goes .
0	i can recommend worktop_express to everyone .
0	other than it taking 00_hours , everything else was great !
0	they regularly don ' t turn_up for collections or delivery and claim some useless excuse like ' there was nowhere to park ' or ' there was no response '.
0	it was not another concert from the same cycle ( could have been tuesday or friday - not wednesday !)
0	thanks alot .
0	early on in the process daniel was very understanding and we discussed in depth budget , location and duration .
2	called again and was told will be sent out in few_days .
2	having paid up , stating i was not happy , an employee then took me to the car and in a whirlwind after making me sign an inspection form , made his exit .
0	not only was it easy to place an order , but the efficiency from when i sent the phones to you to when i received confirmation that the money was transferred to my account was astonishing !
2	in any case , it has made me rethink my constant use of them .
0	sembra novella duemila
2	that '_s why i get all my stuff from them
2	if you have a problem with chess that is not being resolved to your satisfaction then contact these two organisations .
2	i give it 0_stars as - 0 for instructions & - 0 for quality of materials .
0	avoid at all costs !
0	we were miles_away from any shops so out of desperation i managed to get a pizza delivered but had to miss some activities to go meet the guy .

2	i '_ve used handles 0 doors 0 times and each time i have received goods within 0 days .
0	especially if you are hoping to win more_than a tenner .
2	even the part number sticks in my head . ftd000 traditional pattern knob - i ended_up with 00 of the little tinkers and very happy i was too .
2	note to self , always wear headphones when entering shop to drown out the sales_pitch :)
0	easy to identify the options available for my acer aspire 0000 laptop .
2	well pleased
2	they do offer good value products in most_cases but i feel they punish their suppliers to enable this .
0	have been on the sofa watching stupid tv_shows all day long waiting for the driver , he never came !!!!
2	this company offers an excellent service .
0	i would recommend abraham because he provided a really good service from the beginning to the end .
0	sammie was very helpful and handled my problem with ease .
2	because i neglected to get the registration date of the owners v0 before we parted company this did not match on the final certificate .
2	shop around , you may find cheaper rates on the same travel dates , at approximately 00 weeks ahead .
2	they send an_email that they will keep the monies because it was cancelled on same day of the reservation .!!!
2	it seems matters then got a little out of control .
2	my rule is that if the seller has less_than % 00 . 0 in their seller ratings then go_elsewhere .
2	its not to be .
2	!
2	as a woman of a certain age who has spent 00 years being hot every night i am looking_forward to better sleep .
2	i made some mistakes , the help files are a great training aid .
2	it is slim enough to stand against the wall without causing an obstruction and quiet enough to use in the bedroom at night .
2	the pool and garden were good and safe for the kids with supervision .
2	unfortunately the shower was not included .
2	i have sent a personal review of a company ( a very good one btw ), but for some mysterious reason , trustpilot published it as if it was written by my company .
2	their tech_support are just telephone operators reading from a card of instructions .
0	and finally the money was returned to me by my bank .
2	or contact their agents who take 00_hours to respond and then give you an equally useless stock response which indicates they have not even read your question .
0	!
0	it cost me nearly £ 0 , to send it first_class recorded .
0	scouring the internet like i normally do , i found that ccl had the best deal and good stock_levels .

2	the tap i purchased from you guys was a wonderful top_notch product but unfortunately didn_'_t fit my bathroom so i returned it but i am still_waiting for the refund .
0	hopefully all the hard work will be noticed and due praise and promotion given .
2	this took five months , not helped by emails in ' franglais '.
2	therefore it hasn_'_t yet arrived
0	it ' s hard to sum up how refreshing it is to see a company like this .
0	!
2	it all worked out in the end and the family holiday was judged a success by all .
0	update_: i still enjoy looking at gumtree but be very very careful if you are selling , anyone who asks you to give out your paypal email address because they will give you an extra £_00 -£ 00 for postage is scamming you and should be reported immediately .
0	i went and sat back in the reception .
0	paid the item on 0 / 0 , 0 days_later asked for more postage , paid them , no response no delivery until 00 / 0 , received the perfect box , but when opened , all solutions are falled aparts , complained to the customer_service , blamed to the courier broke them .
0	the service was quick friendly and reliable !!
0	convenience turned into a complete nightmare .
0	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
0	have been panicking all day , phoned viagogo twice .
0	no answer .
2	left with a promise to ring his " mate " who has one on his van and would ring in an_hour . you guessed it , nothing .
2	i have just taken possession of my seamaster omega and i am absolutely_delighted with it .
0	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
2	i asked why and he said this was for fuel in case i didn ’ t return it with fuel inside it .
2	money should not be in limbo whilst waiting for drawdown , other_sites such as wellesley are instant and are also backed by assets .
2	after years with mcafee i am converted to bullguard . it is easy to use ( with the on line help ) and you feel in control .
2	website great , products and prices are great , delivery tracking and delivery excellent .
0	i only really use it if i need to get stuff quick and can ' t be bothered to search for a cheaper price .

0	i was so impressed with watchfinder .
2	a very unhappy ex customer !!!!!!!!!!!
2	the products are as you would expect , but given i specifically paid extra for them to be delivered within 00_hours , had the email_confirmation and they didn_'_t arrive ( with no explanation or forewarning ).
2	i was disappointed that it took them a week to email me to say they had now processed my order and it was ready for collection from the courier .
0	i highly_recommend them !
0	yours ,
0	also had a major problem with getting payment as they took down the wrong details and then had the phone put down on me by their customer_services team when all i wanted was to sort out my details so i could get paid .
2	quick , painless and a massive boost to my laptop !!
2	unlike_other courier companies , i discovered that i could only contact dpd via their email enquiry form .
2	the service was great , all the phone_calls were answered quickly and the cso '_s were extremely friendly and polite .

2	i was taken through every_step of the way and kept_informed of progress .
0	i posted my phones off .
2	very easy transaction and pleased with product and delivery

0	recieved a decent amount by cheque .
0	so i just couldn ' t be bothered , got a full_refund and bought it off amazon .
0	no curious question asked just simply brilliant .
2	the item i required was with me in less_than 00hours .

2	but
2	if you ’ re not going to be in for the 00 hour collection window , the mm website offers very few characters for collection arrangements , “ in the side alley ” is about all you ’ ll get in and then the disinterested guy from hermes fails to collect from the side alley .

0	--- update 0 days after the concert i wanted to attend :
2	when the next men arrived to fit the screen it was raining and they took one look at the range_rover and told me they could not fit the screen because the canopy would not fit over it ?

2	now i ' m left with a handset i cannot use and the money i purchased it for is gone !
2	margaret understood and happily we left the store to go searching . look where you like , you will come back to marlows .
0	if this is an example of what scotland has to offer , good luck to them and the potential independence !!
2	items i have needed have been sent immediately and received in good time and safe packaging .
2	i certainly would not advise_anyone to attempt this unless you have a few_days spare and lots of help and patience in abundance !
0	and their customer_service manager is very rude , i don ' t know how she became customer_services manager but when i wanted to speak to her supervisor , she told me that she is actually a manager and i was really surprised .

2	i have had a long conversation with both institutions and i have been given assurances that my complaint will be passed on to david pollock .
0	perhaps they ' ve forgotten my first shipment ?
0	they said we would be refunded within 0 - 0 working_days , but after a week of nothing , we decided to call again .
2	staff were there to meet us on arrival , and we only waited about 0 minutes upon_arrival back into manchester .
2	they need to use a better delivery company other than royal_mail
2	email them and you get an_automated message promising that a member of their team will contact you .
2	order placed late_afternoon and although standard delivery specified , the package arrived the following_day .
2	so i contacted parcl0go via there web chat and sarah amended the details and emailed a new label , also because yodel failed to pick_up a parcel the day before she changed the courier to tnt for pick_up today .
2	despite this the concert was brilliant .
2	i checked my local airport ( leeds / bradford ) on the internet , and found that i could fly direct to dusseldorf .
0	i got a fair price for the phones and the payment within 0 days of posting my phones off .
0	the customer_service is great , as you ' d be able to see if you read the below reviews , with any_issues being called up on with detailed and sincere explanations .
2	i will_definitely be back in the future .
0	i was very disappointed with rentalcars .
0	please make it easier for customers to post reviews and then maybe i would be happy to sign_up for additonal services .
2	ordering was easy , plenty of communication to let me know what was going on every_step of the way .
0	been waiting for my delivery for over a week now .
2	as they said it isn ’ t their responsibility !
0	i have rated incrystals earlier this month , and the service only keeps getting better !
2	save your time and energy book through a hotel booking site and save_yourself a lot of hassle .
0	i have been recommending this site to everyone !
2	laptop turns up next_day in belfast .
0	after having my racket for approx 0 weeks and only playing 0 competitive game and only 0 training sessions the strings snapped during warm up for my 0nd competitive match , expected much more .
2	ordered 00th , supposed delivery 00th , then told by parcelforce 00th , contacted both company and parcelforce ( parcelforce 0 times today by phone , twice by email , westin '_s line had switched to an answer phone by 0pm ), order finally delivered sat am , not to the right house ( yes we were in ), but 00 is close enough !
2	i have now spoken again with the proprietor of ++++ and he has kindly been out with his satnav to see if he could locate another business the tyres may have been delivered to in the piostcode ???
2	prompt delivery as well .
0	overall thank_you very much and great email co - operation and friendly staff who are very useful .
0	i have complained on every occasion and don ' t even get a callback or a response when you e_- mail them .
0	business should stop using them as their carrier , my supplier has now lost my business simply because yodel cannot do what they are paid to do .
2	however the man who answered the phone on my return 00 days_later was much more helpful and did in fact leave the car as close to the arrivals area as he could .
0	apparently , on planet ups , this counts as an attempted delivery .
2	the item took a long time to be delivered despite saying on the website it would be delivered within 0 - 0 days .
2	you contract to mm t ’_s &_c ’_s so read , understand and accept they ’ re written by mm to mm ’_s advantage .
2	the trolley was assembled in april .
0	the 0 year guarantee was a bit dodgy as i had to pay for the parts but not the labour .
0	i just contacted dreams again , and they have not even updated my details to say the order is cancelled , so are expecting to deliver the bed in may .
2	all in all very pleased so far .
2	myhermes was the courier service used , the shoes did not arrive .
0	excellent service !!
2	please do not trust anything that anyone tells you in rattan_direct as they are clearly lying to their customers .
0	now been advised that the beanbag won ' t be in til march thats 0 months for a beanbag to arrive !!!
0	“ have you tried switching the router on and off again ” jesus man , i ’ m not an imbecile , of course i ’ ve tried that - and many of the other useless troubleshooting exercises on your website .
2	amazing value and very fast delivery .
2	after 00 days i received my refund and a very polite apologetic message giving the impression my difficulties were abnormal .
0	received good offers and discount vouchers for next time .
2	if only this was the case with every company !
2	their info was out of date , the delivery company had moved their base 0 years before and told dell many_times , but dell kept giving me the old address .
2	i could see the tyres stacked in a corner of the depot .
0	?
0	where is yours ?
0	it ' s also good that you find the hostel by map search .
0	i ’ ve found their technical_support to be very good and they are always updating the product with customer suggestions .
2	thanks , samantha .
0	let ' s face it ; who wouldn ' t be !
2	ok , they are usually the cheapest when you ' re after something , especially electronic products .
2	you can check your return pick - up time but you still have to make a phone_call to confirm your return_journey .
0	i felt it was easy and fast to complete my order , very informative and kept me well up to date as to the whereabouts if my order !
2	tried to track today , but no information , so rang bdw only to be told that one of the products that i had ordered ( one they had specifically emailed me about to tell me it was back in stock ), had not come into stock until friday at 0 . 00 pm meaning that my order was not dispatched at all .
0	always quick delivery , great prices .
0	soon after i have modified my old review and put more information into it .
0	it arrived within a few_days and we ' re loving the new tv .
2	company claimed not arrived - despite guaranteed delivery .
2	highly_recommended .
2	absolutely hopeless .
0	they were shipped very fast and had the best prices i could find on the internet here in the uk .
2	it is so easy just to post requirements and wait .
2	branch then checked re other colour and identified would be 0 day delivery .
2	i got a nokia lumnia with vodafone in may 0000 .
2	excellent price for product , and brilliant delivery time , ordered and delivered within two days .
0	whether it ' s frequent giveaways or their great engagement and conversations on twitter and facebook , they ' re clearly very much in love with their product .
0	have been speaking to ' rowan ' for an eta on my delivery .
0	i then purchased their key 0000 skills course for the adobe dreamweaver package but found this completely_different , the style of learning was different and hard for me to follow .
0	i sent a parcel with them in january and had no_problems , then received emails from them with offers so i logged on to send another .
2	politicians please take_note , review rating here 0_stars excellent .
2	you must try this site it is a delight .
2	it seems as though they are attempting to dumb down the nation .
2	a cancellation recently occurred and i was gutted again .
0	when we received the new set we again only received 00 roses which all looked like the cheapest battered roses money could buy .
2	except when it takes time to load .
0	this was the only time i have ever felt quite angry with them but , as with most companies , if they are taking your money they are excellent , as soon as you owe them money or you want something from them they become quite rude !
0	look fantastic had everything i wanted to buy at a great price and the website was extremely user_friendly .
2	i bought this runner for my caravan and its great , it stays where its put and looks wonderful .
0	if you think that sucks the fun out of collecting , then they do sell unopened boxes to fill the needs of those feeling lucky or want a surprise .
0	i found many cheap codes for all the games i like , i would recommend for anyone using digital downloads and the rate of delivery was super_fast i also found the site rather easy to navigate .
2	good description of the website , including how many lumens , so i knew how bright it would be .
0	****** update *******
0	starting from the technical aspect of setting_up the web_site and continuing with the logo and web_design , firm branding and seo enhancements that would attract more clients to my site , pph freelancers were there for me ; not only to successfully complete the task i was assigning them , but also to give me insights on how to set_up my service more efficiently .
0	i posted my phone at 0pm and received an_email from mazuma at 00 :_00am the next_day saying payment would be made shortly .
0	also its a shame amazon don ' t pay proper taxes in the uk - will think_twice before making large purchases there again .
0	the prices are not wonderfully competative so its worth seeking price matches if possible although their vat free events make prices far more desirable .
2	get a legally binding ( set in stone ) completion date with draconian penalties for overruns .
0	i ' d say , use only when they are cheapest .
2	no call back .
2	luckily i was passing by a shop so could pop in - they have a good range and reasonable_prices for ok quality .
0	the produce is not worth the money and its very exspensive you dont get your moneys_worth .
0	easy to use website , fast and secure .
2	such a lovely selection of chocolate items to chose from the callets have a lovely shine when they have been melted .

0	so off i went to my car with the key left in the ignition , my wipers left on and my lights on full beam .

0	a young_girl asked for my id when i bought 0 bottles of lager .

2	it was a very quick service and it was waiting for me when we came home though i thought i had to sign for as it came by the tracker post
0	so simple to upload videos !
0	they make it as difficult as possible to complain and when you do , it ' s unlikely you ' ll receive a response .
2	and if you try and speak to anyone they are at best curt and at worst rude .
0	our deal is over .
0	will always continue to use reshmee to book our away holidays and will always recommend to friends and family !
2	i wish i had paid the extra and gone elsewhere .

2	friendly delivery_men .
2	the service was some what rushed and we got the feeling that we an inconvenience to the cabin_crew , they would have been happier if the business class cabin would have been empty .

2	at last they have been back in touch and this time the customer_services were excellent thanks kevin maguire hope i spelt his name right faith restored !

2	don_'_t you have bigger boxes !

2	i was with the company for nearly 00 years .
0	special delivery arranged and order delivered just in time .
2	when the watch arrived it was spot on , all complete and i was over the moon .
2	it is a lot of effort to do things which can more easily be done by phone , email or forum .
0	all in all , i found that the course was worth - while , although - for me personally - not as learning as a face - to - face course where the tone is more informal and questions are easier to ask in person .
2	i have placed quite a few orders over the last 00 months , standard delivery is 0 - 0 days .
0	they charged me the same amount but has not sent me a confirmation letter for the order .
2	the garage was not available at the hotel and they never send our reservation to the taxi company .

0	nope .
2	lovin the skirt .
0	i then asked to speak to a manager at which i was told he would give £_00 worth of e_- vouchers to take off this order we were due , as he had put the order through once again of his system between 0 - 00am the following_morning .
2	despite the shortage of time to decorate the room in readiness for the installation , we complied and were ready for the fitter , lee falconer to commence work when he arrived at 0am .
2	this just goes to prove that if you complain loudly enough and publicly enough , your voice will be heard .
0	cult_pens could not have provided a better service if they had tried .

0	i ordered some ghd straighteners on sunday , as my old ones decided to stop working suddenly .

0	since i told the seller this i have had problems with the seller who had been telling_me that i was responsible for the liability of the parcel if it did not arrive with them or was damaged .
2	i get get the products for the same price i would get them if i had a local shop .
0	the company not only treat the customers with care but also everything that they affect in doing their business .
0	the price_matching option is the best solution to finding great products for even greater prices .
0	just seen the reply , 0 its my word vs your word about phone being damaged .
0	would ' ve been with me a couple of days earlier even , but for the atrocious postal service in my area .
2	likewise the take away told me to take the matter up with just eat .
0	will use again for future events .
0	they are thieves and only seem to have an interest in taking people ' s money , without providing anything in return .
2	phoned them back and told them i will get the work done elsewhere and just pay for the service and mot greed £_000 as they wont release the car until you have paid !!
2	chess was not the least bit interested in getting me up and running quickly .
2	done nothing no explanation just an_apology .
0	absolute waste of time .
0	bought tickets , was contacted and confirmed via_email .
0	i ' ve been sending them emails and talk to different people ( christine , janani ) but they just totally ignore me .

2	i was able to make an informed choice of piano as a result .
2	overall very satisfied with the official spigen case .
0	i don ' t understand_why they don ' t have better quality_control .
2	they even did a second run and turned_up with more men than i asked for .
0	they are conniving , horrible people .
2	so their complaints policy " i couldn_'_t give a s ** t ." works !.
2	i assumed all was well at that point .
2	i am marjorie in the uk
0	it was taken down again immediately and i was asked to provide_evidence to my purchase .
0	i can however say one thing , they are consistent , but it is consistently useless .
2	the hassle was at the airport ( manchester t0 multi - story ).
0	fantastic service and quick delivery .
0	too expensive though
0	i proceeded to drive the car onto the forecourt and without even a thank_you they started working on my car .

0	they arrived quickly and without any hassle .
2	wide_range of products and food . a one stop shop . great customer service and really quick delivery
0	good but a bit_pricey and delivery wasn ' t rapid .
2	a couple of years_ago i would have given screwfix 0_stars , but prices keep rising in relation to other sellers , stock_levels haven_'_t kept up with the product range and the discounts given at the new ' trade counter ' are being paid for by everyone on the other side of the dividing wall ( cheers for that !).
0	these_guys are scam_artists !
2	they have always been well received by my wife , mum , sisters and daughers on special occassions and being_able to hand pick is great fun - even two of the same .
2	i will have to write a letter of complaint to them as it is the only way i can get through to them .

0	" this website may be unsafe " <<< facebook statement !
0	which means that when you upload an image , you can ' t get the direct link of it , that means that you can ' t upload any files you want ( which is really stupid ) etc .

2	if i hadn_'_t rung myself to chase my order along the way i would not have had a clue what was happening .
2	i can '_t hang_around in telephone queues during the business day ( and they always have a queue ) but got through in the last 00_mins of their working day on a friday .
2	this is clearly a rip_off i have tried to ring the customer service number on the event information email , this number according to recorded_message no_longer exists .
0	i always recommend them to friends and family .
2	great service , like the old_fashioned shop service as well as too notch meat .

0	i love the whey_protein chocolate powder just goes down so nice everytime and also i have seen very good gains from it .
0	customer_service is great .
0	guy called anwar at rgb deserves special credit .
2	the fact that there are so many small pieces to put_together to make each part of the building makes it a blind task unless you have previously erected one and would therefore be aware of pitfalls encountered .

0	to end on a positive however , the code did arrive quickly once the former was sorted .
2	then again someone came on wed !

0	and wait .
2	i was able to perchase a full service pack for my motorcycle comprising of good quality oil a ngk spark plug , oil and air filters for only £_00 !
2	if someone from regenersis would like to contact me i would appreciate it as you '_ve totally failed to communicate so far .

0	personally , i wouldn ’ t chance it .
0	bought a coat and the wrong_size came .
0	was also impressed with the security as i used a different email in sign_up to my paypal addy .
0	0 . steak that had so much fat through it i feel it was only fit for my dog ,
2	after paying £_00 for two bunches of flowers to recieve one bunch of poxy looking tulips is a complete rip_off .
2	so t t take my money for a service they cannot provide , give me every indication that the service will be activated within 00 days , send me a bill , but don_'_t bother to tell me they cannot provide me with the service and then expect me to wait up to another 00 days for a cheque that i have to drive 00 miles to the the bank to pay in and then wait another 0 days for it to clear , so in total tt can hold on to my money for up to 00 days , how many people are they doing this too .

0	use again !
2	unable to purchase due to bank security check each time i try to make a purchase from gamesbite resulting in purchase being turned down untill check complete .

0	the site itself is not bad , they need better customer_service and to stop lying to customers about 00hour shipping that doesn ' t exist .
2	?
2	order never arrived on time after paying extra for the service . no compensation for all the time wasted .
2	prices are keen , they have a good range of items and ordering is easy .
0	customer_services they told me i should expect it by the 00th_december .
0	but the code worked , and was the le version on top of it .
2	i have emailed and sent letters to no_avail .
0	from my initial contact with away0 , through to a successful booking , daniel_mednick ' s delivery and approach has been friendly , committed and diligent .
0	the only problem was the customer_service and the guarantee .
2	we decided to book and we were short on time , your site was really helpful but pricing was really high , we had to take it , we wanted to book the hotel ( crown plaza down town in dallas texas ), but we found it much_cheaper on other_sites .
0	turned_out the taxi was driving too fast for the weather_conditions and bounced off 0 cars on either side of the road .
2	i should also like to apologise for the use of a course word in my original review and state for the record that after spending £_000 . 00 on your company products i would use you again and would recommend your products .
2	i know that catalogue prices have always been higher than shops but now the difference is getting far too much i . e .

2	excellent service & the only place i will buy my inks from now .
0	catherine_corless is a very kind and efficient member of your staff , i highly_recomend this service to anyone .
2	- massive_range of unit sizes / styles , allowing you to create a truly bespoke looking kitchen
2	i have in the past spent much more on inferior goods , and have already_recomended your company to friends and relations , as i work in the theatre i am frequently attending first nights and royal galas for which we need to wear formal attire i shall definately be using your sevice again .
0	prices are not that competitive compared to buying off a more reliable website like amazon .
2	order came 0 mins early - everything there .

2	they would not even give me the name and address of their ceo .
2	where '_s the no stars please !
0	).
2	it was at this point that i started to feel uneasy .
0	they never understand what your problem is and keep reapting same things even_though they have no clue about what they are talking_about . communication between various departments is so poor and they love transfeering your call from one department to another .
2	update_: connection cable between guitar and amp was damaged .
0	i proceeded to wait patiently .
0	also they have lowered their hand_luggage_allowance to 00kg and charge a whopping 00 quid for a 00 kg back for check in .

0	my flights were rescheduled , meaning that i would have to take two more days off work and be stuck in shanghai airport for over 00_hours on both the outward and return journeys .
2	tried to persuade us to just go for other colour but i insisted they call up and check actual stock - again no stock will be mid nov .
2	i can buy items here that i would not buy on other_sites because the addition of delivery charges makes the product too expensive .
2	a couple of disappointments :
2	gear0music 00 out of 00 - local_store - forget it they are useless .
0	everything i needed to get me started .
2	arena flowers have plenty of flowers to choose from for all occasions at reasonable_prices
2	however over the last 0 - 0 months the reception has got to be more patchy , giving them 0 last chance as i have just taken out a new contract , then i may have to reconsider my options despite the excellent packages offered by this company .

2	regarding customer service if they just followed up an order after confirmation with an expected delivery date but apart_from that hispek is a good company and worth looking at especially there prices i can '_t fault that .
0	after giving up and then moving_house the problem persisted , this could no_longer be the house , or even the area , causing these problems .
2	however , when i tried to contact them to find out when the order would be dispatched ( after the 0 week deadline had passed ) it took three attempts on different days and waiting an average of 00_minutes before anyone picked_up the telephone , i also sent 0 emails and got no response .

0	instead of us receiving the food we ordered on the saturday , it was monday before it arrived .
0	the worst thing you ever did was to sell out to bt .
0	basically they are taking customers money in good faith saying they have adequate stock_levels but in reality they are building up a back log of orders so that they can purchase the phones when they have say 0000 orders at rock_bottom prices .
0	my other disappointment was that the website states under the watch i ordered that the watch came with a 0 day refund policy , offering me peace of mind if i needed it .

2	not good on veggie food .
2	all negative_comments on facebook were taken off and there is now no means of commenting - a transparent company ?
2	recently_purchased a charging dock and a car dock for a samsung_galaxy_s0 , the price was very competative .
2	as clearly warned , it arrived on a pallet and really needs two people to safely take it off the pallet and transer it to the room where it is to be constructed .

0	key is finally available at 0000hrs
0	i cannot reccomend the services of grammar genie enough .
0	if you can avoid it , don ' t use this company to collect parcels .

0	the silver lining .

0	i have no emailed them asking if my cheque may of been lost and waiting for a reply
0	i would recommend as you can find some interesting items on here .

2	secretary , bristol model car club
0	the products i received i was very pleased with !
2	like most people i work for a living and the courier will only deliver mon - fri free of charge , if you want delivery on a saturday it is apparently £ 0 extra which would negate the saving i make on my pets food .
0	i called consumer advice and reported this company since they had not delivered an item i ordered in february and a few_days_later i had a call from trading_standards .

0	they kept saying " it will be on by next week ". gone to bt now .
2	finally , they have an inability to send you invoices and credit notes which they may one day live to regret if they are ever inspected by hmrc vat inspectors .

0	some of the hen_party arrived early as we were going to decorate it before the hen arrived .
0	but ( a ) we were home all day and no one buzzed the door ( b ) i checked the shed and there is no parcel in the shed .

2	" there was a problem with your review "
2	when item finally arrived it wasn_'_t suitable and they had the audacity to deduct 00_% from my refund .
0	when xmas period time passed , i was mildy surprised , as i received another automatic email prompting me to provide feedback about their quality of service .
2	it is a criminal offence to impersonate the director of a company .
0	still_waiting for a solution from them !
2	highly_recommended , use them once and you would use them again and again !
2	then , suddenly he said he needed £_00 . 00 held on my card .
2	now dictated to , take delivery on monday 00th as we are in the area or cancel order and pay 00_% cancellation_fee .
0	first of all you can only log in with a facebook account ?
2	i just thank_god i never bought the bedroom_furniture to go with my sitting room furniture that turned_up damaged .
2	i have just cancelled the remainder of my order as i am not prepared to wait 0 months from the date of order until delivery .
0	when we had to expand the trip from 000 to 000 due to massive sign_up numbers , they allowed us to do so within 0 days of finding out we needed more spaces which took a huge_amount of pressure off us as a committee ( a lot of people were very annoyed that they werent in the first 000 ).
0	no waiting around in a garage - you can do it in the comfort of your own home .
2	whilst i accept that people only post bad_experiences , they looked pretty scary .
0	been buying online games for years from many websites then came_across this website the other day and bought a few games , received codes in minutes and was a great service .
2	the user_interface is simple to grasp and very intuitive to use .
0	all in all great buy , cannot complain for the price at all , plus the quick delivery .
2	this was a gesture supposed to cheer_her up but firstly , the bunch arrived a day after they were due to be delivered with no apologies .
2	straight returns are charged only a nominal fee for postage .
0	i have decided to pay_monthly for now , even_though it ' s more_expensive than paying yearly , because i want to make_sure that this is worth my money .
2	bought the spigen tough armour case for iphone_0s .
0	thank_you ultralase .

0	it ' s so hard i have been in real discomfort with my back .
0	and i don ' t want it .
0	the customer_service is non - existent .
2	since then i have received no reply to any of my communications .
0	if you want a customer to post a review now , and dont pay for trust_pilot , then that customer must pre_- register or be prepared to use their facebook account .
2	always had no trouble and quick deliveries .
2	the courier arrived the following_day - 00_hours late !
0	i e_- mailed wowcher on their enquiries e_- mail address regarding a special offer they advertised on september 0th , asking if the deal was suitable for a person in a wheelchair .
2	still_waiting for a refund - i would definitely check reviews of a company before i use them in the future - this company is using false_advertising my saying they can repair your item within 0 days !!!!!!
2	i purchased the lg 00lm000v smart_tv , the customer service was second to none .
2	i have always been happy shopping with littlewoods but was left very disappointed with the way i was treated .
0	so i ' m still_waiting for resolution of my problem till tomorrow , then i ' m going to contact viagogo management directly .
0	all in all a very enjoyable course & will_definately use again in the future ( hope there system comes back online by then !)
2	i had to send 0 emails on 0 consecutive days , 00 days after_placing my order .
2	but , regarding facebook , i realise i am reviewing a product which works , but which i have no interest in , like a chicken - sexing kit .
2	we all know these company '_s produce cheap tack but even i was shocked at how cheaply the 0 costumes i ordered on line were made so sent them back .
2	should have bought it ages_ago , it makes all the difference to the look of the caravan .
0	i lost my temper and had a go at the person talking to me .
0	it ' s been 0 days since i ordered now and i ' ve gotten in touch and had no reply from " customer_services " i wish i used a big well_known website and i will never make this mistake again !
0	i attempted shopping online with them once last_year but the accidentally ( just bad luck ) canceled my order but left it a long time before telling_me so half of the stuff i wanted was sold out .
0	the forums were taking away and have never been replaced .
2	excellent price , excellent service .
2	you don_'_t get that kind of service every day .
2	0 .
0	my one regret , not selectspecs fault , is that i did not look in the shops at what i was buying online .
2	the longspan bench is a new item , and there are as yet no assembly_instructions for it ; but i was sent instructions for bulk longspan racking , which was close enough .
0	i am no expert so i believed that and after a couple of minutes of hesitation and regret that i didn ’ t go for john_lewis accepted the new appliance and signed for it .
2	i shall_certainly use double0 again .
0	trust me it was tough to decide what not to buy !
0	i personally find the site a nightmare to navigate .
0	my website is verified registered and verified safe !
2	so there '_s an offer for a product , only to find out later that it hasn_'_t been applied !
0	the account management tool on the website is very poor and i was forced to create a new account again to place the order .
2	awesome
2	excellent price and service
2	the car provided only held two .
2	the parcel was undamaged & came on time .
0	so far i have paid nearly £ 0 , 000 for a bed i haven ’ t received and nearly £_000 for a 0nd_hand bed and delivery to cover the inconvenience .
2	staff don_'_t seem surprised and willing to accept situation , with one exception will , but nobody will pass my calls onto him
0	this was resolved quickly but i felt as if i was being difficult in what i was requesting .
2	on the day of delivery i was emailed and text a one hour delivery time_slot which was accurate !
2	everything is a winner .
2	i had also bought a shower_head that was too small , so i ordered another one .
0	great website , easy to use and understand .
2	money transfer in should also be quicker e . g use faster transfer direct into own account .
2	now they are lying and patronising me !
0	the staff were friendly at all times .
2	they are defininely at the top of my list .
2	offered to contact me ?
0	seems like they spend more time leaving time on here because the comments are public than they do replying to customer emails !
0	i use this company on a regular_basis and will keep doing so not been let_down yet
0	i ' ll definitely be shopping here again for sure , however one of my nail_varnish products did come in the wrong shade .
2	i am hoping that they might just manage to bring this forward to friday , but am not holding my breath .
2	still a good card , but my , how the rewards have been cut .
0	obviously the phone one is only a voice recording but have fun guys .
2	thank_you interparcel !
0	what a complete_joke .
2	i have ordered several_times now from this company and they are are excellent .
2	fantastic company to do_business with - they are high recommended - will be using them again .
2	makes a change to be given a 0 hour_slot instead of having to wait in all day .
2	we fly standby a lot , so we arrive very early for a good reason .
2	this so obviously how they keep their profits up .
0	basically , use it as a shop by all means , where you go to it knowing what you want .
2	many_thanks
2	next time , hifi_gear will be my first_port of call !
0	la la love these_guys , would diffidently order again and again .
2	not to bad you may think , however we were issued with a telephone_number to call 00_hours before departure to arrange pick_up .
2	no address on their website .
2	the products ( headphones and amplifier ) arrived following_day and to cap it all they sent me a lollipop !
2	as the elderly mum of two 0 month old indoor kittens , i couldn_'_t do without their support .
0	tecc should be everyones first stop when considering replacement products to smoking .
0	website provided clear up - to - date information about the progress of the order .
2	and i also think the thousands of your customers that put you in the position you are in are made fully_aware that if their meter goes_wrong ( as mine did through no fault of mine ) that they will have to ensure it is between the hours of 0am and 0 . 00pm .
0	my 0nd order was the biggest disappointment of any online purchase i ' ve made .
2	my long slim black fridge n freezer arrived i love them
0	if they don ' t get posted until wed / thurs then we won ' t be able to leave and get there on time !
2	so i repeat my header , is there any service here ?
2	then wait and wait for the bill .
0	qtag ' s ridiculous , pointless policy is no sending items back in exchange for the correct_size .
2	the only reason bt still exists is i suspect based on it monopoly roots .
2	next_day i get a text saying delivery refused by addressee .
2	i needed a particular motherboard to replace a faulty one that would accept my aging components .
2	in spite of the pension_fund i was using to purchase an annuity was very small , age_partnership was able to obtain a higher income than my fund provider .
0	simple booking procedure .
0	definitely use this company again
2	we have used mattress man 0 times now and totally recommend them .
0	!
2	furthermore the amount agreed was in my account , not less like other purchasing sites seem to do .
0	they have the biggest_selection and they even still carry jack0d and oxy elite pro !
0	and they also remind you about the travel , giving details and that helps a lot
0	i received an_email from them on the 00st oct just at 00 : 00 saying they ' ve dispatched my goods , but it didn ' t mention which courier .
2	packing excellent , all in zip bags .
0	i ' m very disappointed with their service !
2	it is not up to me to sort_out problems you have created !
0	dont rent with rentalcars !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	having looked aound and decided the model i needed was the lexmark_x000 , printerland had the cheapest offer up to 00_% lower_than some others .
2	after returning it and waiting for my refund .
2	alans
2	with so many providers to choose from i would be happy to recommend age_partnership .
2	i was frustrated at the breakdown , but impressed with the offer of a sunday delivery .
2	but unless i hear they have raised their game , i will not be using them again .
2	thank_you .
0	i ordered £_000 worth of pc parts to build a pc from aria as i found their site yet again very easy to use as i have the last 0 or 0 times i have bought products from them .
2	poor service , wrong customer service advice - shame about the phone .
0	they were always easy to contact , and got back to us very quickly with any_queries .
0	plus i still had to calorie count any way as your snacks are not labeled clearly .
0	finally received my order after 00 working_days .
0	there are quite a few different sites on the internet where you can buy cd - keys to games for a discounted price , if , like me , you are not interested in owning the physical media and would rather just download the software .
2	they are always a customer friendly team with a very efficient and very fast delivery . my orders come in around nine days , all the way to the uk , which is amazing .
2	this was pathetic considering the major inconvenience i had suffered .
0	can ' t wait for the next camping_trip !
0	good variety of restaurants available on the site , with some new entries that i can ' t find on any of their competitors ' websites .
2	bought a very competetively_priced rab downie for my wife '_s xmas_present .
0	this is all i can rate the company on as i haven ' t received the order yet but very good customer_service .
0	the prices are very cheap and affordable but what they lose on their cheap prices they make up in their overpriced shipping charges .
2	00_hours_later got a reply which i can only think is automated because it did not address the question of a replacement .
0	0 small items for a 0month old . over £_00 !
2	thank_you for your help emma .
2	perfect , thank_you !
2	then on appointed delivery date guess_what no show !
2	items are always dispatched quickly and arrive well_packaged and in good order giving me confidence that i will use again in the future !
2	spent several hours walking round trying to find them .
2	i bought flights to lanzarote and decided to pay extra for extra_legroom .
0	doesn ' t deserve a star .
2	i think they are now trading on that reputation and joining the band wagon of rising supermarket prices which are catching people out because we seem to just accept that prices have gone up everywhere .
2	add to this constant issues with account numbers changing and it '_s just not the same as it was before the takeover .
2	everything else seems okay .
0	my order was a little delayed however nothing major .
2	i hope that you do care about your customer_satisfaction and your brand , my experience so far suggests not .
0	also used them for a football_match , results were nothing spectacular .
2	even some of my real - life friends tell me that it helps them to ' keep in touch '.
0	i find shopperhive ' s comparison listings easy to compare , especially using the grid view .
2	i ordered a collection for the monday , late_afternoon they cancelled on me , then re booked for tuesday , i spend an_hour on chat trying to explain i was not in tue and they should make it wed but i will be out after 0pm ( that '_s why i booked mon as i was in all day !)
0	i have been able to pick_up a rubber stamp at a reasonable_price , and was lucky_enough to catch the free postage offer this time around .
0	delivery and the lovely saving off the rrp of the lens :)
2	i was tempted to phone him to say ' nothing personal , but you ' re going to have to accept that i am your friend , without my having to join some official club in order to prove it to you '.
0	0 :_00pm came by and i finally decided to call a customer_service number i found online .
0	everything was there as advertised and we ' ll packaged .
0	a gutted girlfriend as this was for her_birthday which is now no use but yet wowcher is not willing to help in anyway . says a lot really !
2	complete_waste of time with a bad attitude thrown in for free .
2	normally i would check and double_check reviews before using new company but , thankfully , my lack of research was safe this time !
0	he is friendly , funny and professional .
2	having left things till the last_minute i contacted e . florist to have a bouquet delivered .
2	i cannot_fault simply_games , have used a few online stores in the past for our video games , and although they start with a good service , for some reason the level of service decreases and we lose confidence in them .
2	probably won_'_t use cardtown again
0	i cant_wait to end the contract .
2	thank_you
2	i '_ve bought their ts000 - p wireless lapel and headband microphone kit .
2	the second time the woman_who answered had a very bad telephone_manner .
2	ordered dishwasher also for family .
0	so in short their pushchairs do look really good and are good quality but if you have a problem that ’_s when the issues start , i just want people to beware and know your rights .
0	worst experience online ever !
2	being a novice on the internet i was recommended the company parcel0go to send my son in america a parcel . i asked for help and chatted on line to daniel who guided_me through it from beginning to end , and the price was lower_than i expected .
2	blurry , lighting , half cropped signatures are always the problem + i hate making sales when i know that i will get an_email_stating the image is pixelated , blah_blah_blah !
2	i have only used them once but i had excellent service and would highly_recommend
2	brilliant
2	thank_you !
0	it is also cheaper_than hostelworld .
2	cały czas niezmiernie się stresowałam .
2	not so .
2	tbh , after_reading all the reviews on here , i doubt i '_ll be using them again , but i just wanted to state for the record that my experience was a good one .
2	they do exactly as they say they will do , better prices than another distributor i deal with and a wider_range .
0	after multiple attempts at contacting them , an engineer and many phone_calls the problem is still reoccuring .
0	envirofone were incredibly efficient with regard to sending me my packaging along with sending me the money for my old phone .
0	the tent as expected is of high_quality and worth every_penny !
0	another 00 - mins past and the mechanic sorting my car walked in and sat down at the desk and started typing .
2	the first time i ordered a jumper to try them out was extremely bad .
0	my declared dimensions were correct for the entire package .
0	unfortunately it did not work .
0	promotion invalidated because tesco couldn ' t deliver goods advertised ( 0 weeks in a row )
2	terrific service .
2	the camera never showed up and i did not receive any explanation from pixmania .
2	the demands included links that required my response but directed me to missing pages .
2	ordered a 0000l bunded oil tank and after 0 days made contact with bhl to be told there is a delay .
2	!
0	company is a joke .
2	0 .
0	from experience vodafone customer_service can be incredibly hit and miss , like no other .
0	with fast dispatch in quality packaging , i really can ' t fault them .
0	excellent prices , and super_fast service .
0	i ' m sure the people behind it have given the material and the way it ' s presented a lot of thought .
0	so i sent an_email to hkyongnuo service and got a reply within a day or two to send the flash to mr . william lin at their hongkong office .
0	we are the managing agent who looks after the property on behalf of the landlord who is based in abu dhabi .
2	excellent item and has worked wonders enabling me to take two dogs of different_sizes for a walk with one lead .
0	my exprience of 0000rpm has always been and i hope will_continue to be reliable , professional , quality and great budgeted company .
2	on this occasion the 000_euro deposit stated on my confirmation became a 0000 euro deposit when i arrived at gold_car in rome . that '_s their requirement for the class of car we hired .
0	i was wary as i had read a few negative_reviews on facebook and other review sites so was unsure , but i took a chance as i had no_problems with my first delivery .
0	i was on hold for 00 min and then they hung_up on me .
2	really !?!
0	lets_see what turns up first . my item or those flying pigs i ordered off amazon where i should have gone in the first place .
2	love it or hate it .
2	what more can i say - everything as promised .
2	delivery excellent , do not expect as much when returning items .
2	we booked many extras for our holidays such as indoor garage at the hotel and return taxi service from the airport .
0	it was very well set out so i could compare the hostels easily to eachother and put in necessary criteria .
0	line dead when trying to call customer_services .
2	their prices are great and they post things almost the next_day , they are called cheapsmells , and they had everything from vintage to really new makes .
2	because there was a private plate on my vehicle and some dual controls to change over it was 0 weeks before i got the new car . whilst waiting for these weeks to pass and having signed the new agreement i received a letter from ford finance about a missed payment on my old car , i still had 0 payments to go .
2	but the pilots usually arrive at the destination on time or early , so it '_s not all bad !
0	i have been waiting for a refund for over a month . have called . told someone would contact me . not happened .
2	i researched my local suppliers and the online market extensively before selecting tayna .
2	i placed an online order with toolstation yesterday for delivery today .
2	its truly a place no one in their right minds should miss , you cant lose but plenty to win and tell your friends as i am sure you will .
0	trying to get things corrected was very difficult and involved many calls and having to be quite forceful which should be unnecessary .
0	ordered my item on the thursday before 0pm and it arrived on the friday , excellent speedy_delivery cant_complain_about that .
2	would certainly recommend .
2	more calls to customer_services .
2	i tell my friends to come onto the site and have a good look
0	so i found this site which is optimize for user who find cheap but good hostels .
2	i pulled_out of the transaction too early , thanks to andrea , recovered all my details and order processed correctly .
0	the not so good now , they didn ' t send the email confirmation straight_away , the login process and access your data for the itinerary is poor quality ( gives no info !)
0	the price_match was very reasonable with dr so i chose them and i ' m very happy with product and will buy other products , such as lenses with dr , in the future .
2	offer insurance with a reasonable excess to start with .
2	!
0	have a nice day .
2	i would avoid parcel 0 go
2	update .
0	i ' ve come to the conclusion that there ' s one person out the back making shirts on a loom .
2	steer_clear save_yourself a load of hassle .
2	the section on roi and analytics is less_than useful , and the test at the end seems a little bug ridden .
0	it took 0 - 0 mins to load each page during checkout .

2	even when i no_longer needed an item because my old one started to work again they didn_'_t hesitate to cancel my order .
2	more than happy with chocolates now .
0	i leave a message explaining the issue .

2	phew .
0	chilli_sauce got a few things right over the 0 nights we spent in hamburg : the hotel was comfortable though the breakfast was lacking and the transfers between airports and activities were a nice feature ( though also lacked consistency across activities or in arriving on time ).

2	it appears that delaying refunding as long as possible is part of their business plan .
0	the money we paid for this shambles is shocking deffo not worth the money never using chillisauce again and safe to say i don ' t think the other girls will either .

0	contractor on site turned the collection company away .

0	after hearing such positive_reviews about this company i decided to proceed with my order of selling my ipod_nano .
0	the website was quick and easy to use , the main thing that let my experience with double0_tickets down was that the tickets did not arrive until very last_minute and i found myself on the phone to them various times having to try and trace where my tickets were to ensure they would arrive in time .

2	fitters had received nothing .
0	really annoying .
2	did not work , my phone rejected it .
2	product is a gift so hasn_'_t been used yet .
0	now , let me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
0	i am £_00 down , my boss is annoyed at me , my girlfriend has had to wait in all afternoon yesterday and again all day today , and i have not had a single communication from this company .
2	well there are even more bargains to be had , and if they are not quite what you wanted they are only £ 0 .
2	called their offices and was told it would be sent in the next few_days .

0	earlier this year , i needed a replacement power_supply for my computer .
0	one other piece of advice is that while there are very few uk reviews for them , there are a lot of reviews from germany ( where they are based ) and generally the reviews are very poor .
2	easy to get through on the phone and everyone i have spoken too are friendly and helpful .
2	very efficient and polite .

2	but as the next couple of days unravelled i found more items with same day delivery shelf_life .

0	not sure whether i would recommend their online service .
0	love the website !

2	very easy to use website - clear pricing and options .
2	however the customer service that followed was good , but was unable to give any reason for the delay
2	i was very satisfied with both the staff and the quality of work and would not_hesitate to recommend the blackpool site to any one .
2	the quality of the goods and service are second to none , would highly_recommend this company to everyone i know .
2	buying from ' retention ' is deemed to be online and nothing to do with o0 retail shops .
2	i doubt any company could equal let_alone better the service i received from hurst and sons
2	petmeds is the only place i have found to order the precious ovarid for our 00 years plus buetiful lovely black cat .
0	seems like nike have become lazy , taking a very long time to process my order for dispatch .
0	however , it took a long time for the amount to be deposited back into my account .

0	again i was told they will not replace the leg due to the splitting was part of the charactistics of wood .
0	when the item arrived it looked perfect , we had a good inspection as the website said : reworked prams and pushchairs are sold without warranty , under distance_selling regulations you have 0 days to return the item to us if you are unhappy for the goods in any way .

2	i paid by credit_card and waited for it to be brought back at the agreed time . 0 to 0pm it got to 00 : 00 no sign of car ring them .
2	what set it apart was the rewards programme - you can use clubcard_points to convert to cash , or to convert to airmiles , with extra rewards if you use the card in a tesco petrol_station .
2	quick , great choice , lots of additions and very easy to use !
2	i bought two jackets for my family this month they are so pleased with them
0	i will be back with more friends for more purchases !
2	but in saying this my son bought his computer through them 0years ago and was disappointed to find he had been sold a build windows disk and not the full pro pack that you get in the shop .
2	instead , on their tracking page the item remained " forwarded to : kowloon office hong_kong " for five days ., i rang the aramex office in ireland and the first time they hung_up on me .
0	so after contacting paypal and getting this info , i used my sisters account and got the money .

0	everything was confirmed , we had the pickup time of 00 . 00 .
0	if you are looking for a cheap nightstay but you are not too self confident in terms of your orientation and organisation skills , hostelbooker will help you , it s very comfortable to chose time and place on their page and they will you show wide offer , all presented in convenient form , and setting the matter after your choice takes honestly 0 min . if it seems that something happen and you could call off your travel , you can choose the option of payment protection when you are booking , so that your 00_% paid at booking will turn to another booking . thats a good possibilty , because the planned travel is never 000_% sure , but undoubtly i will_continue my booking with hostelbooker so my money stay there like in bank . and another matter , once my credit_card wasn t valid , they asked the hostel s manager to let me pay all at arriving , that was really nice of them and solved my problem in this case
0	serenataflowers did a great job , flower are lovely and the girl i sent them too really really loves them , however her special supprise was ruined when i was forced to phone her before they eventually arrived to be on the lookout for a package .

0	real happy with my purchase !
0	i used currencychange for eurgbp transactions they have always been , safe , reliable and quick .
0	my boyfriend was told that as the delivery arrived on the day requested , he would only get a refund of the delivery charge ( i don ' t agree with iflorist that delivery at 0pm to an office address when the office normally shuts at 0 . 00pm counts at successful delivery as it was rather luck that anyone was still in the office , never mind i , the recipient , didn ' t even get the iflorist flowers and won ' t get to enjoy them till the 00th of february when they are completely dead ).
0	when i finally received this there was a lose screw rattling around in the tower which unfortunately i cannot get to , pretty shoddy considering i paid over £ 0000 for this item , where is the qc checks apple ?
0	amazing people , amazing company and amazing service i am lost for words when it comes to the service from this fine establishment and i can_honestly truly say that me and my co - workers and friends are very happy all together .
0	if enough of us write to watch_dog we could save other people the misfortune of being out of pocket and unnecessarily stressed by wowcher and it ' s affiliate companies .
2	what i haven_'_t liked is the box it came in had no padding or protection for such an expensive item .
0	the tyres were very easy to view and order online , and when i phoned to speak to a member of the sales_team , the phone was answered_quickly and the guy i spoke to was very friendly , helpful , and knowledgeable .
2	they take money and don_'_t deliver or refund at all .
2	first_class service and competitive_prices .
2	i was really impressed with this site , easy to locate my favourite perfumes , even those really expensive ones , that are not in the shops .
2	i have left orange after 00 years as a customer .
2	what amazes_me is that i find a bargain , go to the till and am told that the price is even less , due to another sale !
2	flowers arrived on the correct day as promised , however , i was really disappointed to find that the deluxe moonlight bouquet was little better_than you see on a garage forecourt but at three or four times the price .
2	web_site clear and precise .
0	we raced in 0 sets of 0 with a short practise , qualifying and then approximately 00 laps on a 00 - 00 second / lap track .
2	the brighton team were excellent great service and lovely people .

0	however , payment is via_paypal , would have preferred other methods of payment .

2	i wish all sites were like this .
2	i wasn_'_t .
2	organised and supplied . i also visited the showroom which i highly_recommend the staff are knowledgable and very helpful
0	this site is very user_friendly , easy to navigate and find what you are looking for , as well as lots of information on each hostel .
0	the next e_- mail i received was completely unexpected , it was telling_me that , even_though the product was listed on the site , even_though they ' d let me place my order , even_though there was no indication that the product was out of stock , it was in fact , out of stock .
2	they don_'_t have the courtesy to inform you if they can '_t fulfill an order .
0	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
0	first order fine although received a few_days late .
2	as i was going away for two_weeks holiday i was not too concerned about the delay .
2	no contact number , tracking_numbers don_'_t work , two delivery dates missed and still not in possession of the package sent on the 00th !!!
2	game is today .
2	the company failed to respond to a request to swap the item in order to get something for christmas and have failed to respond to a request since christmas to cancel the order and refund .
0	keep up the good work !
2	i always take_advantage of trying new products for free that are offered at checkout .
0	paypal takes a lot too .
0	last weekend in budapest was fantastic thanks to the guys at chillisauce !
2	i have just had a fantastic service from sarah_hayes at parcel 0go
0	it ' s a shame for her as she wanted wellies people would turn to look at , now she ' s panicking that they might do exactly that !
0	i emailled them to say we hadn ' t received it .
2	i won_'_t be using them again or recommending them .
0	i recently visited the new store opening in middlesbrough ( on the grand opening day as well ) looking for a decent quality multimeter to test electronics .
0	when i told him i had to run it past my husband who was at work kept on saying he would hold or just book it and cancel later !
2	had very bad_experience with these_people and when , yes when ( because they will ) they lose your parcel they don_'_t make much of an effort to find it and instead just pretend that the tracking_number the they supplied does not exist ??????????
0	good points : woolworths seems to attract you in as if there is something you think you may need or you may have actully thought it never had it
2	an appliances_direct website that claims said dishwasher is out for delivery
2	i was telephoned to explain that my first order had to be directed to my credit_card address , which was not great for me but it is a policy for first orders so i was happy to respect that .
2	easy to use and delivered beyond expectations !
2	be warned - avoid extreme frustration and expense - do not deal with this company .
0	do you have special preference for some hostals ?
2	( hence three stars not two .)
0	even when i lost my way to find hostel , i don ' t need to be panic .
0	that is a great saving for what is essentially a newly_released title .
0	i had no problem with the reservation , everything was perfect and the most_important is that they don ' t charge you a cent for booking online .
2	the heater fan was buzzing occasionally and it had a slight groan on the steering at low speeds so i was going to mention these item too .
0	items generally turn_up when expected , sometimes a bit bashed though and their own delivery drives can be a bit moody .
0	emma was very helpful on chat today .
2	well_worth sorting_out all your old_phones and getting some money back for them .
0	we ' re a business open 0 - 0 yet they claim they tried to deliver and left a card .

0	been using viovet for some time now as my pet needs medication on a fairly regular_basis .
2	told repayment had been authorised on 00 / 0 .
2	i won , but he still tried to wangle out of payment .
0	would most definitely use again !
2	with excellent quality food on offer , why oh why don_'_t sainsburys provide enough staff at their checkouts ?
0	besides ; me sending it back won ’ t be worth it as the item is £ 0 . 00 ( including tax ) and p_& p ( postage and packaging ) is near enough £ 0 . 00 and me sending it back would be about the same and you people probably won ' t refund return_postage so i ' ll be left with £ 0 . 00 .
2	cancel order and buy from amazon - cost £ 0 more ; item delivered friday .
0	sarah and ben
0	i have only used the products for a few_days , but i will post another review after i give some time for the products to do their work .

2	the seats , as promised , were fantastic , block b , row j - 0 rows from the stage .
2	the part i ordered came the next_day and the company kept me informed at all times when delivery would be .
0	you would think it ' s not unreasonable to deliver flowers to an office address within normal working hours , not after 0 . 00pm .

2	the night before collection , we used online facility to extend the rental period and request a collection earlier in the day .
0	either my hermes is really bad - or quite simply their customer advisors need some good training .
0	eventually , after_speaking to someone at the staff entrance , they finally let me in .
0	i gave up .
2	when i responded asking where that might be , and whether they meant a dhl delivery depot rather_than the royal_mail , there was silence .
2	you have to return them 0st_class recorded delivery and have a tracking_number , this cost me nearly_£ 0 . 00 , why i don_'_t know as you cant speak to anyone regarding returns and they don_'_t respond to enquires through email .
2	ok but no need for the hassle .
0	what is the system ?

0	this company is diabolical !
2	the guarantee was invalid and i was expected to pay a massively inflated amount for this warranty which would not have been valid if i had tried to use it due to a number of reasons .
2	i will never do_business with groupon again and say to anyone interested in listening , beware what you buy with this company .
2	i have traveled with thomson three_times now , usually prefering to travel with kuoni .
2	i take great umbridge to being subjected to these awful television adverts that are only there to imprint those numbers into your brain at the exclusion of other good companies that cant_afford the advertising .
0	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
2	although there was some difficulty getting the watch exactly when i wanted i was kept up to date with the order process .
0	there is no card .
0	as the leg was like this from delivery i do not except their answer of weathering .
0	i ' ve always found trustworthy , inexpensive places to stay through them ( and their prices really are the cheapest among the other hostel sites .
0	the answer we received was that its no there problem well im sorry but if i am putting my faith in your company to complete a simple_task as to delivery my parcel to me in one piece so of us quite clearly can not do their job properly .

2	i would and have certainly recommend wowcher to others .
0	initially , budgetair said that it would take 00 - 00 weeks to refund me the ticket amount , but they wouldn ' t refund the flight booking_fee , credit_card costs or airline failure service .
2	i have since heard from time talk and they have decided to credit me back the £_00 because as they admitted their salesperson had made a mistake in allowing me to believe they would simply pay back the breakage fee .
0	it might be the cheapest broadband provider in the uk but certainly not the best .
2	tv now working perfect .
2	m

2	the other three pairs she could not even get them past her knees .
0	for bundles of features and seriously quick internet at an affordable price i would recommend them .
2	very , very pleased i used age_partnership to arrange my pension_annuity .
2	i only have one thing could gave been done better !!!!
0	the team comes across incompetent and incapable to assist particularly with international deliveries !
0	they were the first to pop up on google lol so i hopped on it and took my chances .
0	where do i begin ?
2	instead they advised us to go to " their own " website and putt in the car details and we would be given a price .
0	the same was experienced when i rang up to place the order ; very pleasant and courteous .
0	would highly_recomend to anyone .
2	ordered some speg training tights at the weekend , and they arrived first thing tuesday_morning , well_packaged and a perfect_fit !
0	it was processed on the 00th day and i was told the correct_size would be sent out as soon as possible .
0	your rubbish !
0	the order was accepted and i received a confirmation e_- mail but when i view my account the order has disappeared and i have not received any tracking_number at all ( you would have thought this was essential right ?).
2	same lady .
0	we ' ve ordered a lot of times through mine and my partners account .
0	basically they are not the ones that do the delivery , they arrange it for you !
0	which i guess would be fine in most_cases , but in our case they couldn ' t type the special character in the middle of my name .
0	transaction_id_0000000
0	being summer i wanted something flowery and vibrant .
2	after experiences of john_lewis ( nice stores but difficult to try anything out and very limited for real hifi separates ) and richer_sounds ( the less said the better ), i was very pleasantly_surprised to find that the old_fashioned approach of courtesy , helpfulness and expert friendly advice could still be found in the high tech age !
0	ordered a tv online and was told the delivery would be between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm during the week , so i had to take an afternoon off work to make_sure i was in the house to accept the delivery .
0	after the last card i contacted yodel to explain what had happened and they said i could pick it up from the local_depot .
2	i knew which hotel i wanted to stay in , i just needed the best price .
0	this company are ripping people off !
2	• writing to your chairman expressing my concern
0	i emailed again .
2	hermes is also more difficult to track than collect +.
0	i would happily_recommend to others , great experience dealing_with this company .
2	i have just used blackcircles for the first time and have to say that i was very impressed .
0	ordered a ps0 game for £_00 , arrived very quickly and well_packaged but somehow the case for the game had got smashed ( i ' m blaming royal_mail ) i sent a email to customer_service and got a reply back only 00_mins later saying they would send out a replacement case .
2	really cannot_fault this company !
2	i offered to send them the necklaces to look at the quality but they said they were a voucher company and did not wish to see the goods .
0	the fact that he said a customer is wrong is just plain stupid .
2	never buy anything from merlin_cycles .
0	definitely_recommend to anyone_wanting to buy cd_keys ( or even replacement disc / box / manuals !)
2	also storing the different addressees is handy when time is tight online .
0	all correspondence i have had with this company will be being sent to trading_standards and also watchdog and would suggest everyone_else do the same .
0	they got the best prices , i love there products
0	0 .
0	they have no contact number , which is extremely irritating , and to make it worse they do not respond to all emails .
2	i do think this service is getting poor , i remeber you could get your first bid within 00min it was excepted , not now the bids are ridiclous its laughable , my wife used the same courier , s if she can , courier , s come and go . my wife as used this service for 0yrs , it was great , courier were reliable , you got a good service all_round , i used this service because its straigt forward but you do wait a long time for a good bid offer
2	the parcel always comes on the right day , i get texts and e_- mails to tell me its on its way , and the driver is courteous friendly and helpful .
2	inquired about the purchase of samsung blue_ray ; was advised that it was out of stock with no know re - stock date and a suggestion that i should purchase a more_expensive unit that i did not want .
0	therefore the argos one was returned after 0 night .
2	i ' m looking into it and i '_ll let you know asap
0	a group of 00 lads on stag wanting to have a good time !
0	strong advise to all of you , never ever ever switch to talk_talk .
0	the parcels are always on time and they keep you well informed as to when your parcel was dispatched and where it is now .
2	when i contacted cheap_smells they refused to honour gift .
2	however of late the company is constantly updating their products and the new models are unrliable and so becoming too expensive to continue with .
2	they have fast shipping to keep me going and keep me healthy .
2	the stand in driver had " scanned all their deliveries wrong ", whatever that means .
2	sammie_taylor speedily got to the root of the delivery problem in a friendly and professional_manner and completely put my mind at ease that the parcel will be speedily re - delivered to my client .
0	its annoying because i cant complete the tests .
0	sadly , i did not read these before i sent my perfectly good iphone .
0	i did find , however , that the course itself came with a lot of non - mandatory , but highly_recommended extra - costs , such as buying a manual and exams .
2	resultant photos acceptable , could be better .
2	oh and the prices are good too !
0	i was pretty impressed with this website .
2	will use this site again .
0	all the best for your future .
0	thursday 0pm , still no parcel , i called customer_services again and to my surprise there is no record on the system regarding my parcel .
2	arrived at pisa and there was no queue so we had the comprehensive sales_pitch to sell us the extra insurance as otherwise we would have to pay € 0000 excess ( this amount was reserved on my credit_card anyway and paying € 00 per day extra wouldn_'_t have changed this ).
2	eventually rang the company to be told it was a good half / three quarters of a mile away which we had to negotiate with heavy cases and inadequate directions .
0	the order processing took a little longer_than_expected which is fair as the deal must be very popular .
2	i have tried telephoning better_bathrooms , was kept waiting with no reply for 00mins , i have emailed better_bathrooms customer_services and had no reply .
0	customer_service was okay however they agreed to give me a money off code because of the issue yet i never received this until i had to email them once again asking for it .
0	no manners !
0	i haven ' t actually used it yet ( and i assume it will have expired by now ) but it was only 0 %_off anyway and i haven ' t seen anything online that i ' ve wanted to buy from them since .
2	i have ordered replica chanel embossed crocodile flap bag and have never received .
2	we have been using hyve for almost 0 years now for email , website and application hosting using site to site vpn as well .
0	they claim all_sorts of excuses but fail to realise that all the delivery locations i have specified have cctv so can easily prove that they are lying .
0	when i phoned i was told that the parcel had not left the warehouse and after a bit of haggling i was offered a refund on the delivery onto my card or the amount refunded as loyalty_points .
2	there are a number of companies i have dealt_with in the past who would have been put to shame by such welcome and responsive customer_services offered by procook .
2	this company really must try a lot harder because they are rapidly sliding down the pan .
2	mr_memory interceded and helped get my order to me on the 0rd attempt and my next_day delivery premium was refunded .
2	roger
0	have some , and worry_about thieving uk gov
0	the service i received in store at bluewater was also fantastic .
0	paid for an early morning delivery of an item .
0	what ?????
0	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer_service lines .
2	i think i was polite and composed however it is really beginning to get my goat .
2	in short , they make themselves rather unreachable .
0	my iphone was coming with yodel .
0	i find that theres not enough information on what products they regularly sell , only information on the special_offers
0	i used found them extremely_helpful .
0	will not use again !
0	also i didn ' t got any payment today , as representative promised .
0	products are okay but then service needs to be more professional .
2	product quality was ok but fixing screws missing from one box so not checked before dispatch . luckily i had some plugs and screws that i could use but could have been most annoying if i had to go and buy some .
2	just returned from a 0month trip around singapore , australia , new_zealand and thailand , one of the legs from sydney to bangkok was on ba00 , and i must_say that the service on business class is not what it used to be .
2	i have just had to suffer 00_hours without electricity due to utility_warehouse ’_s non - existent out of hours support .
2	where do i start ?
0	which was fine just wished they would have told be before hand .
0	communication was excellent throughout .
2	have been very very impressed with diy kitchens .
2	item arrived within a few_days and i will_definately_use them again .
2	keep away if you value your watch .
0	thank_you dreams for finally understanding my concerns .
2	their online_chat option is excellent and sam austen on the evening of 00 . 0 . 00 was more than helpful in getting my query sorted , thanks matey .
2	probably my fault but be warned .
2	however the taste is poor and the pods are really cheap and don_'_t seem to be solidly packed with coffee .
0	i ' m returning the boots i bought because they didn ' t fit , which at_least i can do in store but will lose out on delivery .
2	a most unsatisfactory experience and i won_'_t be ( not ) doing_business with them again .
0	ma la brutta copia a ah aha ha hahahah aha
0	the delivery date come and went with no communication from them .
0	communication was excellent and they also went the extra_mile by offering help and advice .
0	i ' ve found them to be fast in delivering completed images and they do a very neat job .
2	no further calls from the company no pick_up from the company at 0000 hours and as such a local taxi picked us up at 0000 hours and deposited us at the airport at 0000 without_any hassle .
0	and had an initial response time of 00 seconds or even less .
0	all the shirts and jumper fitted_perfectly and i will_definitely use this service again .
2	avoid this company .
0	on the other , trying to get them to do work on the bike themselves is an_absolute chore .
0	i highly_recommend them as first choice .
0	i can ' t actually believe the poor customer_service .
0	i was informed my chairs and cushions would be with me in four move weeks .
0	on the 00nd , i contact home discount at 00 : 00 to try and find out the courier and they came back quickly saying it was xdp and gave me a consignment_number which i looked up .
2	i was a customer of another isp up until a couple of months_ago .
2	a review for the main superstore in thetford , norfolk .
0	i ' ve bought and sold on ebay many_times , and i think its a fantastic website once you know what your doing , but intially it will take a while to fatherm it out , which is a shame .
0	hostelbookers is cheaper_than the competition and at worst as reliable and at best far more reliable .
0	if they would just be honest and put made to order on their site it would have saved me a lot of annoyance .
0	i hadn ' t met my neighbour before , so it was a good job she was honest , otherwise i may never have seen my printer !
0	i wish she didn ’ t repeat it so often because before this conversation i had no_intention of writing this review .
0	when they turned_up i said i thought she was coming the day before she just shrugged .
2	so it was a flight of two halves for me .
2	delighted many_thanks .
2	thank_you

0	items we have bought include , printers , inks , cds , cases , flash_drives , cd readers , speaker systems and various hard ware / motherboards / soundcards etc .
0	you can reply as a company even when you are not the company .
2	they have admitted to seining out fake solicitors letters and charged their customers for them .
2	hope this will help others avoid same hassle .

2	all in all orange are liars and cheats who offer the worst customer service i have had from any mobile or telecommunications company .
0	they always have stock of the product that i am looking for , they are always competitive on price and deliveries and both speedy and efficient .
2	in response to an order placed on a sunday_afternoon
2	they dont do weekend delivery using dpd !!
0	they attempt to deliver your package , then leave a card with no reference_number , just the mobile number of the person who tried to deliver the package .
2	dir .
2	i tend to forget to ask to be parked by the lift . due to a disability .
0	they still attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
0	i can now express my feelings and tell others about my experience about different shope i have bought with !
0	so in summary , terrible customer_service , we are in the process of making a complaint and hopefully we will get our money back and reimbursed for the voucher we used .
0	flight : klm
2	ordered epiphone ukulele and belcat 00w slim amp on monday and tracked until thursday when they said that they had tried to deliver but they hadn_'_t so after several phone_calls to yodel they managed to phone their driver who was in next village so arranged to meet at coop to pick_up package ( never really wanted to be a courier ) his excuse was that his sat_nav sent him wrong . any way product is good although it came without pick guard and amp was not slim one as ordered ( but not worried_about this .) i would recommend this firm as i think courier was at fault .
2	they did the work and pointed_out some other issues that needed attention in the future .
0	i ' ve been an orange customer for years - i ' ve had all_sorts of problems from niggles with rude customer_service to being overcharged by £_000 .
0	neively originally booking a cheap trip to ibiza in 0000 where alpharooms placed us in a room with two single beds ( after requesting a double ).
0	after my third enquiry , a week after my original enquiry , i received a completely unhelpful reply , telling_me to call their number instead , which no doubt will cost .
0	this is the third time ive used mazuma , each time we have found it so quick and easy .
2	so , if a collection is not made , you can ’ t get hold of the company until the next_day !
0	very competitive on pricing and rapid delivery .
2	previous dealing was with the nottingham branch who i found more than helpful so there are a few staff that can do what they can .
0	the person loved it and the fact that it was personalized because she can never find anything with her name on it !
0	this was after various calls to 0000 numbers which has cost me god_knows in phone_calls .
2	often travel leeds / bradford to malaga .
2	however , i moved_house , and that was the beginning of a very sorry_saga .
2	i would be grateful for any advice as i have 00 packs of porridge !!!
2	hail google !
2	said they would sent out last_week still_waiting .
2	also , could i ' phone the branch on the thursday_morning to make_sure the tyres were there .
2	orange should be struck off or something !
0	i have now cancelled my breakdown_cover .
2	another arrived , again it took far too long
2	one small item wasn_'_t in stock , but gear0music quickly sent that on to me as soon as they had one in stock , and that too arrived with me the day after the rest of my stuff !
0	which meant i would be back at work and unable to receive delivery .
2	he always
2	when it wasn_'_t my fault .
0	this rating would have been a 0 if it wasn ' t for the fact half the things i like sell out quickly .
0	they couldn ' t even guarantee that my glasses would even turn_up !
2	if you miss a delivery , trying to re - arrange it is like pulling teeth without an anaesthetic !
2	could it be changed i said , expecting a fight .
2	i have been a catalogue customer for a number of years and yodel took over the courier service .
0	so a big saving right ?
2	prewrapped cheese is a rip - off compared to the cheeses counter .
0	cannot say more_than that , very impressed .
0	i won ' t be doing_business again with this company if sales are all they are interested in .
0	!
2	great system but has a little problem listening to it '_s users
2	i '_ve found that by the time accommodation becomes free for all to contact , the best ones are already gone .
2	i sent for 0 pairs of leggins in the sale at £ 0 . 00 a pair . the sizes were 00 / 00 and m / l to fit my daughter who is a size 00 , but only one pair was a perfect_fit and another pair fit ok .
2	turned engine off , definate knock .
0	might use collect_+ again , but i am not necessarily impressed .
2	my skycadie rangefinder was not lasting the 00 holes , i searched on line and found that bestbattery . biz sell a complete range of batteries for gps .
2	with no time to run out and buy flowers and worry_about getting parked etc this was a godsend .
2	i find it unbelievable that there isn ’ t an_emergency contact point within utility_warehouse when something like this happens – the fitter who was eventually sent to replace the meter yesterday lunchtime said that he was available and on call the night before as lowie beck were aware of the situation with the substation fire .
2	i have since this order was completed ordered some audio technica ath - m00fs headphones , and they , like the bigger order arrived_safely and very quickly .
0	been trying to reach scottish_power for 0 days now .
0	super_fast delivery , i placed my order just after 0pm , it arrived the morning next_day !
0	when i first booked the gentleman was great and we set_up suitable activities and times .
0	they are ok
0	i have used the site before without any_problems but since this i have realised that their returns_policy is a joke .
0	and they will ignore any claims you make if any of the items of the shipment was damaged , so if it something broke in your shipment , good luck hearing back from them .
0	have purchased two games from cdkeys . com . au
2	i booked a collection with yodel00 ( 00 . 00_hours . this is a joke believe me ) for monday .
2	thank_you
2	however , the product did arrive in a reasonable amount of time and i am pleased with the camera .
0	placed order on 00 / 00 /_0000 worth £_00 . 00 .
0	would definitely use them again .
2	on the aircraft though they fall back into the ignorant misserable look .
0	this means i won ' t be ordering items form here often .
2	this was one of the very best ways of collecting airmiles until recently .
0	ive been with vodafone for a while but my friends have better deals and offers .
0	i have been made aware that the new frames will be dispatched on monday ( today ) and should be with me mid week - they also wavered £_00 since the frames i chose were more_expensive that the original pair .
2	great prices if you wait for a sale , but the quality of their gear varies wildly .
2	i was disappointed when my order for perspex sheeting arrived with every sheet broken .
2	no one to talk to at cheaptickets .
0	they didn ' t .
2	so we contacted the company from which we bought the item .
0	i must_admit i was slightly skeptical ordering from digitalrev , especially because i had never_heard of this site but went_ahead with the purchase of my hs00exr fujifilm camera based on excellent reviews i had read about their services - i was not disappointed !
2	when i dialled the number i got an operator who claimed they were signing_up customers to a new account .
0	avoid at all costs !
0	in peopleperhour i found a pool of talented people that were just there when i needed them .
2	sellers get none .
2	there is a varied_selection of vitamins & minerals & the only problem is you want so many of them .
0	i have a good anti virus so have tried on a couple of different files and all do exactly the same .
2	all in all a pleasure to do_business with .
0	0nd lie : i was never called back by the mighty person capable to make the judgement call on my case
0	steve
2	for clothing , mm accepts only a limited number of labels and the item descriptions on the website are not always how you would describe an item .
2	the branch was faultless , though i did have to wait about 00_minutes which i would have done if i ' d just turned_up .
0	they are only after your money , don ' t care about the clients .
0	i have used iflorist before , they have always been punctual and the flowers are always high_quality and last a long time .
2	doesn_'_t sound right at all hence lowered review rating .
0	i searched this shop by online .
2	thank_you for your enquiry .
0	the mobile checkins are great as these are not included in the retention fee , but sometimes the app has problems and you cannot check in .
2	they are good people to do a bit of business with .
2	i ring .
0	simply_games have always been a reliable online presence for me and with the big names failing in their customer_service obligations lately ( game ' s delivery time is terrible and amazon have whacked their prices up now that hmv and play are gone ) they ' re well placed to take a lot of my custom .
2	i needed to set_up the shower room , so asked her to email instructions .
2	the pc is great looking and from my son really good spec .
0	their autokey distribution system is very easy to use once your purchase has been paid for .
2	they couldn_'_t give a monkey '_s .
0	doesn ' t deserve a star .
0	oh_yeah . it is somewhat hard to connect to customer_service chat .
0	not only did it take more_than several phone_calls and emails to alpharooms to actually establish our travelling vouchers and baggage_allowance ( we were told two bags for the hold and then just one , then two again .) encountering a range of ' customer sales representatives ( 0 out of 0 were english ), the rest were foreign who could barely understand , nor speak_english fluently themselves ( great idea for customer_service placements ).
0	would go again , but doubt i will ever get that price again , £_000 for the week !
2	great chocolates , great services and delivered in good time with nice wrapping .
0	it never happened .
2	i would advise people not to go_anywhere_near them , as there products are no good .
2	then when that deadline expired , in another couple of days , then , when that deadline expired , another week .
2	i would never use them again and never recommend them to anyone !
2	edition 00 makes some bugs .
2	all have eventually been paid .
0	transaction_id :_0000000
0	i don ' t begrudge paying over the odds for an event of a lifetime but the stress of thinking we ' re not going to get to go is awful .
0	to my suprise they had sent them to the wrong part of the country despite having my adress .
2	the lenses were excellent , but one had split , i contacted customer service via_email & there response was to send both contact_lenses back with a full_refund , i am a really happy customer who would certainly recommend this company !
2	also the transfer service for gold_car at fiumicino is a nightmare , 0_seater minibuses and a scrum to get on one competing with parkinggo car_park clients . not good when there are 0 of you and two are elderly ( age reduces scrumming ability ).
0	mr and mrs preston
0	the worst part is every one else can make a review with out the need for trust_pilot to take it down ask to change then send an_email asking why you made it .
2	thanks for the quick delivery , and the really excellent communication .
2	when i tried to complain , they lied again and the person i spoke to claimed he was the sole director of the company and he was the only one i could complain to .
2	sammie was from start to finish more than help and really gets the idea of what a good customer service assistant is all about , and deserves to be more than the customer service assistant and others would learn from them .
2	fantastic as so good with staff available 00 / 0 who do a wonderfull job . first_class in every_respect .
2	you will be the first_port of call in future .
2	£_00 for a room , looks very good but parking and internet add £_00 per night so in reality it was £_00 per night , again not bad but this should be the advertized price

2	it has still yet to arrive , we have been assured it will arrive today .
2	i am not impressed with this season '_s clothes which veer from dated and boring to quirky and overpriced .
2	purchasing from handles0doors , is very straightforward on their website and they arrive on the date promised .
0	however , all the goodness is destroyed by power hungry moderators who get a kick out of suspending someone at every opportunity , regardless of whether in the rules or not .
0	to this day , i still_haven ' t heard from them and the deal is long gone .
2	just waiting for confirmation from my son that he has managed to collect it from the office in his apartment complex .
0	i don ' t really like to shop in tesco although there fruit and veg is good , but i have found horrible bits of meat in pasta pots ect and there was an orange fly in a packet of crisps i brought in a meal deal .
0	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
0	i bought a shirt as a gift last christmas and the service i received from the staff at uk soccer shop was excellent .
2	hotpoint htv00s stainless_steel visor cooker_hood .
2	and matches the quality of the electric_guitar i brought a few_months_ago .
2	re - scheduled for tuesday and waited in all day and ditto no - one came .
2	given ziffit and music_magpie can pay via bacs i see this as a weekness in the zapper propostition
2	absolutely superb website but has dropped its usual standards due to the following sellers :- zoverstocks = fantastic prices & when the orders are correct , 00_% of the time they are in excellent condition . but , they take far too long to dispatch items , which seem to be getting longer & longer .

2	he arranged for a replacement to be fitted , when i pointed_out the likelihood of rain he told me they would cover the range_rover with a canopy attached to their van .
0	nah forget it because it costs more in p_& p for multiple items .
0	warum ?

0	such a hard website to navigate

0	talktalk is not a reliable company .
0	i could not recommend this company and if you are based outside the uk avoid them .
2	so they have the monopoly on it , but sorry guys the internets here .
0	my one honest tip is , this is not special amazing food , it is stuff you can make a lot tastier and cheaper , it is just smaller portions .
0	the service is shockingly disgusting .
0	getting home at 00 : 00 , i breathe a sigh of relief as the tracking_info stays the same , there ' s no card , so i sit_down to wait .
0	i understand it is where they make their money , but is not ethical to do it on our fear .

2	may 00th : " you will be paid in 00_hours ."

0	i had an issue with my phone and emailed them for a follow_up . of which i am still_awaiting a reply and that is now 0 weeks .
2	excellent service , good prices , prompt delivery .
2	when they finally do read it you will get a bunch of patronising garbage about how great they are and not much else .
2	this is the third parcel in a row that '_s taken ages to deliver . yes i too have the message on the tracking service , card left , which is never in my door , then next_day unable to find . my last parcel of knitting wool from turkey was in my local_depot the very next_day from dispatch . and then took 0 working_days to get 00 miles up the road . customer_services are rude and unhelpful , and my local_depot never answers the phone or replies to messages left . i have made formal complaints on their forms but never_heard back . in future i will find out who the seller will use to deliver my parcel before i buy .
0	well , i purchased " steelseries siberia " headphones and i assumed that everything would be nicely_packaged .

2	i have therefore had to take additional leave .
0	i have had exactly the same problems as he has .
2	0 days of use and the fabric split .
2	the delivery will take a few_days but the driver was very friendly unlike_some other company drivers !
0	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn ' t expect such shoddy service , i think it ' s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people ' s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
0	having shelled out all that money , we would have expected more !
2	i bought 0 pcs together which was very fortunate because it enabled_me to compare them before turning anything on .
0	my only issue is the cost of returns .
2	we did and we waited for 00_minutes which at 0am is a long time , only to have to phone them again to find that the driver had been waiting on chairs facing away from the cars .
2	what was i supposed to do ?
2	what actually arrived was two bunches of white tulips that looked like they were on there last legs .
2	which meant i cannot mix them with my left over ’_s .
2	the website is one of the best laid_out i '_ve seen .

2	after about 0 months of hearing nothing and when i contacted them being met with confusion over what i ' d ordered what they had received from the supplier and other issues i decided to cancel the order .
0	i want the manager of the company to read this and ensure that their staff are retrained and updated on selling regulations , as you have good pushchairs but really really really bad aftercare and this can massively affect your business .
0	in the end i arranged for a credit_card charge back as this company had failed to send all the products .
0	the best dedicated online games shop on the web - great games , great prices , speedy dispatch , texts / emails / picture updates to let me know that my order has been processed , packed & sent .
2	i even posted a couple of reviews of companies i had bought from and after_reading comments about companies i was thinking of buying from changed my mind about them and tried another company which had good reviews .
0	i was offered a quote within £_000 of the final price i paid swiss watches , the watch was in stock and the fitting would have been free .
0	the rep was great , the hotel fab and the skiing great .
0	after having the glasses sent back to them so they could send them off to the right person they finally got hear on the 0th of may .
0	the actual product and delivery were good and on time but i had problems placing my order .
0	i have ordered several_times from this site and while i can ' t fault the prices , i don ' t like the fact they will buy things as f grade and sell them on as a or b !!!!

2	does it fit flush against the wall ?)
2	this shouldn_'_t be necessary at all if i click on an invitation to review email .
2	they need to give better customer service .
2	our rates are the same for both readings as we no_longer have ' economy 0 '.

2	what else could one ask for ?
0	plus i got another meerkat toy .
0	i mean there is not much i can say accept the fact that the prices are low and the time in which i received the key was under 0 min .
0	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn ' t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn ' t as special .

0	update 0th_january_0000 : just received what i believe should be a retention campaign to keep customers .
2	i had a very prompt reply to tell me that company is no_longer a marketplace vendor .
2	now contacted their customer_services by their emailed ' ticket ' system and await their response to wether the meat is indeed consumable still as it is right at the limit of the 00_hours and all the packing had melted .
2	i bid my time and waited for the 00 days to expire which they duly did .
0	i am very impressed with the discounts on the close to expired stuff that saves us a ton of money for quality supplements .
2	i had to use my bt landline to contact them as i had no signal at home .
0	for the rest of us , this is not exactly ideal .
2	rolex_submariner arrived_safely as_described this morning .

2	with printing . com we have been delighted to find a locally based printing company which is very approachable and affordable , and which offers a design and print service to an extremely high_standard , which we feel reflects the quality of our shows .
0	each reply was a half - assed attempt and each time they told me i was wrong and that it was correctly listed .
0	prices were slightly lower_than on ebay , but you do have to pay for delivery :(
2	i still have no_idea what is happening .
0	it didn ' t happen !!!
2	!
0	the company also tends to have exclusive offers such as the special ' epic ' edition of gears of war 0 .
0	i will_definitely be shopping here again !
2	the ordering_process was fine , although i found the website a little_confusing as they have so many items at so many different prices , with similar descriptions that it is difficult to decide , from the limited information available , what is best suited to your requirements and your price range .
2	as long as you don_'_t expect them to stock any of the stuff they advertise on the website they are ok for the odd deal .

0	the plumbing engineers i used from pgs were friendly , punctual and did high_quality work .

0	the flowers turned_up at the office at 0pm and it was only by pure luck someone was still in my office to sign for them , but considering i ' m on holiday now till the 00th of february (!!!!
0	i have had issues with dpd before where they have delivered to the wrong_address and just left the package on the doorstep .
2	good , helpful and effective communication .
0	the whole_thing took under half an_hour which is an eye opener compared to the 0 hour wait i suffered at kwick fit .
0	i cannot_fault anything from this company .
0	took about 0 days to arrive but strangely i ended_up getting a postage refund , tesco said it was delayed : s , so the phone only cost £_00 delivered :)
0	0_stars !!
2	sure pricing is ok but just so they save the vat they split orders into amounts that are less_than £_00 or something .
0	i first contacted them around the 0th of august wanting answers as to when my glasses would be delivered i received no reassurance all i got was something completely_different that didn ' t answer any_questions !
0	after going down to my local dreams store i had no_idea what i wanted after half an_hour i had purchased 0 beds and one tempa mattress .
0	i shipped a 00 lb bowling ball through ups for under $_00 and yet i have to pay over $_00 in shipping charges for half the weight .
0	the above message was in red and bold .
0	this evening i have had an_email_saying dispached .
0	item dispatch was fast as was delivery .
2	and all for a third of the price quoted by royal_mail !
2	the pallet holding the bench and shelving would have required an industrial fork lift truck to unload , so we had to cut all the packaging off and unload it piece by piece .
0	i will_definitely use them again .
0	but you ’ re never going to believe what they said next , remember the item came to me faulty .
2	could have done without the stress .
2	i use the re - conditioned cartridges for my epson photo px000w and have had no_problems to date .
2	in december it had collapsed .
0	what ' s more important is that when i didn ' t know how to find what i wanted or had questions , their awesome customer support was there to assist me and help me move on .
0	i ' ve been using different e liquids for a while but struggled to find ones that actually have a proper taste and vape .
0	they really are utterly rubbish and incompetent .
2	promised and delivered .
0	the webpage is easy to use and great for any given occasion .
2	i am very pleased to have found this source .
2	basically , they would replace but not refund .
2	obviously , more incompetent shambles - less pursued complaints !.
0	do not order from them .
2	it does go to show that persistence and sound_advice / help from flattv parts can have positive_outcome .
0	( sold some old nokias ).
2	very good value .
2	i am sure my equipment will turn_up promptly and as ordered .
2	thank_you .
2	led light_bulbs are very new and certain sizes hard to find . blt direct are presently the only supplier i have found who supply sbc fit in led . good service , reasonable price i will_certainly use them again , and recommend blt direct .
2	avoid this company like the plague !!!
0	distressed , i used the order tracker online to track my order and was told that the details i had used were flagged up in the system and needed further verification .
2	i am a genuine customer of repairs0 - and have documented emails to prove their inability to repair my ipad .
0	very simple and easy process would gladly use them again
0	did the job quickly and to a high_standard .
2	then the nightmare begins .
2	don_'_t know if i would order from them again as you have to pay for delivery normally .
2	i lost my phone number and this was a major inconveience .
0	they really didn ' t seem to care that i was annoyed with their service either .
0	great place , in good spot with nice night club , everyone seen friendly , cheap would be wonderful if the materass were bit more comfortable anyway i will suggest to anyone
2	had further orders to place such as tiles and accessories inorder to complete the room . will be going else where .
0	som jeg_ikke føler at der bliver gjort ordenligt opmærksom på ( og selv fakturaen nævner det kun indirekte ved at lægge gebyret til buketprisen . så ser det jo nok lidt mindre farligt ud ?).
0	if you cantravel with just hand_luggage you do generally work out cheaper , but it ' s never as convenient and the airport is generally quite far away from its description
0	on returning home i rang resort_hoppa to complain and ask for a refund and they told me to email their customer_services ( who you can ' t contact via phone ).
2	funny that .
2	it showed " delivered to porch " two day ago !
0	so i had to stay in hostel .
2	however , i don_'_t want anything posted on my fb page or anything notified to friends which you try and sneak through .
2	zapper is great if you have a load of old books that you '_ve read and no_longer need which are taking up space .
0	disgusted by the product .
2	since i have changed , i am not able to get a wireless signal anywhere in the house .
0	i have never had an issue with the website , delivery of the items or the items that were delivered ( i . e .
2	i was surprised but attached it to an e_- mail on the same day .
0	not good . but hey , that ' s not sunglasses_shop ' s fault .
2	i explained orange had agreed to pay the balance .
2	!!
0	they called me next_day to inform me that the product is out of stock and that they will receive new stock on monday .
0	thank_you , from a very happy customer !
2	will_definitely_use again .
0	i highly_recommend you to do not worry to deliver your iphone blindly to official_iphone_unlock .
0	it ' s where i shop for protein , as their prices are great .
0	third time i have used mazuma and again it was great all_round .
0	0 weeks_ago i cancelled my order with dreams and demanded a full_refund ( phone and email ) and was told someone would get back to me on the matter to arrange the refund .
0	thank_you taunton_leisure .
0	their most annoying habit is their drivers that don ' t leave a card when attempting delivery , it ' s like they expect us to be mind readers !
2	when i rang on monday the chaps said the paypal thing was a bit of an issue which needed to be ironed out and he would recall the laptop , refund me and ring me when it turned_up to see waht i wanted to do .
2	cafe is handy , some branches better_than others .
2	love the video of items for comparison .
2	then wait for your main course .
2	will use this company again
0	so i brought a new shirt in the sale on 00 / 00 / 00
2	i received my two_pairs of glasses , one for reading the other for tv etc .
2	since then , no refunds but plenty more bills !
2	this is with allianz ,
2	i was a little disappointed that i could still hear the car radio , when i was trying to listen to an audio book .
0	i booked my hen_weekend through chillisauce and found the service to be excellent .
2	00 ( very small 0 " high numbers ).
0	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .
2	suddenly decided i needed another £_000 of euros so ordered £_000 for the free delivery ( being a yorkshireman ) they arrived today tuesday 00th_september and i fly away to samos in greece on thursday 00th_september .
2	couldn_'_t ask for more !
0	thank_you parcel 0 go .
0	i spoke to emma through the live help and she was excellent !
0	another think i don ' t like - its additional surcharges for paying with cc .
0	don ' t write off your local official dealer before getting their best quote .
2	good company , item arrived very quickly .
0	after ordering a guitar which wasn ' t in stock ( my error , not theirs !)
0	i had a looka round numerous sites for a long time thinking which one is a honest and true trustworthy website to buy from .
0	if you bet even just a couple of times a month , you really should be using oddschecker to get best value !
0	completely incompetent and unreliable !
0	instant key delivery , very happy what more can you ask for =)
0	thanks
2	i arranged for city_link to collect a wheel / tyre in london on the 0th_december_0000 .
2	00_minutes later good news and bad_news .
2	0 hours after activation i re - entered the caravan expecting to see dead insects and crawlers but only found live ones who seemed un bothered with the very small_amount of smoke produced by this product .
0	i thought this was strange again and then discovered that they are allowed 00 days to check for a fault .
2	they never do .
2	virgin games is a good all rounder , if you want to experience the thrill and fun of playing bingo and slots . i must_say they have by far the best selection of slots of any site , you can also play them in demo mode , so you can try them out before playing for cash to see which ones you prefer .
0	thank printing . com !
2	never rely_on a single source for this sort of data .
0	i had to sign into my account and cancel it manually , where i was faced with the most outrageous and miserable cancellation process i ' ve seen in my entire life - involving ticking several check boxes etc .
0	the delivery driver sounded a bit hacked off , but i explained that it was the fault of the customer_services .
0	very happy with the packaging and the fast and i mean fast delivery .
2	to make_matters worse i was told i was not forced to pay the line_rental in advance , then told i could have the service if i paid for a new line , another £_00 . 00 please , i checked the possibility of this with tt sales and was told it was impossible .
0	:) having said that , i really_enjoyed roulette too .
0	same here !
2	good prices and prompt delivery .
0	the same products , with same quality and same standard , i ' ve seen else where sold for even low_prices , e . g .
2	flowers as_described , although next_day delivery did not happen until 0pm .
2	what a let_down . avoid this company at all costs
0	when these_guys say ' next_day ' delivery - they arent kidding !
0	fantastic service , very knowledgeable_staff and very friendly service .
2	so on this basis they have started to go up in my estimation .
2	helpful pre_- sales technical info by phone .
0	for example , i bought a hoody for £_00 instead of £_000 .
2	unbelievable i will not use again .
0	overall prices are higher then competitors .
2	maybe i should give them another go but once_bitten .
2	jennings had some how managed to forget to settle my previous car finance despite a new agreement being in place , it was then paid .
2	it was only when i tried to chase them up i noticed the cards had been erased , so no payments .
2	we arranged to have old machine collected and whilst driver was not aware of this on their paperwork they still took it away .
0	before the poster arrived a was a little concerned_about what the quality would be as the poster was so cheap !
2	you have to be certain you are buying from a seller that is trustworthy .
0	i ordered pau d ' arco bark cut and it arrived as promised and contained what expected .
2	i hired this car as a goodwill_gesture for a friend . never ever again will i help anyone out like this again . even_though this was not his error . i have been charged for it and i am the only one out of pocket for doing a good deed .!!
2	i asked for this to be forwarded .
0	even now that i ' ve cancelled my account with them 0 months_ago , i still have issue with the refund they owe me .
2	it doesn_'_t stop at where did you get it .
2	so the one thing company could do is to perhaps co - ordinate the collection of old machines a but better .
0	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
2	barney phillips ( chess wholesale channel director ) and stephen dracup ( chess managing_director ) will be contacted via_twitter .
0	we always get argos_vouchers , and always have that within a few_days , but we are kept in the loop via_email to let u know when ure fones been received and when ure argos card has been sent out . im so happy with the service that i havent even considered trying out another company . and we will_continue to use mazuma twice a year to recycle our old_phones .
0	the delivery wasn ' t up to scratch however : i ordered on a thursday_evening and expected everything to arrive on the monday as next_day delivery is advertised , however when i called on monday it turned_out that it hadn ' t been sent , i got an_apology but no explanation .
0	it ' s xmas !!!!
0	!
2	understand it might have been difficult to make the delivery address change even_though it was with a days notice but would really have appreciated some response , well in fact any response would have been good .
2	i had been mis_- sold the deal and contacted orange to cancel the switch .
0	would i use sg again ?
2	unfortunately it snowed over the weekend and the person we had arranged to sit could therefore not get here resulting in my husband having to take 0 hours off work .
2	they managed to provide an item i had had great difficulty in locating at other on - line retailers , and at a lower price .
2	i was amazed as in the past you could fill your basket with gay abandon .
0	i ordered olbas oil for a cold , by the time i received it i was well over it , come on chemist_direct . you should be better_than this !
2	result ( my wife buys a pile of stuff on ebay on the saturday and it all arrives well before my item does ).
0	it ' s strongly worded but no shouting or swearing asking for someone to call me back .
0	thank_you so much sky tour !
2	great service , well please voucher cam quickly a little difficult to redeem though cheers shaun .
0	thank_you so much
2	graham
2	the order was placed almost 0 weeks_ago and as yet i have not received any confirmation that the order has_been processed or dispatched .
2	not a good start but hey no_problems with my last car !
2	i feel there aren_'_t enough options in the layout either , quite boring layouts so going to start having these photobooks done elsewhere .
0	i recently relocated to the us and had to transfer a larger amount .
0	i ordered some filters last_week thursday and they arrived on monday_morning .
2	i would recommend that you look_elsewhere for your beanbag purchase .
2	they don_'_t give a sh0t about their customers .
2	on both these occassions i had my money returned to me , but not before the manager had passed some comment to the effect that it was my fault .
0	when i placed my order i was told my watch was a special order though and therefore wasn ' t eligible .
2	thank_you .
0	i read all these reviews and decided to give this a try .
0	i am an extremely_satisfied customer .
2	webtogs belongs in that elite .
0	the prices are very much average with little deals .
2	i had a welding set to return to the shop i bought it from online .
2	can '_t praise this company highly_enough .
2	regards
0	i have provided the required documents without delay , but my review was not published and <_private data_removed > requested to modify my review because he said there was not enough information about the whole_process between me and roompaddy .
2	a really easy to use website coupled_with speedy delivery : perfect !
0	this is amazing im speechless
0	my returns experience was hassle - free , and i ' m pleased that i could return items free of charge , with no random fees deducted from my refund , and also that they send a confirmation of receipt of the return .
2	you have a major floor within your company which should never have happened and it certainly should have never happened to me and my family .
0	id still give it a 0 out of 0_stars though as everything else just works so well .
0	impressive .
0	if you need help and you raise a query , expect long delays for someone to come back to you and they are never apologetic .
2	i had been waiting for a month and a half for my local music store to order in a cable !
2	i hope the company reviews their feedback procedure in the future and allows the appropriate time to elapse before requesting such information .
2	great website with lots of stoc variet .
2	we ordered an electric_guitar and all stuff needed .
2	the necklace was as shown on website , beautifully_packaged and ready to send off to my friend in sweden .
2	the last place you should ever shop in .
2	there are , however , many millions of people who like spending time on it - it obviously ' works '.
0	these_guys do the opening and identifying for you , so you know what exactly_what you ' re paying for , instead of dishing wads of cash on blind boxes in an vain attempt to finish your collection ( not speaking from personal experience -- honest !).
2	since i last ordered online , toolstation have switched from royal_mail to comedians yodel .
2	boots are outstanding !
2	would recommend buying from them , but not very good technically
0	no , not the exceptionally good price for such a service .
2	i have always found debs full of very helpful staff and excellent products .
0	if they were too easy to reach , 00_% of their business would be about wasting time dealing_with unnecessary calls .
2	we were meant to have free competitive companies but this company have successfully killed of the opposition .
2	i did as instructed and was asked by my provider why i was moving considering i had £_000 to pay for cancelling my contract .
2	i use them internationally for my family and friends in the uk and they always report how beautiful the flowers are .
2	nobody had the decentcy to contact me to update me of the situation .
2	ali went very well until we got back and found that the rear number_plate to the car had come off ( somehow ??)
0	customer_service is always really helpful and i would recommend prestige to anyone .
0	to add_insult to injury , i moved_into a new home with my partner who is also a bt customer .
0	easy online form and as soon as i had my prescription they took no time to send them out .
2	a shame because there is some good stuff in here and the style of presentation is engaging ( even if the sections are a little brief in some cases ).
2	!
2	received products superfast as_described , company could really do with email_updates of despatched items as these not advised , otherwise very super service and cheap excellent quality products , cheers shaun .
0	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
0	well firstly on arrival in france my transfer never actually turned_up at the airport !
2	in fact the watch ended_up arriving sooner_than i expected so it all ended well .
2	ordered on 00 / 00 ' received a tel call within a couple of days to confirm delivery date , followed_by email and text , with a 0 hour delivery slot , reminder email / text the day before and phone_call on the day to say be here in 00_minutes .
0	i ordered my bath 0 weeks_ago , 0 bath was delivered into the local_store and they found it was faulty , the 0nd bath was delivered to my house 0 weeks_later and was damaged .
2	i was told that i could return the desk for a refund & re order if i chose to .
2	buyers get protection .
0	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
2	they seem to like to blame website for pricing , offers inconsistencies .
2	so , that makes me a little uneasy to be helping a company make money out of africa or wherever .
0	wanna save a hella good amount of money use this website bra .
2	got a cancellation this morning so drove 00_minutes to the garage to be told they are so busy they cannot come out to see the vehicle and i have to book it in for them to look / listen to these problems and then book it in again to get any_problems solved !!!
0	phoned up to pay the bill and was told it would be back on within 00_hours , well 00_hours_later its still not on !
0	i have used mp for over 0 years now and have always found the service from start to finish fantastic , however this year it has been horrendous , my last order i paid extra for next_day courier ( ordered on a thursday at 00am well within the same day dispatch period ) i received a mail that afternoon to say it had been dispatched , friday came with no sign off it , contacted mp they couldn ' t give me a tracking reference for it , eventually got the tracking reference on the monday and it ended_up that they didnt give it to the courier until friday_afternoon .
2	have to say i have no_idea why parcelforce can '_t understand the instructions when they are plastered in a large label on the top of the box " perishable - do not return to depot ".
0	in fact i waited for eight weeks and heard_nothing so i made contact with them .
2	one rear light with sbc bulb ( small bayonet cap ) & three fan speeds .
2	come 00th_november , i still had no refund , so used the website '_s live_chat option to query the situation ( i still have the transcript for this ), and was assured that the refund would be made immediately .
0	collection is easy to organize
2	i '_ve since attempted to get a re - scheduled collection date and hopefully things will go well but my first impression of music_magpie isn_'_t very good .
0	their prices seemed to be marginally cheaper_than their competitors , and they offered free delivery over £_00 which was handy .
0	always the same question have you changed the micro filter , router is your phone ok they then say they will run some tests and it could take up to 00_hours .
0	i can only assume that yodel forged my signature ( so they ' re fraudulent as well as unreliable ) and stole the parcel for themselves . absolutely_useless !
2	when these items arrived in june_0000 , i noticed that they had expiration dates of july_0000 .
2	usually they turn_up and give a good service .
2	after more than a week overdue it hadn_'_t arrived .
2	!
2	while browsing the internet i came_across mytuxedo and was really impressed with the range of formal wear .
2	it used to be the sum total of your order could be spread over 00 weeks or 00 weeks , now it '_s each individual item which can make the payments too high therefore limiting the number of items bought , so catalogue is missing out on profit .
2	you put in the wrong postcode so laptop in woodford , she says .
0	don ' t get me wrong i do train very hard and also eat good balanced meals !
0	really impressed with them and will_definitely be using them again .
2	while i was waiting , i found a number of hotels with rooms available and at around 0 . 00pm decided to book one of them myself as lastminute had failed to find a suitable alternative .
0	shame .
2	we have used virgin for our florida flights quite a few_times - using air miles collected through amex and then xferring them to virgin .
0	i tried signing_up for talk_talk home phone and broadband and got booted off the line 0 times .
2	the items must be perfect for mm to accept and pay .
2	playing ping pong with a laptop .
2	they do however deliver internationally now . just not to bfpo .
0	the bad :
2	i too went through the multiple status updates on the site which was very annoying , but every couple of days it progressed to the next one .
2	we were very happy with the online service from viagogo but when our tickets arrived they were clearly_marked at £_00 .
0	once you place your order ( and pay at point of order ) you receive one email as confirmation of order .
0	even i brought an android tablet from them via wowcher .
0	simply appalling .
2	customer base in india dont understand you , value for money 0 star customer 0 star .
2	0rd friday this has happened .
2	if i stick to making a purchase i usually have weeks to wait for delivery .
0	we ordered a painting for my parents wedding_anniversary and use interparcel as the courier it arrived to us 0 days day with no explanation or apology we opened the packaging to find the frame and glass smashed .
2	i am now going to hit every social network site and internet forum to relate my experience with chess .
0	haivng had two parcels from amazon recently dropped over the back fence , the second lanfding in the snow and being left for the weekend by initial review would be much lower .
0	had good and bad_experiences with the company .
0	i could tell instantly that it was a terrible mattress and phoned the customer_service number .
2	.
2	when we complained to the store . experience team they told us that the store manager could expel us if she liked .
0	as part of the order we paid £_00 . 00 for a bed recycle that meant i had to take apart my old wooden frame bed for them to collect .
0	after telling them that they told me it was my software , again told them this , each " problem " was always me , never them .
0	last_week i got last_minute tickets through viagogo to the chelsea flower show which was incredible !
0	been told i do not have the extended_warranty i pay for monthly ( which turns_out that it covers nothing ).
2	so i had a plumber who couldn_'_t do any work , and a tiler who was waiting to tile the shower room after the tray was installed and no kit .
2	in the end i gave up trying to get them to admit it was faulty and paid for a repair elsewhere .
0	they not only have a large_selection of supplements but they are at great values .
2	of course he will sell the van again and uses dodgy practices to sell these vans .
2	so , after you have ordered and you have paid , you find out that you are not able to fill in another delivery address .
2	i can only concur with the other reviews on this page .
2	i will use firstaid0sport again .
2	ps , it says under here inform yodel about my review .
0	everything i have said in this review about the sighing and lazyness is all on tape .
2	a hole in my account balance having paid for a dishwasher
2	the communication_throughout , whilst prompt , was awful and i never recieved an_apology or an explanation .
0	amazing !!
2	excellent after_sales service on how to get the best out of the kit . would highly_recomend .
0	when we deliver all over the world , it would be sensible to have a customer_service at the height .
2	don_'_t buy anything before checking the quidcio site .
0	a couple of days_later i have received an_email from <_private data_removed > asking to provide some proof that transaction has taken place and only then to reinstate my review .
0	however do not be_fooled .
2	so this side of things i am not happy about
0	**_update **
2	glasses 0 for 0 .
0	the poster was designed and a proof sent for my approval within hours and the design was perfect first time .
0	all in all great place to learn a new language .
2	stay well clear .
0	he then told us he would email resort_hoppa and tell them we need to be refunded .
0	great business .
0	also after noticing on our e_- ticket that they hadn ' t booked us baggage , we rang up to enquire .
2	no window to open .
2	i ordered some flowers for my daughter for her_birthday and received email_confirmation of safe delivery .
0	would recommend this company for their awesome clothing .
2	dear_sir / madam
2	it didn_'_t take long to assemble the 00ft trampolin the main problem was keeping the legs up .
2	they did not charge me the postage for this second pair , spent some time on the phone checking the fit compared to the first pair , and they arrived within 00_hours of ordering .
2	perhaps then they will review their fee '_s
2	not sure if my prescription was incorrect or if the glasses are incorrect or maybe i need trifocals !
2	ao . com is the place i go first for appliances , having used them several_times i have never been disappointed .
0	i ' m booking my ferries with aferry on a regular base .
0	i sent my phone to mazuma on saturday_morning and the money as quoted was in my account for monday_afternoon .
0	! 0 %_off your next order until a month from today .
2	the staff in india are an_absolute joke and were rude , surly and hung_up on me .
0	the arrived late and allthough i was in the delivery driver left the package with a neighbour and just posted the ' i called but you were not in card through '.
2	after all there is a pop up offering accessories etc .
2	this year will be no different .
2	unfortunately the worst part came after the holiday when threatening emails started to arrive claiming additional_charges .
2	i get stopped every time - at the supermarket , at the rta , at the bank , on the street .
2	perhaps all parcels should be " tracked " as m & s do on mail order deliveries ?
0	so i asked whether the costs can be reduced .
0	not only did i get the cheapest price and free delivery , i also got fast next_day delivery !
0	she then covered her name tag and said she is not called amy .
0	sellers are also put at a disadvantage where they can ' t leave negative_feedback , so the buyer always has an advantage over the seller , which can be bad when you open a case with ebay .
2	the delivery came in 0 days [ which incuded two public holidays ].
0	thanks home av , i will_definitely be recommending you !!
0	the blacks were clear and defined but the greys appeared faded / yellowish , which was a real_shame given the time it had taken to put_together .
2	i can advise that perishable items such as food stuffs are not covered_under distance_selling regulations .
2	i see that tesco , asda and all the rest of them ship from the channel_islands too nowadays so they can all save on tax - while the rest of uk companies have no choice but to pay it - money goes to money as usual
2	lee also advised me that the internal brackets had not been delivered but should arrive the following_day – at no time were we advised of this in advance by hammonds .
0	despite much waiting my order arrived oo 00000000 , now how do we hit this request ? grateful , clezio lelis
0	i have used overclockers . co . uk a lot over the past_year , every time the service has been excellent .
0	i was so bowled_over by the fantastic deal on offer that i should have thought logically , if something seems too good to be true it ' s because it is .
2	the stool was quite poorly finished with sharp corners , in fact my wife cut her foot on one of the corners .
0	then i got an e_- mail saying my order had been returned to them and queried why i hadn ' t completed the returns slip !
0	thanks beautybay and sorry for the negative_feedback .
0	because of this it means i have been looking elsewhere for my items and to be honest finding them cheaper and with better customer_service .
0	after calling customer_services and being on hold for a total of 0 hours , i finally got through to the right people and by this stage i was happy to cancel our account all together .
0	well , getting the point of putting a quote out there was dead simple and very easy , after that things got a little hairy , for instance :
0	don ' t list items for sale that are not for sale .
2	wow what service !
0	a credit to your company !
0	ok site could be a little better layout
0	everybody else i spoke with were useless , specially customer_service , if they can be called that .
0	i would recommend using them for international transfers .
2	pitty really .
2	big_mistake !
2	we tried 0 times and gave up only to find later they had processed the payment of £_000 three_times but can only get one refunded !
0	we ' ve never closed during the day and no card was left .
2	• i will be forwarding details to your trading body
2	simply do my normal shopping and get money back for nothing :-)
2	there were small flying things and crawlers and i thought the mini fortefog would do the trick .
0	great value product delivered next_day delivery which was a lovely suprise .
0	i am furious !
0	she loved it but when i saw the greeting card i was disappointed .
0	i quickly agreed on a different model and price and the order was processed .
0	about a week after the delivery date i emailed asking for an update and no reply again .
2	world whether bought in store or on line , don_'_t , don_'_t , don_'_t , if you value you sanity
2	very well_organised and really safe .
0	the perks are amazing , and they have a ton of stuff to choose from .
2	then they cut me off .
2	many_thanks to lauren w for her help .
2	i can recommend chemist_direct , they have a fab web_page which is easy to use , the products are extensive and varied .
2	been having problem with on line ordering , but they sort thing out quickly and efficiently !
2	as a supplier the staff have been helpful and encouraging regarding this and apply the same standard of service as they do to purchases .
0	having had a few visits to this dealership i ' ve had my car damaged twice ( included one when i was in they car yet they still denied it ).
2	in addition , neither [_name ], trading_depot director , nor [_name ] of dpd have replied to my email of 00th_october , complaining_about their poor service
0	viovet always get the medication to my door in super_fast time and i ' ve never had any_problems .
2	of course not .
0	mazuma could not be more highly_recommended by myself ; i completed the required details and had my pack sent to me , which actually arrived the next_day .
2	bought a phone form them last november and today it wouldn_'_t turn on .
0	i can ' t think of any_problems i ' ve had with them and their loyalty service is second to none .
2	bästa sidan . barna och jag nöjda
2	they sent emails on delivery progress and the package arrived_bang on time .
0	i highly_recomend this guys .
0	purchased an acoustic_guitar from dv000 an_hour before the next_day delviery deadline .
0	terrible service , deliberately aimed at getting you on the phone .
2	support is useless as they never answer the phone or respond to email , though this is normal for r / c model shops , none of which seem to care to support the complex and fallible products they sell .
0	when i arrived to pick it up the next_day guess_what i received ?
0	the instrument to everywhere .
2	not enough variety .
2	i was offered a screen_protector and upgraded delivery ( laughable if not infuriating ).
0	right product , right price , fast delivery
2	as a result , i am raising my score of parcelhero to 0 points .
2	i received an e_mail on the day it was due to be delivered to say the courier couldn_'_t deliver and it would come the following_day , as it was heavy and they needed a different vehicle .
0	been sent goods that were obviously ' seconds '
0	spoke to reshmee who was extremely professional , brilliant and courteous over the phone and not to forget her super efficiency for sorting_out our complicated flight pattern and being extremely patient when we had changed out minds on a hotel that we had booked .
2	return_journey .
2	in fact , it is nigh on impossible to move without it disassembling itself ; it is very heavy .
0	i never returned it because it seemed like hassle but now i never order clothes and warn_people if they are contemplating it .
2	eye_test pretty painless .
2	very frustrating .
0	one of the review says that the tub was not nearly as full as the picture implies : i would have to disagree .
2	some of the staff seem quite rude ( both checkout and the shelf stackers ); i '_ve lost_count how many_times i '_ve been given dirty looks ( whilst minding my own business ), and being stared at .
2	worse still , i seem to be in the centre of irrelevant , even idiotic information trying to grap my attention of my clicks .
0	both arrived exactly when they should have ( which was next_day delivery ), and the two guitars were set_up beautifully .
0	only slight_issue these days is that buyers seem to be under the impression that they don ' t have to pay if they win .
0	thanks a lot !
0	would ' ve been cheaper on high_street after all and not the hassle , i ' m disappointed as this is my first order .
0	so i had to rush home from work , taking a taxi to get back in time , which cost me £ 0 and greatly irritating my boss .
0	best 0 star website
0	i nodded " someone will see you in a bit ".
2	!
2	i ordered 0 items online on 00nd march .
0	will be buying a new monitor from them soon .
2	after having a few queries regarding mt parcel collection i spoke to rick on chat earlier for some advice , he was so helpful and sorted_out my delivery for me :) sam
2	sit here for another 0 hours like a fool , listening for the door_bell ?
2	after all that bending over_backwards they then tell you it '_s not faulty !!
2	i then needed to check some discrepancy in the details about delivery .
2	i wanted a canvas picture for my oh '_s christmas_present , and wowcher had a promo for just this .
0	my daughter loves her converse and her grey furry coat , shame they didn ' t do the coat in mummy ' s size tho lol :)
0	overall , i highly_recommend this company .
2	they arrived really quickly and fitted_perfectly .
2	here is my letter to hammonds sent 0 weeks_ago - still no reply or even acknowledgement , also no allen key which was apparently posted 0 weeks_ago as the senior fitter refused to give it to me !!
0	i try my very best to avoid buying from other_companies that use yodel as their delivery ' partners '.
2	i am now with o0 with great customer service and a functioning phone beside me on my sofa , great signal .
0	they do not care about their customers at all .
0	now they have stopped_replying to my emails !
0	update_:
0	we are suffering heavily !
0	i do rather object to the almost constant emails i have been receiving , however .
2	i had also asked for air conditioning due to the hot weather .
0	i had miss placed all my phon numbers and had no way of getting them back i needed one contact asap and i spoke to a guy called michael he was a star !
2	the prescription was the same as was everything else but this time they are not as good or as comfortable .
0	account often wrong and still now having problems with them trying to charge me money i don ' t owe !!!
2	went into meltdown after a month .
0	upon calling customer_services couldn ' t get through .
0	i always used to love going into game .
0	i then received a message_saying they couldn ' t refund me as the tickets had been sent and i had given my consent on the phone .
0	i think they want customers to wait forever .
0	i ordered the big_boy xxl beanbag , via groupon , 0 weeks before_christmas ; waited 0 weeks for it to arrive and it never did so i logon to the website and the delivery date was very vague : week 00 , which to me means the week before_christmas .
2	i spoke to an advisor called steve who took me through the whole of my medical conditions & who did not rush me at all .
2	been waiting over 0 weeks now for the money to arrive .
2	after my initial tentative enquiry via_email , my early reservations ( re mail order on such a major purchase ) were dispelled .
2	i will_continue to be a customer & their customer service is brilliant .
0	it is only because of the suppliers that these issues have been sorted .
2	problem where there site suddenly decided it didn_'_t recognise our postcode as a collection address - having phoned interparcel and spoken to numerous people who suggested various things which didn_'_t work - nobody really seemed particularly bothered - my last dealings with this matter , a supervisor promised to phone me back to sort it out after supposedly going away to look into in more depth - they never did .
2	very happy with all_aspects of my booking with hotel direct
2	the ch make the games enjoyable and are great .
0	i find amazon have an excellent variety and range of products plus prices are generally cheap .
0	as part of our deal we were given free entry to a few clubs , a 0 - course_meal and we also had a spa day included with treatments - a perfect end to the weekend .
0	their website has no contact number on it but i managed to track one down and phoned up .
2	in fairness the customer service were every helpful , waiving the early_termination fees .
2	on receiving the tent i realised that i had made a mistake in the size of tent i had ordered .
0	!
0	i won ' t be able to enjoy these flowers as they will be dead by the time i return to the office and to top everything off , my colleague ( who i asked to open the box this morning ) has emailed me to tell me the flowers are of poor quality and already started to wilt !
2	eventually agreed .
2	they are clearly the same people , same names , e_- mail address , telephone_numbers and address .
0	but the way it ' s still lucky for me . this site is not completely fake .
2	the star_rating system does not allow for that distinction .
2	this site is easy to use , but appears almost identical to several other train sites in layout and prices ; is this indicative of shared data , as these sites have the same prices as each other every time i look .
0	i would reccomend this site to anyone who is wanting to be fit and stay healthy .
0	i ' ve had problems with most of the other online pc component retailers in the uk , but not a single_issue with overclockers .
0	this would then effect the rest of the day , but i managed to change our next activity to be half an_hour later .
2	great work chris and the team , thanks !!
2	overall an excellent experience - we were even able to observe a video review of the washer_dryer via the company website .
0	great support and service .
0	good service but i prefer not to pay_monthly because i dont use that much data and making payments through paypal .
0	perfect !
0	bought a camera bundle online .
0	they sounded polite , apparently it ' s because of the holiday so there ' s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there ' s no mention on the site ).
2	it will be interesting to see if this edited review is challenged by shiply
0	the introductory meat pack , 0kgs of tilapia , and 0 cartons of egg_whites .
2	no way would austrian refund the ticket .
2	i ordered flowers to arrive in england when i was visiting my parents for my stepmother '_s birthday .
2	technology is basic but is good / straightforward as you ' d expect so 0 - 0 minutes to book on a collection .
0	we were accepted into bars we were not previously allowed into due to guest lists .
0	really fast , simple and easy !
0	slow delivery
2	but i cannot warn anybody that these campervans could be dangerous in more than one way .
2	an order placed on the 00st_december is still " processing " according to my account details .
2	( like today .)
2	in august we used hermes /_herpes to send an item we had sold on amazon .
0	by contrast , dpd have been keeping me appraised of another delivery of audio_equipment i ordered through amazon , just like they always do , and should be arriving today between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , and i am sure they will - they usually call me 00_minutes before they are popping round .
2	!
0	the manager came to sort out and said she had to back up her staff ??
2	i recently ordered an internal compact flash card_reader for a computer i ' m building .

0	i just wish i had had it done sooner !
0	that was my experience during half term at taunton asda .

0	top service , top prices , i strongly_recommend !
2	the actual procedure was ok , not painful although quite unpleasant , but initially i could see pretty well .
2	parecl0go need to up their game as opposition is now better .
0	nothing was ever said about taking appliance out of the kitchen .
0	i tried the website again and the delivery was changed for week 0 without informing_me !
2	down_side delivery on the slow side , puts me off ordering again .
0	i will keep shopping there , because the products i have received * have * been of good quality ( and i really do need the stamps !).
2	i then was put through to a manager at my request to ask why i was charged two lots of postage .£ 0 . 00 for delivery and returning the item .
2	0 .
2	i only ever buy one or two machines at a time but david my account manager is always ready to find the exact machine that i want .
2	the rhs of the forward cabin were just normal pitch , useless .

2	bad advice .
2	(.
2	a delivery company telling_me that the dishwasher never arrived with them in the first place
0	i pay them money to advertise my site and now they display a message on my site stating it " may be un - safe !"
0	getting the money back is like getting blood out of a stone .
2	then when i registered my new sim on the phone ( website wouldn_'_t work ) i was told i would receive a text but after 00_hours it hadn_'_t come so i had to phone again !
0	i would also like to point out in this review that i have a disabled relative who also uses sainsbury ' s in a number of stores across the country ( mainly as i live in essex and she is in shropshire ) we have never had an issue borrowing any form of wheelchair or acquiring goods from the top shelf at any of the 0 stores we regularly use , they also have ramps for the cash machines and a lower machine for wheelchair access .
0	very quick delivery ( arrived in less_than 0 days ) and an easy to use website .
0	two_weeks have gone by and i ' ve only received one .
2	easy to arrange , reasonably_priced .
0	all of the utensils you need to finesse are available in one spot .
0	have bought from them before and will buy again .
2	i ' m wondering_if the good reviews are posted by friends ?
0	i have just recieved my valentines_day flowers which my boyfriend bought from them to be sent to me at work today ( valentines_day ) and i just needed to express how disgusted i am .

0	waiting for a parcel on a 0 - 0 day delivery - a birthday_present for my son .
2	the other bunch was christmas tulips with thistles .

0	if that + sky for 0 rooms wasn ' t so damned expensive we ' d have stayed with it .
0	i will use this company on my future_purchases , thanks cjs !

0	vodafone seem to have started charging more and more for their service compared with other_networks .
2	the company were good at sorting it out and sending a new part .
2	minutes after i ended that phone conversation i searched on google for an_alternative company to buy this card_reader and who in my search results do i see selling the same product ?
0	shocking !!!!!
2	they are cheap but what what cost ?
2	the cost of the complete pack , with the plinth was around £_00 , so i decided to order the complete pack , only to be told then that they were out of stock and even if they were in stock i would not receive them the next_day as it was too late for a next_day delivery .
0	i hear it ’_s going to be cold this winter and this will keep me warm while out and about .
0	i have since cancelled my policy
0	again , on arriving at the club , we weren ' t on the guest_list !!!
2	i had no choice but to ' verify with facebook ' or abandon teh review .
2	bought my battery on the 00rd jan , when i rang on the 00st i was told by a very rude girl that they had trouble with their courier and my battery was not dispatched until 00th .
2	prompt delivery too and definitely value for money .
2	a month later still not connected and chess advised a minimum wait of three more weeks .
0	buying any product that takes 00 days for delivery without prior warning is unacceptable but at christmas its is just outright bad customer_service .
0	ok i have a mixed review here with some good points and bad points .
2	decided to fumigate a small caravan i just purchased .
2	aftr 00 days i informed wae_+ if i did not receive it within the next 0 days i would be contacting my credit_card company .
2	rang and emailed numerous_times - no reply to phone messages and emails keep saying refund is coming but it never does .
0	although they might say they ship from america on the about us page , a lot of people wont see this and when your shopping on the site it looks to be a normal uk site .
0	the plastic box on which the headphones were laying down was also damaged .
2	well earned .
0	can ' t get any response from then .
2	they were the same price on one of the pricier items .
0	i would recommend to you cheryl to buy tickets from double0tickets . com , as it has the best and cheapest tickets from sold - out events .
2	all they want is your money and they know every trick in the book to get you to part with your cash .
0	i wont even be able to enjoy them for one day .
0	return transfer in mallorca didn ' t turn_up but after persistent emails to resorthoppa customer_services we were given a refund for the taxi fare we had to pay for to get to the airport on time .
2	will most definitely_use again , thank_you tshirt_studio :-)
2	we were further impressed by the offer of a £_00 discount to remove our old mattress .
0	there was no electricity usage in between tenants .
0	they are a shadow of their former self and are trading on their name .
2	!
0	been using them for years , loved the price_match guarantee , but on my last purchase they didn ' t accept the price_match and decided to charge me more .
2	which means i am unable to re - order for 00_hrs due to failed order while completing security check .
0	the staff were polite , but the best staff in the world can ' t save you from being chewed up and spat out by horrible business_practices .
0	so my negative_review is based on gaks misleading website .
2	far too expensive .
2	00 february - still_waiting for refund .
2	they are meant to detect your booking via your license plate - that didn_'_t work ( and i suspect that was a problem for others trying to enter at same time ).
2	as for their products , i am a repeat customer several_times over , and being a fussy so and so ( polite or what ?!
2	ref_: avis rental_agreement number 000000000
2	i really wouldn_'_t bother , i know some people find it brilliant , but not me !
2	website states ' less_than 00 in stock '; i '_ve been speaking english all my life and this means in stock not out of stock .
0	i was offered an_alternative and was told on the phone that the mattress i would be receiving instead was very similar / almost the same as the one i had originally ordered .
0	on the two times i ' ve had to talk to a customer support person they proved pretty up to the task too .
0	i am just glad that i hadn ' t actually spent £_00 on them , didn ' t expect them to be delivered in a cardboard_box they were also disappointingly small and just less that 00_hours , the roses and gerbera ' s are wilting and the lilies don ' t look like they ' re even going to open !
0	i then got home to unpack my shopping to be disapointed once again these are the reasons_why ?.
0	i wanted to trade - in the game , rayman legends for wii_u . cex had the best trade - in price for cash , so i signed_up and went through the process .
0	i wish all customer agents were as helpful as sammie .
2	i booked a courier and arranged to work from home on the arranged day ( s ) so i could be in .
0	as with things like this always sell face to face and be_careful if you are unsure .
0	take note : no paper work comes with the mattresses that they deliver .
0	000_% recommended to use hostelbookers instead of hostelworld !
0	well yes .
2	roger
0	i have bought 0 products now from selectspecs . com and i have been very pleased with each product .
0	left a message on their fb_page , they said to send them a private message , which i did , and then received no response .
0	they immediately provided a refund with no_hassles !
0	the other reason i am not giving any higher_than 0_stars is because of their customer_service .
0	i called the depot and its is confirmed that my parcel hasn ' t been dispatched and also that they don ' t know where it is . is this for real ???
2	have tried other search_engines but google is deffo the best imo !
0	and yes , carphone_warehouse shouldn ' t be using them .
0	i am a customer of supplement_warehouse for more_than a year now . love buying from them coz of price and quality satisfaction .
0	almost 0 months over still not they are not transferred to bank .
2	i '_ll try serenata one more time , but any more glitches and bad manners and i '_ll not use them again .
2	once installed it works well and sucks in food steam / smoke from the cooker below , blowing out non - smelly air
2	company employees refuse to provide names of directors and no email_addresses are available .
0	so when i went for the reunion , i received compliments from everyone .
0	brilliant i thought , suddenly the frames i thought were out of my price range were affordable so i promptly ordered another home_trial to check the frames i wanted and placed an order .
0	when i went to the local_depot , there was a small door resembling a fire exit for collections ( at_least the entrance for the staff looked nice !).
2	some allow blatantly sexual banter while one female host in particular drags people off chat for the slightest reason , particularly where she does not agree with their jokes !
0	put my case though accident_advice helpline and gave them the only piece of information i had , the registration of the cab , they did all the work for me , tracked down the cab driver , cab company and all the insurance details .
0	which i might not even get since i am not leaving a great review .
2	!
2	called austrian airlines in the uk and got a call_centre in ukraine .
0	i would most definitely recommended this company to family and friend . i have even commented on face book !!
0	being so simple , i am sure to use them again in the future .
0	if there does arise a problem ( which is inevitable with any shopping site ), their support was always quick to answer my questions and helped_me out very fast .
0	great website and company , will recommend to friends and family , and use the service again !
0	brilliant !
0	so during a chit chat with a colleague at my work she suggested to buy a dress online .
2	i ordered some additional memory and key ring phone chargers using standard delivery .
0	departure - the app that we were told to download didn ' t allow us to find out our pick_up time , so i had to call them .
2	i am very impressed - brilliant service , thank and well_done .
2	had to order a new one to replace it , could get new one but could not get damaged one collected same day so have to find room for two washers . have to say the after service was better_than the delivery , and they went out of there way to sort my problem , nisha made sure my replacment washer and the damaged one were swopped on the same day , thank_you for that .

0	i sent the suit back and had to chase for the refund and communication was poor although i thankfully have been refunded .
0	we are planning to leave for the event on thursday but when should we actually expect the tickets ?
0	it sounds a lot like the service you get from western_union in their shops all around the uk .
0	we were told " no bbq today " without any reason_why and with that we spent the rest of the day hungry .
2	communication is always superb , customer service is how it should be .
0	many of my customers are not happy to do this , so may have to look at dropping trust_pilot as a preferred review site .
2	wrong product sent , no reply to emails .
0	looked inside had a george asda tag size 0 .
2	oliver 0 hour
0	made an order with standard delivery between 0 - 0 business days on monday .

0	how on earth is not a proper phone system to taken calls ?
2	job_done
2	we registered 0 cards with quidco ( my wife and i ) at times the card_details got erased so any purchases made did not register .
2	as the car is used for driving tuition i ' m in it an awful_lot and fitting in trips to the garage are very rare so i '_ve coped without a spare key , no great hardship , and the other 0 faults have nicely grown louder making detection easier .
2	saved loads of time at installation
0	we got a spanish speaker to help us and we found out the so called emergency number was just a mobile phone turned off .
2	i '_ve been using usenext for over a year .

2	i managed to save some money compared to viovet and a couple of other_suppliers plus the medicin arrived in very good time .
2	good named brand batteries at a fraction of the cost in the shops .
2	in a nutshell ; calls are never returned , emails seldom replied to , " account managers " who could manage their way out of a paper bag and countless broken_promises .
2	when i link on to website my order is saying in progress . it never gets any further .
2	starting to think this might not be a site i can trust .
2	i really am not impressed with this experience , and will almost certainly use a local supplier from now on .
0	i found a list of possible delivery country then bought some_cases .
0	that insurance factor is the only reason they get 0 / 0 , otherwise it would be 0 . 0 / 0
0	order dispatched with 00_hours and then delivered the following_day .
2	delivery terms we '_ll call you within 0 days and delivery within 0 days .
2	we waited in all day .

2	within 00_minutes an engineer was on the door_step .
2	paid a premium but had to wait untill after the weekend . result no bike .
2	to add_insult to injury my add on driver got fined for parking at his own workplace despite having informed the company he was in a temp hire_car and them agreeing it was ok and signing reg no in every day . this was obviously a mistake . fine was squashed . however , enterprise have charged £_00 . 00 admin_fee to my bank_account and despite agreeing if the fine was deemed wrong and squashed , i would get my admin_fee back , no such luck . even after several emails to the traffic violation dept . i have heard_nothing !!
0	price was competitive not amazingly cheap , they arrived on time on valentines_day in a large box .
0	( almost 0 months ) i ' m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .

2	a fast response and turnaround to gain_access to this product and susanna was very helpful in setting_up our account .
0	ordered my brother ' s xmas_present in nov , which the website advised was out of stock , but would be available in jan .( as he already knew what he was getting he said was happy to wait ).
2	important to note : as of april_0000 jexaa limited was dissolved .

2	a few_weeks_later the shoes were returned to me , no letter stating why , i had to phone littlewoods again , i was told that i had to proof there was a fault within the shoe myself and that i had to get in touch with adidas , now the way i see it is that i purchased the shoe from littlewoods and it should have been up them to find the fault , according to the sales of goods_act , this should have been the case .

2	the biggest disappointment was that the face_value of the tickets was £_00 and we paid almost three_times that much for each ticket .
2	something_else i have to go to tesco / sainsbury for .?
0	this time i waiting in all day on the day the tracking_information said it was out for delivery - nothing .
2	its a standard fit & can be mounted by top , side or rear screws .
2	suffice to say , no goods arrived after several emails of promises , can '_t get through to helpline , always in a queue .
2	- get yourself a good fitter ( who can often advise on what you will need in terms of panels / cornices before you order )
2	i was very pleasantly_surprised to receive a despatch confirmation_email the following_day and true to word , the out - of - stock item was delivered within_00hrs .

2	i ordered my pc on 0th_january_0000 via the website and it arrived on 00 january_0000 so just outside the 0 week lead time mentioned on their website so not too bad , it came with all the correct components , the oem windows 0 disk and the graphics_card box + drivers so no_problems there !

0	i used the website to just arrange collection rather_than have another failed delivery .
0	in no way am i blaming gak for the time it took for the refund to come through , i know there is multiple factors that can contribute to a few_days delay in refund , but the fact is this delay could have been avoided had gak not falsely advertised a product on their site .
0	i responded with an ok and thank_you and proceeded to sit in the reception .
2	excellent service .
0	also beware of their points system , it ' s very poorly ran , my account had gone into minus figures , and i had saved numerous points whicheck theh wiped at the end of the year without warning ( it does say in the t &_c ' s but a warning would have been nice .) if ordering from these just make_sure you are 000_% certain with your order before you place it as you can ' t edit an order after paying .

2	i ' d buy a lot more from boden if they kept their stock up a good deal more .
2	good communication_throughout via_email and sms .
0	sometimes you get suspended for something vaguely within the rules , but open to interpretation , sometimes you get suspended even if it is not in the rules , just because a moderator thinks it is .
0	will certainly use again .
2	this is their standard " customer service ", lousy !!!
2	not thinking anything had changed i continued to book a car .
0	i ' m sure the coach service they offer is very good , just be mindful to use a disposable email address when enquiring or booking via their website as " sophie " from national express will spam you relentlessly with " offers ".
2	booking made easily , but i was surprised when the payment was taken .
2	i ordered a laptop and wireless adapters / extenders should have been free but even_though free on website £_00 added in checkout .

0	the fuel was delivered on time by a polite , friendly and professional driver .
2	the service was efficient and quick .
2	best regards ,
2	would still recommend as the pricing and service is great .
2	the only_downside is that there are too many of the same winners / jp winners and if you don_'_t play all day every day you have very little chance of winning big .
2	after numerous phone_calls to yourselfs and being assured by your telephone operators it will be here by 0pm at the latest today no sign of the said asus_laptop .
0	after constant pestering by the company i feel obliged to reply .

0	i picked_up europa universalis iv for 00 quid instead of the steam price_tag of 00 . 00 .
0	after years of chopping and changing supermarkets finally finding one that does everything it says on the tin has been difficult .
0	and go to ********* because they send package through dhl_express .
0	good prices and good products , there was a problem with dhl mixing up the order but sima took care of it and sent me the correct blades in 00hrs .
2	not happy .
0	they told me they were in contact with decuisine , took my order details and said they would arrange a refund .

2	off road driving in total safety .
0	to use my friend ' s words " they were borderline rude ".
0	delivered in the same time as estimated .
0	i was happy with the product i purchased but delivery was very slow .
0	took so long to resolve as plusnet admitted they raised an incorrect fault as they didn ' t know what else to do !
0	then i found that the desk size was not what i expected .
0	well_done .
0	since 0000 i have purchased supplements from supplement_warehouse , their prices can ' t be beat , and the selection is out of this world !
2	i called avis immediately to a man called barry granderson .

0	recomended !
0	( the official way )

2	could have got slightly more for my 0 phones at other_sites but their feedback / reviews were very negative so i used mazuma .
0	dreams , aware of the fact they are leaving a 0 month pregnant women to sleep on the floor , have been no help whatsoever , have not made any attempt to explain the reason for the cancelled delivery ( without forceful prompting from me ), or to explain_why we have had to wait nearly half a year for a delivery .
2	on wednesday 00th , i overheard lee contact his manager as he was concerned straightaway about the position of the main light switch , something which was raised with the surveyor as i was worried that john fox had not taken this into_consideration in his design .

0	they stole our money .
0	fridges etc )
0	tryed somewhere_else and had a nightmare .
2	i received the memory card which i had ordered along with a vipix card which i did not order .
2	offer of free insurance is a waste of time so if its a valuable shipment you should get additional cover .
2	another convenient store that repeatedly fails on stock_levels , partly because the way they store stuff means if they say they have 00 in stock , 00 are probably broken / missing / on a pallet somewhere_else .
2	thank_you trustpilot for the forum .
2	however , recently sold them an iphone for £_000 and i asked them how they made money on that to be told they sold them to developing countries .

2	only saving grace was excellent support from repairs team - but it took me 0 hrs and 0 calls waiting on piped music landlines .
0	they replied and said they would look_into the issue .
0	they don ' t seem to really cater to anyone who is a uk size 00 and above , much to the disappointment of some my friends .
0	i asked for the phone back many_times but they are charging me ten_pounds .
2	great product
0	easy to contact , great products , friendly staff
0	i wouldn ' t recommend going to it and trying to work out what you want , as they push certain products ( e . g .
2	they were sympathetic and helpful but there are two snags : firstly they don_'_t pay for repairs that ought to be covered_under_warranty .
2	ordered money on internet got confirmation_email went to pick_up and was told they had no money .
0	we choose some tickets for monday 00rd for symphonies 0 & 0 and looked forward to it .
2	one cd ( out of about 00 ) was not recognised by the site .
2	however , i do still have some criticisms of the parcelhero service .
2	delivery was as promised and price was excellent .
2	too often though , you see " bargains " in their daily offer , that you can find just as cheaply elsewhere .
2	if you are thinking of using them . do it i ' m_glad i did .
2	surly the clue is in the title ?
0	ordered a dress online .
0	so , it was a nice surprise to find that their service was very straight - forward and smooth .
0	when my mother opened the box , the flowers were on their side and looking really limp and fragile .
2	however , the courier used clearly did not read ( or maybe did not receive ) the explicit instruction left regarding delivery and leaving at a safe_place at my home , and i had to contact customer_services ( delivery ) on a number on which i only had push button responses to use .
0	the experience had it ' s good points and it ' s bad points !!!
0	the matter was resolved swiftly and with no hassle , although i did have to wait for a while before my call was answered .
0	all that , everyone has .
2	i was told that the order would be delivered to a fitter who would in turn deliver it to our fitter who was due come on thursday 00th – only for a box of parts to be delivered to me on wednesday 00th .
0	all in a great deal and prompt service from the company .
0	you can tell that they put hardly any effort into the work , for example , the box was completely ripped on the side .
0	bad practice and even worse customer_service !
0	i have to sat the slot games are big strength of kerching - there are obvious titles like ghostbusters and da vinci diamonds but lots of others to enjoy too and i have had some good wins to boot !
0	ordering was easy and fine .
2	it took me months to eventually take the dealer to court .

2	i stumbled_across the supplement_warehouse website and discovered that they were substantially_cheaper on most of the items that i buy .
0	who don ' t like free_stuff !
2	overall t mobile have offered a good reliable service , with good coverage over most of the uk , however they do seem prone to changing their price structure at the drop of a hat , and their contact number has also changed .
0	yet some how the whole_thing turned into a nightmare .
2	fortunately for me the cost was half that of parcel0go but i now have the problem of trying to obtain a refund from a company that you can not speak to !
0	i could have got a much_better valentines bouquet for less_than half the price from morrisons .

2	we ended_up hiring a van and doing the job ourselves , but shiply will not refund our money .
0	brilliant :)
0	i was certainly unable to get through on the phone_lines for 0 hours this morning before this initial review was posted and a chase up email sent 00_hours ago to the above email address .
0	this is a truly great casino site with accurate casino simulators that aren ' t biased like many websites out there !
2	we then phoned yodel ( their delivery agent ) and were told that it would be that day but could give us no estimate of time except - between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
0	easy to contact , fast and reliable
2	excellent service , would definitely_use again .
2	i waited in as given the hour_slot .
2	i have nothing but praise for this company !
0	i can definatly recommend this site to anyone_looking to cash in on an old laptop .
0	i pressed the buzzer no less_than three times with no answer .
2	on returning car the man barely checked it ( apart_from the fuel gage ) ( but did check the car before me quite thoroughly and found some damage that may or may not have been there before according to the user ) and sent me off with the paperwork to the office .
0	so i message trustpilot and ask if they actually bother checking reviews ?
0	it would have been much more efficient had they just said this in the email to begin with .
2	this is how it happened .
0	they have a . co . uk website but everything is still shipped from america .
0	the products i ' ve ordered is good quality and exactly_what i was looking for .
2	so lots of wasted time and irritation - plus a loss of confidence in what autoglass had advised me .
0	my boyfriend ordered flowers on the 00th to arrive on the 00th_february as a surprise for me and considering the fact the office is normally open from 0 . 00am to 0 . 00pm , you would think the flowers would be delivered within that time .
0	!
0	however the courier didn ' t turn_up on the day they were supposed to after waiting from 0am_till_0pm .
2	i couldn_'_t buy on ebay without this service .

0	some of the highest prices in the e_- cig game but saying that there customer_service has alwayse been good and there red labell tobacco juice is next to none if they sorted there prices it would be a 0 * companny
0	car passed mot , payment made and i was advised car would be delivered for 0000 .
0	that night , cycling home from work , the chain snapped in the middle of a busy junction .
2	i walked out of my local o0 shop when they said quote " yeah we are expensive and the trade in is pants - but hey we can sell as many as we like ( 0s )". so i went to vodaphone and they had a really good deal but no phones . so went back to 00 .
2	the quality is fantastic - and i '_ll be ordering some dining_chairs next month !”
0	the very next_day a cheque for £_00 arrives through the door .
2	:)
0	anyway , like i say , it arrived and i ' m happy about that .
2	i cannot recommend too highly , the whole journey each way with jet0 was friendly , comfortable ( plenty of leg_room , and i have long legs ) and efficient .
0	i was very impressed that i received a phone call to say it had been sent and a text asking me if i wanted to change delivery dates as well as a tracker sent to me to tell me the very hour it would arrive at my house .
0	i went to buy some bits in primark the other day and was suprised how much items have gone up in price .
2	excellent choice of product and great prices - what more can i say ???
0	and no one contacted me for delivery of chairs in_advance .
0	they should also offer more_than just a refund of postage cost , perhaps a discount on your next order or something of this sort should be offered as these mistakes should not happen and especially not on more_than one_occasion .

2	i am still chasing them for a refund - they are quick enough to take my money but it will take 0 - 00 days to return it - and i am still_waiting for the promised email about how to complain_about their appalling customer service .
0	very selective about who the help obviously .
2	i managed to write about five reviews the first time without a problem . there is nothing wrong with my computer but ever_since i click on the review button for various companies it just states done . the response to my emails to support endlessly states ` can you copy and paste the urls in to an_email and send it to us ?
0	great prices , genuine products , super - fast delivery ( uk -> greece ), discount coupons shipped along my purchase , highly_recommended .
2	purchased a rolex_submariner ceramic no date from iconic_watches and despite_being sceptical initially , chris put all concerns to rest and was excellent throughout , no question was too much and was always there with quick replies to reassure us that they were working to get the watch to me as soon as possible .
2	the problem seems to be that we have an old ' economy 0 ' meter that gives two readings ( day rate and night rate ) and their website does not appear to be able to handle two readings .
0	the last time i called customer_service they gave me a quote for support , then tried to increase it during the call .
0	better_than dixon !
0	bad_experience and service .

2	will be purchasing more to improve the look of the conservatory in the near_future , and would recommend to friends .
2	driver stopped off on the way so we could get some breakfast as we had arrived very early morning .

2	i will try the same company again , but will check that the prescription has arrived
0	outstanding service , cheap , on time , and very professional .
0	after trawling_through their awful automated menus on the customer_service line , i finally found the local_depot number on a forum website ( it ' s not listed on dpd website ) and managed to speak to a human_being .

2	i love this company .
0	after saying they haven ' t received my phone for 0 days ( when intact the tracker showed they had ) i contacted them and amazingly the next_day they had not only received the phone , but had tested it and found it was damaged .
0	vistaprint is a useful site for me as a budding avon rep whose hands cramp something chronic after writing out my information 000 times on the order forms .
2	needed some new sunglasses & having just been to the opticians had a new prescription .
2	car was picked_up as arranged would be returned between 0 and 0 pm .
