Fashion_Accessories	the service and delivery at webtogs is second to none , they do exactly_what they say , excellent on price , easy to use on line ordering and polite and efficient on the phone .
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased with my purchases but , in my experience , delivery does take about 0 weeks - this hasn_'_t been a problem for me but could be for someone who sees that an order will be ready for delivery after 0 - 00 days and doesn_'_t realise they '_ll have to add on another couple of weeks or so .
Fashion_Accessories	i brought these socks for my sons christmas_present to go with his hunter_wellies and i have to say it was so easy and stress_free .

Fashion_Accessories	0st time i '_ve used pediwear and it won_' be the last .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service , keep you informed at every_stage by e_mail .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered on tuesday arrived on friday even_though the xmas_rush was in full swing .
Fashion_Accessories	well_done pediwear .
Fashion_Accessories	the loake shoes i bought can '_t be_faulted .
Fashion_Accessories	the pics and and catwalk video are excellent , but the help you get when ringing customer service is second to none , i panicked that i had ordered a colour my partner might not have liked , the staff where understanding and even offered me sound_advice and alternatives , very very reassuring .
Fashion_Accessories	pleasure to deal with , oh and the price was the lowest on the net , but the service was priceless .
Fashion_Accessories	the bag is what i expected and the service was good .
Fashion_Accessories	but the bag was squashed into the packaging box which was too small for the item - therefore the bag is badly creased .
Fashion_Accessories	shame !
Fashion_Accessories	don_'_t you have bigger boxes !
Fashion_Accessories	?
Fashion_Accessories	children love dressing up as there favorite stars i think it was great value
Fashion_Accessories	i order all my premium brand clothing from jules_b , i don_'_t even bother looking elsewhere as i would '_ve done when i 0st began to buy from them , there '_s no point !
Fashion_Accessories	you simply cannot get these brands at a better price anywhere online & their customer service is 0nd to none , i recommend to all my friends & they even ask me for advice now on what to buy & i ' m 00 next week ahah , fantastic , just lucky i don_'_t live in kendal anymore otherwise i ' d probably be divorced now ahah .
Fashion_Accessories	beautiful design and hand made quality
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered the ray - ban aviators online and they were delivered within 00_hours .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses are great value and more inexpensive than the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	i strongly_recommend that you purchase online .
Fashion_Accessories	i was originally looking for a cheap pair of glasses for my son to keep in his car .
Fashion_Accessories	i found this site and decided to get myself some funky readers and a pair of cheap rimless too - seriously , £_00 . 00 , what had i got to lose ?
Fashion_Accessories	it didn_'_t matter if they were tacky as they were only for driving .
Fashion_Accessories	just 0 days after_placing my order they arrived .
Fashion_Accessories	my son prefers his cheap £ 0 ones to his designer ones and i ' m thinking that it is rather a shame to confine my rather nice dusky pink rimless ones to just being worn for driving !
Fashion_Accessories	i also have a sneaky feeling that i '_ll be ordering a pair of readers to go with every outfit .
Fashion_Accessories	i '_ve already ordered two_pairs for my husband too .
Fashion_Accessories	not only are they cheap but the quality is as good as ones i '_ve had from the high_street and the prescription is perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m not particularly a woman with a passion for shoes or handbags but i may discover a passion for spectacles !
Fashion_Accessories	this is not hyberbole .
Fashion_Accessories	i live in toronto , canada and ordered a pair of grensons which you can '_t get here .
Fashion_Accessories	luckily i knew my size because i have purchased previously in london .
Fashion_Accessories	anyway , not only was the price competitive , but they immediately removed the vat , shipped a bonus shoehorn , polish and silk tie of my choice .
Fashion_Accessories	and the best thing is that it arrived in only seven ( 0 ) days .
Fashion_Accessories	shipping_costs were also very reasonable .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended .

Fashion_Accessories	i will always buy from them .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent , thanks webtogs
Fashion_Accessories	clothing what everybody wants but not what everybody as got
Fashion_Accessories	what a shame , i ordered some nice boat shoes for my hols and they sent me the wrong ones .
Fashion_Accessories	then said i had to open up a pay - pal account to get my postage fee back .
Fashion_Accessories	simply not good enough from a very good shop .
Fashion_Accessories	great glasses , fit well and great value .
Fashion_Accessories	what a superb company to deal with ?!
Fashion_Accessories	website is easy to find your way aroind but yiou can also phone of you are not quite sure about any detail .
Fashion_Accessories	goods were delivered on time and the 00cm ' one touch premium ' is living up to the high reputation it has gained over many_years .
Fashion_Accessories	we '_ve gone for a charcoal bbq as a replacement for our ' old ' gas bbq .
Fashion_Accessories	any regrets moving back to charcoal ?
Fashion_Accessories	none whatsoever !
Fashion_Accessories	this ' one touch premium ' unit takes some_beating !

Fashion_Accessories	couldnt_ask for anything more
Fashion_Accessories	easy website , confirmation emails and speedy delivery , well_packed and great branded products .
Fashion_Accessories	would buy again .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered jacket came the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	fab service .
Fashion_Accessories	could have returned it for free if i had needed to but a fab fit .
Fashion_Accessories	so ordered another the next_day for my husband .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely recommend country_attire to friends .
Fashion_Accessories	exceptional service , friendly staff , great products ... what more can be said ... apart_from great value .
Fashion_Accessories	i would have no_hesitation in purchasing from diamondgeezer again .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service , and really beautiful and perfect prescription varifocals .
Fashion_Accessories	i '_ll definitely buy again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	i very rarely buy clothing online unless i know the brand and sizing .
Fashion_Accessories	couldn_'_t find what i wanted elsewhere , so ordered a nehru collar shirt in cream .
Fashion_Accessories	arrived 0 days_later , far better packaged than most of the things my wife buys online from all the usual big names .
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased with the fit and quality , and the super fine cotton is just the weight i want for sicily .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended , will use again without_hesitation , many_thanks
Fashion_Accessories	asking someone to marry you is a daunting experience .
Fashion_Accessories	choosing her ring as a surprise , totally scary !
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer took away all my nerves .
Fashion_Accessories	from the ease of using the website to choose a stone and ring setting , to the wonderful customer service over the phone made the whole_experience a joy .
Fashion_Accessories	after a long chat with the team i chose a diamond of exceptional clarity and my wife has not stopped remarking on its brilliant sparkle .
Fashion_Accessories	worry_about delivering it on time was never an issue with regular_updates on the work of building the ring and the date of its arrival .
Fashion_Accessories	i highly_recommend the service .
Fashion_Accessories	could not have been happier !
Fashion_Accessories	i found the sun glasses i was looking for at a great price .
Fashion_Accessories	i was kept_updated on my order and delivery took a week in the run up to christmas , not bad .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d be happy to use this company again and to recommend them to others .
Fashion_Accessories	the variofocals and fit are not as good as last time i ordered them .
Fashion_Accessories	the prescription was the same as was everything else but this time they are not as good or as comfortable .
Fashion_Accessories	no_problems with the delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	i provided my credit_card_details in december for a repair .
Fashion_Accessories	at the end of march i am still_waiting and cannot get an adequate reply from them .
Fashion_Accessories	they now seem to be ignoring me .
Fashion_Accessories	the service seems completely disorganised .
Fashion_Accessories	ignoring me is a poor customer service policy .
Fashion_Accessories	follow_up - 0 / 0 /_0000 , hopefully progressing to a satisfactory_conclusion
Fashion_Accessories	follow_up - 00 / 0 /_0000 , hmmm ?
Fashion_Accessories	still_waiting ...... hopefully
Fashion_Accessories	i have used country_attire on 0 or 0 occasions and they are without_doubt the best site i have dealt_with .
Fashion_Accessories	as well as being good value for money the delivery service is second to none ( exceptional quick delivery in a couple of days ) and also e_- mails of delivery time etc .
Fashion_Accessories	i had to return my purchase because it was a size too small , unfortunately my size was not in stock and i was refunded the full_amount with no_problems at all .
Fashion_Accessories	wouldl definately be using country_attire again and would recommend them to anybody .
Fashion_Accessories	beautiful products .
Fashion_Accessories	fast reliable service .
Fashion_Accessories	love shopping with jules !
Fashion_Accessories	i placed an order late on a sunday , and received delivery on tuesday .
Fashion_Accessories	i live on a remote scottish island , so that is no mean feat .
Fashion_Accessories	and free delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	i '_ll be spreading the word ( and looking for an excuse to be ordering again ).
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a pair of le chameau boots as a christmas_present for my wife in early_december .
Fashion_Accessories	she tried them on briefly on christmas day , thought they were great , but wanted to try them again as she suspected they might be a little small .
Fashion_Accessories	before she got the chance to do so , we were both involved in a serious road traffic accident on new year '_s eve .
Fashion_Accessories	my wife broke bones in both her feet and was unable to try the boots on again before the expiry of the normal returns date .
Fashion_Accessories	i contacted country_house outdoor in late january to tell them what had happened , and they could not have been nicer .
Fashion_Accessories	they were happy for us to hold onto the boots for as long as it took , and then return them if they were too small .
Fashion_Accessories	my wife was finally able to try them on in march , and they were indeed too small .
Fashion_Accessories	i contacted country_house outdoor and they gave me a free returns_label and i sent the boots back .
Fashion_Accessories	within a couple of days i had a call from them offering a full_refund of the amount i had paid , and to be charged a slightly_lower price for the replacement boots a size bigger .
Fashion_Accessories	( where is the catch , you ask ?
Fashion_Accessories	...
Fashion_Accessories	there was none .)
Fashion_Accessories	the refund of the original payment was processed immediately and the new boots arrived a couple of days_later .
Fashion_Accessories	in all my dealings with them , on the phone and by e_- mail , sarah and lydia could not have been more friendly or helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	i have just paid one tenth of the amount i shelled out for my last two_pairs of prescription reading_glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	as long as you are prepared to wait for the galsses to be made and sent from hong_kong you will be " quids in "!
Fashion_Accessories	thinking of ordering some prescription sun glasses for reading on the beach - at these prices why not ?
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	what a fantastic company !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a couple of pairs of keen sandals late in the day for our holiday as the internet had been down .
Fashion_Accessories	the suggested delivery date was rather close to our holiday for comfort .
Fashion_Accessories	however , i was delighted when the shoes appeared in 0 days , weekend included !
Fashion_Accessories	not only is the service good but the quality and price of the shoes were excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you webtogs .

Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend giving chemicaluk . com a go .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought this as a last_minute christmas gift and was concerned that it would not arrive in time .
Fashion_Accessories	this wasn_'_t an issue however .
Fashion_Accessories	the harris tweed purse was as per the description and photos .
Fashion_Accessories	the only complaint from my son is that his mum has no window pocket to store his photo .
Fashion_Accessories	hello all , i had no_hesitation to place a order for retired swarovski crystal paperweights .

Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service . easy to order . speedy delivery . well priced . good range . no_complaints .
Fashion_Accessories	i '_ve bought keen footwear a few_times from webtogs .
Fashion_Accessories	never done that before thinking it would be a hassle if stuff didn_'_t fit .
Fashion_Accessories	had exceptional service , personal follow ups , hyper fast exchange and returns , return post etc .
Fashion_Accessories	to the point where it '_s just not worth going into london , trawling round shops that might have my size and spending more than need be .
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs give me complete_confidence that i '_ll have what i want within a couple of days ( or less !).
Fashion_Accessories	the people who work there are wonderfully helpful and thoughtful and i hope the company goes from strength to strength .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recomend this company to all of my friends and family .
Fashion_Accessories	the service that i received after a very small compaint , concerning loose screws , was dealt_with very promptly .
Fashion_Accessories	the service that i received was above what i would expect from a high_street opticians
Fashion_Accessories	with prescription glasses that start at only £ 0 , they are cheaper_than reading_glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	do not be put of by the prices , that are so very reasonable and the quality is great value for money .
Fashion_Accessories	trustful as always - perfect british service - as always .
Fashion_Accessories	was never screwed by a british purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	often best price also after freight
Fashion_Accessories	used these_guys a few_times to get specialist stuff which is hard to get elsewhere in the uk like western mountaineering and nemo gear .
Fashion_Accessories	can '_t fault their service and if you find a price on the web lower just email them the link and they will match the price .
Fashion_Accessories	their you - tube gear reviews are really good too .
Fashion_Accessories	i rate this company highly in terms of quality of service , and quality of product supplied to me . i wont hesitate to buy from them again . well_done webtogs !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a pair of north cape convertible trousers .
Fashion_Accessories	checked the spec against a pair which i bought about 0 years_ago , and the details on the web_page seemed to compare favourably .
Fashion_Accessories	payment easy , delivery within stated time period .
Fashion_Accessories	paid £ 0 less_than i paid 0 years_ago , and they ' re almost as good , except the new design has omitted a small pocket which was useful for change , and replaced it with a larger zip pocket .
Fashion_Accessories	the key ring is omitted as well , but not a huge problem .
Fashion_Accessories	service from webtogs has_been good on the items i have ordered from them ; always competitive , easy returns_policy , well_packaged .
Fashion_Accessories	delighted with my jacket and my free scarf will shop_here again and will recomend to friends also .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you for making such an important purchase so easy and stress_free .
Fashion_Accessories	i have had my engagement_ring since last summer and absolutely love it and we have now received our wedding rings which are amazing .
Fashion_Accessories	despite having made the wrong choice with my wedding_ring at first , with your advice and fantastic service i now have the perfect ring .
Fashion_Accessories	we will_definitely recommend purely diamonds .

Fashion_Accessories	this company did everything they promised and more .
Fashion_Accessories	they price matched a competitors price and delivered on time .
Fashion_Accessories	after i received my order i noticed webtogs had dropped the price of this item on their web_site .
Fashion_Accessories	they are now returning the cash difference to me .
Fashion_Accessories	where else do you get customer service like this ?
Fashion_Accessories	thanks webtogs .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent and accurate product descriptions backed by great service , packing and delivery .

Fashion_Accessories	was a bit_wary given the very low price of the glasses ( 0 pairs ) but as it was turned_out to be very happy with what i got .
Fashion_Accessories	the quality of the lenses and frames was excellent and the delivery service given they were coming from china was also very good .
Fashion_Accessories	would definetly buy again from this company

Fashion_Accessories	i thoroughly_recommend them .
Fashion_Accessories	phoned up with a few personal queries ,( one in particular was needing longer arms on my specs ).
Fashion_Accessories	i spoke to a lady on the team by the name of clare .
Fashion_Accessories	clare was incredibly helpful and totally understood all of my needs , infact she solved all of them for me . i will_continue to sing the praises of this wonderful , good value company and reccomend them to every one needing quality glasses with that personal_touch and good reliable service .
Fashion_Accessories	thankyou to all the team .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a pair of keen walking_boots - my favourites - but this time decided to try a new model .
Fashion_Accessories	inexplicably they were the right size but pressed in on my ankle - ultimately could not walk in them .
Fashion_Accessories	suspect a manufacturing error forcing the boot stiffening inwards .
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs could not be more helpful when i contacted them - they are replacing with an_alternative pair - slightly_cheaper at no postage cost and refunding the price difference .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer service was sensitive , helpful and positive .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_certainly use webtogs again for both its competitive_pricing and excellent service .
Fashion_Accessories	it is good to have confidence in a web company .

Fashion_Accessories	as a customer of many_years and the purchaser of many , many garments for both myself and my daughter i feel i can fully justify my award of five_star_rating without_any reservations . i can phone alex , the delightful and most helpful at all times , manageress of the conservatory shop to discuss sizing , colour and design and either purchase from her or on line . customer service is always helpful and pleasant . the returning of items is no problem . the range of goods is wide suiting both myself and daughter .

Fashion_Accessories	thankyou for your service which is lacking in other_companies these days
Fashion_Accessories	i have been wearing glasses for reading purposes for a while and i have tried many on - line glasses companies and my own personal experience with selectspecs has_been a very good and efficient service , i ordered 0 pairs of glasses at £ 0 . 00 each and i can_honestly say i was pleasantly_surprised with how good they are and i can say i was very pleased with the whole_experience , let us not forget things won_'_t always go right and there are risks with buying over the internet , so if you are upset and unhappy at some stage , think to yourself is buying over the net really for me and if not go to the high_street and pay a fortune .
Fashion_Accessories	i shall be ordering more in differing colours just for my own amusement .
Fashion_Accessories	my first purchase with " webtogs "... and they most certainly fulfill all expectations ... first of all , they were the best value by far !
Fashion_Accessories	after searching for ages ... excellent communications , my order was sent directly to the person i was buying for , it was received the very next_day ( at my request to pay the extra p_&_p ).. a totally hassle - free , prompt , reliable , professional service ... 0 *****+ from me .

Fashion_Accessories	thankyou all at webtogs !

Fashion_Accessories	0 / ordering was easy and professionally dealt_with by riverside .

Fashion_Accessories	0 / the goods purchased are excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	0 / will_definitely_use riverside garden_centre again .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased a north_face product just under a year_ago which was faulty .

Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my keen h0 sandals from webtogs by phone yesterday having been let_down by another on line shop . the service was friendly and very helpful and the goods arrived this morning .
Fashion_Accessories	i will happily_recommend webtogs to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	if you are not happy ordering on line phone them up they are nice people .
Fashion_Accessories	i stupidly ordered the wrong model guitar , they were very helpful in organising collection and delivered the right model the very next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	i needed a new pair of wellies to replace my aged hunters ... they had given in to the bad_weather we are having .
Fashion_Accessories	research led me to agile wellies ( french make ) hunters are no_longer manufactured in scotland and the reviews paint a bleak picture of the now poor quality .
Fashion_Accessories	then a quick search found me the best deal for the ones i wanted and they were to be had from country_house outdoor .
Fashion_Accessories	i found the website easy to use and with the offer of next_day delivery ( extra_cost ) i was a customer satisfied .
Fashion_Accessories	i have road tested and am very pleased with my new agiles , and hopefully we shall spend many a happy day together :-)
Fashion_Accessories	excellent company , so helpful and friendly on the telephone .

Fashion_Accessories	having checked the price and availability in the high_street i took to the internet and having looked at numerous companies decided on the sunglasses_shop , by reputation .
Fashion_Accessories	i placed my order at 00 . 00hrs 00th_may they arrived 00 . 00 00th_may , less_than 00hrs_later .
Fashion_Accessories	the sunglasses_shop kept me fully_informed of the progress of my order and when you add a saving of £_00 . 00 over the high_street price why go_anywhere_else .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks folks that '_s what i call service .

Fashion_Accessories	their returns system is good and simple .
Fashion_Accessories	no need to pay to return the items , they just knock a few_quid off your refund .
Fashion_Accessories	sounds dubious but it '_s less_than the postage would be so seems like a good deal to me .
Fashion_Accessories	good prices and lightning_fast delivery !

Fashion_Accessories	my personal experience is that this company offer an excellent product and level of customer service .

Fashion_Accessories	choosing a ring and diamond is easy and the diamonds are certified by gia which is the standard you want .
Fashion_Accessories	the finished ring is superb .
Fashion_Accessories	where these_guys excell is in comminucation - from initial order confirmation by sms and email to regular email_updates of progress and despatch .
Fashion_Accessories	i have had to return for a slight tweak - they even sent a text to say they had the ring back - i got this before royal_mail could confirm delivery !!
Fashion_Accessories	i would have no hesittaion in using these_guys again .
Fashion_Accessories	i compared prices and found juleb had the best for the item i wanted .

Fashion_Accessories	look no further .

Fashion_Accessories	this is the first time i have made an online purchase from jules_b - a hugo boss polo shirt .

Electrical_goods	i was then informed that the stock they had for the phone i ordered ( 00gb version in black ) had all got 0gb devices in them by mistake - so would not be able to get the phone .
Electrical_goods	i . e .
Electrical_goods	the web - site estimated delivery was fiction .
Electrical_goods	( for the record , the lady that dealt_with me on the phone was very pleasant and efficient )
Electrical_goods	they emailed me an offer of a white one , which i subsequently declined , and requested order cancellation .
Electrical_goods	i tried to cancel the order via the web - site , but it would not let me , as the order was at a stage requiring human intervention .
Electrical_goods	i have emailed them 0 times , and today tried to track my order to see if had been cancelled .
Electrical_goods	the web - site reported " error 000 " and claimed to be so busy , i would have to try later !!
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	i have tried again to ring customer_services , but it puts you on hold , and eventually reports all lines are busy - please try later .
Electrical_goods	not impressed .

Electrical_goods	excellent team
Electrical_goods	i bought this juicer having been recommended it by a good friend .
Electrical_goods	my previous juicer was a pain to wash and really because of this i didn_'_t use it much .
Electrical_goods	my new sena juicer from juicers uk is just awesome .
Electrical_goods	i can have my vegetables all juiced , the machine washed and back together within 00_minutes .
Electrical_goods	it '_s just amazing .
Electrical_goods	i would recommend it to anyone .
Electrical_goods	it '_s a must have .
Electrical_goods	i received my headphones , the day after i placed my order , very impressive !
Electrical_goods	they are comfortable to wear and the case is convenient for carrying .
Electrical_goods	i was a little disappointed that i could still hear the car radio , when i was trying to listen to an audio book .
Electrical_goods	this was the main_reason for buying them .
Electrical_goods	also if using them with sky go on my ipad the sound goes out of sync , in fact distorted if you with the noise reduction mode !
Electrical_goods	i chose digitalrev because they offered free delivery within a few_days of purchase which was essential as i was going away shortly_after and wanted to take the product with me .
Electrical_goods	the only other supplier that could match the sale price couldn_'_t arrange free delivery within this time_span .
Electrical_goods	delivery was on ( purchase day + 0 ) and the parcel was well_wrapped with layers of protective materials to prevent_damage .
Electrical_goods	all - in - all , a job very well_done .
Electrical_goods	the item delivered was a good spec and easy to fit .
Electrical_goods	excellent service , next_day delivery , very pleased with this companies service , web_site and ordering_process , would recommend to others .
Electrical_goods	bought the latest samson juicer gb 0000 and delighted with the build and quality of this machine .
Electrical_goods	the canon_00d was my second major purchase from digitalrev and just like the first purchase they did not disappoint .
Electrical_goods	i was kept_informed of progress at all times and even received it a day earlier_than the " tracking " predicted .
Electrical_goods	to be recommended !
Electrical_goods	from order to delivery in three days and we were able to track it around the globe .
Electrical_goods	it arrived at ema at 0000 and was at our house in derby next_morning .
Electrical_goods	thank_you we are so pleased with our purchase .
Electrical_goods	the service & delivery was exellent , delivered promptly , well_packed .
Electrical_goods	i love the item
Electrical_goods	my family have bought three_separate items from digitalrev and based on our experience would recommend this company to anyone .
Electrical_goods	why :-
Electrical_goods	* greta products
Electrical_goods	* brilliant prices
Electrical_goods	* fast delivery
Electrical_goods	* you are kept_informed every_step of the way by their own and dhl '_s tracking systems .
Electrical_goods	i bought a 0 . 0 speaker system .
Electrical_goods	following my purchase i had several e_- mails keeping me informed of the progress of the purchase order and dispatch .
Electrical_goods	after a couple of days it was delivered .
Electrical_goods	the functions of the unit are admireable .
Electrical_goods	i was a little scepticle of the 00 watt speakers , but their performance is supurb with no distortion at full volume ...
Electrical_goods	the speaker cases and unit have a high gloss finish and look very swish ( i know it '_s a dated expression !).
Electrical_goods	the only_criticism i have is that the speaker wires would look better with ' clear coating ' instead of the standard black .
Electrical_goods	easy to use remote_control and very straight_forward to assemble / wire up .
Electrical_goods	the remote also controls my mp0_player whilst plugged_into the usb port of the unit .
Electrical_goods	in summary a very nice unit at a very good price .
Electrical_goods	really helpful on the phone and good advoce .
Electrical_goods	purchase very smooth .
Electrical_goods	i have purchased from a large number of world and uk e_- cig companies but have now narrowed my list down to just a few ... safercigs is one of them !
Electrical_goods	their product range is superb and delivery time for orders is excellent .
Electrical_goods	i will be using them regularly .

Electrical_goods	my canon 00 - 000 arrived in days of ordering .
Electrical_goods	my new sigma 00mm took a few_weeks , but well_worth the wait .
Electrical_goods	it was just for an extention cable , no complains .
Electrical_goods	£_000 below uk high_street prices and delivered within 0 days , what '_s not to like .
Electrical_goods	awesome is the right word :-)
Electrical_goods	excellent service from start of the process to completion .
Electrical_goods	items ordered , all delivered promptly and well_packaged .
Electrical_goods	all worked out of the box and were high_quality as expected from lindy .
Electrical_goods	also some useful hard to find leads and adaptors .
Electrical_goods	once again dr got my order to me in a few short days ; free delivery from many uk_based companies can take longer .
Electrical_goods	after doing some research i decided the canon_powershot sx000 had everything i wanted from a new camera to replace my old canon ixus 000is - far better spec .
Electrical_goods	at a reasonable price .
Electrical_goods	i '_ve tried to give below a balanced account of my purchasing experience from digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	delivery : i ordered it just before midnight on sunday , 00rd march - it was dispatched on wednesday 00th from hong_kong and delivered to me in uk less_than 00_hours_later on friday , 00th_march .
Electrical_goods	that '_s less_than four and a half days from ordering it to delivery - amazingly fast .
Electrical_goods	packaging was excellent - there was no way it was going to get damaged with the amount of bubblewrap that had been used .
Electrical_goods	price : regarding price - all i can say is , fantastic .
Electrical_goods	digitalrev were by far the cheapest when compared to other internet sellers , especially when you consider shipping is free - in case you are wondering , there were no " surprise " customs charges !
Electrical_goods	the famous " local " high_street / retail_park outlets had even higher prices !
Electrical_goods	quality of camera : before it arrived i had read on various internet forums that several people were experiencing problems with the battery losing its charge very quickly when using this camera for taking video .
Electrical_goods	i did panic that i had made a wrong decision but decided i ' d have to wait_until it was delivered so that i could check this out for myself .
Electrical_goods	after giving the battery a good initial charge everything was fine when taking photos but as soon as i started to video ( and use the zoom ), sure_enough , i got the low charge indicator for the battery .
Electrical_goods	of course at this point i did panic a little but i have found that by making a number of changes to the default camera settings ( there are lots of them ) i can now reliably use the camera together with the video without the battery going flat or the low charge indicator coming on .
Electrical_goods	of course , like any battery , it doesn_'_t last forever but i ' m not experiencing the problems some people have reported .
Electrical_goods	i ' m not a technical expert and i know that the changes i have made were more luck than judgement , but the bottom_line is that this camera exactly meets my requirements for being compact , not heavy , point and shoot , great zoom ( x00 optical with another x0 digital as well ), capable of producing some top quality photos .
Electrical_goods	i will need to buy a camera for my daughter soon and will not_hesitate to use digitalrev again .
Electrical_goods	in the meantime , i ' d like to say a big " thank_you " to everyone there .
Electrical_goods	as a first time user .. i am very impressed with the vision ego kit i have ... great delivery time ... sturdy kit ... had a small problem that was solved immediately by the company ... and the juice is very nice !
Electrical_goods	i will be a regular buyer from the company .. and will be recommending it to friends who would like to try vaping !
Electrical_goods	excellent prompt service , product exactly as_described , couldn_'_t be better
Electrical_goods	excellent website , best price on the internet and arrived faster from hong_kong than an order placed in the uk !
Electrical_goods	item was very well_packaged and i was able to follow its delivery progress online so was kept_fully_informed of its imminent arrival .
Electrical_goods	i was initially a little tentative buying from a seller based in hong_kong , so i phoned the company before ordering online and spoke to a helpful chap_who assured me there would be no extra import_duties or fees to pay .
Electrical_goods	this proved to be true , and my camera was delivered quickly and efficiently .
Electrical_goods	i would ' nt hesitate to order from digital_rev again .
Electrical_goods	initial phone on schedule as per delivery details but it devloped a fault after a couple weeks .
Electrical_goods	spoke to pmc returns details emailed and sent back and replacement provided within two days .
Electrical_goods	excellant service and dealt_with the situation with minimum_fuss .
Electrical_goods	products will always go_wrong key to this was the way it was dealt_with and that was first_class .
Electrical_goods	good website , easy to use and the chosen headphones were very competitively_priced .
Electrical_goods	as advertised , the item arrived the next working day after i placed the order .
Electrical_goods	i am_delighted with the denon ah - d000 headphones - very good value for money all_round .
Electrical_goods	hifiheadphones - good job well_done .
Electrical_goods	i placed my order late on sunday_night ( uk time ) and received my canon camera g00 mid - day wednesday and it only took three days to be delivered .
Electrical_goods	fantastic service from digitalrev and can only be highly_recommended .
Electrical_goods	and by the way , the price and camera are just great .
Electrical_goods	also , check out digitalrev '_s you tube instructional videos which are also of a very high_quality , and humorous as well .

Electrical_goods	i bought this for my dad .
Electrical_goods	he wanted to stop_smoking but has_been smoking for over 00 years and had tried the e cigarettes you can buy at garages .
Electrical_goods	although he tried hard to use these instead of cigarettes he just didn_'_t get the satisfaction from them .
Electrical_goods	he talked to someone who had tried the safersigs and recommeded them .
Electrical_goods	i phoned darren from safercigs and asked about what i needed as a starterpack for my dad and he was extremely_helpful .
Electrical_goods	sent me links to what to buy online and a link to a video to show how to use them .
Electrical_goods	after receiving them within a week , my dad was up and running .
Electrical_goods	he had a bit of a hiccup at the start and did not really manage to get a satisfactory smoke from them so i emailed darren and explained the problem he was having , he emailed straight back and told me how to work it which i explained to my dad and it worked perfectely .
Electrical_goods	very friendly and helpful service , would recommend them .
Electrical_goods	the fire i purchased from hi - tower is great i have never seen one with the smoke effect it looks great & works well as discribed fast delivery & good communication i whould recommend hi - tower & the team .

Electrical_goods	i ' m impressed and happy , well_done hi -_fi tower .
Electrical_goods	i searched long and hard for the best deal on my new camera .
Electrical_goods	whatever , brand you buy and at whatever cost point , we all like to make our money go further and feel_confident in both the product that we have bought and the company who we bought it from .
Electrical_goods	there are hundreds of reports littering the web of dodgy companies selling to desperate consumers - counterfeit goods , long and costly delivery charges , goods that never materialise , money disappearing from accounts , worthless warranties etc .
Electrical_goods	i am happy to tell you that digitalrev have exceeded my expectations and my camera arrived ahead of schedule , perfectly packed with all statutory paperwork , software and included accessories .
Electrical_goods	ordering during " black friday " week was a real_test for digitalrev that they surpassed by providing free tracking via_dhl and initial email_confirmation of order fulfillment / shipment .
Electrical_goods	this meant that i knew every day where my parcel had got to and at what time .
Electrical_goods	this really is a smart , professional service .
Electrical_goods	i reckon i saved around 00_% on the list price .
Electrical_goods	if you are happy to trust a ) that there will be nothing wrong with your purchase on arrival and . b ) that if there is , digital_rev '_s 00 month international warranty will cover you for local repairs during the first year .

Electrical_goods	a few_weeks_ago i bought a canon multifunction wifi printer from pixmalia .
Electrical_goods	from the outset while the printer would work if connected by cable , it wouldn_'_t work using wifi .
Electrical_goods	pixmalia agreed the printer could be returned to its workshop , but did not agree to a refund .
Electrical_goods	0 weeks_later the printer arrived back ( i was without a printer for those weeks ).
Electrical_goods	what little documentation came with it was in french - as was the printer which had had its operating language changed to french !
Electrical_goods	i don_'_t speak french so was no wiser as to what had happened - and when i started it up - no wifi connection was possible !
Electrical_goods	i phoned the company , but all they would offer is a return to the workshop and another 0 week wait .
Electrical_goods	this is just not good enough !
Electrical_goods	the printer was not fit for purpose .
Electrical_goods	i contacted canon directly and within 00_minutes they had identified the problem and fixed the machine ( a software issue ).
Electrical_goods	i will never buy from pixmania again

Electrical_goods	being ' older ' i yearn for the ' good ole days ' when you got - service - when buying stuff .
Electrical_goods	i ' m well used to buying on - line from amazon and play and so on , and , well , yeah , it works but it has no soul .
Electrical_goods	these_guys are a real breath of fresh_air .
Electrical_goods	the site '_s good ; they had what i wanted and the site answered all the questions i had ( so i didn_'_t need to call ).
Electrical_goods	the ' phones arrived the very next_day , packed as if for armageddon .
Electrical_goods	even the tracking emails have style !

Electrical_goods	there may come a day when we all work through the same electronic connectors but that day is a long way off .

Electrical_goods	i took the 0st_class post option , ordered late on a tuesday_evening , the goods were with me by thursday am .
Electrical_goods	that was impressive and plenty good enough but they also offer a next_day courier service for those in a rush .
Electrical_goods	i got a pair of roksan kandy k0 amplifiers
Electrical_goods	the staff were helpful prior to purchasing it giving me advice in the sound quality .

Electrical_goods	i ordered a multi card_reader panel from lindy as it said it was windows 0 compatible , i had purcased various others that were rubbish to say the least from other outlets , this unit is working without_any_problems at all , the only item i was a little bemused at was i had to physically install a driver for windows 0 ( never known that before ) the reader has nice deep entries into each of the card_reader orifices , so there is little chance of bending any pins .
Electrical_goods	the multi facia that comes with the unit was easy to change over and i must_say that they look good too .
Electrical_goods	the only_downside i had with the unit was it needed a little persuasion to line up with my case screw holes but that was soon overcome .
Electrical_goods	all in all a lovely piece of kit .
Electrical_goods	lindys service deserves more than 0_stars , i ordered it just after lunch one day and it was delivered at around 00 am the next ( saturday too ) by royal_mail , no waiting for the courier to arrive as and when they want this time !
Electrical_goods	- just keep it up lindy , you ’ re great .
Electrical_goods	excellent service and prices - thank_you !
Electrical_goods	superb service & excellent item .
Electrical_goods	i have used many ebay shops over the years but i have to admit hifi_tower is the very best .
Electrical_goods	nothing was to much_trouble & the courtsey shown was second to none .
Electrical_goods	my item was so well_packaged it felt like opening a russain doll , there were three layers to ensure my item arrived intact and undamaged .
Electrical_goods	thank_you for providing a complete & friendly service .
Electrical_goods	i bought via_ebay from bop - dj , just about the smallest , cheapest item a dj could need - a headshell weight for a technics turntable .
Electrical_goods	anyway it arrived within 0 days and was exactly_what was listed .
Electrical_goods	can '_t complain at that !
Electrical_goods	ordered a nikon camera lens on saturday from the uk , and it arrived on the following_tuesday .
Electrical_goods	really quick delivery , and the cheapest price anywhere .
Electrical_goods	thank_you
Electrical_goods	always a fast service with good quality goods
Electrical_goods	i recently had to return a product to hifi - tower .
Electrical_goods	from beginning to end the process was so simple and dealt_with in an excellent manner .
Electrical_goods	when i first ordered my product from this company everything was well_done , from the order process , packing of my item to delivery .
Electrical_goods	then when it had to be done in reverse , the customer service was excellent .
Electrical_goods	i received advice all the way through the process and a very very prompt refund .
Electrical_goods	i would have no_hesitation in recommending this company and will_certainly be using them again in the future .
Electrical_goods	this is the company all internet sellers should be trying to emulate .
Electrical_goods	a big camera from hong_kong to london quicker_than a tiny 0gb_ram stick form somewhere in england to london .
Electrical_goods	they didn_'_t even take the money form my account until after i had signed for the camera delivery .
Electrical_goods	best prices , best service .
Electrical_goods	i '_ve now bought quite a few z - wave bits and pieces and i '_ve found uk automation really helpful in answering any questions i had .
Electrical_goods	most z - wave components are fairly easy to integrate to the vera0 controller but one proved a little more difficult .
Electrical_goods	having found differing opinions on how to include , group or associate a horstmann hrt0 - zw thermostat and asr - zw receiver ( switch ) .... one thing i can say is uk automation '_s instructions actually work ..... they offer specific instructions on how to do this and i can thoroughly_recommend following these .
Electrical_goods	this is the third time i '_ve placed an order with hispek , they seem to have a problem with customer_services they don_'_t contact you if there is a problem but leave it until you contact them , i don_'_t mind problems with orders as long as i am aware of it .
Electrical_goods	having said that my order is supposed to arrive on tuesday 00th_may ( placed on 00th_april ) bank_holiday '_s and stock etc .
Electrical_goods	so if i can i '_ll leave a review then .
Electrical_goods	to add to my review , i '_ve just received my cooker at the time specified and by the most helpful driver you could want .
Electrical_goods	the cooker is all and more than i expected and very pleased with both the price and the product .
Electrical_goods	regarding customer service if they just followed up an order after confirmation with an expected delivery date but apart_from that hispek is a good company and worth looking at especially there prices i can '_t fault that .
Electrical_goods	living on the isle of lewis was very surprised we recieved the goods so quick and at the same price the uk_mainland pay .
Electrical_goods	we had a problem with one of the products being damaged , this was resolved within 0 hours of contacting hifi - tower .
Electrical_goods	very happy with this service , excellent friendly personal messages , keep_up the great work .
Electrical_goods	the item arrived well within the stated delivery time , was very well_packaged and arrived in perfect order .
Electrical_goods	communication was excellent , from first acknowledgement of order , to confirmation of payment and despatch of item with expected delivery day .
Electrical_goods	the product itself is very smart , appears to be of good quality , and works very well .
Electrical_goods	i am very pleased with the transaction in every_respect .
Electrical_goods	product sound and an extra plus came with video software which is the reason_why i bought it .
Electrical_goods	firewire + usb0 .
Electrical_goods	all products ordered arrive in next to no time and as expected

Electrical_goods	ordered on thursday_night before easter friday so expected a little delay , but after a couple of emails with tracking_number and a couple of text to my phone product arrived tuesday_morning .

Electrical_goods	each time they have delivered ontime & the product has_been exactlyas described .
Electrical_goods	ccouldn '_t ask much more from a company

Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely recommend mazuma - much_better_than envirofone who i would not use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	ia fast and efficient service , and i liked the extra cash with argos_vouchers .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really happy with mazumamobile . com !

Cell_phone_Recycling	my two year_old iphone 0 is in exceptionally good condition as it '_s always been in a case .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no scratches or cracks & works_perfectly - far better_than you would expect for a phone half its age .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was promised £_000 , i sent it off which cost me £ 0 they emailed me a week_later and offered only £_00 saying that ' lots of visible marks and scratches all around the handset .'
Cell_phone_Recycling	total rubbish and i rejected their offer and told them to return the phone without delay .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then received an improved offer of £_000 - proof in my mind that these_clowns were just trying it on .
Cell_phone_Recycling	again i rejected their offer and they have now returned the phone which i shall now put on ebay and expect to get at_least £_000 for it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i checked their small_print which states that they will pay the promised amount providing there is no damage other than fair wear and tear , my phone fitted into that category easily .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am only £ 0 out of pocket but i have wasted 0 weeks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	avoid_avoid_avoid !!!

Cell_phone_Recycling	once i had filled in the web form postage envelope only took 0 days to come and i posted the phone the next_day .

Cell_phone_Recycling	posted my 0gs on saturday_morning .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received the money in my account by 0 : 00 pm on monday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if only everyone you dealt_with on the net worked like this !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma in the past to recycle older_model phones and been very happy with the speed and value offered .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recyckled an old htc_wildfire last_week , posting it on the thursday after christmas .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received my argos_voucher on the saturday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn_'_t actually get any faster_than that .
Cell_phone_Recycling	definately recommend mazuma , sent my sons old phone to envirophone initially , it was in perfect working order and they offered £_00 for it , but once they had it sent an_email to say it was defective & would not charge , said they could only pay us £ 0 !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	or would send it back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so , had it returned , and checked it - all fine .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent it to mazuma who paid us a fair price of £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not a rip_off like the above company !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	some doubts to use this service , but was amazed by the super_fast and efficient service , and the price paid for my phone was excellent .

Cell_phone_Recycling	didn_'_t cost me anything to send them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	within a few_days i received an_email to say my bank_account would be credited with the amount originally_quoted .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so fast and excellent service .

Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was a very stress_free experience applied tehy said yea sent an envelope put the phone in sent it off money in the bank the next_day even notified me when the transaction was completed easy_peasy
Cell_phone_Recycling	swift , efficient service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good price paid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	clear_instructions and rapid payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	gave me a fair price and paid very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good communication and updates throughout the process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very pleased .
Cell_phone_Recycling	found tthe website easy to use , postage bag was sent following_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my old phone on the friday_lunchtime and my money was in the bank monday_morning .
Cell_phone_Recycling	smooth and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would and have reccomended to all my friends
Cell_phone_Recycling	what more can you ask for , got an_email_saying money would be transferred , give it 0 working_days , it was in my account that afternoon , highly_recommended
Cell_phone_Recycling	may not pay immediately but i had the money within a few_days - best price which was main point
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick , easy and prompt payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	are better deals out there but they make it so easy i keep using them !
Cell_phone_Recycling	however , recently sold them an iphone for £_000 and i asked them how they made money on that to be told they sold them to developing countries .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so , that makes me a little uneasy to be helping a company make money out of africa or wherever .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i mean , how can they make money on a 0nd_hand iphone when paying me £_000 ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	doesn_'_t sound right at all hence lowered review rating .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0_stars for service , 0_stars for morals .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after careful review and looking for best price for my old iphone the zoomfish team gadget team came up tops , not only with best trade in price but on speed and service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	with internet deals there is always an element of doubt about quote matching payment , so i was really impressed when the packaging arrived the day after getting an on - line quote , followed_by a confirmation of receipt and payment all within 0 / 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i rarely take the time to recommend or to give feedback but zoomfish excelled in every way so 0 * for price service and efficiency is easy to score and encourage others to use their service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	also .......

Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	when i decided to sell my old iphone , i was a little_wary as it was the first time i ' d tried this sort of sale .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found a mobile_phone resale price comparison site and did a google_search on the couple of companies that offered the highest prices - alarm_bells went off for those companies .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma was very near the top in price and my searches didn_'_t throw up any apparent concerns so i went_ahead with the sale with them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was a smooth and rapid transaction and they sent emails at every_step so i knew what stage the process was at .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the money was in my bank_account the day after i posted my phone off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d definitely_use mazuma again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	due to illness i had to extend the offer time in my phone and received a substantially lower price , i rang within 00_minutes of the email being sent to say i ' d have the phone returned only to be told this was not possible .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the receptionist said the phone had arrived 0 day out of the sales agreement by arriving today , so the original offer did not stand !
Cell_phone_Recycling	upon checking the royal_mail tracking the phone had been received the day before as she had said was required , so another phone_call was made they then proceeded to try and say that was the date the item would be received at the royal_mail sorting_office not at envirophone even_though this was clearly_stated on the royal_mail tracking_information .
Cell_phone_Recycling	beware of using this company they obviously operate a policy of making a offer but i would be surprised if people receive the amounts stated !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i only put my old phone in the post box to mazuma on the monday_evening , had an text confirming that everything was going through on the thursday and had the cheque for the full_amount quoted by the saturday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely_brilliant !
Cell_phone_Recycling	totally different to another company who originally_quoted slightly more for the same phone but , on receipt took 0 weeks to contact me to tell me the phone was " not of an acceptable standard ", refused to send it back until i ' d payed £ 0 postage , then took another 0 weeks to send it back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d never use anyone but mazuma again !

Cell_phone_Recycling	a further 00_hours and i had a cheque for the agreed ammount .

Cell_phone_Recycling	everything worked out as they described .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my first question concerned how to find the required imei_number when my phone '_s screen was broken .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a very quick and helpful email .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then submitted my request , and the pack came very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had 0 old_phones worth nothing , and a quick email ascertained that i could send these as well .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i took their advice of posting my package with a receipt at the post_office , but the email notification arrived the following_day , and my argos_voucher the day after , i believe .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted the phone on friday and the money was in my account by lunchtime on the monday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will_continue to recommend and use this company
Cell_phone_Recycling	these_people had my imei_number so would have known the phones status before i sent it to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	due to my daughter losing the phone for a week , it had been reported to the police , lost or stolen , and also to orange who blocked it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone was found and the police came and took a statement to that effect .
Cell_phone_Recycling	orange unblocked the phone and all was well for the two years of the contract .
Cell_phone_Recycling	now this company have my phone and will not pay me or return it because it is supposedly still_showing as stolen .
Cell_phone_Recycling	orange say the phone is fine , the policeman tells_me he has reported the phone as found and the police station tells_me there is no offence showing against this phone but still they refuse to either pay up or return my phone .

Flowers	yes , you service is on my ' favourites ' list
Flowers	thanks !
Flowers	this was such an easy way to order beautiful_flowers quickly and at great value too .
Flowers	thanks iflorist !
Flowers	my husband ordered a bouquet of flowers as a birthday surprise and indeed it was a surprise but not a good one !
Flowers	as the date he requested for delivery fell on a bank_holiday , prestige_flowers in their wisdom decided to deliver 0 days early without even checking that this was ok . well , it wasn_'_t as we were away on the day the company decided to deliver and so the flowers had to be taken to the local royal_mail delivery office where they had to stay for 0 days because of the bank_holiday and the limited opening hours of our local office .
Flowers	needless to say , by the time i collected them they were all dead .
Flowers	on contacting the company , my husband was told that it was in their small_print that flowers could be delivered on an_alternative date if the company so decided and that a refund was out of the question .
Flowers	shocking service to say the least but judging_by other comments on this site , prestige_flowers won_'_t be the slightest bit bothered that they spoilt my birthday surprise .
Flowers	after ordering on thursday before mothers_day my mum still has not recieved her bouqet six days on !
Flowers	after trying all day to get hold of someone finally they refused to help saying they couldnt offer a refund and if the flowers still didnt_turn_up they would resend them .
Flowers	i paid extra for a sunday delivery also .
Flowers	i wanted to talk to a supervisor and was told no one else could help mke after sending emails i still have not had an_apology or refund or any flowers
Flowers	i wouldnt even give them half a star !
Flowers	poor excuse for a company !
Flowers	have now recieved an_email from some rep called jamie after a week of getting no where .
Flowers	prestige_flowers have blamed royal_mail but still cant tell me where my flowers are . was advised they could send another bouquet and a £ 0 . 00 voucher fpr next time !
Flowers	pah next time !
Flowers	i have been advised by trading standads that as they have breached their contract to deliver the said flowers on the said day i should write and request a full_refund .
Flowers	i have emailed them to inform them but surprise_surprise heard_nothing again from them .
Flowers	i have also contacted watchdog and explained the situation > please report them if you are disappointed with the service , so we can stop another family_members day being ruined !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	ordered flowers for my friend and was impressed that delivery was free .
Flowers	i had text_alerts informing_me when the flowers were despatched and when my friend received them .
Flowers	fantastic service .
Flowers	placed an order on 00th_december to be delivered to two elderly ladies in australia on 00st_december costing me over £_000 .
Flowers	they were delivered on 00th_december ( why did they ask me for a delivery date then ?)
Flowers	and they were dead by the 00st .
Flowers	i have used other_companies to deliver flowers to australia and usually get about 0 - 00 days life out of the flowers - 0 days at £_00 each is ridiculous .
Flowers	there online customer_services refuse to help as i don_'_t have photographic_evidence of the flowers which i cannot get .
Flowers	as one of the deliveries was to my mother - i don_'_t think she would lie about something like this .
Flowers	don_'_t use this company - go somewhere_else .
Flowers	this is the third time i '_ve used you to send flowers to friends and relatives .
Flowers	i ' m really impressed with the quality of the flowers , they look just like the photographs .
Flowers	you get a text to tell you when the flowers have been delivered , and the recipients have always been happy .
Flowers	why look anywhere_else !
Flowers	!
Flowers	after trying unsuccessfully for two days to send flowers to my sister , i decided to try arena flowers out of sheer desperation .
Flowers	it was the easiest order i have ever been able to place .
Flowers	my package arrived on time and my sister was so surprised by the way it was arranged and she , s also very happy with the contents .
Flowers	i , m_glad i did not get through to the other_places i tried .
Flowers	thank_you arena flowers for making me and my sister happy , and may your business continue to bloom .
Flowers	i will refer you to my friends and you can count on future orders from me .
Flowers	i have been using arenaflowers . com for a number of years to send flowers and gifts to my relatives in england .
Flowers	i used to have to get up in the middle of the night to call a florist ( due to the time change ).
Flowers	now i get email reminders about birthdays and anniversaries a week ahead , i no_longer have to set my alarm and lose sleep or pay huge postal fees for shipping gift parcels or worry_about postal strikes in either country !
Flowers	i have yet to be disappointed , and even better , i look like a rock star niece for being on time ( not something i am best known for ).
Flowers	plus i often hear from my auntie that the bouquets we send are so big that she breaks them into several groups and decorates the whole house .
Flowers	i can say that this is by far the best on - line shopping system , and best floral delivery i have ever_encountered in canada or elsewhere .
Flowers	thanks .
Flowers	i wanted flowers for a birthday celebration for a friend in malta .
Flowers	i chose floraqueen .
Flowers	the web_page showed a beautiful range of flowers to choose from and was easy to use .

Flowers	dont buy from this company flowers are nothing like advertised on website totally disappointed might as well of gone and picked some weeds out of back garden .
Flowers	vase was ok . had instructions to leave with neighbour which i did not ask for , and didnt bother to even wait for door to be opened .
Flowers	great value & good communication ... would use again ..
Flowers	first time i had ever ordered flowers on line , i couldnt_believe_how quick they were delivered they brought a smile to my mums face especially the heart what i purchased to go on them i thought the price was very reasonable and will be using them again in the future ...
Flowers	terrible service i ordered flowers in good time and didn_'_t arrive on specific day i contacted eflorist who just told me i should have read small_print and used a florist if i wanted them for a specific day i felt the adviser was having a laugh at my expense .... they arrived a day late but wasn_'_t left even_though i left clear delivery instructions emails haven_'_t been answered .... please read other review_sites to get a clear picture of this company ... they just don_'_t care about the customer when things go_wrong and ignore you
Flowers	thank_you for the flowers - the delivery was fast and on time , they were deliveried in 000_% perfect condionion and my gf said they were top qualilty - i will be using you now not the other rival deliveriy outlet that starts with an inta - thanks you
Flowers	i would rate this company a 0 .
Flowers	i ordered the arrangement a week before_christmas to be delivered on the 00nd .
Flowers	it was not delivered until the week_later .
Flowers	this was a christmas center piece which was useless after the holidays .
Flowers	there was no card or note from us in the delivery so my parents did not know who sent it until i asked if they recieved it and ther was no name of the florist .
Flowers	i would have appreciated an e_- mail if they knew they would be late and figure out a way to change the order to something that was more appropriate for the new year !!!
Flowers	i will never use this web_site or florist again unless i get a refund !
Flowers	very easy to order , efficient service and elegant flowers .
Flowers	my husband thought they cost me double the price !
Flowers	if only i ' d read the reviews before i placed my order .
Flowers	i ordered a special thank - you gift of sunflowers , prosecco & a teddy_bear for my daughter and family at vast expense .
Flowers	i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 to have them delivered yesterday evening but they didn_'_t arrive ( i had of course to spoil the surprise as i had to ask my daughter if anything had come ).
Flowers	i emailed and phoned and after hanging on for ages and then being cut_off i finally got through to someone who gave a half - hearted apology and said she would ring me in the morning to tell me what had happened .
Flowers	no - one rang .
Flowers	i emailed again and then rang them myself .
Flowers	no - one could explain what had happened but i was told that the delivery would be made this evening instead .
Flowers	surprise_surprise !
Flowers	no delivery again .
Flowers	i have just spoken to them and have been promised a re - delivery next tuesday !
Flowers	( with fresh flowers ) they say they have refunded the delivery charge and also the cost of the teddy_bear but after_reading all the reviews i '_ll believe it when / if it happens .
Flowers	i agree with everyone_else - always read_reviews first , and never use this company
Flowers	site was very easy to use .
Flowers	everything was very clear , all items were clearly_marked and labeled , payment and ordered conformation very user_friendly .
Flowers	i would recommend this company and site to everybody .
Flowers	i ordered flowers and a teddy for my sister on her_birthday for same day delivery and they arrived later in the day .
Flowers	they were left with a neighbour as my sister was out having a birthday lunch .
Flowers	when she came back her neighbour brought them round and my sister was absolutely_thrilled and delighted - the flowers themselves were so beautiful and she loved them and loved the teddy !
Flowers	i received a text_message from teleflorist to confirm that the flowers had been delivered .
Flowers	the order had been made completely on line and it was extremely reassuring to know that the arrangements had all lgone smoothly as i live several hours away from my sister and could not be with her on her_birthday .
Flowers	thank_you so much teleflorist , its my first time using you , but i will be back !!
Flowers	happy customer x
Flowers	i received a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates from a friend .
Flowers	the flowers were just about acceptable although two stems were snapped , and the 0 roses only lasted two days .
Flowers	the 000 g duc d ' o belgian luxury chocolates which were paid for as an extra were actually out of date when they arrived .
Flowers	i contacted the company and had to prove this by sending a photo , which i did .
Flowers	ten days ago they promised to send a replacement box of chocolates .
Flowers	they never arrived , so i chased up this week and today i received a 000g sloane square chocolates which had been wrapped in a piece of a0 paper and were smashed to pieces .
Flowers	so what i got was an inferior ( the company sloane square is located in lancashire and is a brand of the colonial gift company which is used by prestige ) and smaller box of chocolates now in pieces .
Flowers	i have been told that i have to send another photo and they will send out another box also wrapped in an a0 piece of paper because they do not have any wrapping for boxes of chocolates .
Flowers	this company is a farce - do not waste your money with them .
Flowers	my friends were indeed delighfed and surprised to recieve their roses and frescias together with chocolates on the day i had asked for delivery .
Flowers	they told me they were beautiful and i was so pleased arenaflowers had met my expectations .
Flowers	i ordered this particular bunch of flowers for my mothers 00th_birthday .
Flowers	she_loves roses and purple .
Flowers	the flowers arrived on time and were well_presented .
Flowers	the colours and arrangement were lovely .
Flowers	i only have two complaints ...
Flowers	the roses , on the second day , have already started to brown at the edges of some petals .
Flowers	secondly , i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for a bigger ' bunch '.
Flowers	for the price i was expecting more .
Flowers	i ' m a little disappointed to be honest , but , my mother was very happy .
Flowers	i found teleflorist great to use .
Flowers	easy to navigate through the website , with great pictures to see of the array of types of flower bouquets for sale .
Flowers	great prices - the one i bought was reduced in price , which allowed me to upgrade to the slightly bigger version .
Flowers	bouquet was delivered on time on the correct date .
Flowers	no_problems .
Flowers	great service .
Flowers	ordered online at 0000 in manchester , delivered in harwich only 0 hours_later .
Flowers	my sister was very impressed by the variety and quality .
Flowers	arrived saturday_afternoon , once i opened the box i realised flowers were all in bud .
Flowers	this i knew would give me longer life on my flowers .
Flowers	they have opened up now and are lovely .
Flowers	i was happy with the service and the quality of the plant
Flowers	really prompt delivery of high_quality products always !
Flowers	great selection
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on time and i was informed by email when they were being dispatched and when they had been delivered successfully .
Flowers	my friend said they were in perfect_condition and such a beautiful arrangement , they made her cry !
Flowers	i would be confident using serentaflowers again .
Flowers	i had left it rather late to send flowers to a friend for a " special " birthday .
Flowers	having trawled search_engines i noticed serenataflowers .
Flowers	they offered next_day free delivery if i ordered up to 00 . 00 p . m . that night ( i managed to order at 0 . 00 p . m , nothing like being close to the wire !)
Flowers	and were competitively_priced .
Flowers	serenataflowers kept me informed what was happening all the way along with my order via text and email .
Flowers	i was well impressed , as was my friend when she received her beautiful_bouquet , having arrived home after a birthday lunch out .
Flowers	she was probably thinking by this time that i had forgotten such a momentous occasion !
Flowers	serenataflowers really saved the day for me and stood head and shoulders_above their competitors when it comes to service so thank_you from the bottom of my heart .
Flowers	i shall_definitely_use them again and mention them to all my friends .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for delivery the same day for my husband and his brothers and sisters who were together following the death that day of their sister christine .
Flowers	it was a very sad time for all concerned .
Flowers	however , the flowers arrived , i did not request the colours but they could not have been more appropriate !
Flowers	they were bright pinks which christine not only loved , but as she died of breast_cancer were very apt .
Flowers	they were still bright and cheerful the following_monday ( 0 week_later ) and smelled lovely .
Flowers	many_thanks
Flowers	this is a well_laid_out site , it is so easy to find the flowers or plants i want .
Flowers	ordering is straight_forward and you can use paypal at the checkout .
Flowers	choice of delivery days means i can choose a day to suit , even next_day .
Flowers	i am looking_forward to hearing from my mum when she gets her rose plant .
Flowers	i wanted to send my sister in law flowers .
Flowers	the most obvious choice of florist would be interflora .
Flowers	however , i looked online and just wasn_'_t impressed at the bouguets .
Flowers	then i saw the reviews for this company and thought all those people can '_t be wrong .
Flowers	to be in london and flowers arrive in san diego the next_day is just so impressive .
Flowers	so service was good but most of all the flowers were really beautiful .
Flowers	my sister in law was surprised and thrilled so the desired effect was achieved .
Flowers	thank_you so much .
Flowers	will always use you for flowers abroad .
Flowers	sent flowers to mother - in law -- who is in a nursing home -- to arrive on saturday .
Flowers	delivery on time - but what a mess .
Flowers	flowers with heads detached from stems , stems with no flowers anywhere in site adn those flowers that where intact look as though they died last_week .
Flowers	have e_- mailed customer service and received a rweply stating that they need a photograph of flowers !
Flowers	hello !
Flowers	i live in manchester , mother - in law lives in wallasey -- the reason we sent flowers rather_than take them - how the hell am i suppopsed to get photographs -- remote_control ?
Flowers	have heard_nothing from them since .
Flowers	awful service --- do not use
Flowers	the flowers my friend received for her_birthday were beautiful , she was really pleased with them .
Flowers	i have used e florist many_times and i have never been disappointed .
Flowers	buying flowers on line can be precarious as some flowers may not have the high_standard as i have got from e florist .
Flowers	outstanding , everything is so easy , need to add much more gift baskets and alot more items for men
Flowers	thanks
Flowers	there was a good choice of flowers and good follow_up informing when they were dispatched and delivered
Flowers	used seranata for the first time - based mostly on reasonable_prices .
Flowers	they kept me updated regularly so i knew_exactly_what was going on - really great .
Flowers	my daughter & family moved to a new house & we sent flowers .
Flowers	the address was slightly wrong 0 the neighbours rejected the flowers .
Flowers	within 0 working_days , they were resent .
Flowers	excellent customer service !
Flowers	i ordered a bouget from you for my son & daughter in law on sunday_night & they were delivered on monday the next_day . irecived a phone_call on monday_afternoon from mydaughter in law letting me know she had recieved the flowers & that they were really lovely she thanked me for them , also she asked me if i would thank the florist .
Flowers	that made them as they were so lovely .
Flowers	. thank_you i now know that i can .
Flowers	order from you next time i want to send flowers .
Flowers	margaret stevens .
Flowers	easy ordering
Flowers	delivered as requested and on time
Flowers	mum says the flowers are gorgeous
Flowers	ordered flowers on sunday , to be delivered to my mum for her_birthday the following wednesday , as advertised .
Flowers	wednesday came no flowers , thursday royal_mail attempted to deliver flowers but mum was out , royal_mail re delivered flowers on saturday_morning , and i wish they hadnt .
Flowers	flowers have been lying in a box without water for a few_days , they were wilting and turnign brown .
Flowers	phoned customer service , not interested , they have not broken any contract , flowers were sent out .
Flowers	they also fail to respond to further emails sent , have been promised someone will phone me soon ( 0 days ago ) nothing .
Flowers	basically they are not interested they have got the money for the flowers , they dont care how and when they are delivered .
Flowers	so basically have paid for dead flowers to be deliverd to my mum 0 days after her_birthday .
Flowers	so upsetting and stressful for my mum and me .
Flowers	never again .
Flowers	my experiences of eflorist are that the order exceeds my expectations compared to many other_suppliers , including large retail store online services .
Flowers	why do you offer a £ 0 voucher when i have already said i would never use iflorist again .?
Flowers	offer some real money as you have promised elsewhere and don_'_t be miserly .
Flowers	so much for the 000_% guarantee of satisfaction .
Flowers	the whole_thing is laughable .
Flowers	second time i have ordered from serenata , arrived on time and lasted longer_than any other others i have ordered from in the past
Flowers	i have used this company before but won_'_t ever again i ordered 0 bunches of flowers for elderly aunts for xmas .
Flowers	one lot arrived but the others didn_'_t .
Flowers	the money was taken from my card .
Flowers	now serenata say they don_'_t have any phone contact but deal will deal with problems by email , within an_hour .
Flowers	i have emailed them 0 times , over 0 days and got no response .
Flowers	appalling service .
Flowers	i now have to contact my credit_card company to get them to deal with this company .
Flowers	i won_'_t ever use them again and will tell all my friends and family not to
Flowers	haven_'_t seen the flowers but out friends were delighted , would definitely_use serenata again .
Flowers	still_waiting for the flowers to arrive . delivery driver claims left secure in the back of property , the back of property is sealed off with a 0ft fence with no access gate , so unless he threw them over the fence or dug a tunnel to crawl under the fence , then i am at a loss as to how he left them secure . the only conclusion , is they were not delivered to the requested delivery address . the day has_been spoiled by the non delivery but i will press to get refunded or a very good reason as to why not .
Flowers	mum was very happy with flowers it was free delivery and the communication was great . i will_definately_use again + will be recomending to family + friends . great service !!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	these_people have a complete disregard for customer commitment , quality and service .
Flowers	i have used this company on four occasions .
Flowers	the last two experiences have been unmitigated disasters .
Flowers	my valentines flowers were delivered four days late , yes four days late .
Flowers	after no less_than eight emails i was given a refund and 00_%_discount .
Flowers	i ordered flowers on the 0th_april for delivery on the 0th .
Flowers	no flowers showed up .
Flowers	when i enquired_about the reason through their customer no service chat line .
Flowers	bad address , fascinating as they have delivered flowers there on three previous occasions .
Flowers	i also provided a telephone_number with voice_mail .
Flowers	no call was received or message left .
Flowers	i was told by there customer service rep , " well i didn_'_t deliver the flowers , its not my fault ."
Flowers	wow really .
Flowers	you take my money out of account in a split second , but they can '_t provide a simple service and then when i enquire as to what is happening they are rude and condescending !.
Flowers	fool me once shame on me , fool me twice shame on you !
Flowers	i have emailed their so called customer support .
Flowers	very interested to see what bovine excrement the spew forth .
Flowers	i had a small issue with this order , but it was resolved quickly through an online_chat ..
Flowers	very impressive with the service and website , so much so i placed another order today ..
Flowers	friend delighted with her flowers really fresh and beautiful .
Flowers	disappointed not to receive farm bucks for facebook game though not good for
Flowers	advertising .
Flowers	i ordered flowers whilst abroad for a family relative .
Flowers	the online website was extremely easy to use .
Flowers	once the order was placed i received a confirmation_email .
Flowers	the day the order was despatched i received an_email and text_message to adivse me my order was on route with the courier .
Flowers	when the order was delieved to the recipient i again received an_email and text messge to advise .
Flowers	the recipient was over the moon with the flowers and said they were beautiful .
Flowers	thank_you for such a professional service .
Flowers	ordered 0 flower_arrangement for people on valentines weekend , all where delivered on the day i had an_email to let me know when the delivery was completed very pleased .
Flowers	wonderful service informed every_step of the way about delivery .
Flowers	the flowers are fresh and wonderful !
Flowers	i had only wished i had seen this iflowers rating site before purchasing .
Flowers	i have now noted the endless adverse comments of other totally disappointed purchasers like myself who ordered flowers and chocolates for valentines_day to be delivered at a convalescent home where my wife was staying on valentines .
Flowers	what was supposed to be a nice surprise and cheer_her up during her recovery has had turned_out to be a total disaster as she had assumed i had forgotten i had to forward her the emails to confirm that i had placed the emails on the saturday .
Flowers	needless to say like everyonelse i tried_calling them directly yesterday but just a message confirming no - one was available at around 0 . 00pm when they state they are open until 0 , 00pm .
Flowers	i completed an on line complaint form confirming i wanted an_immediate full_refund and todate have heard_nothing so will be escalating this to trading_standards on monday
Flowers	i ordered the bumper pack of bulbs for my daughter and the delivery was made on time , no hassle .
Flowers	all the bulbs were good , plump and healthy , no dried up rubbish .
Flowers	i will use dobies again for sure
Flowers	the site is a pleasure to use and the flowers were a welcome surprise to the recipient who rang to say they were beautiful and so fresh .
Flowers	all this and a great follow - up service .
Flowers	ordered flowers the day before required delivery date .
Flowers	got an_email about 00 : 00 the delivery day to say they had been left in the porch in a secure location .
Flowers	the delivery location was a office that was fully staffed that day , the building has no porch .
Flowers	no flowers got delivered and now i have to wait for a investigation into what happened , that was the most_important day of the year ruined .
Flowers	five_stars for the fantastic service and quality of flowers that were delivered as requested the following that i placed the order even_though it was the 00th of december .
Flowers	well_done !
Flowers	i will_certainly use this company again .
Flowers	flowers as_described , although next_day delivery did not happen until 0pm .
Flowers	i am living in the uk and my husband is in south_africa , he paid a fortune ( over a hundred_pounds ) for roses with diamonds in the flowers for me for valentine day , including a vase .
Flowers	when i received them it is a normal bunch of 00 roses nothing like he ordered , there was no vase either .
Flowers	the lady was kind enough to tell me there is a little heart keep sake for me , sweet not worth the extra 00 pounds .
Flowers	i looked on the site and the same flowers go for about 00 pounds .
Flowers	i orderd a flower_arrangement for my son and daughter in laws anniversary confirmed to be delivered on saturday june 00rd .
Flowers	it was not delivered i was informed through live_chat that it would be delivered on monday june 00th .
Flowers	still no delivery and despite having two numbers gvm - 000 - 00000 and dbk - 000 - 00000 .
Flowers	i still have not had any communication with the company and as there is no telephone_number to contact .
Flowers	i am toatally disgusted and as i live in the usa will not be using this company again .
Flowers	i also wonder_how i can get a refund ?
Flowers	how can you send me a letter saying it was a mistake and to phone up so you can put it right and then go on to say again it was , nt your fault !!!!!!!!
Flowers	i am so utterly disgusted in your attitudes you should be struck off !!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	flowers arrived nice and early the next_morning .
Flowers	at first glance the bouquet appeared a bit small but once the lillies come out they will be fabulous .
Flowers	i am very happy with the flowers and the service and would definitely_use them again
Flowers	if you want to find a a reliable competitively_priced place to buy a high_quality bouquet , be it for a birthday , get well or special_occasion , serenata_flowers cannot be_beaten .
Flowers	seeds delivered on time to give as christmas_presents .
Flowers	well_packaged but unable to rate germination success as seeds will not be sown until later in the year !
Flowers	found the sit easy to use and exccellent value for money
Flowers	arranging for a bouquet online was simplicity_itself .
Flowers	the choice was extensive .
Flowers	the process easy .
Flowers	simple to order on the website , plenty of choice and delivered on time .
Flowers	i thought the fowers were very reasonable , well advertised and i was notified of every_step frome ordering to actual delivery .
Flowers	the recipient was highly delighted with the flowers and said they were beautiful .
Flowers	i would use this company again for definite .
Flowers	000_% satisfied :)
Flowers	if you need to send flowers with the assurance that they will be of good quality and delivered on time then i would recommend that you use eflorist . co . uk .
Flowers	it '_s the easiest_way to do it and very good value .
Flowers	it '_s the first time i '_ve used them and i will_definitely_use them again .
Flowers	there are flowers for every_occasion and in every colour you could ever want .
Flowers	ordered flowers as a thank_you and birthday surprise .
Flowers	paid extra for quick delivery .
Flowers	no delivery ever transpired - late contact made about non delivery and i asked to deliver again .

Flowers	the second one arrived the next_day but no - one was in .
Flowers	my email complaint and request for an explanation has_been ignored .

Flowers	i '_ll try serenata one more time , but any more glitches and bad manners and i '_ll not use them again .
Flowers	visited yesterday as wanted some fresh_meat from the butcher dept .
Flowers	the staff in the butchers were friendly , funny and very helpful .

Flowers	a lamb longboat !
Flowers	cooked for 00th_birthday meal and it was the best lamb ever .
Flowers	thank_you guys !
Flowers	yum yum !
Flowers	also got some beautiful_flowers for mother in law and they were really lovely .
Flowers	we always go here every year for our xmas trees and garden plants .
Flowers	it '_s one if my favourite places .
Flowers	i wanted to thank an individual in an organization for their help .
Flowers	the flowers were presented exactly when and where i wished and could not ask for more in the service i recieved .
Flowers	( though i did have a discount card off my total_cost but gave up in trying to use this in the end as i could not find the means of using it in my order >)
Flowers	my mum '_s flowers arrived at 00ish on mother '_s day , a perfect time .
Flowers	she was moved to to tears and told me the flowers were beautiful .
Flowers	she loved the chocolates and the balloon also .
Flowers	my daughter recommended the company to me and i am so glad i used them .
Flowers	i used interflora at christmas and was disappointed with the flowers they sent to my family .
Flowers	i would recommend serenata_flowers to all my family and friends .
Flowers	a lovely product and excellent service .
Flowers	ordered flowers on the 0nd february ( yes 00 days prior ) to be delivered on valentines_day as i would be out of the country on business .
Flowers	got an_email on the 00th_february at 00 : 00 saying they can '_t deliver on that day but will deliver on the 00th !
Flowers	offered 00_%_discount .
Flowers	wow !
Flowers	big deal .
Flowers	i work abroad and there is no way on this planet that i am now going to be able arrange delivery of flowers on this day .
Flowers	to say i am peed off is an_understatement .
Flowers	and my partner ?
Flowers	well she is now without flowers on valentines_day :-(
Flowers	what an_absolute disgraceful way to conduct business .
Flowers	and he reckons he can take on more orders and make his company bigger ...
Flowers	he '_s having a laugh .
Flowers	i will avoid this shambles of a service in the future at all costs .
Flowers	ordered mothers_day flowers over a week ago for delivery on saturday march 0th ..... nothing has_been delivered !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	the only tracking_number on the website for my order is for royal_mail with may as the dispatch ????
Flowers	?
Flowers	been on hold on the phone for over an our ... no answer !
Flowers	!
Flowers	sent several emails ... the only reply was automated which is useless .
Flowers	we are now £_00 out off pocket with disappointment all_round for our 0children who chose the bouquet for nannie and also for my mother in law who must have thought we didn_'_t bother to send anything at all .... had to explain :-(
Flowers	prestige_flowers should be_ashamed !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	living in dubai means we miss many family_members birthdays , so serenata_flowers is the perfect solution for us !
Flowers	reliable and a great service !!
Flowers	i received an_email once the flowers had been dispatched and then again at the end of the day with the exact time they were delivered !
Flowers	stress_free ....
Flowers	i will_definitely_use serenata_flowers again !
Flowers	cheaper_than most of the alternative online flower delivery sites .
Flowers	the online order process was simple and quick .
Flowers	i recieved both sms and emails regarding the delivery process and the flowers were delivered on time despite using yodel
Flowers	serenata_flowers have top quality flowers at great prices and their delivery is fast and on time , thats_why i wouldnt go any where else .
Flowers	my partner , who_lives in spain , was coming out of hospital after some pretty risky surgery .
Flowers	i couldn_'_t fly over for that day , so i decided to have flowers delivered after she ' d got home .
Flowers	my mistake was to entrust such an important gesture to iflorist .
Flowers	my order was accepted , and my card debited by £_00 . 00 .
Flowers	i even received a confirmation_email .
Flowers	( this is important , as will be seen )
Flowers	well , no flowers arrived .
Flowers	not on the agreed day , not on any day .
Flowers	after 0 days i emailed iflorist .
Flowers	no reply .
Flowers	i emailed again .
Flowers	no reply .
Flowers	i called .
Flowers	no reply .
Flowers	not a single word of explanation or apology , and certainly no refund .
Flowers	more in anger and frustration than anything_else , i posted the story wherever i could .
Flowers	suddenly , a response !
Flowers	they said my form had fields missing - so how come it went through ?
Flowers	they said they had emailed me - so where is the email ?
Flowers	they had the correct address to send the confirmation .
Flowers	they said they would email me directly - they haven_'_t .
Flowers	it is now 0 months since the original order .
Flowers	running out of options for redress , i emailed the managing_director , which is supposed to bring results .
Flowers	i rather assumed he would be shocked at the conduct of his company , and would deal with it personally .
Flowers	he hasn_'_t even replied .
Flowers	so now what ?
Flowers	i ' m past caring about the money .
Flowers	now i ' m feeling cheated , ignored and insulted .
Flowers	i '_ll look into some kind of legal avenue , but that would cost me more money .
Flowers	( although if it named and shamed iflorist to a wider public , it would be well - spent .)
Flowers	my other option is to drive the hour or so from my house to their hq , in burnley , and speak face - to - face with someone - anyone .
Flowers	i ' m leaning towards the latter option , so if any other aggrieved iflorist customers feel like joining me , leave a message .
Flowers	my issue is not about the non - delivery ; these things happen .
Flowers	my issue is the conduct of iflorist subsequently .
Flowers	they have ignored me , then lied to me , then ignored me again .
Flowers	it '_s become a mission now , almost an obsession .
Flowers	i ' m not giving up .
Flowers	i have used serenataa few_times , easty to use web_site with good descriptions .
Flowers	good availablility of delivery times which they stick to .
Flowers	i love getting the texts telling_me when the flowers are on their way and when they have been delivered .
Flowers	all my friends have loved the flowers , pretty , very long_lasting and have asked me where i have got tehm from .
Flowers	try serenata , you won_'_t be disappointed !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i have always used serenata since i received the 00 white_roses arrangement from friends a few_years_ago .
Flowers	0 weeks_later they were still upright and fresh .
Flowers	this latest purchase was no different .
Flowers	on time , advised when delivered and recipient very happy .
Flowers	i will use again and will always recommend
Flowers	the orders were promptly delivered and brought lots of joy !
Flowers	the person who received the flowers told me ( by telephone ) that she was delighted with the beautiful_flowers .
Flowers	thank_you serenata !
Flowers	very easy and simple site to navigate and place an order , check out is slick and simple .
Flowers	all_round very good site to use .
Flowers	smidigt och lätt att ge blommor till någon som inte bor så nära !
Flowers	sedan vet man inte om dom är hemma heller !
Flowers	då kan man bara släppa det och låta er sköta det istället !!
Flowers	kanon :-) jättebra !
Flowers	ordered 0 . 00 am ( yes just after midnight ) ... delivered 0 . 00pm the same day ... she was delighted ... and so am i
Flowers	do not order from these_people !!
Flowers	i have sent 0 emails complaining and i have not had a reply to any of them .
Flowers	they say 000_% satisfaction guaranteed but this is definitely not the case .
Flowers	flowers cost £_00 .
Flowers	they were a tiny display and were weathered and old looking .
Flowers	upset as they were sent to a relative as she had recently lost her young son .
Flowers	this company advertise a live_chat but it is always off line !!!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	very bad_experience .
Flowers	will never use again .
Flowers	wrong bouquet delivered and flowers were dead - have contacted then several ways - forms / phone / e_- mail etc been promised a refund so many_times and have been promised replies etc - simply the worst company company - my complaint raised in there support centre and closed by them as resolved with no communication - there online_chat button is never live and when it is - no agent comes on line .
Flowers	just don_'_t use them .
Flowers	this site has a lovely selection of flowers and it '_s really nice they do seasonal arrangements too .
Flowers	i chose one of those in a pretty wicker basket as i thought they would be the freshest and prettiest .
Flowers	hope my mum likes them .. a surprise for her 00th_birthday !
Flowers	great to be able to order online in the uk and have them delivered in nz .
Flowers	have used another company before , but serenata_flowers beats them hands_down in all departments .
Flowers	cost , quality and range .
Flowers	however i do not believe they should have five_stars , as there is always room for improvement , but would give four and a half .
Flowers	i ordered flowers as a retirement gift for a friend at 0pm and hey_presto !!!!!
Flowers	she recieved them at home at 0 . 00pm as i had asked :) they were beautiful and well_worth the money :)
Flowers	found this website that offered more than just flowers to be delivered , ordered what i thought would be a special gift of flowers , mini balloon and birthday cake .
Flowers	unfortunatley the cake was not delivered , which was a great disapointment as i received 0 really good emails , 0 to say they were on the way and the other to say they had been delivered .
Flowers	=.
Flowers	(....
Flowers	i was expecting long stem roses but received all be it more than the dozen ordered roses that i could have got myself from tesco .
Flowers	they now look a sorry state with the heads bending .
Flowers	we followed_instructions but they are very disappointing .
Flowers	i ordered from you for my wife '_s birthday as at the moment cannot drive due to a recent major cancer operation .
Flowers	i will not be using you again or recommending this company .
Flowers	cheaper_than the main players , good quality flowers supplied .
Flowers	highly_recomend
Flowers	i was ordering flowers for an aunt '_s 00th_birthday for several family_members , so wanted it to be very special .
Flowers	after completing the order the computer went funny and i was unable to get confirmation of the order .
Flowers	i clicked on the appropriate tab to ask serenata to call me , which they did very shortly_afterwards .
Flowers	the gentleman i spoke to was very pleasant and confirmed all the details of the order .
Flowers	he could not have been more helpful .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered as and when requested and my delighted aunt rang up to say what a wonderful surprise and bouquet it was together with the additions we had ordered of a vase and chocolates .
Flowers	we are well pleased .
Flowers	my son ordered a lovely bouquet of flowers for mothers_day with a glass vase but the flowers that were delivered were nothing like he had ordered , a much_cheaper variety and i didn_'_t receive the vase at all .
Flowers	i have emailed these_people on numerous_occassions but they have not bothered to answer .
Flowers	i used their live_chat but he just gave me another email address , but again they didn_'_t answer that either .
Flowers	iflorist dont wast your money this company is the worst i have ever used .
Flowers	i ordered a lovely basket of yellow and cream mixture of flowers for mothers_day , as my mother was spending the weekend at my brothers house i got them delivered there .
Flowers	they never arrived until the monday which by this time she was back home .
Flowers	there was no way in getting them to her as she lives miles_away so i contacted them yesterday 00th and they agreed ed to resend them to my mothers address today 00th , the first lot were not the basket i ordered the were pink roses no basket .
Flowers	i have just found out that the second lot of flowers were delivered today as promised but they were also pink flowers not the basket of yellow ones .
Flowers	they looked like a £_00 pound '_s bunch of flowers from tesco and as if that wasn_'_t bad enough they resent them to my brothers again instead of my mothers .
Flowers	very disappointing will never use again customer service was terrible i had to fight with them to get them resent free of charge .
Flowers	what a wast af £_00
Flowers	as a new customer i found iflorist to be easy to deal with .
Flowers	simple to follow throughout the website .
Flowers	plenty of choices for each_occasion .
Flowers	great !
Flowers	i have used iflorist . co . uk on 0 occasions over the last few_months .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on the day i chose and all recipients were delighted with their flowers .
Flowers	thank_you for the excellent service .
Flowers	my son is 00 and an apprentice on a very low salary .
Flowers	he was ill all last_week so decided to order flowers and chocolates online to make the day special for his lovely little girlfriend .
Flowers	it is the first time he has had disposable income to make such a gesture and it took a lot of hard work to earn the £_00 iflorist charged him .
Flowers	i have read many reviews on here stating that flowers did not arrive , believe me , you are no luckier if they did .
Flowers	the flowers were tiny , wilted and badly packaged in a broken box .
Flowers	they resembled the one bunch that is always left on a garage forecourt because not even the drunk or mad would purchase them .
Flowers	called customer_services .
Flowers	ansaphone " this ansaphone is full - goodbye " it was never cleared as phoned at_least a dozen times .
Flowers	mailed but no response .
Flowers	then noticed the final insult was only 00 not 00 wilted pathetic roses contained in tacky wrapping and broken box .
Flowers	this seems to be a recurrent theme as read complaints on twitter snd ciao from others stating they had received only 00 flowers also .
Flowers	onto twitter goes i .
Flowers	read their timeline .
Flowers	first tweet from another customer who had the same problem .
Flowers	00 wilted mini roses .
Flowers	i ' m not sure what others are going to do but i ' m waiting until this evening to be fair to them then if my boys money is not refunded i ' m off to trading_standards .
Flowers	today im contacting martin_lewis smith and watchdog .
Flowers	twitter is alive with complaints about iflorist .
Flowers	check their timeline @ iflorist if you wish .
Flowers	i ' m off to tweet martin_lewis smith and await contact from this dreadful company .
Flowers	my advice is avoid iflorist at all costs .
Flowers	disgraceful .
Flowers	thank_you for making it all so easy !
Flowers	flowers ordered on 00nd devember for delivery on 00rd_december , money taken on the 00nd_december .
Flowers	flowers have never arrived .
Flowers	cannot contact company as emails being ignored and live_chat not working .
Flowers	what a crap company !
Flowers	!, these_idiots are ignorant and shouldnt be allowed to trade !!!!
Flowers	why say christmas delivery still available when it obviously wasnt
Flowers	l want my money back !!!!!
Flowers	this company do not care that these flowers were a xmas_present .
Flowers	will the have the decency to call me back tomorrow !!!!
Flowers	probably not !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	this was my first visit and i am very impressed with the ease of ordering and the price , plus free delivery !
Flowers	i await hearing about the flowers !
Flowers	good choice of bouquets and very reasonable_prices .
Flowers	i liked the emails to keep me informed of the progress of the flowers and when they were delivered .
Flowers	they were loved by the recipient and they really made her day .
Flowers	i sent them as a big thank_you to her .
Flowers	i have not used eflorist before and have had a bad_experience when sending plants to my mum in the past so i was a bit_nervous .
Flowers	i didn_'_t need to be , it was really easy to order ( i ordered on friday for delivery on saturday ), the flowers arrived on time and my mum in law was thrilled with them .
Flowers	i would recommend eflorist and will use them next time i want to send flowers .
Flowers	flowers absolutely nothing like my order .
Flowers	i regulary send flowers and allow for seasons .
Flowers	but realy what arrived was terrible and late .
Flowers	i was embarrased .
Flowers	i paid over 00 pounds for it .
Flowers	iflorist gave me a voucher for 0 . after many calls and emails .
Flowers	i wont be using it .
Flowers	flowers were due on saturday , received no call .
Flowers	i have emailed and tried to call - no response , got a call today from someone trying to deliver the flowers , asked her where they had been for three days and she said she didn_'_t know .
Flowers	the flowers are dying , wilted and without water , i tried to ring and as usual got no response
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be sent to my daughter who was traveling abroad .
Flowers	they never arrived and never arrived .
Flowers	when i contacted iflorist they said they were checking with the delivery agent .
Flowers	i didn_'_t hear back so i contacted them again .
Flowers	i told them i wanted my money back and they clamied to be checking on it .
Flowers	i still have not received my refund and the last email went_unanswered .
Flowers	the last i heard from them was 0 / 00 / 00 when they said they were sorting it all out and that they apologized once again .
Flowers	flowers arrived the next_day as promised . email_updates throughout the process , great service !
Flowers	nice array of options , happy recipients and happy customer - can '_t ask for much more .
Flowers	email contact with delivery updates were beautifully done and quite clever .
Flowers	thank_you serenata_flowers , you now have a loyal_customer .
Flowers	my order did not arrive for my friend '_s funreal on 00 / 00 / 00 .
Flowers	as they dont have a phone number i could not ring on the day
Flowers	i have left 0 email '_s and not once has anyone got back to me .
Flowers	i feel so let_down and cheated .
Flowers	lflorist do the decent thing and get back to me !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	our friend emailed me to say how lovely the flowers were , really please with your service will_definitely_use you again , cheers chrissy .
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my daughter for her_birthday and received email_confirmation of safe delivery .
Flowers	i then discovered , on speaking to my daughter later that day , that she had been out all day .
Flowers	she had picked_up a card which had been put through her letterbox that rather unhelpfully said the flowers had been left at her own door number !
Flowers	she called on neighbours both_sides but no luck .
Flowers	eventually she spotted a rather nice bouquet in the window of a house three down from her and thought she would call on the off - chance .
Flowers	fortunately her very honest neighbour confirmed that they were indeed meant for my daughter .
Flowers	i appreciate that it was not the fault of the florist that the flowers could not be delivered but i feel cheated that i had been told they were safely delivered when clearly they were not and if it was not possible to deliver to a next door neighbour surely it would be better to keep them and try to arrange a more appropriate delivery time ( even at extra_cost ) rather_than risk them being lost .
Flowers	disappointing .
Flowers	the flowers however were gorgeous and i would order again but give more specific delivery instructions next time .
Flowers	ordered these flowers for my daughter .
Flowers	liked the look of them on the web_page .
Flowers	they arrived early afternoon and are a very big hit .
Flowers	i asked for a description and they are exactly as the photo .
Flowers	can '_t ask for more than that .
Flowers	cheered my daughter up which was the aim .
Flowers	serenata are really good and the only florist that i use .
Flowers	i have tried others online but found them very expensive and not very reliable .
Flowers	very easy to use at a time of great sadness , took away the problem of shopping around
Flowers	more shame on you sutton , s
Flowers	i have had a delivery of what sutton , s call plants i call them dead rubish , they just dont take any notice of people they think giving you £ 0 . 00 back is the answer just send good quality plants out in the first place the money i have spent with you and still get rubbish plants that come dead plus i have not recivied my potatoes even_though you phoned me and said they will be with me within 00 days its all a load of lies the plunge pots came dead the aubrieta x0 came dead then a letter came saying they was a bad crop what rubbish you should not have advertised them if you knew that .
Flowers	if i dont get all my remaining orders by the 00th of july i will take it further ......... plus i will never use sutton , s seeds again .
Flowers	people just dont care today plants are to much money to buy without getting dead ones sent and not getting some orders .
Flowers	byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Flowers	delivery was on time despite the last - minute order .
Flowers	i haven_'_t actually seen the flowers , but if they ' re anything like the picture on the website , they ' re good value .
Flowers	got phone_call from my daughter in - law thanking_me for the lovely flowers delivered on the occasion of there 00th_wedding_anniversary .
Flowers	the flowers were beautiful .
Flowers	absolutely perfect service amazing contact from the company the emails were personal and fun . kept_informed all the way my mother is not keen on flowers but the bouquet she received she loved thankyou guys and girls will buy flowers only from you know well_done your a credit to the industry keep_up the good work .
Flowers	ordered valentines flowers for a friend .
Flowers	recieved an_email at 00 :_00pm at night on the 00th_feb saying that they cannot deliver the flowers due to adverse_weather_conditions in nottingham .
Flowers	they would be sending them out to arrive on the 00th .
Flowers	i tried to cancel the order and could not get through .
Flowers	they decided to change my order and include a " i love you " balloon .
Flowers	my friend has a phobia of balloons , and so was desperate to stop this order before causing distress and not to mention the insult of me sending them a balloon , knowing about their condition .
Flowers	and then to send a day late .
Flowers	i managed to get through to someone on the phone on the morning of 00th , the gift at this stage had not even been prepared , so stopping should not have been a problem .
Flowers	how wrong was i !!!!!
Flowers	the lady on the phone said that there is nothing she could do , and i explained the situation .
Flowers	her reply was " well it '_s only a small balloon " how narrow minded response was that .
Flowers	i asked to be passed to a manager to assist with this and was assured that they will look into it and will get back to me .
Flowers	that never happened .
Flowers	from this point on it only got worse .
Flowers	0st the phone number then disappeared from the website , ( lucky for me had written it down ), then every time i tried to call a women was answering the phone pretending to be a recorded_message .
Flowers	kind of made me laugh as each time i called she messed_up the words .
Flowers	i gave up on this number and search the forums and found a direct number .
Flowers	called this and got through to someone who said that they were still dealing_with my request to stop this order going out and that they would confirm to be shortly .
Flowers	that never happened .
Flowers	then guess_what that number then became engaged and could not get through .
Flowers	next up logged tickets , numerous_emails , even copying in [_name_removed_] md & [_name_removed_] the fd .
Flowers	nothing !!!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	please do not waste your time with this company .
Flowers	it is now the 00th and they are still not responding to me .
Flowers	don_'_t even bother raising a ticket it gets ignored .
Flowers	the insulting balloon freaked out my friend and the roses were nearly dead when they arrived .
Flowers	they also sent the wrong chocolates , should have been belgian .
Flowers	and they also arrived a day late .
Flowers	i am still trying to contact and will not give up .
Flowers	i want a written apology and a full_refund .
Flowers	to which they have not responded to .
Flowers	no surprise there .
Flowers	sent 0 bouquets within days of each other .
Flowers	both recipients were totally delighted .
Flowers	good choice of flowers to meet everyone '_s budget .
Flowers	have used this site many_times and will_continue to do so .
Flowers	thanks
Flowers	mum loved the flowers , delivered on time and excellent communication kept me informed of progress of order .
Flowers	fantastic service , keep you informed about where your delivery is and let you know when it '_s delivered .
Flowers	quick , easy and straightforward ordering , can personalize as much as you like .
Flowers	my auntie was delighted with the flowers .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	i bought flowers from serenta flowerson line had them sent to my sister she sent me a photograph of them we are very pleased with them
Flowers	once again , my sister - in - law was delighted to receive such a beautiful arrangement of fresh , fragrant flowers .
Flowers	plus my brother - in - law much_appreciated the bottle of wine .
Flowers	such a speedy delivery & the courier was most courteous when presenting the flowers , it made it all the more special .
Flowers	once again thank_you for providing a wonderful colourful arrangement , which is also much_appreciated and truly affordable .
Flowers	this was the first time i have used this company .
Flowers	i thought the bouquets were reasonably_priced and had a lovely selection of flowers .
Flowers	i liked the fact that you got a free card , and with some of the bouquets a free box of chocs .
Flowers	there was also free delivery .
Flowers	i would definitely_use this company again .
Flowers	would recommend serenata_flowers .
Flowers	com .
Flowers	their products are always first_class and they keep you informed of the progress of your order .
Flowers	they keep you informed , the flowers arrive on time , they are fresh and nicely_presented and i no_longer use any other on - line flower delivery company
Flowers	excellent service
Flowers	although this will require some effort ( in relative terms , as we are all so used to email ) why don_'_t we all send letters - at the very least they will have to open these , and this will hopefully cost them time .
Flowers	it might actually be quite annoying for them having to physically sort through their post ... then , we have to think about some concerted legal_action .
Flowers	i had ordered a bouquet of flowers to be delivered today ( st valentine '_s day ) to my partner in france - i know that there was someone at the delivery address all day , plus they had my partner '_s mobile number .
Flowers	i have often sent flowers and this is the first time that i have come_across a company that has failed to deliver .
Flowers	moreover , i tried to contact iflorist during the day today , but to avail .
Flowers	they have taken my money and not fulfilled the contract .
Flowers	they appear to be an awful company to be avoided at all costs .
Flowers	i ordered christmas flowers for my wife which did arrive on time , but , 0 ) they were the wrong type of bouquet
Flowers	0 ) i ordered a £ 0 . 00 vase with it and that wasnt included in the delivery .
Flowers	the flowers that did arrive were not the best quality and looks as if they will only last a few_days .
Flowers	i emailed the " support " team 00_hours ago and still have had no response .
Flowers	i now have a fight on my hands to get the money refunded for the vase and i will be insisting on a full_refund for the flowers which was not what i had ordered .
Flowers	would i use them again ??
Flowers	no chance .
Flowers	we had a skype call from my nephew and new niece late on sunday last to tell us that they were having a baby , their first .
Flowers	wanting to mark the joyful news , we went on the eflorist site and found plenty of choice .
Flowers	we ordered and they were delivered to a bit of a remote spot on anglesey the next_day .
Flowers	my niece was delighted .
Flowers	with the arrangement .
Flowers	sent another selection to my nephew '_s mother , my sister , who_lives nearby , timed to arrive on tuesday_morning , which they did , she too was delighted .
Flowers	i have seen pictures of both arrangements and they are beautiful , just as displayed on the site .
Flowers	economic , fast and accurate delivery , thank_you eflorist
Flowers	two lots of flowers were to be delivered to a remote part of anglesey , where lots of deliveries go astray .
Flowers	both lots were delivered on time to the correct places and my sister and my future niece were delighted with the arrays .
Flowers	lots of brownie_points for me !
Flowers	always reliable .
Flowers	flowers and gifts delivered on time and of a high_quality .
Flowers	we ordered easter flowers for the mum in england .
Flowers	received an_email that they were enroute and then when they arrived .
Flowers	imagine our suprise when speaking with her that they never did arrive .
Flowers	won_'_t be using these_guys again .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my best friends 00th_birthday on the 0st december .
Flowers	the flowers arrived on the 0th_december in a very very sorry state , just fit for the dust - bin .
Flowers	i am a pensioner with not a lot of money to spare , and grudge paying good money for a bunch of dead flowers .
Flowers	i would be very grateful for a full_refund into my account as soon as possible , as i have spoken to my local trading_standards office .
Flowers	the advised me to email you once again , and if i got no satisfaction , they would take it from there .
Flowers	the service and flowers were great .
Flowers	they communicated with me each_step of the way and i would highly_recomend this service and would use them again .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my daughter late_afternoon tuesday 00th , they arrived as expected on the 00th .
Flowers	beautiful display as discribed , just lovely .
Flowers	thankyou very much and highly_recommend this company .
Flowers	nicky ireland
Flowers	friend absolutely_delighted with flowers and chocolates .
Flowers	ordered a boquet specifically because it contained chrysanths and roses , but it contained mostly lilies , which are disliked by the recipient , who of course was politely grateful .
Flowers	delivery was great and on time by a good guy .
Flowers	i '_ve used a number of online florists in the past and have had issues with all of them , since i started using eflorist i have never looked back , excellent choice of products fair pricing and outstanding service .
Flowers	i will use them again .
Flowers	i wanted to send some ' thinking of you ' flowers as my best friend had recently lost her dad .
Flowers	ordered the flowers complete with a vase and filled in our message to her and her family .
Flowers	just had a telephone_call from her to say ' thank_you so much ' for the gorgeous flowers , they came in excellent condition complete with foil and a ribbon , she just burst into tears when she took delivery of her flowers .
Flowers	she absolutley loves them !
Flowers	excellent service and comes highly_recommended .
Flowers	have ordered from this company before and have had no reason to complain but this year bought some pepper seeds and only 0 germinated .
Flowers	asked for a refund and received a very patronising email and said my account would be credited .
Flowers	but if i wish to use the credit i would have to pay more postage_costs - totally unfair .
Flowers	emailed again and asked for a refund , they are sending me a cheque for £ 0 . 00 !
Flowers	won_'_t use them again and expect that the cost of raising and posting my cheque will add up to more that the actual packet of seeds .
Flowers	a " sorry " and " can we replace the seeds with another variety " would have satisfied me and kept me as a customer .
Flowers	tight wads !
Flowers	i sent my daughter flowers , from " iflowers . com . uk .
Flowers	what was sent was totally dismal , nothing like the " gorgeous " bouquet i had chosen from their website .
Flowers	my email of complaint was ignored , now i find how many other customers , have also been ripped_off .
Flowers	how does this company continue to trade ????
Flowers	?
Flowers	how do we stop this company , who do we complain to that can take action ??
Flowers	?
Flowers	i had a full_refund for my flowers and a lovely letter of apology .
Flowers	thank_you flora queen for you prompt action
Flowers	best regards
Flowers	serenata kept in touch all the way to delivery .
Flowers	my nephew was really pleased and they arrived on time .
Flowers	everything turned_out so well
Flowers	thank_you for a brilliant and fun service .
Flowers	it was a very user - friendly website , with on - time delivery .
Flowers	the delivered flowers were beautiful and as shown on the screen .
Flowers	i am absolutely_delighted with the produts and service from this company .
Flowers	they managed to deliver plants and flowers to friends and family in december when other_companies , like m & s , would not even accept an order .
Flowers	i would cetainly use them again .
Flowers	i needed to send some flowers urgently to a family_member who has had a bad time lately following a bereavement and just wanted her to know that i was thinking of her .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered within two hours of my ordering and i cannot thank iflorist enough for their very fast turnaround .
Flowers	i can thoroughly_recommend .
Flowers	fantastic , will_definitely_use again
Flowers	i thought i ' d cooked my goose with being_able to send my mum flowers , as i ' d left it till friday before mother '_s day to order , but i was very pleased to find i florist still taking orders for delivery on mother '_s day !!
Flowers	and delivery was free as well !
Flowers	ordering_process was very quick and simple , the pics of the bouquets are stunning as well , hope my mums bouquet is as beautiful !!!
Flowers	thank_you for saving my life !
Flowers	xxxxx
Flowers	good web_site ordering quick and easy , slightly expensive but you get what it says on the tin every time !
Flowers	i am very please with my purchse will order again soon
Flowers	just amazing , and just the job .
Flowers	my wife was over the moon , and such a good price .
Flowers	i have paid much more for flowers in the past , and they have arrived a lot less loved and only survived a few_days .
Flowers	but the care and attention these orchids had was amazing .
Flowers	well_done serenata .
Flowers	will surely use you again .
Flowers	a ++++
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my mother in spain , when ordering , the date of delivery for 0th_may ( same day ) was available so i selected this date .
Flowers	after taking payment and confirming order i was notified by e_- mail that delivery would be 0th_may , so i thought alright maybe i was a bit optimistic .
Flowers	the next e_- mail said they didn_'_t have the bouquet i wanted and would send 00 roses instead .
Flowers	on the 00th of may 0 . 00 p . m . they e_- mailed to say that the address was wrong and could i advise , i e_- mailed them back to say address was exactly as i had said .
Flowers	then i got absolutely no response whatsoever to my e_- mails .
Flowers	until the sunday somebody actually e_- mailed so say that they would try and find out what had happened but not until the next_day .
Flowers	eventually the flowers were delivered on tuesday 00th_may but when my mother took the cellophane off all the petals fell of the flowers .
Flowers	having repeatedly complained about the situation and with no answers to my e_- mails , i threatened to review them on various websites at this they said they would give me a £ 0 voucher which i declined .
Flowers	so eventually they escalated my complaint and got back to me a week_later with a £_00 voucher .
Flowers	i don_'_t know whether they think i am stupid or what but why would i want a voucher when i have no_intention of using this dreadful website ever again .
Flowers	there customer service is the worst i have ever known and would definitely be telling everybody i know not to use them in the future .
Flowers	the flowers i sent were for my mothers birthday and to cut a long_story short my mother thought the flowers were so lovely they actually made her cry with delight .
Flowers	i '_ve used serenata several_times .
Flowers	it was a gamble the 0st time but everyone - truly - has raved about the way the flowers were packed and how beautiful they are .
Flowers	believe you me , some of the people i have sent to would be more than honest if the flowers were anything less .
Flowers	the service is extremely reliable and quick and pleases me because i ' m ordering from several thousand miles_away .
Flowers	iflorist is the best site for ordering flowers that i have come_across .
Flowers	ordering is very simple and there are no_hidden_charges .
Flowers	the flowers are superb quality and value and free delivery for mother '_s day is excellent .
Flowers	i certainly won_'_t use another site .
Flowers	ordered a deluxe bouquet for my aunt '_s birthday .
Flowers	flowers were delivered . on time and in perfect_condition ; she was delighted with them .
Flowers	i was kept_informed at all times as to the delivery status .
Flowers	will buy from serenata again .
Flowers	ordered floral table centres for my daughters_wedding .
Flowers	i intended making them myself but after pricing up all the different components i realised it was far cheaper and far less_stressful to order them ready made .
Flowers	my daughter is delighted with them , they ' re going to look perfect and at such a great price too !
Flowers	ordered mothers_day flowers that did not arrive .
Flowers	0 upset children who had helped to pick the arrangement from the website .
Flowers	waited in all day for a delivery that never happened .
Flowers	tried to contact customer_services by e_- mail twice with not even an acknowledgement to say they had received the e_- mail and would get back to me .
Flowers	very disapointed and will not be recommending this to friends .
Flowers	i ordered flowers from serenata , as i had done so before with great results .
Flowers	i was kept in touch by text from despatch to delivery .
Flowers	my friend was overjoyed to receive the beautiful_bouquet .
Flowers	a big thank_you to serenata_flowers , i '_ll be back for more very soon !
Flowers	got some flowers off them for valentines , they were top_notch .
Flowers	my girlfriend loved them and they are still going strong .
Flowers	thanks very much .
Flowers	very pleased with this order delivery was great .
Flowers	i ordered sunday_afternoon and my friend had her flowers monday_morning
Flowers	daughter ordered flowers for birthday spa celebration at a hotel some 00 miles from home ....
Flowers	it snowed .... we all managed to get to the hotel no problem .... serenata_flowers did not deliver the flowers because it snowed .
Flowers	apparently it states in their small_print that rain , snow etc could mean no delivery and no refund !!!!
Flowers	how that is legal i can '_t imagine .
Flowers	not only did i have a very upset daughter who had ordered a " special gift " of flowers for her sister but my other daughter thought her sister had not bought her a gift !
Flowers	and then to add_insult to injury and not only not deliver but refuse to give a refund ........ avoid at all costs !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i have emailed eflorist and so has my son i have also sent pictures . don_'_t order from these_people go to a trusted florist and choose the items yourself .
Flowers	they use the cheapest items .
Flowers	my aunty was delighted with her flowers thank_you they were really beautiful .
Flowers	they where easy to order and so reasonably_priced too .
Flowers	arrived on time .
Flowers	excellent service quick delivery beautiful_flowers thankyou ...... highly_recommend
Flowers	this is the first time i '_ve used serenata and i ' m very pleased .
Flowers	there was a good choice of flowers and gifts .
Flowers	it was easy to do all the way through .
Flowers	delivery was very fast and it turned_up as shown on the website .
Flowers	the person who received it was very impressed and thought it was beautiful .
Flowers	i '_ll be using them again .
Flowers	i would use serenata_flowers again as the communication was superb and my friend was very happy with her flowers .
Flowers	i was recommended to serenata_flowers by my daughter and i would not_hesitate to recommend them myself .
Flowers	process all very easy from browsing the website , ordering and paying .
Flowers	delivery and packaging first_class
Flowers	ordered flowers for anniversary for wife , great website clear and easy to use .
Flowers	flowers delivered on time and i was kept_fully_informed of their journey , flowers were beautiful and exactly like pictures in fact the pictures didn_'_t do them justice , very pleased with the whole_experience and would definitely recommend
Flowers	flowers arrived on the correct day as promised , however , i was really disappointed to find that the deluxe moonlight bouquet was little better_than you see on a garage forecourt but at three or four times the price .
Flowers	i will not use this service again and cannot recommend them
Flowers	i was absolutely_delighted with serenata_flowers , gave me an uptodate view of what was going on , new where my sisters delivery was up to too the time it was delivered .
Flowers	would use again and recommend to my friends .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my mother on thursday only to realise seconds after clicking the confirm button that there was a ( slightly more_expensive ) bouquet of flowers that she would have preferred .
Flowers	however , there '_s no ability to change any order on the website so you have to send a ' ticket ' to customer_services which i did , only to get a response 00_hours_later saying it was too late by then to cancel , surprise_surprise .
Flowers	notwithstanding this i was optimistic the flowers would still be ok , only to ring my mother today who told me , very embarrassed , that they were all dead on arrival and no good to anyone .
Flowers	never use this company , pay a few_quid more and use interflora instead , wish i ' d seen this website first
Flowers	i ordered from this company as what seemed to be a good option for flower delivery to europe .
Flowers	after having a slight change in plans , it became all to clear that this company is solely out to take your money without_any regard to customer service or ethical business practices .
Flowers	there are many options for flower delivery and , unless you ' re interested in watching your money disappear without_any flowers delivered , i recommend that you steer far away from floraqueen !
Flowers	this was the first time i have used eflorist but will_definitely_use again .
Flowers	choices were great , prices very competitive and able to do next_day delivery even when i booked late the night before .
Flowers	flowers were delivered lunchtime next_day and were beautiful ,
Flowers	highly_recommended .
Flowers	flowers were delivered on time and to the quality paid for .
Flowers	would use them again .
Flowers	thank_you for an excellent service .
Flowers	great flowers ( as i expected ), grest delivery , on time ( as i expected ), but what exceeded my expectations was the way i was kept_informed , by text and helpful emails , so i knew_exactly_what was happening throughout the process .
Flowers	loved it !
Flowers	have just spent the last hour and a half trying to order flowers from a well - known company only to be kicked out of their website time and again .
Flowers	so i gave up and moved on to iflorist .
Flowers	well !
Flowers	what a change , and delightfully pleasant contrast .
Flowers	the choice was fantastic , everything worked and five_minutes later i was relieved to have completed my pyurchase , complete with free card .
Flowers	what more can a girl ask for .
Flowers	as it happens i ot more - free delivery so i went back and ordered a bigger bunch of flowers !
Flowers	so hopefully everyone '_s a winner .
Flowers	many_thanks for putting some sunshine back into my evening
Flowers	i had ordered flowers for my mum before by looking up a local company near blackpool and found serenata_flowers .
Flowers	they seemed reasonable and so i used them .
Flowers	then a lady at work was leaving and she had flowers from colleagues which looked lovely , i found out that they were from a company in fulbourn so i looked them up and found serenata_flowers .
Flowers	i didn_'_t realise that it is a national company .
Flowers	now i know , i will use them again .
Flowers	i was very pleased with the service i received .
Flowers	be prepared to lose all your money if anything_goes_wrong with your order .
Flowers	customer_services igonore you & so does the managing_director , mr david price .
Flowers	i have been requesting reimbuirsement for the appalling bouquet sent to my mother in belgium since the 00th_december_0000 .
Flowers	the 000_% satisfaction guarantee is non - existent !!!!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	after a failure to secure my money , i emailed the managing_director on the 00th_jan_0000 , & although i have an_automated_response , i have heard absolutely nothing from him .
Flowers	all my requests & questions have been ignored .
Flowers	this is a very bad company
Flowers	report them to the office of fair_trading

Flowers	i ordered my flowers to be delivered to a hospital ward just before_xmas .
Flowers	they were never received .
Flowers	i sent an_email boxing_day and had no reply , and went on live_chat to get help but no - one on line .
Flowers	i had to send another email or 0 and at last on 00 jan got an_email with a phone no so i could talk to someone .
Flowers	i was told they never deliver to a ward , and frankly they were very busy over xmas and the flowers were left at the reception and some hospitals don_'_t even take flowers .
Flowers	i pointed_out this should be made clear on their website .
Flowers	they would give me no refund , and said i should send in a complaint which would go to the lady i was speaking to on the phone as she was head of customer_services , so what is the point of that ?.
Flowers	i said how i had been trying to contact them for over 0 weeks and she said she was working her way through the emails , which was rubbish as i never got a reply from my 0st email .
Flowers	i would never use this company again , £_00 wasted , and i was very embarrassed not to have sent my sick mother any flowers in hospital .
Flowers	they need to vastly improve their after_sales service .
Flowers	the flowers were wonderfull my friend was delighted
Flowers	i ordered flowers to arrive in england when i was visiting my parents for my stepmother '_s birthday .
Flowers	i ordered them for the day before her_birthday as we were going to france on her_birthday for lunch .
Flowers	well they arrived the day of her_birthday and had to be taken in by a neighbour .
Flowers	quality was reasonable considering the extreme snow etc .
Flowers	i . e .
Flowers	the roses showed some deterioration , browning on petals .
Flowers	i found this fantastic bouquet delivery service on line . i browsed and found the ideal flowers that i wanted to send .. and placed my order and paid .
Flowers	they were delivered next_day to my friend for her_birthday .. she reported that they were very beautiful .
Flowers	i am so happy to have made her day so extra special as i couldn_'_t be there to visit her as i was away .
Flowers	i had regular_updates from serenata as to my order and throughout the delivery process .
Flowers	i will_definately be recommending serenata_flowers to my friends and work_colleagues .. and most certainly i shall be using this wonderful service again .
Flowers	thank_you serenata
Flowers	the bouquet which arrived was largely foliage , no roses at all , a few lilies and freesia .
Flowers	this looked absolutely nothing like advertised or paid for .
Flowers	in fact it was quite hideous and i am embarrassed to have sent it .
Flowers	the charming reply to my complaint was to list all the caveats and exceptions in their ts_&_cs and to tell me a lovely job they had done !
Flowers	a shocking rip_off and appalling customer service . what a shame i cannot post a photo .
Flowers	avoid .
Flowers	everything this company does is substandard : wrong delivery day , flowers damaged , vase broken , bouquet not as_described .
Flowers	they agreed to re deliver on the right day , couldn_'_t get that right , flowers even worse and again damaged , looked like £ 0 . 00 for the local_garage .
Flowers	raised a complaint in their customer service " ticket " center - no response , three tries later , i used the chat line - no use what so ever , she emailed me confirming the delivery date !
Flowers	no attempt to address any of the issues raised , but marked the ticket " pending closed ".
Flowers	stay_away - rubbish at flower arranging , delivery and customer support .
Flowers	ordered a floral tribute online for my sister '_s funeral in london .
Flowers	after the ceremony found the wreath had not arrived at the undertakers .
Flowers	company took £_000 from me and caused great distress .
Flowers	emma from iflorist sent me an apologetic email and the offer of some flowers ( see response below ).
Flowers	tried to speak to her several_times but the company telephone line was never answered .
Flowers	i do not want a bouquet .
Flowers	a random bouquet is not appropriate at this time .
Flowers	however , may i suggest iflorist send a donation to the breast_cancer care charity instead .
Flowers	if the company do so , please copy me into the letter accompanying the donation .
Flowers	this would be a fitting response .
Flowers	i ordered the roses & lillies bouquet for mothers_day to be delivered on that day . not only were they delivered 0 days early but the alleged " bouquet " comprised of just 0 roses ( both of which died yesterday ) & 0 lillies & some greenery .
Flowers	my mother was understandably disappointed so i tried to complain to iflorist to no_avail ... the online_chat is always offline . they won_'_t answer the phone & certainly didn_'_t reply to my many emails . in the end i wrote to [_name ] as he had put his good name to this outfit . i have had a reply asking for my order no ; so i shall await with interest !
Flowers	in short my advice would be to leave this lot well alone !
Flowers	would highly_recommend serenata_flowers to anyone who is looking for that special gift for any occasion they keep in touch with you when you have ordered right up to the delivery ... very easy to place an order everything is just at your fingertips ... i was more than happy with my beautiful_flowers and chocolates ...
Flowers	thank_you serenata !. xxxxxx
Flowers	really good service .
Flowers	i ordered during the evening of a bank_holiday monday for delivery on the tuesday .
Flowers	free delivery , very good choice of flowers , prices very resonable .

Flowers	would recommend and would use again .
Flowers	good flowers delivered on time .

Flowers	i would use and recommend this service again
Flowers	i sent my friend a bouquet of roses and stocks , it was the deluxe bunch .
Flowers	i didn_'_t see them myself but my friend was really pleased with them and said they were really lovely , which was all i intended .
Flowers	they were very efficient in delivering them the next_day too , which was brilliant .
Flowers	these flowers did not look as nice as they did in the picture .
Flowers	i expected a lot more for saying bought the grandisimo bunch . but service and communications are second to none .
Flowers	a gift for a friend moving into their new home , the flowers arrived the day after ordering them .
Flowers	excellent as i did not order them until late friday_evening i did not actually expect that good a service .
Flowers	the flowers were beautiful and my friends were impressed .
Flowers	well_done will_certainly use your service again
Flowers	the recipient of the flowers was very pleased with them they are beautiful . the delivery was quick next_day for no extra_charge all in all a marvellous service will defiantly_use this company again well_done x
Flowers	as a follow_up to my review on 00rd july regarding flowers not delivered on the date requested and subsequent response from the company that someone from their escaltions department would get back to me .
Flowers	just as well i didn_'_t hold my breath , now 0 weeks on and still no response .
Flowers	their customer service department is without_doubt in need of a serious overhaul !
Flowers	a dear friend taken into hospital , checked online for flowers .
Flowers	decided on serenata easy to navigate website .
Flowers	i was kept_informed on delivery every_step of the way .
Flowers	my friend was delighted with her flowers .
Flowers	free delivery and affordable prices so i would recommend serenata and would use again .
Flowers	i ordered on line a pretty bunch of twilight flowers and a vase for a funeral , that were delivered to their destination on time and they were a very good price ., i would recommend serenata_flowers to anyone , great value and communication .
Flowers	regards
Flowers	josephine herrmann .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on the day requested and were beautiful .
Flowers	i would recommend serenata .
Flowers	i would highly_reccomend serenata not only was it easy it was swift and the flowers were i believe beautiful bang on the button texts when completed despatched and delivered much more swift than any of your competitors !!!
Flowers	amazing

Flowers	i '_ll use them again and again !
Flowers	geoff
Flowers	i have used this company quite a few_times but after this last experience will never use again .
Flowers	the delivery was for last saturday .
Flowers	we got an_email_saying they had failed to deliver .
Flowers	there was no card left to say an attempt had been made , and despite them asking where they could leave flowers and asking for recipients mobile number they made no contact .
Flowers	they promise to give a refund and it is now wednesday and they keep fobbing me off saying they are investigating .
Flowers	they actually delivered the flowers on monday despite_being told not to as it was too late .
Flowers	i used eflorist and the flowers were delivered within a few hours on monday .
Flowers	don_'_t trust this company as their promises are like pie crust .
Flowers	really terribly disappointed , so is recipient as it spoiled the surprise and still not refunded me .
Flowers	lovely flowers gorgeous colour very different
Flowers	delivered on time and i was very happy with the whole_transaction
Flowers	i was really impressed by the level of service offered by this sight .
Flowers	they were the only ones to offer next_day delivery & thr prices were very good .
Flowers	they kept me informed every_step of the way & apparently the flowers were really lovely .
Flowers	will_certainly use this site again
Flowers	great experience , very easy to order and affordable prices
Flowers	i have used serenata_flowers on a couple of occasions now .
Flowers	i have complete_confidence in the company to offer value , quality and service .
Flowers	really good value , great choice and fabulous value for money .
Flowers	easy site to use and flexible posting options .
Flowers	well_worth a look .
Flowers	hi i ordered some flowers for my brothers wedding anniversay , i chose the spring chicken bouquet and it was simply beautiful , my brother and his wife were really thrilled .
Flowers	many_thanks
Flowers	lesley
Flowers	it took just 0 minutes to put a sile on a friends face and give them a happy mothers_day
Flowers	i ordered two bags of compost believing them to be larger than they were .
Flowers	when they arrived i contacted customer_services and they sent me an extra bag for free as compensation for the misunderstanding .
Flowers	would definitely recommend this company as not only did they deliver the original order in super_fast time but also the extra free bag arrived in double quick time too .
Flowers	no_problems and will_certainly use them again ..
Flowers	i ordered the flowers for my friends birthday and i received a text to say they ' d received my order , then a text to say the flowers were out for delivery and yet another letting me know that the flowers had been successfully delivered .
Flowers	my friend said the flowers were beautiful .
Flowers	i would definitely_use serenata again .
Flowers	i ordered 0 of the same bouquet to be sent as ' thank_you ' gifts to a number of people at different addresses , all on behalf of a charity .
Flowers	it was a little annoying to need to re - set the bouquet size to ' standard ' every time to order the right value ( as it defaults to the more_expensive ' medium ') and there was a technical issue with the message on the final one which for some reason wouldn_'_t ' attach ' to the correct order , but which online customer_services sorted ( took approx 00_mins ).
Flowers	i would normally expect some positive_feedback from the recipients but i have only heard from one whose flowers were very poor quality , with some stems broken and blooms " nearly dead " - very disappointing and a poor reflection on the charity '_s intentions .
Flowers	i sincerely_hope that the lack of feedback from the other 0 is not down to awkwardness on their part if they have received similarly poor quality flowers .
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet of flowers for an important business client in thanks for her help and assistance in an important matter .
Flowers	the order was placed on monday , april 00rd , 0000 , in ample time , you would imagine , for delivery on thursday , april 00th .
Flowers	having had no delivery confirmation on thursday 00th , i contacted iflorist on - line support on the morning of friday 00th to confirm delivery .
Flowers	they informed me that there had been a delay and that the bouquet would be delivered that day , the 00th .
Flowers	by 0 . 00 pm .
Flowers	on friday , i still had no confirmation of delivery and recontacted iflorist on - line support .
Flowers	they confirmed that the item would be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
Flowers	i informed them that this was unacceptable and that as the address was a business premises delivery after 0 . 00pm was a waste of time as my client , would have probably not been available .
Flowers	they again apologised and promised " to do their best ".
Flowers	at 0 . 00pm , still without delivery confirmation , i recontacted iflorist by e_- mail , to inform them to refund my order charges as the bouquet had not been delivered as requested .
Flowers	at 0 . 00pm i received a delivery confirmation notification that the item had been delivered at 0 . 00 pm .
Flowers	by the courier .
Flowers	how convenient !
Flowers	i queried the fact with iflorist by e_- mail , to be told " the status of the order can only be changed by the courier so if the courier first made the deliveries and then marked them as delivered this is why the time difference , i apologize for any_issues encountered ", basically blaming the courier .
Flowers	i since have pointed_out to iflorist that if they cannot trust the courier appointed by them , they should not be using them .
Flowers	the only proof of delivery is that by the courier .
Flowers	how else can the customer be sure the item he ordered was delivered , even if it was over 00_hours late ?
Flowers	i checked the yodel courier tracking_information for this order and was horrified to find that the " package " had been in transit for three days .
Flowers	i shudder to think of the state of the bouquet and the obvious mutual embarrassment between myself and my client .
Flowers	that remains to be seen .
Package_Service	the courier service was also very good , the parcel was picked_up as specified and no doubt delivered too .
Package_Service	i would recommend this service to anyone and would definately_use parcel0go everytime i need to have a parcel delivered .
Package_Service	brilliant all_round .
Package_Service	it has_been a pleasure to deal with you ...... thank_you !
Package_Service	we have used interparcel for years and cannot_fault the service or value for money !

Package_Service	sam was very helpful and he was very good and very good mick bigley
Package_Service	i was finding difficulties in registering my parcel to be delivered , and i saw the ' live_chat ' box appear .

Package_Service	i will_certainly be using parcel0go again and if i need to chat , i hope it will be to sarah ' h ' !
Package_Service	i needed to send a parcel from bristol to glasgow and checked out royal_mail who wanted more than £_00 to do the job - my parcel weighed 0 . 0 kilos .
Package_Service	parcel0go did the job for less_than £ 0 !
Package_Service	my parcel was sent on friday and was delivered in glasgow in perfect_condition at 0am on monday .
Package_Service	cannot_fault this service and would not_hesitate to use it again .
Package_Service	i had an inquiry through the company '_s live help system today .
Package_Service	catherine very quickly asked my questions and helped getting me a quote quote .
Package_Service	she also offered to process my order and clearly explain how long it would take to do it .
Package_Service	the live help customer service was fast and excellent !
Package_Service	you ' re much_better off using interparcel
Package_Service	have used these a few_times now and am still using them , really great and reliable service and , as i say , save_yourself some money at the same time
Package_Service	just made a mistake with an address and sammie_taylor at parcel0go sorted it in seconds what a star and brilliant service great team
Package_Service	was asked to review this company by peter_chandler , this is no chore as the service i received was easy from start to finish , the price was a lot_cheaper that royal_mail and there was no lugging the box up to the post_office or queuing , the driver was really friendly and the tracking was excellent , will be using again in the next few_weeks .
Package_Service	xtx
Package_Service	emma was just the kindest and friendliest person i could speak with and she dealt_with my problem very quickly and in an excellent manner .
Package_Service	thank_you so much for this and i wish everyone used this service , it is fantastic .
Package_Service	used them on 0 occasions now for sending_parcels across europe & everything has_been delivered in good time & tracking available so you can see where your parcel is at all times .
Package_Service	why pay more when so far they '_ve been excellent !
Package_Service	i spoke to two different today , the fist time i spoke to a young_lady about a parcel that was not picked_up , i was a bit frustrated about it but she was very calm and sweet , she helped all the way and sorted my problem out .
Package_Service	second phone_call was about cheaper ways of sending small parcels , and the guy that was helping me , ashley , was extremelly helpful and polite ..
Package_Service	a huge thank_you !!
Package_Service	:-)
Package_Service	i needed to send a parcel to the united_states but was not sure what to do . i contacted parcel0go online i was helped out by one of the parcel0go online helpers called daniel fantastic helped_me through the complete transaction thank_you very much will use this company again
Package_Service	fantastic service well_done rose from bolton
Package_Service	thank_you all so much for your quick solution to my problem of when my parsel was to be collected emily was realy good but my hat gos off to tanya who sprang to my rescue ( many_thanks tanya ) all sorted .
Package_Service	go to the top of the class ... nice one thanks again ... mr m galloway
Package_Service	it '_s both easy and convenient to book but if by some chance you are let_down by the courier company , interparcel customer_services do everything you could wish for to put things right
Package_Service	completed a mutli parcel single destination on my behalf , all i had to do was tick the terms & conds box and pay .
Package_Service	easy .
Package_Service	all the parcels arrived next_day .
Package_Service	what a great friendly service .
Package_Service	had a great chat with izabella on the phones , these_people have their fingers on the pulse .
Package_Service	i will use this service again without_any doubt .
Package_Service	collected when promised delivered in record time .
Package_Service	astounding .
Package_Service	this site was so easy to use , i can '_t recommend it enough !
Package_Service	just put in your parcel details ( weight and size ) and you '_ll be able to see instantly all the available couriers , services and prices - you don_'_t even need to put in the collection / delivery postcodes initially , so they make it possible to get a quote and maintain your privacy !
Package_Service	just out of interest , i went to a couple of the couriers direct sites - and discovered that in order to get a quote it would '_ve been necessary to phone them up , and on one of them where i could get an online quote , the cheapest price quoted was £_00 more_expensive than the price they quoted throughh parcel0go - for some bizarre reason they ' d conveniently " forgotten " to make it possible to buy the economy service ; either that , or it was so well hidden i couldn_'_t find it ...!
Package_Service	so much_nicer to be able to put in the details online and then decide which courier service i wanted to use - all options and prices available , from the cheapest economy to the most expensive , with at_least six different courier companies within the uk !
Package_Service	i was also lucky_enough to notice that on facebook they were offering a bonus 0 %_discount today , making it even better value .
Package_Service	add to this a wide_range of methods of payment , including paypal , i couldn_'_t really hope for more .
Package_Service	i '_ve previously looked at different couriers when i wanted to send something large , and ended_up completely confused .
Package_Service	none of that when i used parcel0go for the first time today , it really is so straightforward - all i have to do now is wait for my chosen courier to turn_up on monday !
Package_Service	i realised i ' d bought a service but put inches as centimetres !
Package_Service	katie sorted it all out - many_thanks indeed .
Package_Service	fast and friendly , phew !
Package_Service	after buying something on ebay the seller quoted me the cheapest royal_mail price -£ 00 . 00 for a 0kg parcel .
Package_Service	the parcel would be 0nd class and take approx 0 days to reach me .
Package_Service	the seller was delighted when i said i would arrange for the parcel to be collected from her workplace - all she had to do was print out the label .
Package_Service	she has since informed me that her work_colleagues were so impressed by the service and the savings that they are now going to use parcels0go .
Package_Service	many_thanks - i cannot_praise the service enough and the ease of your website is fantastic .
Package_Service	peter_chandler and team - keep_up the good work
Package_Service	you should try this company before others , i did and was well pleased .
Package_Service	i had arranged a collection with the wrong couriers as i need one that did not require a label printing .
Package_Service	i contacted the on - line help_desk .
Package_Service	i was connected to emily who very quickly re arranged my collection with a courier who did not need a label .
Package_Service	emily made the process very easy and my problem was sorted_out quickly .
Package_Service	i would rate the help_desk service very highly .
Package_Service	if you have a problem don_'_t be afraid to use this service .
Package_Service	i originally got connected to leanne who also provided quick help but before she could completed helping me i cut my self off the chat .
Package_Service	i then re opened the chat and got emily who was able to pick straight up from where leanne had been cut_off
Package_Service	thanks leanne
Package_Service	thanks emily

Package_Service	well mannered and positive response for her .
Package_Service	very pleased with the chat service .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	i went on line and decided to use a courier service i had not heard of before as i don_'_t often use couriers , of course i had my reservations with all the stories you hear about lost goods , late deliveries , but it was very good , straight_forward in completing the order online , then the collection and delivery were quick and early delivered .
Package_Service	i was very pleased and will use this service again with confidence and would definitely recommend them .
Package_Service	if i were to describe them in a few words i would say they are ' efficient and cost_effective ' what more could you want !
Package_Service	easy to book , picked_up as stated and delivered as stated .
Package_Service	what more can you ask .
Package_Service	i had to send a small but valuable item to the us .
Package_Service	the recipient recommended ups or fedex for security .
Package_Service	i got prices from them ranging from £_00 -£ 00 , no way was i paying that , so i went on line and found parcel_hero .
Package_Service	i paid them £_00 , it was picked_up the next_day by ' fedex ' and delivered in under 00_hours to arizona .
Package_Service	i was having difficulties placing an order on - line , but i contacted parcel0go via the on - line chat and the staff_member that responded ( emma ) patiently took all of my order details and raised the order manually for me .
Package_Service	she listened to my problem and sorted things out quickly - many_thanks to emma !
Package_Service	i booked them , they arrived on correct day took parcel and delivered next_day no problem and very reasonable price under £ 0 . 0

Package_Service	help is at hand with a five_star service from [_name ],_[_name ][ name ] and not location location location
Package_Service	i have been using interparcel for the last few_months and have found their service to be good value for money and reliable .
Package_Service	i particularly value their ' pick - up ' service which saves me a car journey to the post_office .
Package_Service	i was very pleased with the service .

Package_Service	everything is clear and easy to follow .
Package_Service	information is accessible and up front , but if you have any problem at all , you can so easily access customer service !
Package_Service	this is an enormous bonus - so many companies actively hide contact details and bar you from asking for help from a human_being .
Package_Service	i have always had extremely_helpful and polite assistance from live_chat staff , but this morning i was prompted to write a review by the perfectly efficient assistance from a most helpful and charming lady_called lauren .
Package_Service	as i say - it is a pleasure to use p0g !
Package_Service	thanks for your good work .
Package_Service	i have been using interparcel for some time now and thought it was about time i posted a review .
Package_Service	the service from interparcel is without flaw .
Package_Service	from ease of use of the account , to accurate tracking ... from value for money to courteous communication .
Package_Service	the realisation came to me just yesterday when i ordered a pickup for an ebay item ... something which has broadened my use of the auction_site .
Package_Service	when someone says " collection only "... i simply message them that my courier will be picking it up .
Package_Service	it was the " my " bit that made me realise i would never dream of using someone_else .
Package_Service	interparcel truly are my courier service ...
Package_Service	i think that just about says it all !
Package_Service	thank_you so much ... needless to say ... i will_continue to use you !

Package_Service	i have had nothing but trouble with p0d and at the moment am taking them to court for false_advertising and mis_- sale of goods_act 0000 .
Package_Service	where do i start ?
Package_Service	i sell on ebay and offer next_day delivery , my items are large so they cannot be lost easily .
Package_Service	if the couriers bother to turn_up to collect , the items do not get delivered next_day .
Package_Service	they give me the wrong paperwork , wrong tracking_details or no paperwork .
Package_Service	then to top it off once the collect items go missing and are lost and never delivered .
Package_Service	all this through yodel .
Package_Service	p0d customer service has_been useless , broken_promises , lies & a general cant be bothered , i don_'_t really care attitude .
Package_Service	i am now out of pocket by £_000 '_s as i have had to refund customers in full & basically have no hope of getting my money back from p0d or yodel .
Package_Service	i am a very small business and cannot sustain losses like these .
Package_Service	avoid p0d & avoid yodel
Package_Service	all the varieties of delivery service provided in one easy access with clear easy to see pricing .
Package_Service	i have used collect_+ a couple of times now and i certainly have no_complaints .
Package_Service	i even had a strange shaped parcel delivered to northern_ireland with no problem .
Package_Service	the added convenience of having the item delivered to a local_store is brilliant for those who cannot sit around waiting for a delivery .
Package_Service	answered all the questions quickly and concisely - thank_you very much .
Package_Service	finally got my delivery from the us .
Package_Service	happy driver but 00 days late .
Package_Service	i contacted sophie via live_chat to help track a parcel for me and delivery time etc she couldn_'_t have been more helpful and friendly and should be rewarded for the excellent service provided
Package_Service	was having trouble with the online form ( chose wrong country !!)
Package_Service	and catherine_corless not only helped_me out but did all the hard work for me , and filled in the form on my behalf .
Package_Service	then sent me a link .
Package_Service	and saved me £_00 in the process !!!
Package_Service	what could be better - honestly ?
Package_Service	she was very kind and helpful ( especially as i was taking down a satellite dish at the same time and had to keep popping back !
Package_Service	)- but she stayed patient and waited .
Package_Service	i was also asked to check restricted items that i may have missed otherwise and probably would have had the items to northern_ireland cancelled .
Package_Service	absolutely fantastic .
Package_Service	catherine is a true saviour !!
Package_Service	a princess back in the day !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	andy .
Package_Service	dont think much to the web_site as i filled that form in 0 times and got no were i spoke to a girl called emily on live_chat she took my order over the net very nice friendly girl wish lot more assistants were like emily
Package_Service	kind_regards susan
Package_Service	the website is easy to get a quote for a courier service , giving you lots of different options and prices .
Package_Service	the ' chat now ' button is available if you need it , and when i did , caroline was able to provide me all the additional info without me having to trawl the faq .
Package_Service	great service , would highly_recommend it .
Package_Service	my husband had a motor bike engine that had to be sent to england , i went on the internet to check for a company that would collect and deliver the engine . i got the best price from parcel0go . i put my order in on a tuesday night and the following_morning at 00am the pick_up was made .
Package_Service	the engine was delivered to its destination on the friday . i highly_recommend this company and a big thanks to peter_chandler for his help .
Package_Service	the best courier l have used , never had a breakage reported yet and never lost an item , so in all am quite satisfied with their service and will use them in future
Package_Service	had some additional questions related to parcel documentation and drop_off points and sarah sorted them all out via webchat - absolutely superb service ;-)
Package_Service	if only everything in life was as simple and effective as parcel0go
Package_Service	absolutely perfect customer service ;-)
Package_Service	we have used intrerparcel for over 0 years .
Package_Service	they are priced very competitively but i guess with that you have to expect a downside and these_guys don_'_t disappoint !
Package_Service	easy to use website offers all the main couriers at around 00_% less_than their own websites for ad - hoc deliveries .
Package_Service	we use them once or twice a month and their ups prices in particular are very good .
Package_Service	the 0 % future discount is a bit misleading as you have to join a shopping club to get the voucher - i wouldn_'_t bother !
Package_Service	technology is basic but is good / straightforward as you ' d expect so 0 - 0 minutes to book on a collection .
Package_Service	no urgency though as most of the services are next_day and you really need to book before 00am to guarantee same day pick_up .
Package_Service	problems 0 or 0 times a year with missed deliveries or lost / damaged shipments - mostly resolved in the end .
Package_Service	offer of free insurance is a waste of time so if its a valuable shipment you should get additional cover .
Package_Service	contacting them is a trial , they should know that using a premium number and long hold times doesn_'_t go down well with customers nowadays !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	all in all enough goes right to keep using them ....
Package_Service	emma was easy to deal with and very helpful :)
Package_Service	i sent a parcel containing 0 cups and saucers which was sold on ebay .
Package_Service	each item was wrapped in bubblewrap and double wrapped in a cardboard_box .
Package_Service	the customer complained that 00 of the items had been smashed by the carrier .
Package_Service	only 0 of the saucers had not been smashed .
Package_Service	i complained to collect_plus and all they could say was that the items were not covered as per their small_print .
Package_Service	their was no attempt to investigate why the items had been smashed or any promise of action to ensure that it did not happen again .
Package_Service	they would not be compensating me for my loss and neither would they refund me the cost of the carriage .
Package_Service	i will not be using collect_plus again !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	adam was able to sort_out in five_minutes the mess i ' d made of my overseas order paperwork and email me new paperwork with the correct details .
Package_Service	thanks again adam .
Package_Service	returning a parcel is always annoying but parcel0go . com made the process of returning a large and heavy package into a simple process .
Package_Service	i ' d like to thank catherine their online help representive who advised and supported me and i will return to this company when i next need to return an item .
Package_Service	spoke to sammie_taylor , problem_solved in seconds .
Package_Service	excellent service
Package_Service	i couldn_'_t track my parcel but richard was very helpful and assured me that tracking would be available later that day
Package_Service	this parcel service was so easy to book and the price was very competitive , and best of all ... no queueing at the post_office !
Package_Service	i have used the inter_parcel site for a number of years , they have always proved to be reliable and well priced .
Package_Service	when compared to others their choice of courier and service is 0nd to none .
Package_Service	on only one occasion have i had a problem with a collection and it is then that the service was put to the test .
Package_Service	inter_parcel responded very efficiently and the issue was sorted they have my highest recommendation ..
Package_Service	i '_ve been using p0go on & off for about a year now and the service has always worked well for me .
Package_Service	i ' m not a business just somebody who sends the odd parcel now & then but living in a rural part of scotland the service is vital to me .
Package_Service	today for the first time i couldn_'_t get the online pages to accept my parcel for the collection on the day i wanted .
Package_Service	so , i used the online_chat link , daniel was my contact & within a very few_minutes he ' d sorted it all out entered all the details and sent me a secure link to pay .
Package_Service	just what was required .
Package_Service	thank_you daniel & p0g .
Package_Service	keep_up the good work !
Package_Service	i ' m a happy customer who will recommend you & continue to use you .
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	have been using interparcel for 0 years and had no_problems , they have always collected parcels within required time and delivered on time , we have had no damaged parcels which is more than i can say for parcelforce !!!
Package_Service	( which i would never use again ).
Package_Service	the one time i made a mistake when ordering on line , i double booked a package , one quick phone_call to customer_services had the double booking cancelled and my money refunded .
Package_Service	[_name ] was very helpful and enabled_me to send my parcel with no_problems
Package_Service	they are unbeatable at the moment !
Package_Service	service is great , pricing fantastic , web_interface very user - friendly and range of services comprehensive and very flexible .
Package_Service	unrivaled , in my experience .
Package_Service	i don_'_t really bother to look anywhere_else now - and that really is saying something !
Package_Service	this morning , i had occasion to use ' livechat ' help and the delightful kristina was fantastic .
Package_Service	can '_t praise p0go highly_enough !
Package_Service	is the cheque on its way , mr kramer ?
Package_Service	;)
Package_Service	i booked a parcel on line weds 00th_october , destined for londonderry .

Package_Service	peter ...... ipswich suffolk
Package_Service	i would recommend parcel0go to everyone sam has_been a great help a big thank_you sam xx
Package_Service	in the couple of months i have used collect_plus i have had 0 parcels go missing , i have not been fully refunded for them .
Package_Service	they have taken payment for delivering parcels twice , refused to refund and refused to let me speak to a manager .
Package_Service	i will hand deliver parcels before giving collect_plus and further custom .
Package_Service	there were so many services to choose from but parcel to go make it easy to see all the options .
Package_Service	when i had a question i was online within_seconds and talking to sammie who was able to answer my queries making it easy to decide what to do next .
Package_Service	brilliant customer service i would highly_recommend them .
Package_Service	easy to use website , with clear_instructions and a reliable service to send and receive your parcels .
Package_Service	no_problems with this one !
Package_Service	daniel knows his stuff .
Package_Service	sorted me out in minutes !
Package_Service	parcel to go is the way forward
Package_Service	super service
Package_Service	ive used this company for some 0 or more years and even if i have had problems , it is soon sorted_out , great customer service and overall highly_recommended .. especially steph and her manager for their help today , very happy
Package_Service	yet again some excellent customer service this week from this company , the bigger companies could_learn a thing or two about customer service skills from these .. well_done remi and kate x
Package_Service	i send bulky items , but not often enough to justify an account with the big courier companies .
Package_Service	my transglobal account has served me well now for several_years .
Package_Service	i have never been let_down once .
Package_Service	not sure what was happening but the support i was given seemed to know , so a big thank u to catherine ,
Package_Service	mick
Package_Service	i had to change my collection date and thanks to sammie_taylor who made it so simple and was sooooooooooooooooo helpful .

Package_Service	recommended to use them and i will use them again , thanks rose
Package_Service	booked a collection , paid for next_day delivery , they then said " it is not a gauranteed service , we only gaurantee next_day after collection is made , we do not gaurantee collection will take place as promised " if you want something gauranteed go_elsewhere customer service totally unhelpfull .
Package_Service	sarah_hayes helped_me out today because i am not the best computer operator in the world !!!
Package_Service	just by a few words back and forth she got my parcel off to my customer and hope she is on the other end of the line when i . m next in trouble ..
Package_Service	thanks a buch sarah .
Package_Service	registered as a user today to despatch a parcel .

Package_Service	thank_you tanya .
Package_Service	easy to use , plug in the dimensions get the cheapest quote , if unsure_about anything just use the live_chat .

Package_Service	having just had an on - line chat with emma i have nothing but praise for her and the company .
Package_Service	extremely_helpful and knowledgable she is a true asset to the company .
Package_Service	i really hope emma wins the friday day off .
Package_Service	staff like that deserve reward .
Package_Service	thanks again emma
Package_Service	i '_ve been using parcel0go for several_years for an annual event that we send out booklets for .
Package_Service	we have found this a very straight_forward way to get our materials out , even with a few international orders .
Package_Service	on occasion we have an address that presents some challenges and on the latest occasion catherine was extremely_helpful in getting the order done through the parcel0go web chat .
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	great service no_problems collected when stated .
Package_Service	second time in a row , katie sorts out the same problem second in a row .
Package_Service	easily sorted and done in under 00_mins .
Package_Service	thanks again
Package_Service	from the moment you book the delivery & then deliver to your local agent it is so easy it is child '_s play .
Package_Service	the parcel then delivered as scheduled with no apparent hiccups .
Package_Service	someone on ebay suggested parcel0go to me and i am so glad they did .
Package_Service	i have used them several_times and their service is amazing .
Package_Service	such cheap prices and collection from your door .
Package_Service	no more trekking off to the post_office with heavy parcels .
Package_Service	the staff are friendly and helpful .
Package_Service	i have communicated with [_name ] who is certainly example of this .
Package_Service	i can highly_recommend this company .
Package_Service	terrible company , impossible to contact , lost my spinning wheel worth £_000 . 00 .
Package_Service	no compensation , no telephone_number to ring on website , web_site very misleading .
Package_Service	just ' live ' chat !
Package_Service	repeated same infuriating circle of incompetance 0 times .
Package_Service	never use these_guys .
Package_Service	large parcel to sweden

Package_Service	lauren w was able to reassure me that changing to a courier more suited to my needs was possible and straight_forward .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	lorraine
Package_Service	first time using parcel0go with 0 parcels to us within 0 days , very smooth process and sam was very helpful with a problem with first parcel ( i had not sent the correct import documents ) this was resolved in minutes and the parcel was delivered without further delay .
Package_Service	i have another two parcels this week to us and wont even bother checking out other options as i have every confidence in parcel0gos pricing and service .
Package_Service	i placed an order with interparcel for a package to be sent to spain on 0th_december and the parcel was duly collected by a dpd courier the following_day .
Package_Service	i tracked the parcel online and saw that it was out for delivery on the 00th , then again on the 00th and finally a message was posted at 0pm on the 00th stating there was a query with the address .
Package_Service	on monday 00rd after noticing this comment , i called at 0 . 00am and confirmed that the address details were correct and confirmed the recipients contact number , which was missing the last digit .
Package_Service	on the 00th , when there was no further update on the tracking_system and the parcel still had not been received , i attempted to call interparcel again ( their website stated they were open till midday ) and just continuously got an answer machine message_saying the office would reopen after the august bank_holiday (??).
Package_Service	in desperation i called dpd direct and after 0 attempts finally spoke with someone with whom i confirmed the address and contact number again and was guaranteed the recipient would be called and delivery would be arranged .
Package_Service	on the 00th , the tracking_system was once again updated stating that they were unable to deliver the parcel ( but having contacted the recipient i knew for a fact that they hadn_'_t yet called her or attempted a delivery !)
Package_Service	i tried to call them on the 00st and the 0st to find out what was going on , but both times i just got an answer machine message .
Package_Service	on the 0nd i finally got through to be told that the parcel was being returned to me because i hadn_'_t confirmed the telephone_number in time for them to contact the recipient .
Package_Service	as this was blatantly untrue , and i had the telephone records to prove it , i quite understandably was not amused , but had no choice but to accept that the parcel was now on its way back to me .
Package_Service	on the 0rd , the tracking_system showed that it had been received in birmingham .
Package_Service	when i hadn_'_t received it by the 00th , i contacted both dpd and interparcel who confirmed that it was now at interparcels depot in crawley ( having passed my house in the process !)
Package_Service	and it would be with me on monday 00th .
Package_Service	on tuesday 00th , when it still hadn_'_t been received , i called and have been promised it will be with me on thursday 00th .
Package_Service	so i wait with baited breath !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	and to add_insult to injury , after having to endure such poor service and incompetent customer support , i have been told that i will not receive a refund for the original cost of the service !
Package_Service	i needed to get 0 parcels to london by a definite date in early_december and chose to use collect_+ as the recipient was at work all day and it was far more convenient for him to pick the parcels up at a local shop after work than it was to try to get to the post_office during the opening hours .
Package_Service	i dropped the parcels at my local collect_+ shop and they scanned without a problem .
Package_Service	using online tracking i could see that the parcels were picked_up the following_day and the recipient received a txt notifying him that the parcels were on their way .
Package_Service	00hrs_later when the parcels hadn_'_t been received and the tracking status hadn_'_t changed i called connect + and was told there was a problem scanning one of the parcels , but that they were at the depot and would be delivered within 00_hrs .
Package_Service	00hrs came and went and as the recipient had now gone on holiday for 0 weeks , i called collect_+ and i asked for the parcels to be returned to me and asked for a refund of the shipping_costs i had already paid .
Package_Service	i was told that i could have a credit towards a future order .
Package_Service	obviously i had no_intention of ever using connect + again so i said that wasn_'_t acceptable .
Package_Service	after keeping me on hold for 0 mins they then told me i could make a claim for a refund and send me a claim form .
Package_Service	i waited another 0 days for the parcels to be returned to me , but still didn_'_t receive anything .
Package_Service	finally , i called connect + again and this time was told that my parcels had gone_missing and couldn_'_t be found at the depot and was emailed another 0 claim forms .
Package_Service	when i said i would rather wait for the parcels to be located even if it took longer , i was told it was highly unlikely they would turn_up as they had probably been stolen !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	the whole_process was unprofessional , badly managed and a complete_waste of my time and money .
Package_Service	the level of compensation is in no way adequate to cover the value of the contents or their replacement .
Package_Service	i will never use this service again and after_reading the many reviews on this site , wish i had never used them in the first place .
Package_Service	always easy to contact and dealt_with quickly and efficiently !
Package_Service	had a problem as the people sending the item to me hadnt packed it ... easly rearanged a collection on a day i specified within a couple of minuets using on line measaging ... easy worked realy well and the person at the other end ( tom ).. couldnt have been more helpfull ... a refreshing_change to being put in a que on the phone as is the norm these day .. ill be using these for all my deliveries and collections from now on .
Package_Service	i have booked collection for my parcel and the cost was fantastic for the destination requested as i tried many others but very expensive almost double , in addition i missed my collection so went through the chat room in the website and the person chat it with " jessica " was extremely_helpful and she re booked collection in the same day with fedex so i recommend this company highly for the price and the service they provide .
Package_Service	emma was really helpful this morning with my request for a quote to post a package to malaysia .
Package_Service	i had a couple of non - standard requirements and emma was extremely
Package_Service	helpful in getting me the price i needed .
Package_Service	a real easy system of live_chat .
Package_Service	kind_regards
Package_Service	stuart
Package_Service	bexley uk
Package_Service	easy to use , reasonably_priced .
Package_Service	parcel size limits are generous .
Package_Service	i sent a tracked item worth £_000 and it arrived 0 days after posting .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	happy to use collectplus for all my shipping .
Package_Service	used interparcel to ship car parts in the uk and europe plus records and cd '_s globally .
Package_Service	so easy to book everything online and arrange for courier to collect from me .
Package_Service	customer service are ok , they can be a little arrogant at times but most deliveries go without problems so it '_s not a major issue .
Package_Service	from a quick glance at our records i can say we sent in the region of 000 packages with interparcel but never again !
Package_Service	the last and final time we will ever use this company was when we shipped a consignment of two packages to a british embassy in a foreign country .
Package_Service	the cost of shipping using ups was £_000 . 00 .
Package_Service	the parcel was labeled with a customers name , building number , street name , town and province but also included an internal post box number once delivered to the embassy .
Package_Service	the labeling , including the use of the po_box number was inline with ups requirements as_described , at the time on their website , which stated deliveries to po boxes must also show the full address including building number and street name .
Package_Service	this has now been removed from ups website !
Package_Service	ups '_s driver collected the parcel which was clearly labeled as above , showing the full address including po_box .
Package_Service	however 0 hour later when it got to their depot it was marked returned to sender - not able to deliver to po_box addresses .
Package_Service	rather_than the package being returned directly to us it was sent to interparcel resulting in a delay of several days .
Package_Service	interparcel refused to refund any part of the £_000 irregardless of the fact that the parcel had only traveled from bolton to interparcel quoting their t &_c '_s .
Package_Service	we did search interparcels t &_c prior to booking the order for the term " po_box " but because we did the search in lowercase as_opposed to " po_box " the term was not resolved .
Package_Service	interparcels t &_c states " 0 . 0 interparcel ltd can only deliver to a full street address .
Package_Service	we cannot deliver to a po_box or bfpo address .
Package_Service	if a consignment has to be returned for this reason , no refund will be given ."
Package_Service	we reminded interparcel that the packages did show a full address including customer name , house name and street number but they still failed to refund any part .
Package_Service	to add_insult to injury and as a direct result of the parcel being " returned to sender i . e .
Package_Service	to interparcel by ups first and not directly to us the end customer cancelled the order due to the delay in being_able to re - ship at a cost of £ 0000 .
Package_Service	we now use [_external link_removed_] and in a strange way are happy to have moved from interparcel .
Package_Service	their customer service had always been appalling and the time spent of hold when phoning them was appalling .
Package_Service	what a great asset to parcels 0 go , so nice to deal with & so helpful , nothing is too much_trouble , sorted my parcels shipping problems , first_class assistance .
Package_Service	having suffered at the hands of other couriers i was anxious that interparcel would be similar .
Package_Service	i need not have worried .
Package_Service	the parcel was collected and delivered on time and intact .
Package_Service	i would have liked to cover the entire cost of the item using the insurance but could only cover part of its value due to company policy .
Package_Service	this was my only_gripe .
Package_Service	otherwise they offered a first_class service and i would recommend them .
Package_Service	i have had to change my review after a satisfactory performance by this company .
Package_Service	i had an " out of area " advise which cost me an extra £ 0 in postage ( from £ 0 . 00 to £ 0 . 00 ).
Package_Service	i paid it because i thought i had no choice .
Package_Service	checking on other_sites ( e . g .
Package_Service	parcel0go . com ), they would have still only charged me £ 0 . 00 .
Package_Service	this would have been with exactly the same courier !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	this company has shown me that they are another cowboy outfit , not fit for porpose !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	replied that i had only been charged £ 0 . 00 - bunch of liars and i have sent them proof .
Package_Service	i have upgraded my opinion of interparcel , because although their response to my non collection issues by hermes ( who should be avoided at all costs ), was slow and cost me my sale , eventually tried to rectify the situation .
Package_Service	interparcel need to be more careful about the couriers that they support , as ( was in the case with my customer ) the seller gets the blame .
Package_Service	hermes who were the culprit got away scott free ( or so they think ).
Package_Service	i do not think with the reviews that hermes are getting on trustpilot . com and also facebook that they will be around for much longer .
Package_Service	interparcel should drop hermes as soon as possible before it tarnishes their reputation !
Package_Service	catherine was really helpful online also very pleased with the service from parcel0go would definately_use again
Package_Service	jenny most helpfull and no delay in speaking and answering questions .
Package_Service	promt collection of parcel , easy to track online and text notification received when delivered .
Package_Service	will_definitely_use again .
Package_Service	was a little_worried as box contained glass items , delivered quickly and in one piece .
Package_Service	customer very happy , thank_you
Package_Service	katie is a really helpful lady , she helps me on my order and go through it step by step .
Package_Service	very pleased with this service .
Package_Service	thank_you very much .
Package_Service	excellent job !
Package_Service	my parcel wasn_'_t collected on the designated day .
Package_Service	i contacted parcel0go .
Package_Service	first of all , i was electronically told that my school reception was closed at 00 . 00 when the courier arrived for pickup .
Package_Service	i don_'_t think so .
Package_Service	i queried this .
Package_Service	the next comment was that it was open but the parcel was not ready .
Package_Service	i contacted parcel0go by live_chat .
Package_Service	the lady researched the problem for me and apparently the reception was open , the parcel was ready but there was nobody appropriate who could sign for the parcel !
Package_Service	the school receptionists were not amused when i told them .
Package_Service	customer_services were very good , polite and helpful .
Package_Service	a new collection date was made , for today , and the parcel was picked_up this morning .
Package_Service	i just hope it gets to the right place tomorrow .
Package_Service	as my parcel is going to reach manchester a day after it was supposed to , and i had to stay in reception myself from 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 for no collection , and had to communicate over the pc for ages , i think that i deserve a refund .
Package_Service	as of yet , this has not been offered .
Package_Service	great helpful agent .
Package_Service	dealt_with my problem quickly and very polite .
Package_Service	a simple problem .
Package_Service	sorted by emma extremely quickly when i had very little time !
Package_Service	thanks emma x

Package_Service	polite , cheerful and efficient , what more can i say except well_done sammie .
Package_Service	keep_up the good work .
Package_Service	catherine was very friendly & helpful , she sorted my lost label out .
Package_Service	i would highly_recommend her , ask for catherine .
Package_Service	i felt very comfortable with her & she gave me clear_instructions on what to do .
Package_Service	thanks again catherine .

Package_Service	parcels0go you ' re pretty good - thank_goodness you have competent people at the front end !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	give him / her a pay rise !
Package_Service	i '_ve used parcel0go on a few occasions now and the process is very easy and straightforward and the prices always seem competitive .
Package_Service	i never thought fedex would cost less_than royal_mail for international small packets , but that is now the case .
Package_Service	the one problem i had wa when the web form would not accept the japanese post_code and the online help from emma was excellent .
Package_Service	she entered all the details quickly via chat and came up with a link to the payment page on record time .
Package_Service	a good experience all_round and my first_port of call for international_shipping now .
Package_Service	i ordered collection of a parcel to be picked_up on monday 00th_nov . 0000 and had to pay premium price as it wasn_'_t being picked_up from my address .
Package_Service	as the parcel hadn_'_t arrived by the time it should have ( tues 00th ) i checked the tracking_number to see where it was , i found out that it had been scheduled to be picked_up on 00rd november !
Package_Service	when i tried speaking to someone via the ' chat ' facility i was fobbed_off with all_sorts of excuses and finally asked if i wanted the parcel to be picked_up the following_day !
Package_Service	no proper apology for causing me to lose a customer ( who the parcel was for ) and no offer of any form of compensation .
Package_Service	i would not recommend this outfit to anybody ,
Package_Service	i must_admit - i was a bit_worried_about using a new service - i needn_'_t have been .
Package_Service	from start to finish the service was simple to use , variety of ways to pay and super efficient .
Package_Service	i sent two parcels and both arrived on the morning of the expected delivery day .
Package_Service	text_message was received confirming delivery - what a great idea !
Package_Service	i will_certainly be using the service again .
Package_Service	i would love it if you offered a more competitive service for smaller parcels and letters - perhaps something for the future .
Package_Service	i give the service i received 0 gold stars .
Package_Service	well_done and thank_you very much .
Package_Service	the personal contact i have had with peter_chandler is also very much_appreciated .
Package_Service	sarah_hayes on the live help chat sorted my problem out instantly with clear , concise information .
Package_Service	thanks very much .
Package_Service	contacted then twice now with minor problems ( via the chat box window ).
Package_Service	spoke to alexandra on the last occasion , very helpful and both problems sorted within minutes .
Package_Service	keep_up the good work ptog .
Package_Service	thank_you .
Package_Service	great service easy cheap and efficient !
Package_Service	what more can you ask for ?
Package_Service	i went on line to p0g and tom came on and i told him the problem i had and he got right on to it and when i ask other questions within_seconds he had the answer thanks tom id recommend the question and answer service .
Package_Service	this was my third time using parcelhero after a recommendation and i was very happy so far .
Package_Service	so they were the obvious choice when i was in spain and needed to come back to the uk for a funeral , without being_able to go home first .
Package_Service	i got a friend to parcel up some suitable clothes and send them to me in time , and they were collected ok .
Package_Service	but although they were shown as ' out for delivery ' from 0am yesterday no attempt was made to deliver the parcel and i assume they were returned to the depot .
Package_Service	i chased customer service and was eventually informed that they were out again for delivery by 0pm today .
Package_Service	no attempt to make it a priority , and no attempt at an explanation .
Package_Service	i now will have to buy or borrow some clothes and no one is likely to be in when they eventually turn_up .
Package_Service	very surprised and disappointed , don_'_t remember ever feeling that a company couldn_'_t care_less .
Package_Service	i booked a parcel on wednesday to be collected on thursday and delivered on friday it is still in my house on friday_evening at 0 pm what a sham this is they really have done a job 00 . 00 to send the item and no service at all the telephone customer_services are a waste of time as is the online help service avoid at all costs

Package_Service	having just bought an apartment in cyprus , we were looking to ship 0 large crates of household goods over from the uk .
Package_Service	having looked at the major carriers websites & ruled them out due to the expense we then seemed to falls between 0 stools , not having enough for overseas removals firms but too much for regular parcel post .
Package_Service	saw the reviews for parcelhero on a cyprus forum & decided to give them a go , but was very apprehensive that our stuff would disappear into the back of a white van never to be seen again .
Package_Service	i needn_'_t have worried , the ordering_process was very easy & the labeling guidelines nice & clear .
Package_Service	a fedex van turned_up promptly on the day i specified & i was able to track the location of our crates online evrey step of the way .
Package_Service	best of all everything arrived safe & sound in half the time expected despite only paying for the economy service .
Package_Service	cost was half what i would have paid if i ' d booked direct with fedex .
Package_Service	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use parcelhero again .
Package_Service	i was trying to send a parcel online to south_africa but came up with a hiccup and was asked to contact ' live_chat ' to continue .

Package_Service	i had a lovely experience today .
Package_Service	i need parcel0go to collect a parcel a customer
Package_Service	is returning .

Package_Service	then i got through to samantha on the chat helpline .
Package_Service	she was great .
Package_Service	i am a pensioner and not a fast at typing .
Package_Service	she took me throught the precedures step by step .

Package_Service	sarah_hayes was yes helpful and was able to overide restrictions manually so parcel was collected today ..
Package_Service	efficient and quick .
Package_Service	what more can one do ?
Package_Service	!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	my agent today was catherine and i would find it difficult to find another that gives as good of a service quick and efficient a star in the making methinks
Package_Service	the first time i used parcel0go . com the service was fine .
Package_Service	second time they missed the collection date by 0 days - although the response was prompt there was not attempt to offer a refund .
Package_Service	online_chat support was worse_than useless .
Package_Service	a guy called [_name ] said that he would check and then just disappeared .
Package_Service	i have just gone to the site to arrange for a collection and despite me using the correct e_- mail address and password - having problems logging in .. so thought i will get them to send me my password ( just in case ) their web genius is so great that to retrieve password - the account e_- mail address is not asked for - the username is asked for .
Package_Service	but .
Package_Service	parcel0go do not send a registration e_- mail containing username etc so i am unable to actually login .
Package_Service	i have now missed the collection deadline for today .
Package_Service	avoid them if you can , i reckon they are victims of their own success and service / web - site etc are redolent of an organisation that does not know what it is doing - i am off to the post_office
Package_Service	thank_you parcel0go and catherine_corless for her live_chat help .
Package_Service	have had a problem with another company and looked on the reviews for parcel0go , seeing that they were good i decided to ask for advice and use the live_chat .
Package_Service	catherine was very helpful , and made me feel_confident that my parcel has_been sent through the right company .
Package_Service	the live_chat was very easy to use and i was talked through everything online .
Package_Service	i would definitely_use again and recommend .
Package_Service	thank_you catherine and parcel0go .
Package_Service	this was my first go with parcel0go and i was so impressed with their service .
Package_Service	i spoke to a really helpful , friendly guy , david , who was polite , helpful and friendly despite my dithering about .
Package_Service	i would thoroughly_recommend anyone to use this service rather_than lugging heavy boxes to a post_office .
Package_Service	i was nervous of the restrictions of sending items from the uk to australia .
Package_Service	emma helped_me through the whole_process via the parcel0g0 ' live person chat ' support .
Package_Service	in fact she filled out the application_form for me and quoted me a great price .
Package_Service	now i feel_confident that my brother will get his christmas parcel as i wrapped it without customs feeling the need to investigate because i '_ve not given enough detail on the relevant documents .
Package_Service	thank_you emma :)
Package_Service	using interparcel was the best thing i have done .
Package_Service	i have a small business that requires collections occasionally .
Package_Service	i have my favourite courier that i use , i know exactly_what time he will arrive , however you do have a choice of couriers .
Package_Service	payment is quick and easy to use and i know that if i ever have a problem there is someone at the end of the telephone in britain that i can talk to .
Package_Service	update 00 / 00 / 00 :-
Package_Service	i am changing my review score and adding these additional comments due to the following events , tnt finally arrived with my equipment , they were wholly responsible for the error and problems and had to be held accountable .
Package_Service	parcels 0 go were very professional and even_though they were not at fault they compensated me for the trouble and delay so in fairness we could not have asked for a better outcome .
Package_Service	totally_satisfied and relieved .
Package_Service	thank_you parcels 0 go
Package_Service	update_: 00 / 00 / 00 -
Package_Service	i am adding this in addition to the original comments_below :-
Package_Service	whilst the order was placed with parcels to go the persons at fault were tnt , these were the persons responsible for collecting and delivering the item , out of the blue after threats of police involvement today a vehicle pulled up and out came the cleaner .
Package_Service	so i am adding this to say that the events are true but it also has_been resolved and not really the fault of parcels to go .
Package_Service	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package_Service	i searched the web and booked a collection of a carpet_cleaner via this company , when it didn_'_t arrive the next_day i started tracking and monitoring the item .
Package_Service	after a week i started shouting because everyday i checked i was giving a load of rubbish , it has finally led to me being told i have to make a claim for £_00 . 00 because i didn_'_t take up the £_00 . 00 insurance_policy i was offered .
Package_Service	so i will have lost a £ 0000 . 00 and i am suppose to just accept it !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	tnt were responsible for the collection and all associated services , they lost it at the depot in llantrisant but point_blank refuse to speak with me and told me i can only speak to parcels to go .
Package_Service	so be aware , " place your orders direct with the courier " not with parcels to go as the insurance is the con even_though you paid for the courier .
Package_Service	i am now going to build a blog page , a dedicated facebook_page and as many individual web_pages as i can to make everyone aware which will be including all facts and evidence showing correspondence proving my case .
Package_Service	roy tucker
Package_Service	i have been using parcel0go for a long time now and have had excellent service from them , i could not log_into my account today but got on their live_chat and the problem was sorted within minutes by a friendly and helpful diane .

Package_Service	i actually attempted to use parcel0go today for the 0st time and i entered all my details for 0 parcels to be collected for delivery just to be informed i was out of time at the final stage and unable to complete the order .
Package_Service	up flashed live help agent asking can i help ?
Package_Service	i clicked yes and daniel , assisted me through the complete process .
Package_Service	he was such a help and so polite .
Package_Service	anyway i then had to cancel this order for reasons relating to a fraud / scam which i very nearly fell victim to so i had to contact live help again to cancel the order and request a full_refund .
Package_Service	emily assisted me this time and again was so efficient and quickly cancelled and requested the refund .
Package_Service	we got cut_off near the end before i could thank her so for the 0rd time i contacted live help and got rob .
Package_Service	he confirmed the above request had been completed by emily and agreed to pass on my thanks to her .
Package_Service	i just can not express how helpful , polite and willing to help these three agents were today with my requests for help and parcel0go should be very proud to have such nice and efficient people to be on hand to assist would be customers such as myself through difficult moments .
Package_Service	i have now registered with parcel0go . com and although i do not send many parcels to be honest , i would certainly return to use this company whenever i needed to send an item .
Package_Service	further more the prices are excellent and well_worth a check before looking at other_companies for such a service .
Package_Service	thank_you daniel , emily and rob for a brilliant
Package_Service	live help service .
Package_Service	it will be a pleasure to connect with you all again and certainly without_any hesitation in the future should i need any help .

Package_Service	not what i am used to of late from my normal courier .
Package_Service	well_done parcel0go .
Package_Service	i am impressed !
Package_Service	i would highly_recommend this service having used parcel0go before .
Package_Service	watch out royal_mail , you are getting too gready and will price yourself out of the market !

Package_Service	thank_you .
Package_Service	very good full range choice for your parcels transportation here and abroad .
Package_Service	one stop will find your solution - plus online assist from people like daniel .
Package_Service	having booked with p0g , i was surprised that despite_being the cheapest quote available , it also offered a better service than what parcelforce offered at nearly three_times the cost .
Package_Service	unfortunately another courier collected my parcel by mistake and wasn_'_t noticed until ups turned_up .
Package_Service	after few phone_calls and a chat with the p0g online help service , the parcel was located and delivered back the next_morning .
Package_Service	this mistake wasn_'_t p0g '_s problem so i was expecting at_least an administration charge for the mistake .
Package_Service	nope , the online_chat with nick ( thanks nick ) answered my questions , emailed me new labels ( in less_than 0 minutes ) and confirmed that there was no charge .
Package_Service	fantastic service both alexandra and nick .
Package_Service	samantha was excelent in the way she helped_me this morning
Package_Service	great service at a cost_effective price !
Package_Service	i would like to thank_you ncatherine for helping me do my order , you kept me from chucking the computer across the room , you descibed very fully what i had to do .

Package_Service	she was very helpful and answered my questions immidiately .
Package_Service	i got all the information so quick .
Package_Service	good thing about it is i could ask the question direct .
Package_Service	cost of sending the parcet to france was very reasonable as well i was very pleased !
Package_Service	i will not praise a company unless credit is due , this company deserves an excellent credit .
Package_Service	parcelhero provided a service that is second to none .
Package_Service	having had recent bad service from a another parcel company , to say i was wary of parcelhero claims was an_understatement .
Package_Service	any way at 0 . 00pm last wednesday i had a medium_sized parcel to ship .
Package_Service	i found parcel_hero on an internet_search_engine & thought i would give them a try .
Package_Service	so at 0 . 00pm i arrange the collection , finishing the transaction i printed the despatch label .
Package_Service	well , i had not finished sticking it onto the parcel when the courier company pulled up outside my house .
Package_Service	it could not have been much more than 00 to 00_mins from completing the order !!
Package_Service	anyway , thinking that an " economy service " might take 00 - 00hrs to be delivered , hell no , it was delivered at 0000hrs the next_day !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	well credit where credit is due , congratulations parcelhero you deserve a big pat on the back .
Package_Service	the driver who collected my parcel wore a uniform , was polite and explained that my part was done and i would be notified over the internet of the parcels progress .
Package_Service	your system kept me and the person who was expecting the parcel informed_throughout , only you were so fast we didn_'_t need to trace it !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i do not recommend many companies , however , parcelhero have excelled in their performance & professionalism .
Package_Service	credit where credit is due , well_done parcelhero and remember to keep_up your service & keep your prices keen .
Package_Service	you dont have to be the cheapest , just be the best !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	thank_you ........ j . s .
Package_Service	please_note :- i had used this company before sometime last_year without_any probles .
Package_Service	however i tried to get a generator collected on thursday 0 / 0 / 00 so i booked it wed pm for delivery before 0000hrs .
Package_Service	thursday about 0pm , i ' m informed the parcel still had not been collected .
Package_Service	i contacted parcel0go via their website , where you have to key your complaint in to a real_person .
Package_Service	anyway , i was given the complete run around , told that it would still be collected and to inform them after 0 . 00pm to rebook if it turned_out to be a failed collection .
Package_Service	they also said they turn off their telephones at 0pm so cannot investigate anything until the following_day !
Package_Service	anyway , it wasnt collected !
Package_Service	ok mistakes_happen but it took me 0 hours on their website & everytime you keyed something in you had to wait for a reply and omg it was slow !
Package_Service	in the end i had to rebook the collection for friday , but because i needed the generator for a holiday next week they forced me to pay the extra for a saturday delivery (£_00 . 00 !)
Package_Service	its rather like rewarding the courier for not collecting the goods !
Package_Service	ok , i needed the item quickly so paid up and it was due for collection on friday for delivery before 0000hrs on saturday .
Package_Service	anyway once again it was not collected , so never mind i thought its 0 . 00 , so i will telephone them , i couldn_'_t find any telephone_numbers so had to endure the typing once again .
Package_Service	i had previously telephoned tnt who as i thought had no details of me or the address where the item was due to be collected from .
Package_Service	getting through to customer service at parcel0go . com was easy enough , but only if you dodn '_t mind typing for 0 hours .
Package_Service	however getting parcel0go . com to understand or offer some help was something_else !
Package_Service	and my fears of this turning into a no collect as the previous day once again turned_out to be correct !
Package_Service	but once again they would not accept that they could possibly be wrong and they assured me the parcel would be collected by 0 . 00 today ( friday ) i asked if they could check with tnt , waited about 00 seconds & was told tnt have said the parcel is booked for collection today .
Package_Service	well it took me abt 00_minutes on the telephone to get the answer that tnt didnt have any details of me of this collection .
Package_Service	i then informed them of this & asked for a manager .
Package_Service	more of the same promises as the day before .
Package_Service	not under any circumstances could there possibly be a fault or failure of the percel0go system , my screen says its due for collection and they would not budge from that .
Package_Service	as i had now been on their websaite again for nearly 0hours , out of frustration , anger & disappointment i decided to hang up for the sake of my own health .
Package_Service	because the genarator i had bought was to run my cpap ( breathing machine ) we have now had to delay our holiday by anything upto a week !!
Package_Service	being an ex customer service manager myself , i found this so exceptionally frustrating .
Package_Service	we had booked this holiday at short_notice but there should have been plenty of time even with one failure .
Package_Service	but this company is oh so frustrating to deal with , on the thursday they completely refused to telephone the courier ( tnt ) as they insisted it would be collected !
Package_Service	then today friday , again they refused to help in any way shape or form & wanted me to see if it didnt_turn_up !
Package_Service	having paid nearly_£_00 for this collection i certainly expected something better_than this .
Package_Service	its most unusual to have a customer service department where you cannot speak to anyone and goodness_knows what one does if your unable to type at a reasonable speed or are not so good with the english_language .
Package_Service	what was previously a great company and with an excellent product has in my eyes been relegated to being near next to useless , rude , unhelpful staff who cannot be bothered to help or resolve an issue despite_being given all the facts !
Package_Service	i was once told " the measure of how good a company is , is when things go_wrong how well you are treated ."
Package_Service	having spent nearly 0 hours of frustrating and wasted time typing questions and waiting for some response / help i have been left high and dry without this bit of equipment and as a direct result we have had to put back our tourning holiday in france until later in the week .
Package_Service	this has_been a real lesson learnt .
Package_Service	i feel i have been given the run around and to be treated in such a condescending manor , its ruined our plans and they are so difficult or impossible to deal with .
Package_Service	if they had listened and taken the appropriate action .
Package_Service	this problem could have been so easily been resolved .
Package_Service	however , with no actual human contact , there is no chance of getting anything put right .
Package_Service	would i use parcel0go again , what do you think ???
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	update :- parcel0go . com contacted me via telephone however , when i refused to accept a credit of £_00 to my account ( no mention of a refund !)
Package_Service	i refused and it looks as if i will get my day in the small_claims court after all !!!
Package_Service	having had dealings with litigations for a very large ' blue - chip ' company , i will be putting these skills to good use !
Package_Service	it feels_like i am fighting a battle here for all of those who have had such appalling service from parcel0go . com .
Package_Service	after it goes to court , i will publish details here and in other_places so everyone can see the result ( win or lose )
Package_Service	please , if you have had similar such poor service from this company please put it up here or e_mail it to me in as brief / concise way as you can ( please give dates / times and be honest throughout ).
Package_Service	i can then use these in my claim by showing parcel0go . com were aware of the poor standards but did nothing to rectify the situation .
Package_Service	thank_you , jon .
Package_Service	( jpspencer0 @ fsmail . net )
Package_Service	i ' d like to commend george from the p0g facebook team for his consistently excellent service !
Package_Service	problems do happen sometimes ( fact of life ) and on the two occasions i '_ve had an issue he has quickly and helpfully fixed things to my complete_satisfaction .
Package_Service	the courier services have also been really good - citylink have often delivered next_day on a 0 - day service ( that makes for happy customers !)
Package_Service	and tnt have never let me down - great driver on the collection from me too .
Package_Service	great service & prices = happy customer definitely coming_back .
Package_Service	thanks george , kate & the rest of the team .
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	have never sent a parcel abroad and was a tad apprehensive as trans was a lot_cheaper then everybody_else .
Package_Service	from start to finish the process was easy communication and service was excellent .
Package_Service	from picking_up my parcel to delivering it in dubai it took 0 days .
Package_Service	the fact they use ups but charge half the price ups charge and you track all the way .
Package_Service	this was a fantastic service at an excellent price .
Package_Service	would recommend very highly and definitely_use again .
Package_Service	katie instantly sorted_out my claim for a damaged parcel , which was delivered badly_damaged by my hermes .
Package_Service	took just a few_minutes , was courteous and helpful , so well_done katie , and thank_you .
Package_Service	i ordered a courier in error & had to have the date changed .
Package_Service	i was dealt_with most efficiently by daniel & the problem was solved .
Package_Service	highly_recommended
Package_Service	convenient and good value
Package_Service	i always use parcel0go for sending packages above 0kg in weight .
Package_Service	0 ) in terms of the quality of service delivered by their representatives and couriers they beat the royal_mail 000 times over .
Package_Service	0 ) packages always arrive at their destination on time or ahead of time .
Package_Service	ialways select fedex !
Package_Service	0 ) i have used their conversation service twice and ashley has dealt_with my questions - promptly and without_fuss .
Package_Service	the royal_mail has much to learn from parcel0go
Package_Service	i needed to send a package to australia and tried the website to compare prices .
Package_Service	very competitive but i had some questions about the practical aspects so used the online_chat_facility and spoke to catherine_corless .
Package_Service	she was very helpful and able to advise , plus very human and charming at the end of a customer service chat system .
Package_Service	well_done , greatly_appreciated , and thank_you catherine ; service with a virtual smile !
Package_Service	i went on the chat helpline and katie was brilliant - answering my question , was very friendly and is exactly_what you want from a helpline !

Package_Service	she answered my questions quickly and clearly .
Package_Service	i would be very happy to chat with her again if ever i needed help with anything_else .
Package_Service	using this service the second time and had no_problems at all .
Package_Service	this was the fourth time i had used their service .
Package_Service	always top - class with items being delivered early or on time .
Package_Service	i find them to be the best and the least expensive .

Package_Service	i contacted parcel0go online & waited all of 00 seconds for a representative to reply . her name was becky . she was very polite , professional & informative .
Package_Service	she took time to look into my querie and resolved it without_any hassle .
Package_Service	i always use parcel0go as they have a never let me down ; always collect when they say they will & are the best priced parcel delivery service in the uk .
Package_Service	i highly_recommend them to all !
Package_Service	i send car parts of all shapes and sizes all over the world for my business .
Package_Service	i always check interparcel first and it '_s great that the premium carriers ups or fedex are often the best value .
Package_Service	if interparcel could take exceptionally large parcels it would get even more of my business .
Package_Service	any_problems are dealt_with quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	i have been using parcels0go for a few_months and have had excellent service .
Package_Service	just had some help form a chat representative daniel who has helped_me change the collection date for my order .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	also had good service earlier today form sarah_h .
Package_Service	great service , delivered on time .
Package_Service	i used this service for the first time last_week after checking various_sites first .
Package_Service	the price is excellent as it was a good £ 0 + cheaper_than royal_mail and you knew when it would be delivered .
Package_Service	the choice of either collection by courier or deliver myself to local shop was very useful .
Package_Service	i chose to take parcel to local shop and although i had just missed the daily collection on 00th_may by 00_mins the parcel arrived at it '_s destination at 0pm on 00th_may .
Package_Service	great service - thanks to peter_chandler & team .
Package_Service	i made a mistake making invoice putting total as a unit price but they had a super on - line assistance service and real nice operator dianne fixed the problem in seconds !
Package_Service	whenever i have trouble purchasing / ordering on line , usually takes a hard time fixing it but it was so easy this time !
Package_Service	great big thanx !
Package_Service	having come a cropper and missing the deadline for same day collection of my parcel recently , i was quite unhappy .
Package_Service	although not a regular user , my previous experience with parcel_hero had been very good and so their slip - up was totally unexpected .
Package_Service	taking on board my comments , parcel_hero made every effort to contact me personally and go through the issues concerned .
Package_Service	given their commitment to top_class customer service and satisfaction , i am pleased to recommend them and will be using them again .
Package_Service	this is a very easy service to use and i decide who delivers and the pricing is unbelievable try it mags
Package_Service	i amended the measurement and weight of a package that was suppose to be collect that very day to make it safer in transit even_though i had already made a payment to the original measurement . i contacted p0g about this changes online and i believe i communicated with alexandra .
Package_Service	even_though the weight went up with difference in measurement she was so helpful , nice and understanding and helped_me with all the changes .
Package_Service	she even waive the difference because in her opinion it was minute . thanks p0g
Package_Service	your new small parcel service is convenient , secure , great value and often takes less time than officially quoted .
Package_Service	keep_up the great service !
Package_Service	as a full time ebay seller i have to send lots of parcels .
Package_Service	i can highly_recommend this company .
Package_Service	the service is easy to use , trustworthy and very good value for money .
Package_Service	i have sent over 0 , 000 parcels with them .
Package_Service	i have had only 0 or 0 items go missing and the refund service is speedy and efficient with a lot less hassle than other services .
Package_Service	well_done collect_plus look_forward to sending another 0k parcels !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i '_ve used interparcel for years .
Package_Service	their site is perfectly thought - out , they use only efficient carriers , and the service is second to none
Package_Service	after being notified by the person who should have received the parcel i sent via ' inerparcel ', i sent a email to the so called customer service to find out what had happened to the delivery .
Package_Service	the reply i received said , thank_you for your email , i have emailed hermes to find out where this parcel has_been left .
Package_Service	once i have had a response i will get back to you .
Package_Service	i had to email again to , in effect nudge them , and in response , i received this message .
Package_Service	' hermes have come back to me today to say that the driver left it in a safe_place but cannot remember where .
Package_Service	the driver is going back to the address today to see whether he can remember and they will let me know .
Package_Service	that was sent on the 00th_march .
Package_Service	so i thought 00th_march , the driver with alzheimer '_s will get to the address on the 00th_march and i will find out what happened to the parcel at the latest 00th_march .
Package_Service	anyhow , six days and three email '_s later with no reply i was thinking that this driver has lost hisself now and i ' m worried for his family , where can he have got to .
Package_Service	then on the 0th day , the 00th_march i received a reply saying ... ' i apologise , i have emailed hermes to find out whether the driver is now able to advise where the parcel was left .
Package_Service	once i have had a response from hermes i will let you know what they advise .'
Package_Service	has the driver returned from his epic journey i wonder , will he have his memory back , on the tracking_information he noted that the parcel had been delivered to the letterbox ( he would have had to chainsaw half the door off to get this parcel through the letterbox ).
Package_Service	the person who should have received the parcel has assured me there is no damage to his door .
Package_Service	shock !!!
Package_Service	i received and email the next_day 00th_march .
Package_Service	i couldn_'_t believe what was said in it , but here goes ..... ' thank_you for your email , hermes have come back to me to advise that the driver does not remember where he left the parcel .
Package_Service	i ' m_afraid that the service that you chose does not offer enhanced transit cover so we would be unable to process a claim for loss .
Package_Service	but as a goodwill_gesture i have refunded the transit costs to you , we do not normally do this but because the driver is unable to advise where he left it we will on this occasion .'
Package_Service	all that says to me is , you paid for a service for us to collect and deliver a parcel for you , the driver has thieved it , you didn_'_t pay for insurance to cover the theft , unlucky better luck next time .
Package_Service	i '_ve lost out on £_000 plus the transit costs if i don_'_t get them back .
Package_Service	so , i will now seek legal_advice and take printed versions of the email '_s sent and received to interparcel .
Package_Service	hopefully i '_ll get a reply from someone in charge of this sham business with a reasonable offer before i go to the solicitors .
Package_Service	dianne was brilliant
Package_Service	better_than the postoffice wish it was a little cheaper
Package_Service	i booked a collection via parcelhero .
Package_Service	it was an international packet to usa .
Package_Service	i paid for an ' express ' service , with collection any time between 0000 /_0000_hrs .
Package_Service	i wasted an entire day , nine frustrating hours , sitting here , waiting for the courier ( fedex ) to collect .
Package_Service	at 0000_hrs , i tried to call parcelhero ’_s 0 . 0 pence per_minute 0000 revenue - share line .
Package_Service	it closes at 0000_hrs !
Package_Service	so , if a collection is not made , you can ’ t get hold of the company until the next_day !
Package_Service	what ’_s more is its ‘ live_chat ’ isn_'_t ' live ' after 0000_hrs .
Package_Service	it closes at the same early time as the phone lines !
Package_Service	you don_’ t even get connected with some clueless live messaging centre operator in the third world ; it is just an e . mail service after 0 , dressed up as live_chat .
Package_Service	what was i supposed to do ?
Package_Service	sit here for another 0 hours like a fool , listening for the door_bell ?
Package_Service	i wanted to know why but parcelhero ’_s customer service lines had closed .
Package_Service	i was absolutely seething :-(
Package_Service	update 00 sep 00 .
Package_Service	i have to commend parcelhero for its customer service .
Package_Service	i have received and made numerous phone_calls from / to its staff , including its md .
Package_Service	i have been assured by him that the reason the collection failed was because fedex failed to fully record and pass on to its staff my collection address .
Package_Service	the village name and last 0 characters of the post_code had been omitted .
Package_Service	there are a few roads in this postal area with the same name as mine .
Package_Service	as a result , the fedex driver had visited an identical address in an adjacent village .
Package_Service	however , i do still have some criticisms of the parcelhero service .
Package_Service	above , i describe its customer service lines , which close at the same time as its last collection time of 0000_hrs .
Package_Service	in addition , it was ironically ‘ fortunate ’ that my package containing 0 legal knives was not collected by fedex .
Package_Service	according to parcelhero staff , fedex does not carry knives and my parcel could have been impounded in uk by the authorities .
Package_Service	this would have caused me enormous stress and concern that 0 valuable items (£_000 gbp ) were impounded in uk , whilst the receiver in usa waited interminably and perhaps eventually would demand a refund .
Package_Service	i chose parcelhero to arrange carriage of these items since knives do not appear in its prohibited items list .
Package_Service	the parcelhero md advised me that he would ‘ look at ’ the parcelhero customer service closing time and in addition , consider including knives in its prohibited items list .
Package_Service	as a result , i am raising my score of parcelhero to 0 points .
Package_Service	sure , p0go is a value for money service when the couriers collect , but just wait_until things go_wrong .
Package_Service	this is what can happen :
Package_Service	you eventually connect to live_chat , where the representative merely repeats endlessly that they are sorry , and that they will rebook for the next_day , etc .
Package_Service	the next_day comes and goes and you have waited indoors in silence for another 00_hours for a courier that has not appeared .
Package_Service	you connect with live_chat and are told ... to rebook and wait in again tomorrow .
Package_Service	push for a more acceptable solution and you will likely be told that the service is not guaranteed ( even days after the agreed collection date ) and that if you want to rebook using a ( more reliable ) different p0go courier , you will have to pay for any difference in price !
Package_Service	all of this endless , frustrating live_chat can take an_hour or so .
Package_Service	alternatively , you can ring the p0go ‘ help line ’.
Package_Service	unfortunately , it is a premium_rate service , costing you a whacking 00p_per min , and much more from mobiles .
Package_Service	that said , the main problem with using parcel0go is this : where you deal with a courier direct ( rather_than agents like p0go ) you can speak with its staff and have them update you on delivery or even location of your parcel .
Package_Service	parcel0go staffs refuse to do this , claiming that all they can do is e . mail the courier you have booked through the p0go website .
Package_Service	it is hopeless !
Package_Service	you never find out where your parcel is , or why it has_been delayed .
Package_Service	all they will tell you is to wait indoors , sometimes day after day , and hope !
Package_Service	back in jan 00 , i sent a parcel to an address in england .
Package_Service	delivery took 0 weeks !
Package_Service	during this period , both the receiver and i spent innumerable , maddening hours on the p0go live_chat and not once did its staff actually tell us why the parcel was delayed or even where it was .
Package_Service	all we were told , again and again , was that the p0go staff could not telephone couriers , only e . mail and wait for a reply ... and wait ... and wait ... and wait ...
Package_Service	parcel0go ; the service that is great when it works and absolutely teeth - grindingly infuriating when it doesn ’ t .
Package_Service	i was very glad to be able to drop my parcel off at a collection point so i did not have to wait in at home .
Package_Service	it was delivered safely the other end and the price for such a good service was the lowest around .
Package_Service	i have recommended it to everyone i know .
Package_Service	needed help with my parcel today , catherine fully assisted me all the way .
Package_Service	great customer service !
Package_Service	definitely recommend and will be back , many_thanks parcels 0 go and catherine_corless :)
Package_Service	i contacted your live_chat today and was lucky_enough to get catherine_corless she was a great help made the experience very pain_free and upmost ease .
Package_Service	she is a credit to your team .
Package_Service	great service mostly done on line but did need to contact customer_services about collection , my query was answered very much to my satisfaction
Package_Service	really easy to use , my first time organising a parcel collection and delivery by the net .
Package_Service	step by step guidance , range of choices , low_prices to compare between carriers and their options , something to bear in mind with christmas coming up .
Package_Service	customer service ( peter_chandler ) was superb too .
Package_Service	could not fault as delivery was made next_day !
Package_Service	saves time too having to call up or go to the post_office
Package_Service	emily was fantastic in helping me solve my issue .
Package_Service	another reason_why i will_continue to use parcel0go .
Package_Service	firts class .
Package_Service	great to have live_chat support , helped_me no end thanks
Package_Service	made a mistake and put my own name back in on destination address der !
Package_Service	got in touch with p0go via there chat function , spoke to a agent called rose she was fabulous sorted problem out super_fast and was friendly and did not make feel stupid ( which is debateable ) xmassed out !!!
Package_Service	thankyou rose
Package_Service	i am using them for the first time and am highly dissatisfied .
Package_Service	they have my phone number but didn_'_t make a courtesy_call to say they were failing to make a collection .
Package_Service	so once again we are making arrangements to be present all day .
Package_Service	i think it '_s galling to then have to pay premium rates to ask about your failed collection and then told to hold .
Package_Service	i think it '_s bad to be told that there '_s no compensation for failed collection which provides carte blanche for indefinite delays .
Package_Service	i am reading here about people waiting over a week for their collection .
Package_Service	how much bad_press can this company take here before they review their practices ?
Package_Service	natalie was an extremely_helpful , kind and patient advisor , who saved me money and time in the most pleasant manner !
Package_Service	thank_you natalie and because of you i will use this service again . it is cheap , quick and easy .
Package_Service	i first used interparcel to send relatively fragile packages to denmark about two years_ago .
Package_Service	their uk service was excellent as was their european network partner .
Package_Service	i have now used them for the third time in a month to send packages to uk destinations via ups ; i was a bit_concerned when the 00 : 00 " end of day " slot passed the first time but the package was collected at 00 : 00 .
Package_Service	the second time it was collected at 00 : 00 and today it was collected at 00 : 00 .
Package_Service	i believe our close proximity to j00 of the m0 made us " one of the last pickups " and also , the traffic is busy at this time of day so i am quite happy with this situation .
Package_Service	each time the driver has_been very polite and professional and my package recipients have been very complimentary about the arrival condition of the package and the speed with which it was delivered .
Package_Service	easy efficient booking procedure backed_up by on - time service !
Package_Service	needed a parcel picked_up urgently - catherine came on line and offered to help , she was very helpful and efficient - just waiting to courier to come .
Package_Service	the on line chat and help service is highly_recommended , especially if all the staff are as helpful and efficient as catherine .
Package_Service	thank_you helen punchard in norfolk
Package_Service	i had an excellent experience shipping through parcel0go .
Package_Service	it was the first time i had needed to ship a heavy yet fragile item internationally , and i was , frankly , dreading the process .
Package_Service	however i came_across the parcel0go website , and using their process made everything really easy .
Package_Service	i was able to view all of the pricing and delivery options in one list , with full explanations of the terms and services .
Package_Service	i chose my service , paid and printed_off the labels , and the package was picked_up by the courier the on the same day !
Package_Service	the parcel was delivered quickly and my item remained intact .
Package_Service	i will_definitely be using this site for any future international shipments i need to make .
Package_Service	it was an added_bonus to receive friendly emails from peter_chandler of parcel0go , following up on my experiences while using the service .
Package_Service	garbage avoid like the plague parcel with printed label to glasgow ends up in kilmarnock was sent 00st_dec_0000 now 00th_jan_0000 have paid another company to pick it up and re deliver had to re - book it twice also no contact number only a chat line with a lot of idiots running it do yourself and your money a favour use the good old post_office might be slightly more_expensive but at_least they deliver on time 0 . 0 out of ten get a grip trustpilot
Package_Service	just look down the page
Package_Service	great service !
Package_Service	had a problem where i entered the wrong detail and required a refund used the live_chat to see if i can resolve this with a refund and was connected to rowan who was very helpful and refunded immediately and gave me a choice of either refunding back to card or as credit !
Package_Service	really helpful and only took less_than 0 min to solve !
Package_Service	catherine the great was very very helpfull today with my parcel to malta
Package_Service	she made it nice and easy and stress_free for me
Package_Service	pleasure to deal with
Package_Service	thank_you so much
Package_Service	wayne kelly
Package_Service	we have had a few problems with deliveries with interparcel but have to say it '_s not interparcel them self '_s but one of the company '_s they used which was yodel out of 00 bikes delivered one was damaged badly one has_been lost altogether and about 0 of the cartons was damaged when our customs received them .
Package_Service	i have noticed that yodel are no_longer an option with interparcel so it seems that they must of had a lot of complaints for interparcel not to be using them any more which is a good thing .
Package_Service	i now use city_link through interparcel and am getting a better service and the driver that collects form me is very good and takes care with the parcels and i have had no_complaints from my customers with the condition they arrive in
Package_Service	this was my very first experience with a courier , i had no_idea what to do or expect .

Package_Service	their tracking says they have attempted to deliver twice .
Package_Service	but that is not true .
Package_Service	the recipient has not had any visit .

Package_Service	no one knows where parcel is .
Package_Service	i have contacted parcel0go 0 times .
Package_Service	on each_occasion they have promised to get back to me ; on each_occasion no one has .
