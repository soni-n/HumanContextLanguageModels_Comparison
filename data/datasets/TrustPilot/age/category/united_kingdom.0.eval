Fashion_Accessories	i do regularly purchase items of clothing or music from chemical_records and i have yet to be disappointed by their service .
Fashion_Accessories	as ever , items are always dispatched promptly and their prices are always competitive .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	i could not fault julesb one bit , firstly on price , keeping me up to date on the location of my package and then the presentation of my goods .
Fashion_Accessories	already_recommended julesb to two friends .
Fashion_Accessories	will always use julesb over other stocklists all because of the ease of this transaction .
Fashion_Accessories	a refreshing_change with online shopping .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic friendly helpful service , not to mention the ' ahead of trend ' range of sunnies !
Fashion_Accessories	fast deliveies and a even better after care service ....
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m a returning customer time and time again ... wouldn ' t go anywhere_else !
Fashion_Accessories	red_hot are arguably the best dealership online !
Fashion_Accessories	ordered on saturday and got in on tuesday .
Fashion_Accessories	hadn ' t heard of the company before but received a 00_%_off discount_code from vodafone so decided to give it a go .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic range of products to choose from , extremely reasonable prices , fast and free next_day delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	just cannot find anything negative about the service .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely use the company again , as_opposed to the big high_street ones !
Fashion_Accessories	simply the best company i have used
Fashion_Accessories	yesstyle is a great company , everything always comes fast with no trouble !
Fashion_Accessories	ordering is great , and the clothes are super cute .
Fashion_Accessories	love yesstyle !
Fashion_Accessories	i always order from them !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	where most websites have just your bog_standard range of sunglasses , this site takes it up to a new level , with a massive_range of styles .
Fashion_Accessories	i used shop by style to find the perfect pair of persol clubmasters .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll be doing all my eyewear shopping here from now on .
Fashion_Accessories	lily dressed in her " where ' s wenda " outfit made us all giggle and she wants to wear it all the time now .
Fashion_Accessories	may have a professional comedian in training .
Fashion_Accessories	the quality was reasonable and delivery arrived the next_day after ordering .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic service , glasses are at great value and was very easy to order .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m usually skeptical_about buying clothes online since i ' ve have problems with many sites but yesstyle is one of the few i ' d say is pretty good .
Fashion_Accessories	the clothes are very attractive and there is a really big selection of styles .
Fashion_Accessories	the website itself is very easy to browse and its easy to find what you ' re looking for .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery is super_quick , especially if you choose clothes that ' ship within 0 - 0 days '.
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered on sunday_night and it arrived today -- rather quick for clothes that are imported !
Fashion_Accessories	all the shirts and jumper fitted_perfectly and i will_definitely use this service again .
Fashion_Accessories	my only gripes with the site is that the delivery is quite expensive , but understandably so since the clothes are imported from asia .
Fashion_Accessories	i think its best to order lots of clothes at once so that the delivery fee is worth it .
Fashion_Accessories	plus , you get can free delivery if you order enough .
Fashion_Accessories	another problem is that many of the clothes are one - size only , and mostly suit to a medium to petite frame .
Fashion_Accessories	they don ' t seem to really cater to anyone who is a uk size 00 and above , much to the disappointment of some my friends .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of long_distance new wayfare glasses which arrived 0 days of the dispatch date and in total 00 days from order date .
Fashion_Accessories	the online order progress keeps you informed every_step of the glasses pathway .
Fashion_Accessories	not a scratch on the lenses and no_problems with my perscription .
Fashion_Accessories	couldn ' t find a better price online .
Fashion_Accessories	my one regret , not selectspecs fault , is that i did not look in the shops at what i was buying online .
Fashion_Accessories	if i did i would have chosen the colour havanah instead of dark havanah .
Fashion_Accessories	my fault entirely so guess the motto is try before you buy .
Fashion_Accessories	i really rate these_guys - its very rare that i shop on line and get the feeling like 0 .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m dealing_with human beings and 0 . they care about the customer and are not after a quick buck .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely shop with these_guys again and i highly_recommend their services to anyone and on top of all this they have great stock which just shows me they know what they are doing .
Fashion_Accessories	what you see is what you get , just 00 times better with a great service .
Fashion_Accessories	i found the site very easy to use , especially the pay_pal option which made checkout very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	website and order process was easy to navigate .
Fashion_Accessories	i called the customer_service team to check on delivery dates , there was no waiting on hold and efficient service .
Fashion_Accessories	i have bought 0 products now from selectspecs . com and i have been very pleased with each product .
Fashion_Accessories	perscription glasses for £ 0 each !
Fashion_Accessories	and i think that included delievery .
Fashion_Accessories	very good product range and great prices .
Fashion_Accessories	gutted i didn ' t find the site sooner !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	very fast delivery and easy to navigate through the website !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	had problems with an interface i purchased from here a few_years_ago .
Fashion_Accessories	the company just did not want to assist me in the matter .
Fashion_Accessories	luckily i found out later i just needed a driver update .
Fashion_Accessories	recently i purchased an active subwoofer from them .
Fashion_Accessories	the item became_faulty on its fourth use but i did not diagnose the problem to the unit until a few weeks_later .
Fashion_Accessories	from my first contact with them regarding the issue it took them 0 weeks to replace the faulty unit , plus i had to contact the manufacturer to arrange the warranty cover myself !!
Fashion_Accessories	( this should be their job )
Fashion_Accessories	i did offer for them to credit note me as i wanted some more_expensive items as an_alternative but they refused !
Fashion_Accessories	terrible service , incredibily difficult to get hold of there person in charge of service department ( sam ) and all_round bad_experience !
Fashion_Accessories	i will not be using them ever again and will make_sure all the contacts i know who also buy dj & sound equipment know to avoid this company .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered my new headphones around lunchtime , and was using them less_than 00hours later .
Fashion_Accessories	good price , speedy service , and received updates via_email on progress of my order .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely_recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	title_says it all - i would recommend red_hot sunglasses to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	at first i wasn ' t totally convinced how good a service i would get given that this company operates 000_% online , but after seeing how cheap their prices were i decided to make an enquiry and after_speaking with one of the team ( luke , who called within 00_minutes of the online enquiry ), i was comfortable in placing my order .
Fashion_Accessories	they delivered the ring on the exact date they had estimated and it was perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	from your initial order up until delivery , these_guys keep you up to date with progress by sending an e_- mail every 0 - 0 days with a progress report .
Fashion_Accessories	i ended_up being one of the unlucky one ' s and had to return my ring for a refund , which was also dealt_with swiftly and incredibly well .
Fashion_Accessories	if you have any reservations in using this company please let me tell you that you will be looked after throughout the whole_process .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect service , perfect quality and perfect_timing !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a pair of stella mccartney sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	i saw them in a magazine and couldn ' t find them anywhere in the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	my pal reccommended red_hot and they had all the latest ranges .
Fashion_Accessories	i got my sunnys and another pair at a really great price .
Fashion_Accessories	it was really easy to order them and i got them earlier_than i expected .
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t wait for the sun to shine so i can get an excuse to buy more .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks red_hot .
Fashion_Accessories	great selection of glasses - i ordered 0 pairs of vivienne westwood glasses , they were excellent value .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service team were quick to reply to my questions .
Fashion_Accessories	sono rimasta molto colpita da sunglasses_shop .
Fashion_Accessories	il catalogo è vastissimo e comprende tutti gli occhiali più belli e alla moda .
Fashion_Accessories	i prezzi sono i migliori che si possano trovare sul web e la spedizione è velocissima , con un ' ottima cura nel packaging .
Fashion_Accessories	sicuramente acquisterò ancora su sunglasses_shop !
Fashion_Accessories	grazie , sono molto soddisfatta !
Fashion_Accessories	having bought a voucher for sunglasses_shop (£ 00 for £_00 to spend ), i first looked offline to find and try on a selection of sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	going back to the website , finding those sunglasses was super easy and they had everything i saw in the shop .
Fashion_Accessories	the order process was very straightforward and delivery extremely speedy , with safe packaging .
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend this shop for anybody who prefers to ' look offline , buy online '.
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m a regular customer at red_hot sunglasses and they have never once let me down .
Fashion_Accessories	in comparison to competitors their range is 0nd to none , the pricing is always the most competitive and most_importantly the service is spot on .
Fashion_Accessories	having had poor experiences with online_retailers in the past , these_guys really know their stuff and are on top of their game .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	overall an excelent company in all departments , fast processsing and delivery of all their goods , even to the channel_islands .
Fashion_Accessories	all products are competitively_priced and i ' ve never_experienced customer_services better from any other company !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought some shorts for a birthday_present for my dad and it didnt come in the waxx tin or with a keyring which i have recieved with all the other purchases that have been made by my family .
Fashion_Accessories	been ordering from chemuk for many years now , always been steller service .
Fashion_Accessories	always worth checking the sales out for a cheeky tshirt or some accessories for the missis .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve wanted some brushes from crownbrush for a while and when there was a 00_%_off code i thought it would be rude not to !
Fashion_Accessories	i am really pleased with the brushes i bought ( all eyes on you set ) as they are such good quality , especially for the price .
Fashion_Accessories	the best brushes i ' ve ever owned !
Fashion_Accessories	i also bought the blusher palette which was a lot bigger than i was expecting it to be which was a bonus .
Fashion_Accessories	the colours are lovely , very natural and pretty palette .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve recommended to many friends already and i will be buying christmas_presents for friends and family also .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you crownbrush *****
Fashion_Accessories	would highly_recommend them and would use again .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a dress but was too small so i sent it back and my refund was paid back very quickly and with no hassle .
Fashion_Accessories	i initially called up webtogs to get some advice and spoke to a really friendly woman with encylopedic knowledge of walking boots .
Fashion_Accessories	her enthusiasm and expertise really impressed me and her advice was spot on .
Fashion_Accessories	i literally cannot_fault webtogs , their website looks great , their service is second to none and their after sales process for requesting product and service reviews are slick and professional .
Fashion_Accessories	and the boots i bought were less_than half the price i would have had to pay at home in denmark .
Fashion_Accessories	if only all webshops were more like webtogs !
Fashion_Accessories	i was originally looking for a wedding_ring i searched the internet as i was could not find the ring i wanted in any of the high_street / shops .
Fashion_Accessories	i found the diamondgeezer . com website through google , which had just the ring i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	i was sceptical at first because of the website name but then found out the owner of the company has featured in an episode of dragon ’_s den , which gave me all the reassurance i needed .
Fashion_Accessories	the website has a very useful_tool to check the progress of your order .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately , i received the wrong ring at first but the customer_service was quick to fix their mistake .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring itself looks great just as i expected .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service is unbelievably good .
Fashion_Accessories	clive was the most helpful and polite person i have ever had the chance to speak .
Fashion_Accessories	mega_fancy_dress offered a wide_range of fancy_dress costumes of all sizes which was important for my needs as i required a larger costumer to dress at stag up for his stag_party .
Fashion_Accessories	the service , through ebay , was good , payment was very easy and delivery prompted .
Fashion_Accessories	my only small criticism , if i were to have one , was that the prices were a little higher_than other fancy_dress shops but the quality of the out fit was of a higher standard .
Fashion_Accessories	overall a great service .
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant website found it super easy to find the exact sunglasses both me and my hubby were after .
Fashion_Accessories	great service and speedy_delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	i came_across webtogs whilst searching for the best price on a the northface base_camp bag for the gym .
Fashion_Accessories	they were the cheapest price i could find at the time and even had a 00 %- off promotional period , so the price was cheaper_than i had seen .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve used the company twice since , getting some argyll boots and a the northface jacket .
Fashion_Accessories	all items were shipped fast .
Fashion_Accessories	everything from this company arrives very fast & their products are always of the highest_quality .
Fashion_Accessories	i had to return something once = even that was a pleasure as it was dealt_with fast & easy unlike a lot of web companies these days , webtogs take pride in their great service .
Fashion_Accessories	their prices are also very competitive & usually are the cheapest around also which always helps .
Fashion_Accessories	i have used them now a few_times & can highly_recommend them in all ways from ordering to delivery to returns if needs be .
Fashion_Accessories	top_marks all_round .
Fashion_Accessories	!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	great product , been looking for something like this for a while , and the designs are ace !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of raybans , came on time with great customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	would recommend this website to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a leather restorer spray to treat my holdall and it was exactly_what was needed .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was fast as always and i will_continue to buy from the store .
Fashion_Accessories	i can always trust that webtogs will not only have the gear i want at a competitive price , but will also provide a first_class customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	bought an engagement_ring from diamondgeezer . com amazing ring fantastic price .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve been shopping in divine_trash for years the staff are always friendly , helpfull , and full of advice their products are bang on trend and very good value for money never disappointed x
Fashion_Accessories	excellent website , easy to navigate .
Fashion_Accessories	very useful product info , videos and reviews .
Fashion_Accessories	goods arrived next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	all in all , brilliant service , thank_you webtogs !
Fashion_Accessories	a great website with all the info you need .
Fashion_Accessories	i found it cheaper_than anywhere_else and the service was so quick .
Fashion_Accessories	really happy and i will use again when i find something that i want .
Fashion_Accessories	i stupidly lost my first pair of ray - ban wayfarers on holiday in ibiza ( after only four days of owning them ).
Fashion_Accessories	needless to say i was absolutely gutted and annoyed at the fact i ' d have to shell out another £_000 to replace them .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided to search the net to see if i could buy them any cheaper_than the full price i had initially spent in - store .
Fashion_Accessories	after doing a quick google_search , i stumbled_across sunglassesshop . com .
Fashion_Accessories	i was amazed at how much lower the prices were here than in the shops .
Fashion_Accessories	i was a bit_dubious at first , but having read a few reviews and researching the site a little , i quickly realised i had nothing to worry_about !
Fashion_Accessories	i placed my order ( using a 00_%_off discount_code that i found on the google sponsored ad ) and bought a pair of black ray - ban wayfarers for £_00 , plus free next_day delivery !!
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely amazing service and amazing price , i have recommended to all of my friends and will_definitely be using this site again .
Fashion_Accessories	( hopefully i won ' t lose this pair after four days though ...)
Fashion_Accessories	on my first order i had some questions about the product i was interested in : the staff emailed me back within a few hours with all the info i needed and explained their return_policy in detail in case i wanted to change my mind after receiving my order .
Fashion_Accessories	i was so impressed that even_though what i wanted was available for a slightly lower_price elsewhere i didn ' t mind paying webtogs a few extra quid !
Fashion_Accessories	also , they were still_awaiting new stock at the moment i placed my order , so they gave me an expected delivery time of about three_weeks - as it turned_out , the parcel arrived only six days_later ... and there was no need to return it !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll definitely order from them again and will recommend to anyone look to buy outdoor_gear .
Fashion_Accessories	just received my hugo boss prescription_sunglasses and i think its like a dream_come true , suit perfect on my face and the best quality i ever had in my life .. thanks select_specs !!!
Fashion_Accessories	i will surely ship for more ...
Fashion_Accessories	i want to mention the excellent and prompt service , as well as james , alina and christina for their attention , care and professionalism !
Fashion_Accessories	i highly_recommend !
Fashion_Accessories	good luck to all of you , my friends !
Fashion_Accessories	good morning . i write to you from baku , azerbaijan .
Fashion_Accessories	i want to thank_you for the excellent service .
Fashion_Accessories	your customer_service ( sheila , mary ) is very prompt and very helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	shipping is very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you .
Fashion_Accessories	sincerely ,

Fashion_Accessories	bought a brush set for my girlfriend for her_birthday .
Fashion_Accessories	she was over the moon and said it was the best collection of makeup brushes she has owned .
Fashion_Accessories	would recommend !
Fashion_Accessories	my order arrived extremely quickly , far faster_than_expected !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i recieced email_updates_throughout the process and was kept up to date with when they were dispatched and delivered .
Fashion_Accessories	really pleased with my purchase as i ' ve been looking for some replacement running glasses for months !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks for a really efficient service , highly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definately_recommend these_guys !
Fashion_Accessories	they make beautiful quality rings , they were helpful and friendly from the begining and fast with their service and feedback !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought my girlfriends engagement_ring from these_guys and will be buying our_wedding_rings here too !
Fashion_Accessories	purely_because of such an excellent service !
Fashion_Accessories	got my items on time no problem .
Fashion_Accessories	however , disappointed on how it was packaged , i ordered a pair of hunter boots and two_pairs of hunter socks which were squashed into the box , few scuff marks on the boots which came off thankfully .
Fashion_Accessories	other than that service was very good .
Fashion_Accessories	______________________________________________________________
Fashion_Accessories	update_: few_days ago i received a phone call from country house outdoors to say they read my review , asked if my item are okay and i am able to send the boots back from a new pair if damaged , as stated the marks did come off with a little_bit of rubbing the other items were fine .
Fashion_Accessories	they did compensate with a £_00 off voucher , which was a pleasant_surprise as its very rare for a company to even offer anything .
Fashion_Accessories	again very pleased with the service , would recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	added two extra stars for the after care event .
Fashion_Accessories	i have a great fondness for crownbrush !
Fashion_Accessories	they provide good quality , cheap brushes that i can ' t really fault .
Fashion_Accessories	the only issue i ever find with crownbrush is the size of the brush is difficult to guess in photos , unfortunately a couple times brushes have been larger than i anticipated .
Fashion_Accessories	however the quality can not be_faulted and even_though i have purchased brushes like the ' bk00 white taklon square ' and the ' c000 angle contouring ' which i thought would be smaller , i still was able to use them in the way i wanted and get great results !
Fashion_Accessories	my favourite brush so far has to be the ' c000 pro dome blender ' as it does a great job of softening any harsh lines and bringing your make up together in a natural finish !
Fashion_Accessories	definitely worth up and above the cost !
Fashion_Accessories	these brushes are a great investment and everytime there is a sale i buy myself a whole set of great new brushes !
Fashion_Accessories	i brought a pair of ray_bans at 00 : 00 and they arrived by 00 : 00 the next_day , fast brilliant service , very helpful , will be shopping here again .
Fashion_Accessories	apart_from holidays bought from very well_known holiday companies this is easily the biggest single purchase i have ever made over the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	it was an_eternity_ring , bought as a surprise for my 00th wedding_anniversary .
Fashion_Accessories	i have to confess the last piece of jewellery i bought without any input from my wife was the engagement_ring , 00 years_ago .
Fashion_Accessories	i knew nothing about the 0 cs or purchasing diamonds .
Fashion_Accessories	my starting point was jewellery_shops , both high_street and independent , there were many fine looking rings but i just wasn ' t sure i was getting the biggest choice so i turned to the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	i spent months researching all online jewellery companies but i kept returning to purely_diamonds .
Fashion_Accessories	it certainly helps that the website has a very professional look , unlike some of their competitors , it was also extremely_helpful on education .
Fashion_Accessories	i was able to use their tools to work out my wife ' s ring size and the pictures and animations of the rings were really helpful for look .
Fashion_Accessories	i settled on a design and size and made my selection and order on the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	it was then the nerves set in , had i done the right thing , i decided to email the company .
Fashion_Accessories	i was emailed straight back by stephanie and from then on she was able to put my mind at ease .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring was delivered as promised .
Fashion_Accessories	it looked amazing to me but the true test was giving it to my wife .
Fashion_Accessories	she was delighted and despite the fact it has been on her finger for 0 days now she still can ' t stop looking at it .
Fashion_Accessories	i am more_than satisfied that i received great service and the ring is more_than value for money .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend purely_diamonds to anyone !
Fashion_Accessories	i have posted this through my wife ' s fb account as i don ' t have one .
Fashion_Accessories	is great do business with you people
Fashion_Accessories	after possibly the worst online shopping_experience ever - no thanks to miragerecords0000 , chemical_records restored my faith .
Fashion_Accessories	my purchase with m0000records was for a pack of ' rock on wall ' vinyl frames , which i paid extra delivery for also , after them not arriving and not 0 single reply to my numerous polite emails , i finally spoke to dave who told me in so many words to do0 , this all without my order arriving .
Fashion_Accessories	in the meantime , i thought all was lost but one more try to get them as the ones in john_lewis werent quite as nice , and tadaathere was chemical_records !
Fashion_Accessories	i called them ob the website listed number for assistance first to ensure they were real and if would take order over phone after what happened above , this wasnt possible but they were friendly and provided reassurance that this purchase would be as hassle_free as you ' d expect it to be , and that it was !
Fashion_Accessories	website clear about shipping and delivery dates , which were exact my order arrived on time and in great condition .
Fashion_Accessories	to be fair , im probably a lil over excited at chemical_records right now , as had such a poop time with miragerecords0000 , but either way top score for a top store !
Fashion_Accessories	thank youuuuu , x
Fashion_Accessories	purchased a teeshirt monday , got it tuesday .
Fashion_Accessories	what more can you ask !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve been using this website for a while now and i love it .
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t find anything wrong with my purchase here .
Fashion_Accessories	i had all the info i needed and emails covering every_stage of the process .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d definitely_recommend them !
Fashion_Accessories	my husband bought me an_eternity_ring for christmas and it ' s stunning .
Fashion_Accessories	i emailed purely_diamonds a couple of times in the hope of it being delivered before_christmas and they were very helpful and i did receive it the week before_christmas .
Fashion_Accessories	the packaging was lovely and made it feel very special .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely_recommend purely_diamonds to others .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you for a gorgeous ring !
Fashion_Accessories	bought a pair of limited_edition ray - bans from this site , was the only one i could find that stocked them in a full colour range
Fashion_Accessories	got them for my 0 month trek around the world and bought them last_minute but as promised they turned_up the next_day in a neat little package .
Fashion_Accessories	good service , easily contactable customer_service and a good price .
Fashion_Accessories	sweet as
Fashion_Accessories	great website with loads of choice .
Fashion_Accessories	bought some carreras which got delivered really quick .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent customer_service - their team managed to get my wife ' s engagement_ring in_advance of when i needed it and made sure i had everything i needed before whisking her away to propose .
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t praise them higher .
Fashion_Accessories	i contacted the company to see if they would pricematch with a price i had seen elsewhere and immediately they did .
Fashion_Accessories	they were prompt at responding to emails , and within a couple of days my order arrived .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service throughout
Fashion_Accessories	really awesome style .
Fashion_Accessories	even if you are not buying you can always look through their blogs on styling tips and learn simple yet effective everyday styles .
Fashion_Accessories	i can scroll on hours for fashion wear , they vary and range from low to high prices so , it really is for everyone from any background .
Fashion_Accessories	even if you are not buying you can get a good sense and styling knowledge .
Fashion_Accessories	order was dealt professionally , i had an issue with it , but they communicated effectively and was sorted out easily .
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t say anymore
Fashion_Accessories	just perfect
Fashion_Accessories	responded extremely quickly to emails and fantastic customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	great for a first time buyer needing some answers regarding which sunglasses would be best and they are reasonably_priced , highly_recommend to anyone !
Fashion_Accessories	i wrote about this on my blog , a full rave review sharing how incredible this was .
Fashion_Accessories	my opinions on this brand where so high numerous people have already ordered products by the brand .
Fashion_Accessories	psychedelic prints and outstandingly comfortable ...
Fashion_Accessories	they get me ready for the weekend ;)
Fashion_Accessories	xxxxxxxx liz xxxxxxxxxx
Fashion_Accessories	the live_chat help provided by diamond_geezer was invaluable when choosing a ring to propose with .
Fashion_Accessories	my wife was delighted with the results and they took all the comments i had got from her to come up with the correct design .
Fashion_Accessories	prices were very fair too .
Fashion_Accessories	even once the sale had been made and money paid service remained good when we had to get the ring resized .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy and recommended to other friends on the cusp of proposal ...
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service / price / delivery - minor problem with one pair immediately resolved by supplying full replacement pair
Fashion_Accessories	was a bit_sceptical at first due to gimmicky name but was no need , communication from placement of order was great .
Fashion_Accessories	good price .
Fashion_Accessories	very professional .
Fashion_Accessories	worked to meet tight deadline .
Fashion_Accessories	beautiful ring .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d recommend riverside garden_centre without a doubt ; they are very competitively_priced , delivery was punctual and well communicated and the bbq is great .
Fashion_Accessories	i have purchased from here before normally o . k , but the last pair were so shoddy it was like they were made by a child in primary school , they did not fit as the arms were at different angles and the actual frame work around the lens was twisted .
Fashion_Accessories	well i suppose it ' s workmanship for the money .
Fashion_Accessories	there is no ability to talk with customer_service over the phone so i will take my loss and go somewhere_else , 0 positive is that it was delivered quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	as a professional makeup artist i am always looking for quality products and regularly purchase from crown .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery is always fast too which is a bonus !
Fashion_Accessories	the 0pc hd set is amazing , each brush feels so luxurious on the skin and am considering purchasing another set for my kit .
Fashion_Accessories	another of my favourites is the b00 angle blush brush , it also feels soft and luxurious whilst still being dense enough to apply colour evenly and is great for contouring !
Fashion_Accessories	i always recommend crown to my friends as they have the same quality as high end brands without the hefty price_tag !
Fashion_Accessories	well_done crown , keep up the good work !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	order process was simple , price was good and delivery was fast & without any_issues .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d have no_hesitation recommending chemicaluk . com to anybody and i ' ll be using them again .
Fashion_Accessories	sgs service : 0 *

Fashion_Accessories	this is not a dig at sunglassesshop , as i ' m sure the product i bought was likely pre_- packaged and redistributed , however i had to carefully remove both lenses and remove multiple pieces of white packaging that was stuck between the frame and glass .
Fashion_Accessories	there is no way this got in there after the lenses had been fitted , as one piece was poking out on both_sides of the lense !
Fashion_Accessories	product : dirty dog dozer sunglasses ( gunmetal / green , polarised ).
Fashion_Accessories	i have added a 0 star_rating for sgs , as the faux pas was not with them , but with the product manufacturer .
Fashion_Accessories	a very easy and efficient website to use with good search and navigation .
Fashion_Accessories	lens and bridge sizes are featured which is very useful and quite_often missing on other_sites .
Fashion_Accessories	fairly detailed product descriptions and relatively low free delivery threshold .
Fashion_Accessories	so , overall i would re - visit and recommend sunglasses - shop . co . uk .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s one of my fav ........ site nt only me bt most of the people thats why definetly it have to get five_stars :) the clothes are so fashionable , cute n comfort and the price is decent lop it < 0 ..... yesstyle is doing awesome job
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely amazing products , super cool and super comfy .
Fashion_Accessories	service from waxx has been top_notch , quick to reply to any_questions or problems .
Fashion_Accessories	however , there is 0 tiny little thing you could do to improve to being absolutely perfect .. change your delivery company , i haven ' t had any_problems with them personally , but i think £ 0 is a bit_steep for the time it takes .
Fashion_Accessories	maybe royal_mail 0st_class ..
Fashion_Accessories	there ' s nothing like next_day delivery !
Fashion_Accessories	but that ' s just me being picky and impatient .
Fashion_Accessories	other than that , keep up the amazing work guys !!
Fashion_Accessories	:)
Fashion_Accessories	i can not fault the experience i had with diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	we were nervous_about buying an engagement_ring online but i needn ' t have worried .
Fashion_Accessories	we got a fabulous ring that was everything i could have dreamed of for a fraction of the cost .
Fashion_Accessories	we certainly got a value for money and a much bigger and better diamond than we would have got on the high_street for the budget we had .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend this company highly .
Fashion_Accessories	i am so glad that i found riverside garden_centre ' s website as they have great deals on weber products .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a 00 ' one - touch grill with accessories cheaper_than the standalone price of the same product on amazon and john_lewis .
Fashion_Accessories	definitely recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	good service and reasonable_price !
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant service !
Fashion_Accessories	perfect_condition and very quick delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	will_definitely use again .
Fashion_Accessories	i placed my order and the joules jumper arrived the next working day .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service , the best price around , great all_round , i ' m really pleased .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent value and super_fast delivery even during the xmas postage frenzy .
Fashion_Accessories	high_quality costume for the price .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent communication about delivery and shipping .
Fashion_Accessories	my product was delivered as_described and they delivered my product within the timeframe specified .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended and i would definitely order from them again .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a pair of matte black polarised ray - ban wayfarers and i had a slight_issue in terms of delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	i changed my day of delivery to the next_day and unfortunately , dpd , managed to send my sunglasses back to the main depot instead of the local_depot meaning i had to wait an extra day for my sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	red_hot sunglasses were brilliant and their customer_service was second to none and made sure i received my sunglasses and gave me an explanation as to what had happened .
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend this company as the delivery issue was no fault of their own but they still did as best as they could to offer their support and chase up the issue as quickly as possible .
Fashion_Accessories	great company , great customer_service and thoroughly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks my engagement_ring is perfect !!
Fashion_Accessories	would never have got what i wanted for this price on the high_street !
Fashion_Accessories	the order process was easy and i was kept_updated all the way !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	my dress is what i believed it should look like .
Fashion_Accessories	it made me feel great and sexy .
Fashion_Accessories	i have worn it to a wedding and a cocktail party and it worked well in both events .
Fashion_Accessories	i will be back to buy more and have shown your wed site to many others encluding brides and mother of the brides .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks shopindream for your quality , reliability .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s the only place to go for your fashion fix : with top end quality brands , competitive_pricing and a 0 star customer_service experience .
Fashion_Accessories	ever helpful , suggestive and excessively friendly , the staff make the trip to the beautifully stylish store an exciting place to visit in a majority online shopping world .
Fashion_Accessories	the variety gives everyone a selection and suits all shaped and sizes .
Fashion_Accessories	not only do they have crazy amazing sales but they promote them through all social_media .
Fashion_Accessories	i also love that they take the time to video catwalks of how they would style key items .
Fashion_Accessories	divine_trash is dominating a declining high_street and makes the town worth the visit .
Fashion_Accessories	the pair of sunglasses i wanted were out of stock so i emailed them and got a quick reply telling_me when they expected a delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	when the delivery came in there was only 0 sets but they emailed again to tell me so i could go and order them straight_away so i didnt miss out .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was quick and on time .
Fashion_Accessories	very good company !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !

Fashion_Accessories	goods were as_described .
Fashion_Accessories	you should see are baby in her outfit she looks amazing :)
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely awful !
Fashion_Accessories	ordered glasses seemingly successfully only to be told a couple of days_later that the frames were discontinued .
Fashion_Accessories	so i contact customer_services and select another frame .

Fashion_Accessories	those frames are also discontinued .
Fashion_Accessories	i then gave up , got my money back and went elsewhere .

Fashion_Accessories	0 * s in my opinion
Fashion_Accessories	not a single glitch when buying an engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	i was kept fully up to date with the progress .
Fashion_Accessories	they were happy to delay delivery so that the ring wouldn ' t arrive when the missus was at home .
Fashion_Accessories	the service and product are both first_class !
Fashion_Accessories	my wife loves her solitaire engagement_ring which would have been at_least twice the price from a national high_street jeweller .
Fashion_Accessories	there is no need to worry_about ordering online as everything is 000_% genuine and trustworthy - i did have some intrepidations beforehand .
Fashion_Accessories	i have had the ring independantly valued at beav ******* ks when we took it in to get cleaned prior to the wedding and they commented how nice the ring was and asked where i got it from .
Fashion_Accessories	comes with certification .
Fashion_Accessories	i have recommended it to friends already !

Fashion_Accessories	the quality is also perfect , my wedding_ring bought elsewhere as we were given some vouchers has alreadt had to be redipped after only a year , my engagement_ring however , from diamondgeezer is still perfect x
Fashion_Accessories	i could say a lot about webtogs , but i really want you to go and explore for yourselves .
Fashion_Accessories	you won ' t regret it for a second ...
Fashion_Accessories	great products and advice at every_stage of your online journey .
Fashion_Accessories	personal service delivered with care and attention .
Fashion_Accessories	swift delivery and great after - care .
Fashion_Accessories	the list_goes on ...
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs has provided one of my best online shopping experiences , and like many of the other_reviewers here , i will use them again and again .
Fashion_Accessories	customer_service is so important nowadays , but often forgotten by many .
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs has got it right on the money and is leading the way .
Fashion_Accessories	arrived within 00_hours with the cheapest of the shipping options .
Fashion_Accessories	product was really well_priced and i would definitely buy from here again .
Fashion_Accessories	got a custom wedding_ring for my partner half price of high_street . is a gorgeous ring made perfectly
Fashion_Accessories	i first used select_specs this year as recommended by a collegue .
Fashion_Accessories	i found that the high_street opticians were becoming increasingly expensive and i was assured that select_specs were a great online company .
Fashion_Accessories	i wanted a pair of glasses that were stylish and affordable and found a great pair on select_specs , which also included a speedy_delivery service .
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend select_specs to friends , family and anyone that has yet to try an online optician !
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of ray_ban wayfarer sunglasses in matt black .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived the next_day ... for free !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	bring on the summer !
Fashion_Accessories	not much more i can say !
Fashion_Accessories	i want to own everything on site !
Fashion_Accessories	i like the fact that they stock contemporary brands that you can ' t find anywhere_else , it makes the purchase that little_bit more special .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of wayfarers last summer and got them next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	even got a text to say they were on the way .
Fashion_Accessories	too bad i lost them in the sea !
Fashion_Accessories	i will be ordering again from red_hot sunglasses this year
Fashion_Accessories	great company , had no_problems easy to order massive_selection of glasses to choose from , sent the next_day via ups .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of chanel sunglasses , price seemed to good to be true and was ....
Fashion_Accessories	one thing this company are extremely good at is taking money out of your account promptly , when it comes to delivering the goods that you have ordered or refunding money they are abysmal .
Fashion_Accessories	basically i ordered a pair of chanel sunglasses at the beginning of the month , and began to get slightly worried that i had received no confirmation of my order 0 days_later .
Fashion_Accessories	so i rang and asked for confirmation of my order in writing they stumbled and mumbled around " their systems " before telling_me that unfortunately they had sent my confirmation_email to the wrong_address .... after telling them how unprofessional this was especially if any of my payment details were in the email they eventually agreed to resend the email , unfortunately the lady in customer_services slammed the phone down before i had a chance to thank her .
Fashion_Accessories	the next_day and the confirmation_email had still not arrived , so i had to ring again .....
Fashion_Accessories	this time i did get speaking to someone who handled my query extremely well who explained that the email had again been sent to the wrong email address ( by the way my email adrress is exactly the same as my name ) and promised that the email would be sent immediately .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service rep then went to check how long it owuld be before the glasses were delivered , and after faffing around for 0 minuted was unable to give me any more information that 0 - 00 working_days ....
Fashion_Accessories	after close to 00 working_days i began to get a bit_concerned as i had received no dispatch email so again rang the company to find out what was going on .
Fashion_Accessories	again when they eventually did find the order i was told that unfortunately the sunglasses were no_longer available as they had been_discontinued several years_ago .....
Fashion_Accessories	when i asked how they were able to take my money for items that did not even exist they were not too forthcoming as usual .
Fashion_Accessories	so after declining to choose another pair of glasses i asked for a refund which i was told would be in my account in 0 - 0 working_days .
Fashion_Accessories	guess_what ?
Fashion_Accessories	0 working_days_later and still no sign of any refund however when i asked why 0 days ago was told that the accounts_department had forgotten to refund the money but it would be processed the same day ... silly me ....
Fashion_Accessories	by the way after finding out that the glasses had been_discontinued i found them with another company ( pret a voire ) who price matched the sunglasses_shop fictional price and had them on my doorstep by lunch time the next_day , exceptional service especially by their rep called wu who actually stayed in work late to ensure my product was dispatched the same day .
Fashion_Accessories	chemical - records is a great music store with a cheap delivery over the world .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s simply a true .
Fashion_Accessories	just one of my fav online stores .
Fashion_Accessories	bargain , gd for business and recommended
Fashion_Accessories	the product arrived really quickly and was awesome , great value for money also !
Fashion_Accessories	:-)
Fashion_Accessories	great selection of clothes and fast delivery !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a full - zip fleece jacket from webtogs last_week , along with a pair of gloves and some base layers , having received some very helpful guidance from the ' human_being ' on the end of the phone .
Fashion_Accessories	without his help i would have been totally lost !
Fashion_Accessories	i was struggling to find a suitable christmas_present for my grandfather , who had specified only that he wanted ' a fleece '.
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service operative helped_me gage his size and the warmth of the various designs in their stock , going way above and beyond his responsibilities in order that i find just what i ( or rather my granddad ) was looking for .
Fashion_Accessories	he even ran to the warehouse to compare fleeces directly , and got his office colleagues to try them on .
Fashion_Accessories	i must have been on the line for about 00_minutes , which is not something i ' ve experienced elsewhere .
Fashion_Accessories	having received such top - quality service i will certainly be shopping with webtogs again , and have no doubt that my grandfather will be a very happy man when he opens his present on christmas day !
Fashion_Accessories	if he ' s not , i ' m assured i ' ve got 00 days to send the fleece back for a free exchange , which again is great .
Fashion_Accessories	nice one webtogs - they deserve every bit of the 0 . 0 out of 00 they ' ve got on here .
Fashion_Accessories	great range of products and excellent service to match .
Fashion_Accessories	took advantage of alfred sargent free shoe tree offer , ordered 0 pairs over a couple of weeks , all arrived within 0 working_days .
Fashion_Accessories	mike small and his team are a pleasure to deal with , and sure to purchase more pairs down the track .
Fashion_Accessories	i recently_purchased the knomo avignon extra slim brief 00 ″, black , from right bag .
Fashion_Accessories	i had been looking for this particular laptop case for a while and found that right bag had this not only in stock , but at a lower_price to all of the other stores i had looked at .
Fashion_Accessories	the site was really user_friendly and easy navigate around , with good images of the product too .
Fashion_Accessories	i wanted a slim case and felt i got a good perspective of this from the images on the product page .
Fashion_Accessories	i opted for the free delivery option ( which i was also pleased they offered ) and this arrived_promptly ( 0 days_later by royal_mail ) with good protective packaging .
Fashion_Accessories	i have been made up with the case and would definitely_recommend right bag to others .
Fashion_Accessories	i recently_bought a personalised item from aspinal and it arrived within four working_days which was quicker_than_expected .
Fashion_Accessories	i did receive two different amounts for the final price but after contacting customer_services they cleared everything up for me and very quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	the only thing i would like them to change is to give a rough estimate for delivery so if ordering gifts in future , customers will know when they will be arriving .
Fashion_Accessories	my parcel was very fast to be delivered ordered on tuesday and came on thursday no_complaints .
Fashion_Accessories	a huge_selection of glasses to choose from at really competitive_prices .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve worn glasses for a long time and find a lot of places sell fashion glasses out of my price range meaning i normally buy one pair and can ' t afford to keep a spare pair ( which is a shame as my little_boy tends to break them often ).
Fashion_Accessories	with selectspecs i feel i can purchase several pairs for the price of a pair in leading opticians .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased two_pairs to begin with as i wanted to check the quality , i must_admit i was sceptical and thought low_prices must equal low quality - i was wrong .
Fashion_Accessories	both pairs have arrived and both are brilliant quality , i ' ll now be looking to buy more as it ' s always nice to have a variety .
Fashion_Accessories	great shop with superb customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	responded to my every email within a few hours and the sunglasses were delivered within_00hrs with fedex .
Fashion_Accessories	check out their facebook_page for a discount and to see how active and approachable they are .
Fashion_Accessories	will shop again .
Fashion_Accessories	last_year ( june_0000 ) i bought a diamond platinum engagement_ring for my fiancée .
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer made sure everything was perfect from start to finish .
Fashion_Accessories	i hate buying anything online - tian smith ensured that he accommodated for me every way possible .
Fashion_Accessories	i must ' ve phoned him at_least 00 times before buying the ring - and by the time i placed the order - i was very short of time !
Fashion_Accessories	they made sure the ring was with me before my special occasion .
Fashion_Accessories	i promised diamond_geezer that i will be back to buy our_wedding_rings .
Fashion_Accessories	last month i bought 0 wedding_rings - clive & luke were sooo helpful is was unbelieveable - there was never any pressure to buy anything .
Fashion_Accessories	my finacee ' s engagement_ring was a difficult one to match with the wedding_ring - within no time diamond_geezer provided me with a cad image of how they could make the rings fit together !
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was also very fast !!
Fashion_Accessories	defo would recommend to anyone anytime !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	sam mistry - wolverhampton
Fashion_Accessories	i placed an order with sunglasses_shop for some fairly expensive custom oakley_sunglasses , something which this website informed me would take on average 0 days before being dispatched and would have a trackable delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	weeks_later i had received nothing and heard_nothing .
Fashion_Accessories	i asked and was grudgingly told that it was taking longer_than normal .
Fashion_Accessories	as such i did not have the glasses for the trip abroad i had bought them for .
Fashion_Accessories	on my return , they still had not been delivered and i was due to move away from my property for an extended period .
Fashion_Accessories	i asked the shop to give me an eta .
Fashion_Accessories	they said check the ups site but gave me no tracking_number , so i had to ask for this separately .
Fashion_Accessories	i realised that the order ( now unapologetically about a month late ) was not going to be delivered in time before i left so i requested a change of delivery address .
Fashion_Accessories	sunglasses_shop processed this so slowly that it was too_late .
Fashion_Accessories	i had moved away for two months .
Fashion_Accessories	when i returned i found no sunglasses waiting for me .
Fashion_Accessories	examination showed that they had been delivered , and allegdly signed for , by some complete stranger , not even someone who lives in my building .
Fashion_Accessories	obviously this defeats the point of a signed for delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	however , by the time i had confirmed that this was the case the window for complaints had closed .
Fashion_Accessories	i was shunted between equally incompetent members of customer_service , each one apparently too lazy to read the previous emails in the thread .
Fashion_Accessories	the upshot of this is that apparently it is considered ok by this shop to fail to deliver their products to the customer , regardless of circumstances ; that keeping the customer informed of what is happening to their order is distinctly optional ; and that requests by the customer will be dealt_with lazily .
Fashion_Accessories	i am now £_000 the poorer for having dealt_with this store and they are apparently guilt - free for never having fulfilled the most basic requirement of selling something .
Fashion_Accessories	this is my second time using this company .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent selection of products to choose from .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of sunglasses and there was no hassle at checkout , very smooth_transaction .
Fashion_Accessories	i got a confirmation_email within a matter of seconds .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses arrived very quickly and were exactly as_described .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely_recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	i did some research for some light weight sun glasses as my last pair finally gave up on me so i though i would splash out .
Fashion_Accessories	i went for a pair of the carbon fibre frame less ray_bans .
Fashion_Accessories	fashion eyewear had the cheapest i could find at the time + i got myself some cashback via topcashback . co . uk .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery time was a little longer_than_expected but i wasn ' t in a hurry ( we have snow and no signs of sun ).
Fashion_Accessories	got the wrong pair of sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	it world have veen appropriate with a small compensation for all the bother returning the glasses , and for the delay .
Fashion_Accessories	orherwise the service has bern quick and efficiant .
Fashion_Accessories	i tried ordering cravats for my wedding .
Fashion_Accessories	skc failed to let me know that they didnt have the stock / the line was discontinued ( i got several different stories ) after waiting nearly four weeks for the delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	they promised the items would delivered the following week , and they weren ' t .
Fashion_Accessories	they made no attempt to make up for the fact that they had left me with little time before my wedding to get things sorted ( and colour matched ).
Fashion_Accessories	i asked for a refund , got no reply , and then two days_later ( today ) i got an_email_saying my order had been dispatched , which i explicitly told them i did not want as i have decided to get cravats from elsewhere as i do not trust the reliability or credibility of their business .
Fashion_Accessories	i have updated my review to 0_stars rather_than 0 , as requested by the company and because in light of this review i have had some positive response and effort to sort this ( including the below response ).
Fashion_Accessories	i do hope that the company means what it says when it will review its customer_service , and this is not just for show .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered the handbag late friday_night , by monday_morning i had received a email to say my order was on it ' s way and by tuesday it had arrived .
Fashion_Accessories	very impressed with the speed of delivery considering it was free .
Fashion_Accessories	i would absolutely use again .
Fashion_Accessories	my experience with sunglasses_shop has been great .
Fashion_Accessories	they have a vast_range of sunglasses of different brands .
Fashion_Accessories	i love their oakley custom series .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a nice pair of ray_bans .. man they have every_single ray_ban model on their website .
Fashion_Accessories	their delivery option just adds to their list of positives .. guaranteed next_day delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely shop at sunglasses_shop again ( preferable oakley custom scalpel )
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	a wide_range of glasses and excellent service .
Fashion_Accessories	would recommend to everyone .
Fashion_Accessories	definitely use them again .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks
Fashion_Accessories	item slipped through quality check was offered discount for faulty item but not a great discount
Fashion_Accessories	i would reccommend this company to you .
Fashion_Accessories	once again i been left feeling extremely happy with the service i received .
Fashion_Accessories	i found exactly_what i was looking for with other alternatives available too .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was swift and fast .
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased with service and items received
Fashion_Accessories	placing order was easy , price was great , got fleece 0 days after ordering using the free service .
Fashion_Accessories	i had a list of products to order and founf them easily and processed an order .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was as stated on the site with the brushes well_packed .
Fashion_Accessories	i have been a regular user of chemical for almost a year and a half now .
Fashion_Accessories	i primarily buy my vinyl records here but also have done some clothes shopping .
Fashion_Accessories	service is great for both .
Fashion_Accessories	vinyl is always very well_packaged and ships fairly fast .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve never had a warped or broke vinyl yet !
Fashion_Accessories	the clothes are always well_packed too but they usually come with records anyways !
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t comment on their customer support as i ' ve never had to use it .
Fashion_Accessories	:) will_continue using chemical in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic service pick your shades go to checkout pay the next_day they arrive and got a right bargin to !
Fashion_Accessories	looks_like i had a brucey bonus !
Fashion_Accessories	quick and reasonable .
Fashion_Accessories	bought my daughter a barbour coat .
Fashion_Accessories	found at here cheaper_than john_lewis ' and also got to use quidco for a further discount .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was excellent as well .
Fashion_Accessories	just the way shopping online should be .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you .
Fashion_Accessories	i was very pleased with the speed and efficiency of the service i received when ordering a down jacket from webtogs ; their stated returns_policy , which i did not have to use , is reassuringly comprehensive , something that ’_s essential when ordering clothes online and not being certain about fit or quality .
Fashion_Accessories	the website was readily navigable and informative and i found the range of products and brands to be very comprehensive .
Fashion_Accessories	i have used a number of outdoor clothing websites but this site is one i will check out each time in future and would certainly recommend to friends .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d never shopped at chemical_records before and was really surprised at how great their customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered something just after xmas and the next_day i had 0 emails waiting for me saying my order had been processed and then shipped , and it arrived in the post the day after that .
Fashion_Accessories	it arrived well_packaged and even got a free poster / calendar !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d definitely shop there again and would reccomend
Fashion_Accessories	same as above .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s difficult to praise diamondgeezer . com enough - in my experience both luke and tian were great throughout the entire_process of buying my wife ' s engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	buying an engagement or wedding_ring should be a fun and happy experience , and the guys at diamondgeezer made sure it was .
Fashion_Accessories	so much so that we bought both our_wedding_rings from them as well ; and on recommendation to my friends , they too have bought their wedding_rings from them !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll be in touch in a few anniversaries ' time when i need to upgrade my wife ' s rock !
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t fault .
Fashion_Accessories	ordering online was simple .
Fashion_Accessories	i made a mistake with the postage so had to call up .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service was fantastic , the guy was extremely polite , very helpful and sorted everything out straight_away .
Fashion_Accessories	i received my jacket yesterday , perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	exactly_what i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you .
Fashion_Accessories	will_definitely use again and recommend to others .
Fashion_Accessories	i am happy with dealing_with you
Fashion_Accessories	it was good experience and i will purchasing again from you organization
Fashion_Accessories	thanks a lot
Fashion_Accessories	regards
Fashion_Accessories	fatima
Fashion_Accessories	amazing customer_services who went beyond the call of duty to ensure that my christmas_gifts arrived today .
Fashion_Accessories	really thrilled and they have save christmas
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks julesb
Fashion_Accessories	great website and super_fast delivery , will_definitely be ordering again with them and will be recommending to friends !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	arrived in time for a birthday_gift , items reasonably_priced and arrived well_packaged .
Fashion_Accessories	great seller
Fashion_Accessories	the best on - line record shop hands_down .
Fashion_Accessories	hats_off to webtogs -- i don ' t think i ' ve ever come_across such great customer_service , let_alone the fact that the item concerned was half price in the first place .
Fashion_Accessories	i had a small problem with an ( otherwise brilliant ) icebreaker top i bought last_year and rang webtogs ; they were super friendly and instantly emailed a returns_label with free postage .
Fashion_Accessories	in well under a week i had received a replacement they had obtained from icebreaker .
Fashion_Accessories	and this on top of low_prices , next_day free delivery , etc -- big_thumbs_up .
Fashion_Accessories	they ' ll be my first_port of call for outdoor_kit in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	great service , and great prices all_round .
Fashion_Accessories	i would love to recommend the fashioneyewear to everyone , just today i received my gorgeous dior sunglasses , they are perfect and really good quality i love them !!
Fashion_Accessories	! the customer_service is so ever helpful and kind , big thanks to all of them for help i really_appreciate all that . xx
Fashion_Accessories	end is the first place that i have found who embrace classic cult brands and new up and coming designers from all over the world , and combine this offering with superb service i only wish i could afford more of their stuff
Fashion_Accessories	good service .
Fashion_Accessories	delivered relatively quick .
Fashion_Accessories	did leave with neighbour even_though that wasn ' t requested , which was slightly worrying .
Fashion_Accessories	i was not protected in this case .
Fashion_Accessories	the garment was lovely however after one wear the quality seems to have diminished already , which isn ' t desirable considering the amount paid for the dress .
Fashion_Accessories	beautifully_packaged but i did expect the dress to come with a protector bag given the nature of its fabric .
Fashion_Accessories	i feel luxury sites such as yourself should not charge shipping when i pay £_000 for a dress .
Fashion_Accessories	overall okay experience .
Fashion_Accessories	have had my eyes set on a pair of ray_bans for a while now .
Fashion_Accessories	the price on sunglasses_shop was a lot lower_than the high_street , so it made sense to go online .
Fashion_Accessories	i placed the order at 00 : 00 on a monday and the ups man rang my bell at 00 : 00 on tuesday - this is what i call service !
Fashion_Accessories	i have ordered many outdoor items from many different stores online before and have to say webtog is one of the top stores .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a jetboil 0 . 0ltr pan and the price was very very competitive .
Fashion_Accessories	may i also say i ordered this on wednesday_night 00 / 00 / 00 and it was delivered new years_eve ( even with postal delays !!)
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was free so you tend to think a week would be fair but 0 days is very swift .
Fashion_Accessories	the product was well_packaged and protected as well .
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks to webtog
Fashion_Accessories	i bought the costumes for world book day for me and some colleagues .
Fashion_Accessories	the range and price of the costumes are all very good as well as the quality of the costumes .
Fashion_Accessories	would not hesitate to use mega_fancy_dress for future occasions , thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve not purchased an awful lot from yesstyle but when i have done , it ' s been pretty quick and i ' ve never had any_problems .
Fashion_Accessories	i think their member scheme is also really handy and is a good way to get people to purchase from them more .
Fashion_Accessories	i personally love the clothing they sell , even if i can only buy from certain brands ( due to sizing ), but the fact that they sell clothes from asian brands that are for plus size makes them even better .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s hard to find the cute asian - style clothing in a size that fits me so when i see there are actual brands out there that have stuff that ' ll fit me , at a reasonable_price too , makes me very happy to buy from them .
Fashion_Accessories	i thought they used an excellent courier service , because it specified which hour the boots were going to arrive .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	super_fast & well_packed .
Fashion_Accessories	this is one of a number if occasions i have used mega_fancy_dress .
Fashion_Accessories	their ebay shop is very easy to navigate and when i have requested info on costumes my query has been dealt_with very quickly and answered the required detail .
Fashion_Accessories	the despatch is always confirmed and the delivery speedy .
Fashion_Accessories	the products are very reasonably_priced and of high_quality and ebay purchases are covered by a very generous returns_policy .
Fashion_Accessories	very highly_recommended - thank_you very much !
Fashion_Accessories	yesstyle is absolutely one of my favourite websites to shop at .
Fashion_Accessories	the first thing i do when i ' m feeling bored of my old clothes is look on yesstyle .
Fashion_Accessories	i even have it at my bookmarks bar because i surf it so often even if it is to be on top of new asian fashion .
Fashion_Accessories	the reason_why i use yesstyle so much is because , i love shopping in hong_kong , every time i shop there i get my hands full of bags and i have to put down all of them at a hotel just to go out and shop more but with yesstyle , i don ' t have to do all of that because it is all just on one website and the shipping is so fast that you don ' t even expect it .
Fashion_Accessories	what i especially love is how yesstyle always have a sale on no matter the season .
Fashion_Accessories	so if you ' re looking for some asian style , yesstyle has everything you ' ll ever need on it !
Fashion_Accessories	great !

Fashion_Accessories	gave my friend pat a pair and he absolutely loved them !!
Fashion_Accessories	he went on the website to order some more he loved them so much !
Fashion_Accessories	quick delivery , great fit and all_round awesome prints !
Fashion_Accessories	having never_heard of the company before i was skeptical_about using them for such an important occasion as my wedding .
Fashion_Accessories	however i found them absolutely_brilliant in every way .
Fashion_Accessories	on their website you can follow the process of your order in minute detail .
Fashion_Accessories	they even tell you at what process in their factory your order is currently at .
Fashion_Accessories	when you place your order they give you a date your item will be ready for .
Fashion_Accessories	for me they beat the due date by 0 full weeks .
Fashion_Accessories	their customer_service is first_class .
Electrical_goods	really helpful advice given on products .
Electrical_goods	competitively_priced goods , free next_day delivery and excellent packaging .
Electrical_goods	i would highly_recommend them .
Electrical_goods	orders are easy and straightforward , loved being_able to get the bits and bobs i go through and the e_- liquid for a really good price and lightening speed .
Electrical_goods	no more shifty envelopes from china coming through the door .
Electrical_goods	my only issue is having to be around to sign for the package , but otherwise i can find no fault , will be using again , very soon .
Electrical_goods	it was a pleasant buy .
Electrical_goods	great communication , process time .
Electrical_goods	0 star !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	i bought a ibiza 0 . 0 pa sound system which was a real let_down as it was faulty - on new years_eve !!!!
Electrical_goods	( first use )
Electrical_goods	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .
Electrical_goods	i took it to a repairer & after hifi - tower initially refused to pay the repair quote of £_00 , they then changed their minds and helpfully dealt_with the matter via telephone and offered me all the assistance i needed in order to get the repair paid for .
Electrical_goods	the customer_service has been ok , just a shame the product was faulty upon purchase causing a lot of un - needed stress and dissapointment .
Electrical_goods	great company , great products , great care , fully recommended .
Electrical_goods	i have to admit , the reason i purchased from this company is that i had money in my paypal account ( from selling on ebay ) and it takes 0 days to transfer money into your bank_account , so i was looking around various speaker sites and found that audiovisual online accepted paypal ( surprisingly the only speaker company i found that does ).
Electrical_goods	so , i had little choice who to order from , however i am very happy that i stumbled_across this site !
Electrical_goods	as i mentioned earlier the prices they offer are competitive offering the same price as amazon for the speakers i wanted .
Electrical_goods	however , having ordered many thing from unknown sites before , i was expecting a large postage cost be be included with my purchase ( in total the speakers weighed 00kg ) but no , the postage was free !
Electrical_goods	being the skeptical person i am , i was expecting it to be sent by economy post and take a week or more to arrive with me .
Electrical_goods	however this was anything but the case , for free they used dpd ' s next_day premium service !
Electrical_goods	this is a great service , with dpd texting me straight_away telling_me the date when my package would arrive .
Electrical_goods	even better was than on the day of arrival ( i ordered this a 00 at night and it arrived two days_later !)
Electrical_goods	dpd texted me giving me a 0 hour delivery slot and sure enough the dpd van turned_up slap bang in the middle of the slot !
Electrical_goods	i couldn ' t believe i got this postage service for free , it must have cost audiovisual good money to use that particular service .
Electrical_goods	the condition of the item was perfect , with the box in perfect_condition ( just as it should have been ).
Electrical_goods	i am now enjoying listening to my new speakers !
Electrical_goods	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use this company again !
Electrical_goods	they would even be in preference to amazon and such like !
Electrical_goods	( yes they are that good !)
Electrical_goods	if only all companies were this good !
Electrical_goods	i ' m better at consuming reviews than writing reviews , but having found the reviews on trustpilot so positive that i bought an expensive camera from a company in hk , i wanted to backup everyone ' s comments that digitalrev are awesome .
Electrical_goods	why ?
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	cheap ( better value than anywhere i could find in the uk or us )
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	quick ( the camera arrived within a few_days of ordering )
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	safe ( the camera box was snuggly secured in lots of bubble_wrap )
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	no duty ( per other reviews , no issue with import_duty )
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	uk version ( the power lead had a uk plug , was not expecting that )
Electrical_goods	the only potential word of caution is that they get by with no import_duty by claiming the value to by £_00 or so .
Electrical_goods	it ' s worth checking in the t &_cs that digitalrev will cover costs if anything goes_wrong with the delivery .
Electrical_goods	enjoy your new camera kit from digitalrev !
Electrical_goods	i order all of my equipment from these_guys .
Electrical_goods	it always arrives earlier_than predicted , the products have always been perfect , and they give great impartial reviews on youtube .
Electrical_goods	saved_myself a bundle of money over the years .
Electrical_goods	keep up the good work guys !
Electrical_goods	i was a little_worried_about spending nearly £_000 with a company that i had never_heard of .
Electrical_goods	i read a few of the reviews and decided to go with them .
Electrical_goods	i ordered the item at 00pm on tuesday , they phoned me wednesday to confirm the postcode and it had been delivered by thursday , this is incredible given that it came from_hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	the item was cheaper_than all the other_companies we had looked into .
Electrical_goods	we got a bundle including cleaning kit , memory_card and a tripod for cheaper_than the price of amazon , comet etc .
Electrical_goods	the only thing i would say is that when we turned the camera on the language wasnt set to english , so we had to download the manual ( the hard copy wasnt english either ) to figure_out how to change it .
Electrical_goods	i would 000_% recommend this company , they are fantastic !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	combined with dhl this company managed to get a camera to me ( at a great price ) from_hong_kong to the uk in 00 . 0 hours from clicking submit to hitting the doorstep .
Electrical_goods	oh and delivery was free .
Electrical_goods	astonishing .
Electrical_goods	placed an order with tekshop000 on 00th_jan_0000 - for sony htsa 0 . 0 home cinema kit £_000 . 00 .
Electrical_goods	item then goes out of stock and awaiting new stock .
Electrical_goods	get an_email late last_night that they are cancelling my oder as sony has increased the price to over £_000 .
Electrical_goods	why the hell would they take an order in the first place when they dont have stock .
Electrical_goods	i could have got it from another supplier for £_00 more .
Electrical_goods	i receive my camera in 0 days without paying any aditional charges .
Electrical_goods	" enormously disappointing .
Electrical_goods	i placed a considerable order with digitalrev , paying through paypal .
Electrical_goods	the next_day i received an_email " confirming ' that my order had " successfully " been cancelled .
Electrical_goods	no explanation was given so i checked the website and saw again that it had simply been cancelled .
Electrical_goods	i thought i must have cancelled it in error by clicking the wrong link so placed the order again , again paying through paypal .
Electrical_goods	the order was confirmed but then half an_hour later i received a second email telling_me that my order had been cancelled .
Electrical_goods	again there was no explanation .
Electrical_goods	this time i found a contact number and called customer_services who told me it had been cancelled because they had been unable to link me to my address .
Electrical_goods	they needed me to send them various forms of id etc and then if i passed their checks i would be able to place another order .
Electrical_goods	now , i don ' t mind them conducting security_checks at all ; i think that ' s a good thing and in everybody ' s interest but i do mind very much their cavalier attitude_towards my custom as well as my time and energy .
Electrical_goods	if they need more information , is it too much to expect that they would contact me and ask for it instead of just cancelling my order with no explanation ?
Electrical_goods	i order a huge number of products online both from the uk and overseas and have never encountered this before .
Electrical_goods	i was paying through paypal and both billing and shipping addresses are paypal verified and have been used on numerous_occasions .
Electrical_goods	as i say , it is not the security_checks that bother me , it is their extraordinarily dismissive attitude_towards someone who is simply trying to buy their products ."
Electrical_goods	i was really impressed with the speed of dispatch , low_cost ( ie , free !)
Electrical_goods	delivery and the lovely saving off the rrp of the lens :)
Electrical_goods	loved the reviews on the digitalrev youtube page and this is what convinced me to make a purchase with dr , i obviously looked everywhere online and researched for many weeks for a new dslr and came to currys uk , amazon uk , and then digtalrev .
Electrical_goods	the price_match was very reasonable with dr so i chose them and i ' m very happy with product and will buy other products , such as lenses with dr , in the future .
Electrical_goods	delivery was very fast and had a online tracking_system with dhl .
Electrical_goods	very well_done dr !
Electrical_goods	i ordered a lens and lens filter from pixmania . ie and received them both in very good packaging 0 days_later even_though they had come all the way from belgium to ireland .
Electrical_goods	couldn ' t be any happier with the speed , efficiency & professionalism of delivery !
Electrical_goods	placing my order was very simple & straight_forward .
Electrical_goods	payment was just as easy and it ' s an added_bonus that i could pay with paypal unlike amazon .
Electrical_goods	the price for the lens i got was also the cheapest i could find so overall i couldn ' t have been any happier with how the whole_process went .
Electrical_goods	i will_definitely be using pixmania again !
Electrical_goods	i must_admit i was slightly skeptical ordering from digitalrev , especially because i had never_heard of this site but went_ahead with the purchase of my hs00exr fujifilm camera based on excellent reviews i had read about their services - i was not disappointed !
Electrical_goods	the product was so carefully_wrapped as to avoid any damage .
Electrical_goods	i thought there may be some hidden conditions attached due to the cheap pricing of the product , however this was not the case and they guarantee free shipping on their website with covered insurance ( not many sites do this ) and my mind was put at rest .
Electrical_goods	the camera is absolutely new and perfect and i would definitely be ordering from them again .
Electrical_goods	they keep you fully informed of delivery through the tracking_number and provide regular email_updates .
Electrical_goods	perfect site !
Electrical_goods	000_% would recommend .
Electrical_goods	fantastic service , very knowledgeable_staff and very friendly service .
Electrical_goods	i was given very good advice on what they recommended and got a good deal on what i ordered .

Electrical_goods	found the focus to be alot quicker !
Electrical_goods	alot better build_quality !
Electrical_goods	amazing clarity and crispness !
Electrical_goods	if you are between the 00 -_000mm and the 00 -_000mm non l series , its definitely worth paying the extra to have this !!

Electrical_goods	all in all one very happy customer !

Electrical_goods	i really like their videos on all_sorts of camera related subjects , and found that the particular camera i was looking to buy ( the canon_000d ) was cheapest on digitalrev out of all the retailers i was looking at .

Electrical_goods	found the site through a recommendation - now here ' s mine !
Electrical_goods	came with discount_voucher and a lolly - can ' t complain !
Electrical_goods	digitalrev is probably the best company i ' ve dealt_with in quite a while .
Electrical_goods	i ' m a musician by trade , so i ' m used to ordering through specialist stores , and they are awfully clinical .
Electrical_goods	digitalrev provides something unique , in that they not only provide fantastic prices for their equipment , they have video tutorials which are informative but also fun ( think top gear meets cameras instead of cars ) and a lot of articles on the site itself .
Electrical_goods	they run regular deals of various products , so it ' s always a good idea to check back regularly to see if there ' s a new bargain in stock , but their prices beat every other retailer on the web – including amazon .
Electrical_goods	with jessops kicking the bucket , digitalrev , in my opinion , has the potential to become the uk ' s new household name for camera gear .
Electrical_goods	great price , delivered next_day using a decent courier ( ups ), well_packaged , rang to confirm company name ( delivered to work ), was very polite and friendly on phone .
Electrical_goods	great , reliable company , highly_recommended !
Electrical_goods	i used hifi - tower to purchase radio microphones for karaoke use .

Electrical_goods	i ordered a canon_000d and it arrived at my door in only 0 days , fresh from_hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	the price was the most competitive around , even cheaper_than amazon .
Electrical_goods	with free shipping and friendly efficient service , what ' s not to like ?
Electrical_goods	i ' ll definitely be buying again from digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	thanks !
Electrical_goods	have had some issues with paypal re payment , the seller has been so good and patient , keeping in touch and responding to all my messages .

Electrical_goods	ordered my lens on the thursday and it was delivered on the monday .

Electrical_goods	was nervous_about buying from outside the uk but everything went well and will be ordering again soon .
Electrical_goods	i ordered a nikon_d0000 for £_000 .
Electrical_goods	it is a much_better price than anywhere_else i found in the uk or on - line .
Electrical_goods	delivery was quoted at around six days , but it only took three via dhl where the order tracking was very good .
Electrical_goods	my bank initially refused payment by debit_card - so i had to call them to pr - authorise the transaction .
Electrical_goods	great price and fast delivery from_hong_kong

Electrical_goods	i was hesitant to order a camera for my girlfriend from digitalrev so close to christmas .

Electrical_goods	my sister had recommended them so i bit the bullet .
Electrical_goods	i was pleasantly_surprised when my order was dispatched on friday the 00th and i received the camera , well_packaged and exactly as_described , on monday the 00th .

Electrical_goods	basically all i can is just purchase !
Electrical_goods	i have recently_purchased a chinup bar from hifi - tower and must_say that the quality of their chin up bar is excellent , compared to others i have seen .
Electrical_goods	its a very strong chinup bar and manages my weight very well without bending while pulled on like other cheaply built bars .
Electrical_goods	the bar was very easy to fit and i would reccomend anyone_looking to buy a chin up bar to visit hifi - tower , will shop again here .
Electrical_goods	thanks hifi - tower team !
Electrical_goods	i ordered my camera on monday_morning - it arrived tuesday_afternoon ( hong_kong to central_london ).

Electrical_goods	when i was ordering my internet crashed and i didn ' t know if the order had gone_through so i sent hifiheadphones an_email .
Electrical_goods	they rang me 00_minutes later to let me know it hadn ' t gone_through .
Electrical_goods	then when i managed to complete the order they sent me a personal email to confirm that this time it definitely had gone_through .
Electrical_goods	i thought that was excellent .
Electrical_goods	the item arrived very quickly , and included a free lolly .
Electrical_goods	small gestures are appreciated !
Electrical_goods	also the product is great - i have already_recommended the product and the website to 0 people .
Electrical_goods	i have ordered many things from hifiheadphones and that will_continue for a very very long time .
Electrical_goods	i genuinely have not dealt_with another company that has given better service .
Electrical_goods	the one time i had a fault with a product , it was replaced quickly , efficiently and without any hassle at all .
Electrical_goods	even ended_up having a lengthy conversation about various headphone / hifi things with the guy on the phone .
Electrical_goods	they properly know their stuff and are friendly and knowledgeable with it - not arrogant and pushy in the slightest .
Electrical_goods	you can see from the other reviews here exactly how great this company are .
Electrical_goods	i see no other choice for my headphone needs !
Electrical_goods	completely nailed the website redesign - very easy to use site , completely informative , straight to the point with well_presented information without any spammy content , which makes a nice change .
Electrical_goods	the live_chat feature enabled me to make an informed purchase after_speaking with a technical salesperson .
Electrical_goods	cheers mike !
Electrical_goods	i had never_heard of pixmania before and was worried that it wasn ' t a legit place to buy a tv , but because amazon wouldn ' t ship the tv i wanted to buy to ireland , i decided to give pixmania a try .
Electrical_goods	i ' m very pleased with my purchase .
Electrical_goods	the tv arrived within the estimated_delivery time and was in perfect_condition .
Electrical_goods	i was able to use a discount_code during the online payment process , so i ended_up paying less for the tv than i would have at most other_places .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely buy at pixmania again .
Electrical_goods	highly_recommended
Electrical_goods	i received the item the next_day after i placing my order .
Electrical_goods	and everything was as it was advertised .
Electrical_goods	this amplifier is fontastic .
Electrical_goods	i highly_recommend hifi - tower
Electrical_goods	i was a little_hesitant at using a foreign site but the service was second to none .
Electrical_goods	i received email_notifications every_step of the way and recieved my canon_0d in very little time .
Electrical_goods	as soon as my camera was dispatched i recieved a link and was able to track my package from_hong_kong through to germany and then into the uk .
Electrical_goods	i wouldnt_hesitate to use this service again especialy when uk prices are so high
Electrical_goods	i ordered from uk on tuesday_morning , the item arrived by friday_lunchtime .
Electrical_goods	all items present and working well .
Electrical_goods	no_problems with customs etc .
Electrical_goods	great value for the item - sony nex0r .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve only used it a couple of times but so far it ' s been outstanding .
Electrical_goods	the sensor picks_up everything , as good as a human eye .
Electrical_goods	used in difficult light ( cloudy day , occasional sunshine ) but all colours and depth captured well .
Electrical_goods	the 00 - 00 zoom lens makes it very portable ( not quite pocket size but light and easy ), the simple manual controls for iso , aperture and shutter speed make composition easy .
Electrical_goods	i look_forward to much more use with it .
Electrical_goods	not so bad , confusing information about opening package before signing ( delivery man wouln ' t allow me to do it , though i had instructions from pixmania to do so ...)
Electrical_goods	overall ok
Electrical_goods	i recently_bought the canon g00 ...
Electrical_goods	i seen this for £_000 in jessops compared to £_000 on digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	i was a little_sceptical at first buying from the internet but i read a lot of reviews of this site and hardly found one bad one .
Electrical_goods	the camera arrived from china in a matter of days , was well_packed and worked a treat .
Electrical_goods	the camera is brilliant and i would recommend digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	unfortunatly my package arrived torn , with no item inside .
Electrical_goods	i quickly established that this was due to royal_mails ( man ) handling of the package before discovering the joys of thier utterly appalling customer_service .
Electrical_goods	i therefore contacted hifi_headphones for advice who were quite the opposite .
Electrical_goods	as well as taking over responsibility for the royal_mail claim , they also offered to replace the item immediately at thier own cost .
Electrical_goods	communication was friendly , professional and polite .
Electrical_goods	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use this company again and highly_recommend them for anyone_looking to buy audio_equipment .
Electrical_goods	thankyou hifi - tower .
Electrical_goods	my purchase of a 000w subwoofer was reasonably_priced , with reasonable postage_costs and , when it arrived ( within the given time bracket ) it was very safely_packaged to ensure it arrived with no complications .
Electrical_goods	thank_you for your hard work on my order guys , i shall buy from you again .
Electrical_goods	ben smith
Electrical_goods	basically this is how all end - user buying experiences should be ' pain - free '.
Electrical_goods	the prices are pretty_much less_than what you ' d expect for such quality gear .
Electrical_goods	they are as far as i am concerned doing the pro - audio industry proud .
Electrical_goods	i ordered a studio monitor and items such as these are pretty fragile , so i was pretty happy to see it arrive in one piece and work just as the manufacturer intended .
Electrical_goods	don ' t normally leave reviews etc , but felt bop_dj deserved one .
Electrical_goods	order received next_day .
Electrical_goods	when had query with item , through no fault of bop_dj , replacement received following_day with no need to return original order .
Electrical_goods	emails where responded to quickly and courteously .
Electrical_goods	will not hesitate to order from them again in the future .
Electrical_goods	although i only had one transaction with them his one went smoothless and in no time i had my item delivered .
Electrical_goods	recommended to all buyers out there !
Electrical_goods	thank_you , your customer_service was without fault .
Electrical_goods	customer_service was superb and quick answers to all my questions i had , very helpful
Electrical_goods	another company let me down and i finally gave up on them after waiting for 0 weeks .
Electrical_goods	one call to kac and i had my tap within 00_hours , delivered in a one hour delivery slot and i saved over £_000 !!!
Electrical_goods	would definately_recommend them
Electrical_goods	no_problems , arrived quickly
Electrical_goods	quick delivery , well_packed .
Electrical_goods	will use it in the future !
Electrical_goods	so ...
Electrical_goods	i ordered my dslr on a monday_afternoon , slightly irritated that i wouldn ' t have it by the time i went away on wednesday_afternoon ( i had the delivery address as my work so i wouldn ' t miss the courier when away ) - but it was totally worth it for the fact that i ' d saved so much money over purchasing from a uk retailer .
Electrical_goods	in fact , it was cheaper to buy brand_new from digital_rev than it was to buy used on ebay / dp forums .
Electrical_goods	well , much to my surprise and joy the camera turned_up on the wednesday_morning and i was able to collect from work and take it away with me !
Electrical_goods	it was impressive watching the dhl_tracking status update from_hong_kong to germany , from germany to london and from london to the north_west in less_than a day ( it was dispatched on the tuesday ).
Electrical_goods	i really couldn ' t be_happier .
Electrical_goods	it ' s come with the digital_rev warranty , which i ' d heard people were wary of due to shipping times etc ... my mind is now at rest on that front .
Electrical_goods	the product was extremely well_packaged and is exactly_what you ' d get if purchasing from your local curry ' s - all usual accessories , english paperwork etc .
Electrical_goods	stop thinking about buying from them and just do it , it ' s a great way to keep the costs reasonable on an otherwise piss - taking hobby ( when it comes to uk pricing , the hobby itself is obviously great ).
Electrical_goods	hope this helps someone , mainly because - and i don ' t want this to come out racist in any way - i ' m obviously british .
Electrical_goods	i read some reviews that were either penned by someone whose first language isn ' t english or by someone whose is but they clearly have no regard for spelling and grammar .
Electrical_goods	it ' s easy to dismiss those reviews as so many nefarious websites will review themselves to give false scores .
Electrical_goods	i ' m confident that ' s not going on here , my experience followed the same path as all the other positive_reviews i ' d heard about them and i ' m beginning to think that the negative_reviews are from people who ' re bitter about us not paying vat with dr ... seriously , what ' s with everyone blowing a gasket that i ' m buying it cheaper_than they are ??
Electrical_goods	they can buy it here too !
Electrical_goods	i don ' t buy into this " morally grey " rubbish they preach , it ' s not illegal to import these from abroad and the items are going through customs fair and square .
Electrical_goods	do these same people go on holiday and not purchase anything ?
Electrical_goods	no memory_cards from spain ?
Electrical_goods	no ipod from florida mall ?
Electrical_goods	etc .
Electrical_goods	get over it .
Electrical_goods	enjoy your purchases , i am .
Electrical_goods	managed to get some great shots of my brother - in - laws gig that i didn ' t think i ' d have the camera in time for , so we ' re all happy .
Electrical_goods	hifi_tower were helpful and professional from start to finish .
Electrical_goods	pre_- sale support was great !
Electrical_goods	delivery was only 0 days from when i pushed the button and my new hifi system is a dream .
Electrical_goods	will be coming_back very soon !
Electrical_goods	thanks hifi - tower !
Electrical_goods	fast delivery , good product , good customer_service , comes with warranty etc brilliant fantastic couldnt get a better price or service
Electrical_goods	had a pair of headphones that developed a fault - my credit note was processed immediately and a new pair despatched the same day .
Electrical_goods	best customer_service i ' ve experienced in years
Electrical_goods	i would recommend this company to anyone , they quickly sent me a reasonable quotation via_email within a couple of hours of filling out the form , i sent the item to them and they literally had the package for half a day before i had my money transferred to me .
Electrical_goods	i dealt_with alex and rich , 0 great friendly people .
Electrical_goods	thanks again !
Electrical_goods	perfect , the delivery arrived earlier_than_expected which is always a bonus .
Electrical_goods	will_definitely be shopping with digitalrev again in the future !

Electrical_goods	wish all modern day companies were as good as these .
Electrical_goods	at last a company that cares_about their customers as much as their products .
Electrical_goods	can ' t say enough good words about them .
Electrical_goods	i got damaged speakers from you and i thought that now it will be problems with the replacement of equipment or recovering my money , but here the big surprise of the first email .
Electrical_goods	i have been informed of the available options and what i continue to do .
Electrical_goods	at the option of returning the goods i had not even pay for the courier because they all email sent '.
Electrical_goods	wow super first time something like this happened to me .
Electrical_goods	( huge plus ).
Electrical_goods	i wanted this problem resolve it quickly so i chose the option repayment parts .
Electrical_goods	of course everything without a problem .
Electrical_goods	in summary , despite the equipment was damaged certainly have not lost my confidence and professional approach made ​​ you i will_continue to buy from you .
Electrical_goods	thank_you
Electrical_goods	having decided on the 00mm prime i scoured web for the best price .
Electrical_goods	no one uk_based could come close to digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	even better still the delivery only took 0 days !
Electrical_goods	as quick , if not quicker_than some uk companies i ' ve used in the past .
Electrical_goods	the website itself was very easy to use and very attractive .
Electrical_goods	the sidebars categorized the various items that they have available and the option to search by brand was conveniently positioned .
Electrical_goods	i had brought a pair of headphones which were really tight on my big head and uncomfortable for gaming use , i called up hifiheadphones and an exchange was arranged instantly with my new product reserved for me by an enthusiastic member of staff .
Electrical_goods	great companies in my opinion are those who can turn an unsatisfied customer into a satisfied one .
Electrical_goods	the customer thus is overall more pleased with the service than if they were not unsatisfied in the first place and take the time out of their day to write several words on a website such as this recommending the company that made the effort to resolve their problem .
Electrical_goods	i ordered the bose computer musicmonitor speakers from hispek electronics .
Electrical_goods	i had been searching for a while for some good speakers at a decent price and these were the best deal available from anywhere i had seen .
Electrical_goods	i chose the standard delivery service but even then they turned_up the next_day !
Electrical_goods	i was very please with the service and the speakers are awesome .
Electrical_goods	i would recommend hispek to anyone !
Electrical_goods	great products for the best price i have seen anywhere and delivered exceptionally quickly !
Electrical_goods	i found this company when i was looking to replace a lost set of headphones and having read some positive information about them i thought i would give them a shot and i am pleased that i did .
Electrical_goods	having placed my order on a friday and choosing their standard delivery option i was extremely pleased when my new headphones arrived on the saturday .
Electrical_goods	their communication_throughout the process was great and it was reassuring to have each_stage of the ordering_process made clear to me so i was always aware of what was happening .
Electrical_goods	the product itself is also very good and having purchased it based on a recommendation placed on a forum by an hifiheadphones . co . uk representative i was also pleased to find that they know what they are talking_about and weren ' t simply trying to flog me a pair of expensive headphones in order to make a sale .
Electrical_goods	overall i would highly_recommend hifiheadphones . co . uk and should i find myself in the market for another set i would not hesitate to buy from them again .
Electrical_goods	very pleased with the item , process and the speed at which it was despatched .
Electrical_goods	will use again and recommend to others .

Electrical_goods	living in ireland , i am always looking for sites based close to home so i don ' t have to wait weeks for delivery : i ordered a wacom intuos0 tablet , and got a great deal - the tablet was even cheaper_than ordering directly from the wacom site .
Electrical_goods	with the money i saved , i covered shipping ( which is a handy flat_rate ) and extra insurance for the product .
Electrical_goods	after my order was dispatched , i recieved an_email telling_me my package would arrive between the 00th and the 00th of january - it arrived on the 00th completely intact and pristine .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely order from pixmania again .
Electrical_goods	compromise with deadline , efficiency , great consumer support and much more , are the reasons_why i am always ordering from digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	you are awesome !

Electrical_goods	kind_regards ,
Electrical_goods	f
Electrical_goods	ordered on a thursday before the next_day delivery cut_off , unfortunately they didnt manage to do it in time ( it happens !)
Electrical_goods	but was emailed saying the delay and if i would accept the saturday delivery instead ( paid for by them ), unfortunately the packer didnt send it via this so i got it on monday but really quick responses from these_guys , gave me a refund on my delivery cost which tbh is good for me .
Electrical_goods	i wasnt in a huge rush so i appreciate them giving me a refund when they really didnt need to !.
Electrical_goods	excellent company , as i always say .. you only truly know how good or bad a company is when something_goes_wrong , hifi delivered on correcting this :).
Electrical_goods	will be buying from them again !.
Electrical_goods	well what can i say i ordered my new lens ( a tokina 00 - 00mm f0 . 0 dxii ) from digital_rev sunday_evening , i woke_up to find an_email with tracking monday_morning , my lens touched down in gb @ 0 :_00am tuesday and was delivered 0 :_00pm tuesday .

Electrical_goods	will_definatley be purchasing products from here again
Electrical_goods	i ordered the lens late on the sunday_night , and received the lens in great condition on the tuesday , can ' t fault the transaction at all !
Electrical_goods	i have been a customer of the production_room for a very long time and i will always be one .
Electrical_goods	they are the only shop where when i go in , the staff will shake my hand and remember my name ( and even remember me when i phone up ).
Electrical_goods	this is excellent customer_service in anyone ' s book .
Electrical_goods	they often do product demonstrations and have an excellent array of equipment to try out in store .
Electrical_goods	it is very important to support local businesses like these when there are so many competitors and i like shopping there .
Electrical_goods	if i ' ve ever had any_problems with gear purchased , it has been sorted without an issue .
Electrical_goods	the only_drawback is the lack of extended_warranty ( for what they are worth ) which is not offered here .
Electrical_goods	the service they provide is everything you would want from a music tech store .
Electrical_goods	they are very happy for you to try before you buy , and there is always someone who can answer the most technical and obscure queries .
Electrical_goods	ive been to most of the main london pro audio stores and very few compare to the all_round quality of production rooms !
Electrical_goods	i can ' t praise them enough !!!
Electrical_goods	i ordered my udg cd wallet 0pm monday , it arrived very swiftly approx 00am the next_day !!!
Electrical_goods	unbelievably quick !!!
Electrical_goods	i will be shopping with them again for sure !!
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	i dont think i could of asked for much more .
Electrical_goods	they ' re good value and fast .
Electrical_goods	very fast considering it comes from_hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	they also supplied me with a uk plug adaptor and paid my import_tax .
Electrical_goods	there was no need to contact customer_service so i cant comment on that .
Electrical_goods	i will_definitely be using them again .
Electrical_goods	bosch " blue " power_tools are for the trade .
Electrical_goods	similar in design to some of the green diy tools , but inside are better components for daily use rather_than occasional .
Electrical_goods	hard wearing .
Electrical_goods	its good gear right enough , but when things do break down they really excel .
Electrical_goods	the blue stuff has a year guarantee that if you register your product within 0 weeks of purchase , they upgrade free to 0 years .
Electrical_goods	if anything fails , they send a courier out to wherever you ' re working , collect the faulty item and repair / replace and return it to you within a few_days .
Electrical_goods	all under_warranty .
Electrical_goods	now that is service !
Electrical_goods	brilliant and speedy service couldn ' t of asked for better !

Electrical_goods	ordered a new canon_00d with an extra lens and memory_card late friday_evening .
Electrical_goods	spent over £ 0000 was able to track delivery at every_stage .
Electrical_goods	by sun evening the package was in the uk and tracked with dhl .
Electrical_goods	the same package bought within the uk would have cost me an extra £_000 , made huge_savings .
Electrical_goods	package was on my door in northern_ireland monday_afternoon !
Electrical_goods	fast efficient and quality canon products !
Electrical_goods	very happy !
Electrical_goods	!

Electrical_goods	i would highly_recommend hifi - tower to anyone .
Electrical_goods	thanks
Electrical_goods	i needed to buy some headphones for my local pre_- school and hifiheadphones were the best for price , range of products and p_& p costs .

Electrical_goods	i liked that touch .
Electrical_goods	would definitely_recommend !
Electrical_goods	fast delivery .
Electrical_goods	good packing .
Electrical_goods	brilliant customer_service , great prices , free delivery .
Electrical_goods	and - get this - ordered nikon d000 00am , arrived from_hong_kong the next_day in uk .
Electrical_goods	brilliant .
Electrical_goods	amazing first transaction with digirev - i had some pre sales questions , all of which we ' re answered succinctly and quickly .
Electrical_goods	top_notch .
Electrical_goods	i will shop with them again .
Electrical_goods	great product , great service , arrived in 00_hours of placing order ( with dhl shipping )
Electrical_goods	i decided to ' bite - the - bullet ' and get a canon_0d , for at_least £_000 cheaper_than a uk version but still with a 0 year_warranty ( albeit via digitalrev rather_than canon ).
Electrical_goods	the alternative was a 000d ... but in my opinion 0d > 000d although based on much older technology .
Electrical_goods	checked out the feedback on the website from other customers and went forward with the purchase .
Electrical_goods	waited for the item to arrive with baited breath ...
Electrical_goods	delivery was tracked throughout , prompt and arrived on specified day with sms updates .
Electrical_goods	item was wrapped in maybe 0 - 0ft of bubble_wrap - and nestled safely was the canon_0d box plus a few extras i ordered .
Electrical_goods	so far i have not had any_problems , i am only just starting in the world of enthusiast photography - i am no expert .
Electrical_goods	my only_gripe , ( and it is a minor one ); all the documentation was in japanese - not a big deal since the english pdf can be downloaded from canon ' s website .
Electrical_goods	but when your just starting and a solid bit of kit arrives with a bible - sized manual that makes no sense to you the reader , it can feel intimidating .
Electrical_goods	to date not had any_issues or problems , so i am unable to comment on digitalrev aftersales / support .
Electrical_goods	i have no_regrets following this purchase and i am very pleased with the product and service from digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	now , photography community what ' s all this rumour nonsense about a 0d mk0 and where can i get one ??
Electrical_goods	?
Electrical_goods	the information available about my headphones , the updates i received about my order and the speed with which it arrived all mean i ' d be very happy using this company again .
Electrical_goods	fast delivery , great customer_service .
Electrical_goods	bought a bud ego starter and a month later one of the batteries stopped charging , dropped them an_email and within an_hour i got a response telling_me to return it for a new one , cannot_fault them !
Electrical_goods	was well worth purchasing my 0d mk 0 from digital_rev as they were so much cheaper_than the alternatives in the uk .
Electrical_goods	the camera came perfectly on time , but unfortunately the battery grip i ordered was missing part .
Electrical_goods	however digital_rev quickly resolved this via emails and instant chat , sending me out a replacement straight_away .
Electrical_goods	their customer_service staff were very helpful and polite !
Electrical_goods	will_definitely be using them again .
Electrical_goods	dispatched same day and arrived next morning despite harsh weather_conditions via ups .
Electrical_goods	plenty of emails regarding order progress .
Electrical_goods	product very well_packaged which for me is extremely important , no one wants their expensive gear to arrive in a dented box .
Electrical_goods	headphones ( 000 ) are also brilliant :-) * 0_stars .
Electrical_goods	perfect item as_described
Electrical_goods	thanks
Electrical_goods	really informative website .
Electrical_goods	the company ' s product review rated the item ( soundmagic pl00 ) very highly , yet the headphones still turned_out to be even better_than_expected .
Electrical_goods	significantly better_than the denon ' s , originally costing twice as much , that they replaced .
Electrical_goods	good price .
Electrical_goods	faultless communication_throughout .
Electrical_goods	delivery via_royal_mail within_00hrs .
Electrical_goods	and yes , finding a lollipop at the bottom of the parcel did make me smile !
Electrical_goods	thanks would buy from u agin very good time on delivery and a grate price thanks ones agin

Electrical_goods	all items were delivered very quickly , even_though i had a problem with one of the amps hifi - towers were really apologetic and gave me a small refund as a gesture of good will and delivered my replacement amp in the same week !
Electrical_goods	amazing !
Electrical_goods	there customer_service is top_class and will_defiantly use them again !
Electrical_goods	thanks so much !
Electrical_goods	after getting an_email back pretty_much instantly , i feel as if they are trust_worthy and their products look great and i will be making future_purchases with them
Electrical_goods	well what can i say , ordered on a thursday_morning and it arrived on the monday_afternoon .... better job than companies in the uk .
Electrical_goods	i ' m a very happy customer ;)
Electrical_goods	i ordered some £_00 headphones from hifiheadphones yesterday at about 0pm .
Electrical_goods	had an_email asking me to cotact them to confirm some details which i was happy to do .
Electrical_goods	nice to know the company cares_about it ' s customers .
Electrical_goods	the headphones were delivered today around midday , very well packages .
Electrical_goods	i was really shocked how quick they arrived .
Electrical_goods	customer_service was fantastic and i had regular_updates informing_me that the package had been dispatched .
Electrical_goods	i will_definately be recommending these_guys to my mates .
Electrical_goods	fantasic service guys .
Electrical_goods	gratz
Electrical_goods	the earphones received were of poor quality the sound crackled on use .
Electrical_goods	soundmagic pl00 in - ear sound isolating earphones .
Electrical_goods	further to this poor product my credit_card was compromised with fraudulent transactions .
Electrical_goods	shoddy .
Electrical_goods	i bought a panasonic lumix camera for my daughters_birthday and doing well in her exams , we did not realise the company was based in hong_kong until the camera arrived .
Electrical_goods	we have had the camera now for nine months and has only been used on several_occasions , family events ect .
Electrical_goods	now all of a sudden the shutter and zoom has stopped_working so we sent it away to be repaired .
Electrical_goods	costing us 00 pounds .
Electrical_goods	digital_rev said that the warranty on the camera will not cover the problem even_though the repairer stated it was a faulty part .
Electrical_goods	digital_rev stated it was down to ware and tare - in other words they did not want to know .
Electrical_goods	the repairer stated if the product was bought in the uk the warranty would have covered the problem without question .
Electrical_goods	in other words when you purchase off digital_rev realistically the warranty does not exist .
Electrical_goods	you might be lucky , but for the sake of 00 , 00 , 00 pounds it is really not worth the risk .
Electrical_goods	this is truly a dodgey company .

Electrical_goods	the lens was well_packaged , delivery came very quickly and had tracking_information all the way through .
Electrical_goods	also like that the follow_up email sounded a bit more human rather_than a robotic " thanks for the purchase , insert review here ".
Electrical_goods	it might still be an_automated email but at_least it ' s with a bit more effort and thought to presentation .
Electrical_goods	i was of course dubious of all these high rating reviews especially after seeing some of the other non - uk stores and their blackhat tactics .

Electrical_goods	i recently_bought 0 vision ego kits from safercigs , one for myself and one for my wife a 000 and a 0000 with a few bottles of juice .
Electrical_goods	the battery ' s are fine no issues with that or the juice ' s however the vision egos themself were all ment to be the one ' s with replaceable atomisers and they were not they were just the standard one piece but also one of them didnt work at all .
Electrical_goods	another thing is the travel case ' s that arrived with them were personalised with the name " darren " on them which have absolutely no relevance to myself or my wife .
Electrical_goods	the thing that really disappointed me the most was the customer_service side of things , i sent them an_email regarding the issues and have had absolutely no response the impression i get is that they got my money and now couldnt care less in light of all the issues i was extremely disappointed and will not be using this company again .

Electrical_goods	i bought a sony bravia tv kdl00w000 for £ 0000 , went all the way from oxford to the store , as it was a pick_up only deal . fast and easy transaction in store .
Electrical_goods	got back home , started unboxing and .
Electrical_goods	that ' s where it started .
Electrical_goods	power_cable were unpacked , hanging on the top of the tv ( where it should have been originally wrapped tight in a plastic_bag attached at the back of the tv ) , the power plug that goes in the power socked were obviously used , marks visible on it .
Electrical_goods	i phoned hispek to tell them what i got , they did get back to me as after doing some investigations , saying that it is impossible and it never happened before .
Electrical_goods	i phoned sony to find out how it comes in the package , they said it ' s definitely not the way it should be and i need to find out with company why .
Electrical_goods	but all that hispec offered me , was to bring it back all the way down from oxford again .
Electrical_goods	i am very disappointed as i paid for brand_new tv and got a possible customer return , ex display or else , which of course according to hispek wasn ' t .
Electrical_goods	after my last email to them which was a week_ago , they never got back to me .
Electrical_goods	i would never buy from them again .
Electrical_goods	also a warning for these that comes from far away for in store purchase , i would recomend to check the item while in store , so you won ' t end up like me .
Electrical_goods	be aware !
Electrical_goods	hi
Electrical_goods	took time to decide which camera to buy .
Electrical_goods	tekshop000 had a good price .
Electrical_goods	i placed an order on - line and got it delivered in two days . i choose 0 - 0 days shipping from there website . they emailed when they shipped the order .. i never had a need to phone them so cant say how good they are on the phone .
Electrical_goods	this purchase was for my first dslr camera as i want to take up photography .
Electrical_goods	after looking around on the internet for my chosen model ( nikon_d0000 ) digitalrev offered the best price by quite a substantial margin for the body and a 00 - 00mm_lens , which is great to start with .
Electrical_goods	after_placing my order late on a sunday_evening i was not expecting to receive it until the end of the week at_least , as i live in south wales , uk .
Electrical_goods	however , it was dispatched on monday and it arrived on wednesday which was amazing .
Electrical_goods	the tracking on the order was brilliant as you can check the progress too .
Electrical_goods	the camera was extremely well_packaged and a uk plug adapter was also included which was helpful .
Electrical_goods	i am really pleased with the camera so far and would recommend the camera to others .
Electrical_goods	you can find plenty of reviews on the internet about this camera .
Electrical_goods	as previous reviews state the instructions aren ' t in english .
Electrical_goods	however , you can easily download a pdf manual off the nikon site so this isn ' t a problem .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely_recommend this site to others , and already have done .
Electrical_goods	i will also return to purchase lenses etc in future .
Electrical_goods	cannot_fault the item or service supplied by digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	cheapest for the monitor and delivery on time .

Electrical_goods	there ' s a simple instruction of how to use the pads inside .
Electrical_goods	the bag is light which is great to carry around .
Electrical_goods	i bought it to travel with me abroad and it didn ' t take much space on the overhead space either .
Electrical_goods	the price is also reasonable .
Electrical_goods	i do highly_recommend it .
Electrical_goods	thats right i ordered it and it arrived from_hong_kong to the uk within 00_hours which is absolutely astonishing , it came in plenty of packaging and works like a charm :)

Cell_phone_Recycling	the day i sent my phone , they accepted it and paid out .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was told 0 working_days plus to get the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the received it the next_day , by 0 : 00 that day the money was on the way to my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will use these over anyone_else in the future
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have sent them my blackberry phones , i had them refurbished recently and they look like new .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wanted to try these_guys as the price was the highest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i paid for special delivery to send these phones to them as wasnt too sure on them and wanted to make_sure them get them quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they tried to stich me up by reducing the price for each phone to nearly 0rd of the value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after trying to get them to offer the original price and sending loads of emails i in the end askled for the phones to be sent back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 weeks_later i finally got them back and the protective screen covers i had on them have been removed by this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	dont use them if you can help it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	bye
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have been using loads of different companies to recycle my mobile_phones and let me tell you ; fonebank are just the best .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the pay the best money , send money quick and if you do have any_queries they sort them out without any funny delays .
Cell_phone_Recycling	always use these_guys . just fantastic
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent off my old_nokia to mazuma with some reservations as there are some negative_reviews out there .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however i can not praise the speed and ease of service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone to them last monday and by wednesday the sale was complete with the funds in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant service highly_recommended
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cannot_believe the speed and efficiency in which my order was processesd .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it only took a few_days from me sending the fone in to getting my payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service is excellent and i will_definately use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the 0rd time i have used mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the 0st time i received my cheque by return post .
Cell_phone_Recycling	on the other occasions , i have had the money transfered and it was in my account by 0000 on the day they received the phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you could not wish for a smoother transaction .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma is a company i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend to my friends and family - 0st_class !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent out the envelope very quickly , received my phone and notified me even quicker and paid the money into my account the same day - excellent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	filled the online form , received the freepost_bag the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and received the money in my bank_account 00_hrs later after sending the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast and reliable service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after upgrading with phones0u , the sales_person advised a recycling comparison site for old_phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the result to give most money for my galaxy sii was money0yourphone . com and after some research online , i opted for them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	checkout was extremely easy and in 0 minutes the order was complete .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had ordered a bag to send the phone in but it took 0 or 0 days to arrive , before which i ' d requested another ( which also turned_up in about the same amount of time ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	whether this is down to m0yp or the royal_mail , i don ' t know .
Cell_phone_Recycling	be sure to send your phone as special delivery as this covers you up to £_000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	signed for mail i believe is only £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	emails for when my phone arrived with them and was tested are good , meaning you are kept in the loop .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment does admittedly take a number of days after this ( i had the money in my account in full , 0 days before the date they stated however ) so if you ' re in a rush for the money , you may have to look_elsewhere .
Cell_phone_Recycling	given the amount they gave for my phone , and ignoring the envelope and delayed payment issues , i would definitely_recommend these_guys .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they paid the most for my phone by a good 00 or 00_% i ' d say .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma are faultless , excellent customer_service team with a quick start to finish service these_guys are always friendly , would highly_recommend - 0 + stars
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent in my ipad yesterday via special delivery next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was emailed this morning to say it had been received , then lunch time to say it had been checked , then this afternoon to say they had paid me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i checked my bank_account and the money is there already .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it literally took 00_hours to send my ipad and get paid for it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cannot_fault them , and i will_definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' m a little_bit in shock , to be honest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i didn ' t think you could get service like this .
Cell_phone_Recycling	says it all in the title !
Cell_phone_Recycling	beware of less well_known recycling firms who offer you more money as they invariably then offer you a lower offer when they receive the phone - no issues like that with muzumba .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i went to mazuma because the song on the advert was stuck in my head , it was so quick and easy to do , and even when we hadn ' t sent the form back they prompted us which was nice and 0 days_later ( from day of posting ) the money was sat in the bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would always use mazuma now
Cell_phone_Recycling	got the price advertised transferred into my account the day after posting my old phone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma is excellent , great friendly , trustworthy company and highly been recomended to any one who_wants to get_rid of thier old_phones , easy and really simple to use excellent
Cell_phone_Recycling	when selling my mobile i used a comparison site and mazuma came out as offering the best price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent off phone on a saturday , received confirmation it had been received on monday and received my argos_voucher on tuesday - fantastic .
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything went_smoothly and you have the option of choosing cash or argos_voucher with a higher value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 days mega
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was thoroughly_impressed by the speedy_delivery of the paper work and their complete efficiency in dealing_with the whole_process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i thoroughly_recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i tried a different company as they were offering more money than mazuma , but it turns_out that mpx is a big scam and i would advise everyone to steer_clear of them and trust mazuma over other_companies false claims to be better_than them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very reliable service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as the company was in london i decided to drop it off , unfortunately their office hours were exactly that of mine so i weren ' t able to go during their office hours .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however i decided to drop my phone there through the post on friday_evening .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so on tuesday when i haven ' t heard_anything back i emailed them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	on wednesday they first came back as not found but after couple of hours got a reponse saying everything was processed with no_problems .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i didn ' t really have any_problems and that ' s why the full stars , i got scared that they wouldn ' t be trustworthy and just say my phone was " gone " as i didn ' t really have any way to prove it . however was very positively_surprised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast payment through the post and very reasonable_price :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	have used mazuma several_times for cheap and expensive phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	each time no hassle and payment received ( cheque ) the following_day after being received by mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this time i tried the payment direct through my bank_account and this service was excellent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was transferred to my bank same day mazuma received my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma a long time and will do for a long time to come ... excellent
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick easy way of getting some cash .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_complaints .

Cell_phone_Recycling	very good service and very easy to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the third time ive used mazuma , each time we have found it so quick and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	we always get argos_vouchers , and always have that within a few_days , but we are kept in the loop via_email to let u know when ure fones been received and when ure argos card has been sent out .... im so happy with the service that i havent even considered trying out another company ... and we will_continue to use mazuma twice a year to recycle our old_phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	keep up the good work !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	very smooth pleasant_transaction
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend mazuma to everyone one who asks about selling a phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really fast reliable from beginning to to end .
Cell_phone_Recycling	00 out of 00
Cell_phone_Recycling	after applying online , i received my postage bag the next_day , sent my phone off and then received my cash 0 days_later !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve used mazuma countless_times and the service is always faultless and fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t fault the company at all .
Cell_phone_Recycling	simple as that .
Cell_phone_Recycling	third time i have used mazuma and again it was great all_round .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma could not be more highly_recommended by myself ; i completed the required details and had my pack sent to me , which actually arrived the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phone at 0pm and received an_email from mazuma at 00 :_00am the next_day saying payment would be made shortly ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had my money by 00pm , less_than 00_hours from time of postage !
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant !
Cell_phone_Recycling	as i said in my review , i did exactly_what said in your instructions and i suposed that you paid royal_mail for a special delivery and they should know that is a mobile phone and you already know that i ' ll sent you a expensive mobile phone and now i have instead a brand_new galaxy_s0 a broken galaxy_s0 , thank_you very much .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and i ' m waiting for the informations to fill the complain formulary ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone to mazuma on saturday_morning and the money as quoted was in my account for monday_afternoon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent , honest and reliable service , will recommend to friends and would use again !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	having heard many bad_reviews on various sites about the different mobile recycle companies i was dubious to try it , but i find putting stuff on ebay a hassle now days so didn ' t want to do that .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i decided to give mazuma a chance .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was quoted from the website £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phones off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a day later i had an_email_saying the phones had been recevied and a cheque posted out .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the very next_day a cheque for £_00 arrives through the door .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was absolutely amazed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got a fair price for the phones and the payment within 0 days of posting my phones off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will_definitely use mazuma_mobile next time to recycle a phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	envirofone were incredibly efficient with regard to sending me my packaging along with sending me the money for my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	their reminder emails were very helpful and their pricing was fair
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have been exploring many websites that deal with mobile recycling but i was recommended mazuma by a few friends saying how quick and easy it was as well as great value for money so i thought id take a gamble .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have to say this is probably one of the most efficient and outstanding websites i have come_across .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not only was it easy to place an order , but the efficiency from when i sent the phones to you to when i received confirmation that the money was transferred to my account was astonishing !
Cell_phone_Recycling	literally about 00_hours it took .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the money i received will now be going towards a few special presents as its my mums 00th coming up as well as my son oscars first birthday coming up .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you to all the staff who work for mazuma , you are all a credit to yourselves and i will be recommending your site to everybody !

Cell_phone_Recycling	will_defiantly use first time next tune .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i decided to use mazumamobile based on the great reputation they have for customer_service and i wasn ' t dissapointed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website was very easy to use and only to a couple of minutes to place an order to send three phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the price quoted was up there with the other_websites too .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the pack to send the phones in arrived the next_day and again was easy to use with the forms to submit already completed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	free p_& p too .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i went for the option of a cheque and this arrived two days_later , even in all the postal delays due to the snow .
Cell_phone_Recycling	now i know the system works i ' d probably use the bank_transfer next time .

Cell_phone_Recycling	00 out of 00 for sure , a really positive experience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great way to turn drawer clutter into cash .

Cell_phone_Recycling	really excellent service , would reccomend & definitely use again when needing to recycle a mobile phone :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i only went with envirofone because i had read they pay you the same day as soon as the phone has been checked over .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wouldn ' t go with them again simply because of this .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had to wait a week for my payment after they got my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i actually phoned when i had an_email_saying they had my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i waited until 0pm for the money but i asked them why i hadn ' t had it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was told it isn ' t same day and loads of people had also said the same_thing i did to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so sort it out and make it clear to customers !
Cell_phone_Recycling	having just sent off my second old phone and received my argos_voucher back in a couple of days i can highly_recommend this service !, very good communication by email , fast postage of both the pre paid bag and the payment voucher - mush faster_than the alternative of selling it yourself on a well_known auction site .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definately use this again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i simply cannot_fault the service provided .
Cell_phone_Recycling	top draw .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very useful website , super easy to use and definitely better_than manually searching the net for the best price i can get for my old_phones - i didnt even know there were so many companies or that my old phone could be worth twice as much as some of the bigger named companies advertise on their websites .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would use again and highly_recommend
Cell_phone_Recycling	it pays you significantly more_than any other company , and it ' s simple , easy , and free to post your old_phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	never had a problem and quick payment too !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted phone on wednesday and had the agreed amount of money in my bank_account the day after .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t believe_how quick they were in processing the order
Cell_phone_Recycling	great speedy service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a great offering and brilliant way to get_rid of those old_phones !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a bit_sceptical after_reading several reviews online about these cash for phones companys , and although mazuma didnt offer the best price (£ 00 - mazuma , the highest being £_000 ), they had the best reviews .
Cell_phone_Recycling	people were claiming to have been ripped_off by the companys offering more money saying they had recieved damaged phones , and giving out a fraction of the advertised price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after choosing mazuma i emailed them to inform them my keypad surround was missing and one corner of the phone was dented , and would this still qualify for the full_amount , which they said it would .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( i kept the email incase of any_issues down the line , i then sent my phone with royal_mail , insured for free up to 00 pounds as_described in mazumas directions , and after 0 days received a confirmation_email , and the money straight into my bank_account :).
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definitely use mazuma again , and have no quams recoomending them to others !
Cell_phone_Recycling	knocks socks off others
Cell_phone_Recycling	this was my first time selling a mobile phone over the internet so i was a little_nervous .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i read a few reviews of different companies and fonebank seemed to have consistantly good reviews .
Cell_phone_Recycling	their prices for phones are good but not the highest on the web - although i hear some of the other_companies quote high prices on their website then when you actually send your phone they knock it down by 00_% saying it ' s not in perfect_condition - who ' s phone is by the end of a contract period !
Cell_phone_Recycling	anyway no such issues with fonebank , sent phone recorded_delivery , the next_day received email confirmation they had received phone and set_up a bacs payment , £_000 was in my bank 0 days_later - top service - thank_you !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	wednesday : registered phone with mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	thursday : posted phone to mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	friday : mazuma received phone and issued argos_voucher
Cell_phone_Recycling	saturday : got my voucher in time for a shopping trip !
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant , fast service from mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	other_companies that i have used can take up to two_weeks to assess the phone and issue the voucher , i had this voucher two days after posting my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	amazingly speedy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	and i ' d definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 * service from mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i find sold my phone was quick and easy
Cell_phone_Recycling	five_stars - i have sold three phones now and the service has been fantastic every time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will only use mazuma for selling my phones in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you for your excellent customer_service mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	found website really easy to use , postal bag came through quickly and money went into my account with no_probs ... deffo_use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service and quick payment , emails to keep me updated and free delivery print off slip to send phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	perfect
Cell_phone_Recycling	i tried envirofone first who offered me less_than 00_% of what mazuma did and took 00x longer in doing so .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really good service , phone received within 0 days , cheque received within 0 working_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good all_round !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my damaged iphone 0 to envirofone because they said " we don ’ t offer an average price for a faulty phone ; instead we take the time to test each_individual mobile so that you get an individual price for the individual fault ."
Cell_phone_Recycling	after saying they haven ' t received my phone for 0 days ( when intact the tracker showed they had ) i contacted them and amazingly the next_day they had not only received the phone , but had tested it and found it was damaged .
Cell_phone_Recycling	everywhere was offering me around £_00 for my faulty phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after taking their time they offer me a paltry £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	£_00 less_than almost every competitor .
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolute waste of time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	what has happened .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used envirofone many many years_ago when they were the industry leaders and pioneers .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( sold some old nokias ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	they are a shadow of their former self and are trading on their name .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service , very quick and easy , transaction was very fast and i am very happy to use this service again as they have very reasonable prices for my old_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fantastic price paid at a very fast rate
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything went smooth !
Cell_phone_Recycling	no hassle service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	registered online and sent phone in on same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the following_morning received an_email to say the phone had been received and the payment being transferred .
Cell_phone_Recycling	two days_later , money in account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick , efficient , good value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would highly_recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service and a pleasure to deal with .
Cell_phone_Recycling	super smooth_transaction and a great price for my phone
Cell_phone_Recycling	really easy , not the best price but the most trustworthy and really clear_instructions .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was very easy from start to finish .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sign_up was easy and you just had to print off the postage label and post it yourself .
Cell_phone_Recycling	when i was delayed posting it they emailed to check everything was ok and they held the price for 0 weeks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have been there customer for very long time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the payment process is very fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	amazing very happy with everything
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma blew me away !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they offered a fair price for my phone and all was done and dusted 0 days from me posting phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would 000_% use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	a guide price was given before i sent in my phone , the pre_- paid envelope arrived a couple of days_later and i popped my phone in and waved goodbye .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was missing a button on the keypad so i was expecting to be contacted about receiving a reduced price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was pleasantly_surprised when i got an_email from mazuma the next_day saying that the full_amount would be paid and that the money would be in my account by midnight .
Cell_phone_Recycling	happy days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks for the dosh !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick payment !
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything was really quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the envelope arrived the next_day and i had money in my account that week !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy to use service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	detailed emails explaining what is happening and when the money will be transferred .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely_recommend to friends and family .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the post back envelope arrived_promptly and i recieved payment 0 days after i sent the phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy transaction cash paid straight_away - thanks
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent iphone 0 in good condition , sent recorded_delivery , then got email_saying screen cracked which is a joke as this had bubble rap and was in a case , said phone screen cracked so it was put down form 000 to 00 , i have sent many phone before with out problem , this has made me so mad and i will never trust this company again , would not surprise me if the company has been sold to somebody_else .
Cell_phone_Recycling	never ever using this again !.
Cell_phone_Recycling	just seen the reply , 0 its my word vs your word about phone being damaged .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 you could have damaged it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 . what the point off sending phone back if its been damaged .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thats why i took the price in the first place its one big joke , like i say never will
Cell_phone_Recycling	use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	.............................. update ..................................................
Cell_phone_Recycling	will never use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thats the end .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found the website very easy to use the pre_- paid envelope arrived the next_day , i posted it off and the money was in my account the same day they acknowledged receipt of my phone ... you cant_beat that for service very fast and efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very impressed with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy to arrange for the mobile to be sent off and i got paid the amount i was promised very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would highly_recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	an entirely hassle_free process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i entered what was required online , printed one document and because i was eager for my money , i sent it in a padded bag that i had lying_around .
Cell_phone_Recycling	although it ' s freepost , i ' d recommend queueing at the post_office for a proof of posting , just for the £_00 compensation cover should your phone go missing in transit .
Cell_phone_Recycling	within three days my phone had been received and the money was in my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had considered selling it on ebay , but the hassle of advertising it , the fees and the risk that the buyer would want to return it just put me off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so impressed that my partner has sent their phones to mazuma as well , and they got exactly the same great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended !
Cell_phone_Recycling	probably the best and smoooooooth transactions ever very quick and class service , defenatley recomend
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found it so good because i didn ' t realise how much i would get for an old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i compred other recycling phone websites and mazuma was the best by_far .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was slightly hesitant to send my phone off , even_though i will never use it again , to a company and rely_on them being ' honest ' enough to acknowledge it ' s delivery .. never mind giving me the money we ' d agreed upon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was stupid !
Cell_phone_Recycling	every_step was easy with mazuma_mobile , i just put my phone in an old box i had sitting around , sat that in the plastic envelope thing they sent me .. popped in my order form then handed it over at the post_office ( finding an open post_office was a nightmare , but that ' s a complaint for someone_else ! )
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 days_later , money is in my account as agreed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	:)
Cell_phone_Recycling	from the moment i applied for their pack the whole_process was quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my return envelope arrived within two days allowing me to send my old_phones off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as i had asked to be paid by cheque i didn ' t receive my money on the day they arrived but my cheque came through my door 0 days after sending the old_phones off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the cheque was for the money i had been quoted .
Cell_phone_Recycling	overall i was very happy with the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easey way to sell best place
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve used fonebanker for years every since my se k000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you can get more money from other_companies but fonebanker is easy to use and fast payment times .

Cell_phone_Recycling	would use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great communication and incredibly fast payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really like the option to print off the paperwork at home instead of wiating for your pack to arrive .
Cell_phone_Recycling	in the last_year i ' ve sold 0 phones on mazuma and every_single service has been great , prompt efficent and very helpful .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only one issue with pricing but that was a fault i had caused to the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	other than that happily_recommend their service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	speedy payment , easy to use site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would be nice if they had an i - phone app .

Cell_phone_Recycling	well impressed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	dedicated service to get you the best deal .
Cell_phone_Recycling	from postage to payment , no_problems at all .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma has exceeded my expectation yet again , such a speedy service with updates_throughout the whole_process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not only that but now bank_transfers are available so money is in your account even quicker .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_continue to use mazuma every time !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the price quoted for 0 phones was the best i could find anywhere .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received the prepaid bag within a couple of days and the money in my bank a few_days after posting the phones back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not much else i can say other than it was very simple .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i just got an upgrade from my phone provider & had a scratched & dusty old 0 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got my new phone & stuck the old 0 in my drawer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a friend at work said i should sell it to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i looked up the price & the phone was fully functioning so seemed a waste not to at_least try .
Cell_phone_Recycling	honestly it was so easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i signed_up online & gave all my details & requested a pre_- paid envelope for my phone ( this was the longest part of the process ) a day later i got the ennvelope !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i deleted all my stuff from my old phone , cleaned it down & sent it off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got an_email a day later from mazuma ( communication is fantastic !)
Cell_phone_Recycling	to let me know they had recieved it and the next_day i had £_00 in my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma twice since , once for another working handset & once for an ancient phone which was broken .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this totalled another £_00 direct into my bank_account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	exact_same experience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would reccommend to anyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quicker_than cashing a cheque !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy to use , simply printed , posted and got paid !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was all straightforward until they emailed me and said they ' d found a fault with my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it worked_perfectly well and i only wanted to sell it as i ' d upgraded and need some extra cash to put towards my holiday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i now don ' t have the box as i didn ' t need to send it with the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so i ' ll get less selling privately .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not at all happy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be using mazuma next time ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	also received an_email after i ' d sent the phone saying they hadn ' t received it ( rude , give me a chance i work full time )
Cell_phone_Recycling	not impressed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a lot of messing_around with envirofone , so got my phone back and sent it straight to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my mobile to them yesterday , today it has been processed and the money is already in my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am absolutely over the moon with this service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend them to everybody looking to sell their old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	honestly couldn ' t fault them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will only ever use these from now on .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you so much for a great , fast and easy service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my iphone_0s to them yesterday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i went on to my account today to find they ' d knocke the price down by £_000 because the phone " tested faulty ".
Cell_phone_Recycling	there is a tiny cosmetic mark on the front and when i rang customer_services i was told that this classes the phone as faulty .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the advisor told me that they sell the phone on so they can ' t accept cosmetic damages !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' m absolutely_disgusted that because of a tiny little mark they won ' t pay the price that the phone is worth !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the fact is , it costs £_00 to make the repair to fix the cosmetic_damage so they ' re expecting to make a huge profit out of taking_advantage of my " naivety ".
Cell_phone_Recycling	well i ' m not giving them that satisfaction .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve requested the phone back and i will sell it on myself for what the phone is actually worth .
Cell_phone_Recycling	rip_off_merchants , avoid at all costs !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used a site like this before and not had a good experience , but mazuma_mobile were brilliant !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website was easy to use , the price was good and the service was problem free .

Cell_phone_Recycling	sold a broken phone for £_00 which would otherwise be thrown away / recycled .
Cell_phone_Recycling	pre_- paid envelope arrived next_day for the phone to be sent out and payment was received two days after i send the mobile phone off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	can ' t fault mazuma_mobile i have an account which i have used to sell several phone .

Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definately be selling my next phone to them when it is time to up grade !
Cell_phone_Recycling	keep up the good work x_x_x
Cell_phone_Recycling	was very good experience however , the sell order before phone apprantly did not get recived and i lost my dal
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone off to them on the 00 / 00 /_0000 and it is still not with them they should not make their return envelopes so obvious so they can be intercepted in the post by thieves in the royal_mail !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i feel this is a major issue that needs to be dealt_with by the company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	now i have to wait_till july before i can have a decent phone again !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i received that on the tuesday , sent the phone back and got my email on the wednesday saying they had the phone and would send me my payment that day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	wanted an instant transfer and that ' s exactly_what i got , no_quibble , just money in the bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if i ' d have known it was that easy i would have done it ages_ago instead of giving my old_phones away .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good price too for a phone i haven ' t used in months .
Cell_phone_Recycling	wouldn ' t have even thought about it but happened to see an advert on the box and thought " why not ".
Cell_phone_Recycling	deffo gonna be using this company again and i reccommend you do the same if you ' ve got a phone kicking about !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	there are many of these televised phone buying websites but following their release of an advert which is related to charlie and the chocolate factory , i knew which was the company to use !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i went online and got a quote for my old iphone and compared that to the prices people were paying on ebay , i opted for mazuma as the price was fair and it would cut out the extra costs i . e .
Cell_phone_Recycling	commission / listing fees on ebay .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone which cost £ 0 . 00 through insured mail and received emails constantly keeping me updated on the process and then my cheque arrived within days .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i was updated all the way through with the process - unlike cash0phones who i have had to ring 0times and now threatened legal_action aswell as sent the managing_director a message on linkedin advising i have sent a complaint to watchdog - which i have - all to no reponse but they can send reminder letters about my sisters phone i enquired_about sending !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	firstly , mazuma offered the best price for recycling the phone i had out of any of the other recycling websites .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone i had also had a shattered screen , which several other_websites would not accept , but mazuma did .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recieved the free postage envelope quickly , and they recieved the phone quickly after i posted it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was then paid ... quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks for doing what you say you will mazuma .

Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma accepted my phone as working even_though i told them in_advance that the buttons were a bit sticky and there was some superficial damage .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone recorded_delivery on the tuesday , had it accepted on the wednesday and had the money in my account on the friday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definately use this company again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast turn - around and all_round excellent service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	what a simple website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ’ ve done my research and after checking out 00 different recycling websites i have to say this is definitely the simplest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	search your phone , place the order and wait for your money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ’ t be easier .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the communication is really good .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received an_email all the way through the order .
Cell_phone_Recycling	when they received the phone , when it was tested and when i would be paid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	try it out for yourselves .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you won ’ t be disappointed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wasn ' t .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got a new phone on contract and i really didn ' t like the handset i just couldn ' t get to grips with it just wanted a quick and easy sale a friend_recommended enviro phone to so i went online and was amazed at the price offered from start to finish you were kept in the loop at all of the stages they are very professional and very fast sending out the packaging and when sending payment i would definitely reccomend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a price and got a check for the amount agreed on the site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	used them before a few_years_ago , trustworthy and reliable site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they weren ' t the highest offer compared to others , but having read some bad_reviews of other_sites , and seen a whole range of companies i ' d never even heard of i stuck with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my phone was in perfect working order but looked very tired for 0 years use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i don ' t think others would have given me the price they originally_quoted .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be using again in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	at first i was a little iffy about sending off my old_mobiles , but the process was easy , quick and most_importantly safe .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after putting in the brand and type of mobiles i wanted to get_rid of on the mazuma website , i was shown how much i could get for them and once i accepted the amount , i chose the best payment option .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then , i got sent the envelope and off they went !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the payment got sent within two days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	placed order on the tuesday and had received payment by the friday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i visited the website and printed off the address label and other required paperwork .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i popped my mobile in a jiffy_bag and the next_day received confirmation that it had arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone was processed and checked , i opted for the same day transfer and was notified when the money was put into my bank !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got £_00 for my phone which was a very welcome january bonus !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent posted tuesday got money wednesday amazing service perfect in everyway
Cell_phone_Recycling	clever service but reward is poor
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wanted to sell my old phone and looked at many websites .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fonebank . com offered me the best value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	what you have to do is just select the phone you want to sell .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you search using the phone ' s imei no then it ' s much_quicker .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then you send the phone to a free post address and i receive the cheque .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have received my cheque in 0 working_days and for the value that i was promised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a bunch of old_mobiles in a drawer - i mean , who doesn ' t ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	- so i decided to make a few pennies from them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma was almost certainly the simplest way to go .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you add a list of imei numbers ( that ' s the unique identifier for your mobile ) and then they give you a price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they ' ll even have broken phones off you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i asked for a free postage pack that arrived a few_days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( you might want to order a couple if you ' ve got a number of phones as the cardboard container was quite tight once packed with four .)
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you take it to a post_office you ' ll be able to ask for " proof of postage " which covers you for £_00 free insurance .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( you ' d be mad not to .)
Cell_phone_Recycling	a few_days_later , a cheque arrives in the post .
Cell_phone_Recycling	done .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process is so simple and i had the money in my account within 0 days of deciding to sell my ipad !
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely_brilliant service and would recommend to anyone
Cell_phone_Recycling	am very pleased with this service & would definitely_recommend it to all my friends & would also use in the future !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	many_thanks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my phone on the day it was approved somehow it hasnt made it there ???
Cell_phone_Recycling	tried to contct with no joy .... was worth more_than 00 quid coud this be the reason ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	every other phone was next to no value got there just fine !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent the phone off on thursday , received an_email_saying it had been received on friday and the cheque arrived on saturday !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	what more could you ask for , a professional , simple and fast transaction , i wouldn ' t use any other mobile phone_recycling company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	awesome very fast and smooth payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i though might be longer then what i have expect but was very fast thank_you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the second time i have used fonebank the first time being a few_years back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	nothing has changed the service is still easy to use and my orders have completed with the exact amount being paid for each phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have read negative_reviews but in my opinion if you send you old phone in and it is exactly as it should be meeting the criteria then you will be paid the full_amount simple !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i look_forward to using fonebank again in the future when my next upgrade is due .
Cell_phone_Recycling	... so i ' m still not too sure how our old_mobiles are worth money these days and they never used to be but this is now the second time i ' ve used mazumamobile and they ' ve been brilliant .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a bit_sceptical about sending the phones first and even worried was it some sort of scam but as it was an old_mobile i would have binned anyway i thought i ' d nothing to lose so gave it a go .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process of me going on the website to them sending the bag to me posting it back ( all prepaid and just through a normal post box so no hassle there ) and the money hitting my account took less_than a week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ended_up sending my old blackberry too a few_months later and the service was just as quick and hassle_free .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they do what they say on the tin and couldn ' t make the process any easier given they do need to see the phones first to check they ' re as you say on the website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they also send some emails to keep you updated on status which is helpful .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t recommend them more if you ' ve any old_mobiles lying about doing nothing !
Cell_phone_Recycling	took the hassle out of finding the best price for my phone in mins !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i chose to drop the phone into the fonebank office .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they were very friendly and processed it the same day as promised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the offer was competitive and money promptly arrived in my account a couple of days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended ( having used a couple of competitors :-)
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick to respond , quickly processed , got money quickly , well_done
Cell_phone_Recycling	i placed my order with mazuma yesterday , i choose to send my phone special delivery using the printed label , i recieved an_email this morning confirming recieipt of the phone , and that payment would be made to my bank_account today .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this afternoon , had the amount quoted paid into my bank_account ,
Cell_phone_Recycling	outstanding service , from an excellant company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is my second time in using this company and would go no where else in the future :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found that out of all the mobile recyle companies that mazuma have the edge over them and are very reasonable prices given and that they accept mobiles that are not working and they are helpful , they keep to their promise and process the phones and money on the same day i ' ll definately recomend mazuma to my family and friends
Cell_phone_Recycling	so quick and easy this is the 0th time i ' ve used mazuma would reccomend to everyone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recently sold my mobile phone through mazuma , i got a quote off the website , confirmed that i was happy with what they offered me and within next few_days i received the free post bag and delivery note to send my mobile phone to them in .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then within the next couple of days the cheque was delivered back to me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy , convenient and reliable .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent communication through whole_process via_email .
Cell_phone_Recycling	000_% satisfied and would recommend everyone to use it if they are wanting to sell their mobile phone at a good price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the envelope to send off my phone arrived really quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got email confirmation after a day or 0 tht my phone had passed the tests and they gave me a date of about 0 working_days that the money would be in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was there in the day they said .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely use this company again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	flawless
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am not joking ... mazuma_mobile saved me big time ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	when i thought all hope was gone and i was really upset because i couldn ' t do anything with my mobile ... mazuma_mobile accepted it and gave me a brilliant price for it !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was seriously over the moon !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i can ' t thank mazuma_mobile enough ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you !!>..
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 -)
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_problems happy with the service i received
Cell_phone_Recycling	the site is very easy to navigate and select your phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the sell process is a breeze , the pack arrives the next_day and now that they offer payment by faster payment transfer the whole_process only takes a few_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great way to make some quick cash out of the smartphone graveyard that is my desk drawer !
Cell_phone_Recycling	simple , as seamless as it can be and held on to all promises .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was recommended to me and i shall recommend and use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	honest value and good communication
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was very quick , easy & hassle_free from start to finish .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they send out the packaging for you to send your old phone back along with very clear intructions and within a couple of days the payment is sent on a argos card and takes a day to activate .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the second time i have used mazuma and will do again in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will certainly recommend to friends and family
Cell_phone_Recycling	extremely simple process which saw money in hand in under two_weeks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very well run and great price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happily sold my phone on mazuma and the turn_around was really quick and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once they recieved my phone the money was in my account 0 days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the fourth time i have used this company and they continue to do business well .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast , reliable and honest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_continue to use and recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault , though it would have been better if the bag provided had bubble_wrap inside as i had to use tissue to make_sure that the phone was not broken in transit .
Cell_phone_Recycling	amazing service !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they text to say they had recieved the phone the day after i sent it and the cash was paid into my paypal account the same afternoon !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank u :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma a couple of times now , with no_problems and always prompt payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	arrived soon after i sent my phone website was easy to follow overall was an easy way to get_rid of my old phone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	im aware that ' reasonable within available method ' is a bit_confusing ... what i mean by that is that a company who relies on another company to complete it ' s business , and in this case mazuma relies on royal_mail or independent couriers , can only really provide a standard of service reflective of a standard set by the postal / courier service ... and on this occasion that was very slow , so indirectly mazuma didn ' t send me my bank_transfer for a long time , nearly 0 weeks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s ok to say mazuma will send a bank_transfer the day they receive the phone , but if the courier fails to deliver timely then it ' s an inconvenience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and although i respect that mazuma have no control over post , at the same time , they can only , having the type of business they do that relies havily on another business , recieve , 0_stars .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very impressed with the service and very fast payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they paid me exactly_what they said they would and also paid the money into my bank the same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received the bag for my phone the next_day after e_- mailing and received notiifcation of mazuma getting the phone the following_day and got the cheque a few_days letter - amazingly quick service and really easy to use - was impressed and would use mazuma again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	was unsure at first as the branding makes it look like a scam .
Cell_phone_Recycling	e . g .
Cell_phone_Recycling	send us your gold and we ' ll send you a cheque .
Cell_phone_Recycling	yeah , sure .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the opposite was true , very impressed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i think they should publicise what they ' re doing with the phones to be able to pay so well ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process took 00_hours !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i printed off the forms , packed the envelope with my htc hero and sent it off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was in my account in 00_hours .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very impressed with the service and the price i got was competitive with other_sites .
Cell_phone_Recycling	there are a lot of sites out there offering maybe £ 0 more but i have heard some terrible things .
Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely stick to a reputable company like mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	can ' t recommend it highly_enough .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good price paid for my phone .... was paid in 0 working_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve used this service 0 times previousd always got the same reliable service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	wanted to sell my iphone quickly and for fixed price , chose mazuma_mobile and was right !
Cell_phone_Recycling	did not expect such a great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	ordered packaging on a week day , got it on saturday , sent phone on monday and had money in my bank_account on tuesday !
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend it to anyone who needs to sell his phone without having any headache !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 + stars service , website and price !
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent the phone on the friday , had the money on the tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cant_fault it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if your looking to sell your old_mobile these_guys are definitely one to watch .
Cell_phone_Recycling	best prices on the net .
Cell_phone_Recycling	even out did cex on my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not always the best but better_than most
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my order via special delivery ( i paid extra ) so that it would arrive by 00 . 00pm the next_day , i received an_email to confirm delivery about an_hour ago , with payment being made today !
Cell_phone_Recycling	fantastic service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my only concern was the live_chat , i have tried a few_times and never anyone there , however the positive was that i emailed them and had a reply within an_hour so that made up for it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	adverts for selling your mobile have been around for some time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	about 0 months_ago i thought i would dig out my old_phones ( which were just lying_around gather dust ) and see if they were worth anything .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after some research i decided to use mazuma as they appear to be the largest company doing mobile buybacks and their prices were marginally better_than their competitors .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got £_00 for the two old_phones but the best thing was the ease of the service , pop details of your old_phones into the mazuma website , wait for the prepaid_envelope to arrive ( it takes only a couple of days ), pop your phones in the envelope ( in some bubble_wrap ) along with the delivery note and send back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it couldn ' t be easier .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a couple of days_later i had the cash in the bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i now use mazuma to get some cash for my old_mobile whenever i upgrade my phone contract .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they are great , well recommendable .
Cell_phone_Recycling	nice and easy site to use , much_better_than others which are far too busy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	their service was quick and efficent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	although many ppl have told me only request for cheques and dont give in your bank_details as a payment_method .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i gave in my details & received a payment within the very next_day of posting it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	there is no scam , it is a trust - worthy site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	how amazing are this company ?!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	even phones that are scratched are excepted , my company has benefited greatly from mazuma , i will always use this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	trustworthy , honest and quick !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	keep up the good work !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	like many others , tried to sell an iphone 0 00gb , was originally_quoted £_00 and today they ' ve received and tested the phone and due to ' water_damage ' and a very minuscule mark on the screen that i knew about , they now want to offer me £ 0 . 00 for it !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was well aware i ' d be offered less because of the mark , which is only visible on a white background and doesn ' t affect the operation of the phone , but £ 0 . 00 !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	come on that ' s crazy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	and there ' s no water_damage to the phone either , loads of bollocks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	have rejected the offer and will be interested to see what condition the phone is in when i receive it back !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a similar problem with mazuma , but at_least they offered £_00 for it - still unfair but better_than envirofone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i rejected mazuma ' s offer and went with envirofone cos i thought they ' d offer me a better deal but how wrong was i !
Cell_phone_Recycling	think i ' ll try selling my phone privately , i might actually get a fair price for it , esp as i had the phone for almost 0 years and it ' s still in working order !
Cell_phone_Recycling	really unhappy with mazuma - they offered me £_00 for my iphone 0 00gb , on receiving it , they inform me they ' ve found a tiny yellow mark that ' s only visible on a white background (_eg .
Cell_phone_Recycling	in the settings folder ) and therefore it ' s classed_as faulty and they ' ll only offer me £_00 !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i understand a small drop in the price but i don ' t think that warrants a £_00 drop in the price , i argued this point on the phone but they refused to budge !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had been warned they would try to find a fault and offer less - to prove this point , on receiving this phone back , i checked it over - no yellow mark .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sold it through a competitor who happily paid £_00 for it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	and to top it all off , mazuma wouldn ' t let me post this review on their website , funny that !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they clearly only want good reviews on there !
Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely wouldn ' t recommend , avoid at all costs !
Cell_phone_Recycling	have sent a couple phones in and have been very happy with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast and easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	another quick turn_around and my 0th phone disposed of !
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted the phone wednesday lunch time and the money was in my account by thursday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found the service at mazumamobile . com to be very good indeed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast hassle_free & helpful .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was straightforward , i put the imei_number on website , got the quote and got free post envelope from mazuma in couple of days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted my phone ( better to get proof of receipt as it gives you cover up to £_00 on free post ) and got my money directly paid into bank in couple of days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service as always .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast and efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i look_forward to dealing_with mazuma again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great fast and reliable service provided by mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	love it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the second time i ' ve used mazumamobile . com never had a problem payments go sameday they receive the phone , they make it simply and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	many_thanks mazumamobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant service my phone was in mint_condition and upon rpc recylce receiving it they lowered their offer by over £_000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma where fast and money was in bank same day they took receipt of mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_defo use again
Cell_phone_Recycling	according to mazuma my fone was blacklisted just took it into vodafone and they checked on the national database and they said phone is not blacklisted and gave me more_than i was offered by mazuma for a non - working samsung jet .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will never use this website again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am very satisfied with the order money and how long it had taken to get to me
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma was really easy to use , i wasn ' t sure how much i ' d get from my phone considering it was old and not in very good condition at all , but amazingly it sold for a really good price - £_00 for an old_nokia_0000 classic :) would have been £_00 even if it wasn ' t working !
Cell_phone_Recycling	worthwhile , it didn ' t take long either ... just make_sure you know what phone you ' ve got !
Cell_phone_Recycling	tried to recycle phone elsewhere , to no_avail , used envirophone & they do exactly_what it says on the tin ... others out there may offer more , but if you want the best deal & service use envirophone ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	a0 service , envirophone took_forever bt mazuma , better_than_expected & would use them first nxt time without a shadow of a doubt ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	really simple and easy to follow instruction .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money went in the bank same day as they recieved the phone which was a couple of days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	just a great service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service , £_00 for my 0 yr_old_nokia , exactly_what it said on the tin !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i filled in the form online .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then in the post 0 days_later my pack arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	all the information was very easy and popped in old phone posted it at the post_office on the friday got my money on the tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	was really good just wish had a few more old_phones to send off lol .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very good no_problems , fast delivery , would use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after trying to trade in stores , needing to take a charger and queuing became a bit of a downer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i looked on here and was offered a great price and it was so easy and quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great company
Cell_phone_Recycling	many_thanks for selling my phones , helped_me out alot so many_thanks for your help and making it happen so quick and easy aswell :_d
Cell_phone_Recycling	this company will give you an attractive offer to make_sure that they get , in my case my phone , and when they get it they will drastically lower the value of the offer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this will be lower_than what you will be guaranteed off far better known and reputable_companies .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they will allow you to get the product back but will charge you for this so you will feel , like i did , backed into a corner to accept or face losing money by paying for your property back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	yes i got a revised_offer , but an insult with and extra £ 0 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would have had an extra £_00 on top of this if i hadn ' t gone with this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my advice would be avoid this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	stated on their website under " our promise " is that you can contact [_name ] the md via_email if you ’ re not satisfied ; don ' t bother you won ' t get a response .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will not use this company again and will never recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	terrible customer_service and the worst i have ever_experienced .
Cell_phone_Recycling	service was so easy to use , got an excellent price for my old phone and very professional in terms of updates of when they recieve your phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will certainly use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	just sold iphone_0s it was great , quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got argos_vouchers which meant i got a bit more but you can ' t spend them online .
Cell_phone_Recycling	think that ' s argos ' s fault tho not envirofone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they were very fast in posting everything , it was a very simple procedure and overall i was impressed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once fonebank . com received my nexus 0 tablet they issued the payment within 0 hours ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have not received this level of service from another recycle company ... as far fonebank . com are the best .. keep up the good work .. only improvement is payments to hit our account same day ..
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent off on wednesday , paid on friday !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was really happy with the speed and price i received for my iphone_0s .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was much more_than others and was a super easy service to use !
Cell_phone_Recycling	one of my best online experiences , filled in the easy online form , received a bag the next_day and had the money in my bank_account the next_day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	all done in three days !
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definitely be using mazuma_mobile again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very speedy service , i posted the phone on the tuesday and the money was in my account by the wednesday with follow_up e_- mails straight_away .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service , will use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma twice now and have always found them to be quick , efficient and easy to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the site is well set out and finding your handset model with accompanying price they will pay is easy .
Flowers	paid in full for valentines flowers and on the day they decide to change the delivery date !!!!!
Flowers	they are ignoring calls and emails ( 0 days now ) but have put a very small apology on the website .... ha !
Flowers	its too_late valentines has been and gone so the flowers are useless and the day has been ruined !
Flowers	if you cant handle the orders dont take peoples money !
Flowers	p . s .
Flowers	hurry up and give me my money back !
Flowers	if i lived closer id be down there collecting it in person !
Flowers	stay_away !
Flowers	i would defo_recommend using seranata flowers to send someone flowers !
Flowers	really quick & reasonably_priced !
Flowers	the whole purchasing and delivery process is very good .
Flowers	you even get a confirmation_email once the package has been delivered to the destination .
Flowers	thanks , i am very satisfied for your services .
Flowers	quality products and fast delivery .
Flowers	recommand to all this site .
Flowers	best regards
Flowers	lilian
Flowers	really easy website to use , great prices , great options .
Flowers	would definitely use again !
Flowers	i had placed an order online for my partner ' s birthday as she only likes this one type of flower .
Flowers	when the order was received the company has sent me a completely diffrent order which is much cheaper_than that i had ordered .
Flowers	not acceptable .
Flowers	could not be more impressed .
Flowers	ordered late sunday_evening delivered monday am
Flowers	i paid iflorist for flowers from their " same day " range , the flowers finally arrived 0 days_later ( after i had cancelled them for not arriving ).
Flowers	my mother explained to the florist that they had been cancelled so the florist said they would be free as it was their mistake .
Flowers	other than an offer to look_into the issue when i cancelled the flowers for going awol and an assurance someone would contact me within_00hrs ( a week_ago ) iflorist have ignored my communications during the last 00 days .
Flowers	i wont let it drop but please everyone avoid this company , anyone can make a mistake and fail to deliver , i know they reply on florists .
Flowers	however then to ignore their own customers complaint is unforgivable .
Flowers	fortunately my mother has forgiven me for seemingly missing her_birthday .
Flowers	never bought flowers to deliver online before and even as a novice i managed to find what i wanted and add / change bits to suit .
Flowers	i did notice 0 different sets of flowers with £_00 difference in the price_tag both had the same picture - which made things confusing .
Flowers	maybe update your pics ?!
Flowers	!
Flowers	otherwise all good .
Flowers	ps - search for a discount_code online - i manged to get free delivery worth £ 0 . 00 !
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet a day before i needed them .
Flowers	it was very straight_forward and helpful throughout the whole_process .
Flowers	i was kept completely up to date as to where the flowers where in the delivery process .
Flowers	and once delivered i was notified that nobody was in to collect them , i was given a detail description as to where they had been left .
Flowers	very impressed .
Flowers	this is the second time i ' ve used serenata_flowers and i will_defiantly use them again .
Flowers	searched for fairtrade flowers and came on arena_flowers .
Flowers	ordered 0 bouquets for relatives .
Flowers	website has very clear photos and it was easy to select seasonal flowers .
Flowers	i really liked the add on options at each_stage - deluxe bouquet , vase , good range of beautiful gifts , cards and even a glossy photo .
Flowers	fastest way to assemble a personalised gift package at a very reasonable_price .
Flowers	our loved father and grandfather in portugal passed away recently .
Flowers	since we are in south_africa , it was not enough time to attend the funeral but we did order flowers online and within the next_day flora_queen delivered them .
Flowers	they were a beautiful bouquet , and even looked better_than the picture on their website .
Flowers	the flowers helped bring joy and comfort to our family .
Flowers	the service was great and professionally presented .
Flowers	everything that was requested was there and definitely worth the money .
Flowers	it was money well spent and we have since told a few family_members and friends to use flora_queen next time for excellent quality and professionalism .
Flowers	thank_you once again flora_queen , you helped make this difficult transition in our lives easier and the beautiful flowers helped make our family ' s day a little_bit brighter .
Flowers	i ordered a bunch of flowers on 00 march for mothers_day to be delivered on the 00th it is now tuesday 0st april and the flowers still have not been delivered .
Flowers	i have emailed customer support twice now but still not got a reply back .
Flowers	it is pointless getting the flowers delivered now as mothers_day as been and gone
Flowers	march 00th i have placed an order , same day delivery for march 00th , my mom ' s birthday , so i have chosen deluxe flower_arrangement , item called " gorgeous ", paid 00 £ at checkout .
Flowers	delivered bouquet was not at any closer look , then the one they advertise .
Flowers	it was a bunch of green with occasional tiny heads of a complete different flowers .
Flowers	also , the roses were not fresh and today all came off already .
Flowers	i did write to their company support email , because is the only florist company which does not provide a phone line , so if something_goes_wrong , like in my situation , the only you can relay on is their email , they don ' t even care to check , as this morning the only answer to my emails of complain i got was this survey , asking for satisfactory review and five_star rate .
Flowers	this company is not to trust .
Flowers	by the way , i managed to buy some extra flowers at the wild heart , at liberty ' s and coated me 00 £ - gorgeous huge flower_arrangement !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i was informed by the person who i bought the flowers for that they were damaged and in a poor condition when they arrived .
Flowers	i have used iflorist before , they have always been punctual and the flowers are always high_quality and last a long time .
Flowers	total scam !!!
Flowers	did not deliver my flowers for mothers_day .
Flowers	when i emailed to complain they sent me one email_saying they thought they had been delivered and then they ignored every subsequest email .
Flowers	in the end i had to request a chargeback from my credit_card company to get my money back .
Flowers	do not use them you will be disappointed and out of pocket !!!!!!!!!!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	great company when things are going well however my flowers were delivered 0 days late .
Flowers	i have received no useful responses from the customer_service team after i notified them ( not the other way around !)
Flowers	and they have taken 0 days to reply to my most_recent email .
Flowers	they promised to redeliver immediately and even the replacement flowers were later than promised .
Flowers	i can ' t understand_why i have received such little communication ( each time from a different person who doesn ' t answer the points raised in my message ) when surely the worst error a flower delivery company can make is delivering flowers nearly a week late ?
Flowers	yes they are cheap , but you get what you pay for !
Flowers	i have ordered several bouquets from this company .
Flowers	mainly for my mum but also to other family_members .
Flowers	i have never ever had any_issues with them .
Flowers	the bouquets are always beautiful looking and last ages .
Flowers	i ordered a rose and lily bouquet for my mum and it lasted over 0 weeks .
Flowers	she had been given some flowers from the supermarket at the same time but they died within a week !
Flowers	!
Flowers	customer_service is always really helpful and i would recommend prestige to anyone .
Flowers	i will never order flowers from anyone_else but prestige_flowers
Flowers	disgusting unhelpful service .
Flowers	no flowers received despite the fact they claim it was delivered .
Flowers	thanks for making my moms mothers_day .
Flowers	not .
Flowers	really disappointed
Flowers	i ordered 0 mother ' s day bouquets .
Flowers	i spotted that the courier company ' s confirmation_email had the wrong_address the day before mother ' s day .
Flowers	i emailed to alert them to the problem .
Flowers	didn ' t hear_anything back so i rang up .
Flowers	spent 00_minutes on the phone to their indian_call_centre .
Flowers	the person i was speaking to just didn ' t understand that there were two roads in london with the same name and that they were delivering to the wrong one ( despite me putting the correct postcode in my original order ).
Flowers	i was promised ( i ) a callback that day and ( ii ) that the flowers would be delivered .
Flowers	surprise_surprise .
Flowers	no call back .
Flowers	no flowers delivered .
Flowers	just come off the phone with customer_services ( another 00 minute phone call ) whereby i was told the i would definitely get a call back today - i ' ve heard that one before !
Flowers	she apparently couldn ' t put me through to head_office ...
Flowers	so gave me a number to call .
Flowers	am sat here on hold , again , so i have lots of time to write this review .
Flowers	p . s .
Flowers	the flowers that were delivered were a miserable bunch of brown flowers - was not worth the money !
Flowers	e_- mailed them early yesterday to confirm track and send numbers for flowers i ' ve ordered and still had nothing .
Flowers	none of the flowers have been delivered up to yet so yeah getting really worried .
Flowers	the following is my opinion of iflorist , based on my experiences .
Flowers	i ordered 00 red_roses to be delivered on valentines_day .
Flowers	late on the evening before valentines_day , i received as email_saying my flowers would not be delivered on valetines day , and would actually be delivered on the 00th .
Flowers	any other day of the year , this might have been ok but not valentines_day .
Flowers	eventually , late on the 00th the flowers were delivered .
Flowers	not the 00 red_roses i had paid for , but three roses and a handful of carnations .
Flowers	i have tried to contact this company on the phone , with no luck .
Flowers	i have also sent emails with no reply .
Flowers	i want my money back .
Flowers	i will be avoiding this company in future .
Flowers	literally the worst flowers i ' ve ever_seen in my life .
Flowers	they look nothing like the picture , they are squashed almost flat and smelly !!!
Flowers	if i could post a photo here to show you i would ...
Flowers	if you want a decent bunch of flowers please pay a bit more and use interflora who have never delivered me a bad bunch before .
Flowers	placed an order for a nice bouqet for my girlfriends_birthday .
Flowers	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
Flowers	when they were delivered they were disappointing and left me feeling embarrassed .
Flowers	stems were snapped , a few of the flowers looked as if they were dying already and the arrangement was poor .
Flowers	the greeting card was small and lacked imagination and a personal_touch .
Flowers	just another printed note for another customer ... no love or feeling involved .
Flowers	deflated , and unimpressed by the standard i expected .
Flowers	this is the first time i have used your company and as this was a bouquet for a special birthday i wont be using you again or recommending your company .
Flowers	i hope you can learn from this feedback and make_sure others receive a better quality of flower in future .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	sent flowers to a friend as a congratulations for her new job , she was delighted as she was sent flowers .
Flowers	however i wasn ' t as impressed as i had hoped i would be as they didn ' t look like the photo on the webpage .
Flowers	they looked rather slim and a bit old to be honest .......
Flowers	amazing service from a company i used for the first time .
Flowers	kept me in the loop when they were despatched and delivered .
Flowers	will 000_% be using them from now on .
Flowers	in fact everyone should use them .
Flowers	after seeing all these posts i am wondering what is going on .
Flowers	i also paid for the tracking service and like everyone_else have not had a tracking link , my girlfriend just text me to say they have still not arrived and she finished work at 0 - 00 .
Flowers	if they cannot make a courier paid delivery by 0 - 00 when i ordered last_week for valentines_day then what is the point in buying the flowers ?
Flowers	wish they had a phone number to ring , all i can do is hope they arrive by 0 - 00 otherwise she will get them tomorrow which i will be seriously annoyed about .
Flowers	will update my rating to 0 if they arrive on valentines_day !
Flowers	order no 00000
Flowers	avoid !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered flowers , registered my details ( including mobile and email ) and received order confirmation .
Flowers	the order was for the following_day , for my 00 year_old grandmas birthday ; no delivery took place and no notification of attempted delivery was left .
Flowers	i have received no contact , in 0 days from eflorist informing_me of any_issues .
Flowers	my grandma was extremely disappointed , this is the worst customer_service i ' ve ever_experienced .
Flowers	i bought my friend some flowers ,
Flowers	from iflorist , a wonderful deal !
Flowers	i thought how lovely they looked online ,
Flowers	could not wait to see them for real .
Flowers	however dear friends , guess_what !
Flowers	the flowers , they never arrived ,
Flowers	my friend stayed late at the office ,
Flowers	so i tried and i tried and i tried ,
Flowers	to ring the iflorist people
Flowers	to ask them " where are my flowers ??"
Flowers	i ' d had my conformation email
Flowers	and my friend waited at her work for hours !
Flowers	but nothing !!
Flowers	not even a phonecall !
Flowers	!
Flowers	they took my money , and me , for a fool !
Flowers	i wish to now receive my refund
Flowers	and i wish i hadn ' t shopped there at all .
Flowers	you could have at_least tried to phone me !
Flowers	to let me know that you guys had gone wrong !
Flowers	yes ok there may have been trouble with snow and the weather
Flowers	but then tell me this before the whole day has gone !
Flowers	you say it was down to the snow
Flowers	and deliveries not made on time !
Flowers	the for the love of god let your customers know ,
Flowers	because that was your problem not mine !
Flowers	i could have made other arrangements ,
Flowers	now i ' m just a mum short of dough ,
Flowers	please issue me now my full_refund
Flowers	or its off to the papers i ' ll go !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be sent to my girlfriend in her office on valentines_day .
Flowers	spent nearly £_00 for the same day delivery option .
Flowers	even_though i know it was cutting it close , paying an extra £_00 for the delivery on the day seemed to make up for it .
Flowers	but i was wrong .
Flowers	they charged me the same amount but has not sent me a confirmation letter for the order .
Flowers	if i had not print screened the check out page with the reference , i would have no proof of sale .
Flowers	tried_emailing 0 times and ringing several_times and all i got was one email in return saying sorry for contacting me so late on valentines_day to say that my order has failed .
Flowers	overall value and service .. abysmal .
Flowers	i have already_recommended silk_blooms to all my friends !
Flowers	i first came_across silk_blooms at a wedding exhibition in aberdeen , and was instantly impressed with the selection of wedding bouquets .
Flowers	i went straight home and ordered for my own wedding .
Flowers	the customer_service given by mara rose was excellent .
Flowers	the flowers are very realistic and superb quality .
Flowers	i am delighted with the bouquets and thistle buttonholes that i ordered for my wedding .
Flowers	i ' m sure they will all be admired on the big day next week !
Flowers	my wife called to say thank_you for the roses in which i asked did she also receive any chocolates , she said no in which it does state to come with these . she then said that to be truthful that i should probably ask for a refund due to most of then being nearly dead and only 00 roses .
Flowers	have also emailed but not likely to get a response any time soon .
Flowers	i found the online ordering simple and easy to use .
Flowers	the option to purchase additional gifts ( a teddy_bear , chocolates and a card ) with the flowers was also very useful .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered the next_day , as promised in great condition .
Flowers	my girlfriend was very pleased with her_birthday surprise !
Flowers	they delivered the flowers and they were lovely but they delivered them on the wrong date !
Flowers	my flowers from my girlfriend were delivered after she had finished work but rather_than call the delivery agent had just dumped them outside on a busy main street .
Flowers	and suprise , suprise they got ruined .
Flowers	any way no contact number to get immediate answers and resolution instead i have had to write emails , post on their facebook and message them on facebook , then wait hours for a response which was we will " investigate " nothing to investigate , they messed_up i ' m requesting a full_refund .
Flowers	we ' ll see how that goes .
Flowers	arrived on time , even after adjustments made by myself late in the day , thoroughly_recommended .
Flowers	i ordered flower for the same day delivery for my wife birthday in luxembourg .
Flowers	the flowers were never delivered , plus they never answer my email when i filed a complain .
Flowers	i don ' t know how such a site can buy google_ads and be on top of search_results .
Flowers	they took my money and there is no way for me to having it back .
Flowers	it ' s definitely a scam .
Flowers	three emails sent regarding my order for mothers_day flowers which were supposed to be delivered today and were not .
Flowers	i have tried all day to access iflorists " live support " which untill half past nine tonight was set to " away ".
Flowers	when i was finally able to connect i was informed by " jack " that due to the mothers_day rush , iflorist were unable to find a florist to deliver on time .
Flowers	despite the order being placed on 00st_march , nobody could be bothered to get in touch and let me know this in order that i could make alternative_arrangements .
Flowers	when i asked why no one had been in touch , i was then informed that due to the limited amount of florists in the area the delivery would not be dispatched untill tuesday .
Flowers	considering the money has already been taken from my account i think this is completely_unacceptable .
Flowers	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn ' t expect such shoddy service , i think it ' s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people ' s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
Flowers	i have been offered a discount_voucher for £_00 my next order , well i can tell you with absolute certainty that there will never be a next order from me or anyone i know .
Flowers	i wouldn ' t use iflorist again if they were paying me !
Flowers	i have been told that " jack " will arrange a full_refund , which will be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
Flowers	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
Flowers	in the meantime , i will now have to explain to a rather disappointed mum what has happened and hope that a much more reliable and trustworthy interflora can deliver something which will make up for iflorists terrible service .
Flowers	in future i ' ll be reading reviews before i purchase anything , but in the meantime i would urge_anyone to stick to trusted sites and avoid this mob like the plague !
Flowers	my husband bought me roses for our first valentines_day together .
Flowers	he recieved an_email on wednesday 00th at 00 . 00pm to say they wouldnt be delivered until 00th !!!!!
Flowers	after waiting until 0pm today - still no sign so my husband called up and apparently they would be there before 0pm !
Flowers	they have just turned_up now and and they are a total state .
Flowers	every flower is pretty_much dead .
Flowers	really disappointed .
Flowers	quick , easy , cheap ( pricewise , quality was far from cheap ) and my girlfriend loved them .
Flowers	thank_you so much !
Flowers	my husband ordered me flowers for valentine ' s day , and it was agreed upon ordering them that they would be delivered before 0pm as we were leaving for a week long trip at 0pm ( the plan was to take the flowers with us so that i could enjoy them whilst i was away ).
Flowers	between 0 and 0pm my husband was getting more and more concerned that the flowers hadn ' t showed up , so he kept ringing eflorist but could never get through on the phone ( he was on hold the entire time ).
Flowers	we waited until 0 . 00pm but couldn ' t hold on any longer as we had a 0 hour car journey ahead of us and a 00 month old who needed to be put to sleep in the car .
Flowers	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .
Flowers	after failing to get through to eflorist on the phone , my husband sent an_email complaint to them but no one ever replied .
Flowers	the next_day he continually rang eflorist but could never get through when selecting the option that he was calling about an " existing order ".
Flowers	eventually he got through when he selected the option to " place a new order ", and was told he was not eligible for a refund despite explaining our circumstances in detail .
Flowers	we never even got to see the flowers as we were away for a week , and they had died by the time we got home .
Flowers	we both wrongly assumed that eflorist would be apologetic and give us a full_refund but as they refused we intend to spread the word to our friends , family and beyond that they shouldn ' t use eflorist .
Flowers	i have just recieved my valentines_day flowers which my boyfriend bought from them to be sent to me at work today ( valentines_day ) and i just needed to express how disgusted i am .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered in a damaged box and when i opened them i was so dissapointed .
Flowers	these flowers were dispatched on monday 00th_feb - are you suprised they are dead ?
Flowers	there were not in water and had come loose in the box so are not looking their best .
Flowers	the mojority of them are dry , black and curling !
Flowers	they are so squashed and look like a 0 year_old hand tied them .
Flowers	i had to call my boyfriend and thank him , however he knew something was wrong and is equally as angry that he purchased from yourselves .
Flowers	i understand they are an internet company with lots of orders but there will be so many unhappy ladies today if their flowers were sent out monday and arrived in this state aswell !
Flowers	i am furious !
Flowers	hope to be getting a refund !
Flowers	if you cant handle the busy day orders then dont take any more !
Flowers	dead flowers are no use to anyone !
Flowers	i wont even be able to enjoy them for one day .
Flowers	i placed an order over the weekend for valentines_day with " courier track and trace " delivery .
Flowers	the order was accepted and i received a confirmation e_- mail but when i view my account the order has disappeared and i have not received any tracking_number at all ( you would have thought this was essential right ?).
Flowers	the item has sold out also so i ' m increasingly worried that they couldn ' t fulfil all orders and just cancelled them .. live_chat was offline and they ' ve not responded to my e_- mails .
Flowers	ringing up the bank first thing and disputing .
Flowers	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
Flowers	then to add more embarrassment the roses were past the fully opened stage .
Flowers	i ' ve never been so publicly embarrassed in all my life .
Flowers	also no telephone service so you can not call them , i sent a complaint via_email and received template email with a promise to contact me asap .
Flowers	but i ' ve heard_nothing .
Flowers	don ' t use this company they have no care nor respect for their customers .
Flowers	**_update **
Flowers	0th_february_0000
Flowers	so iflorist said they would send my sister some flowers and guess_what ?
Flowers	it didn ' t happen !!!
Flowers	this company is ridiculously unprofessional .
Flowers	i emailed iflorist reminding them that the flowers had to be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
Flowers	the reply stated that the driver would be contacted and then i ' d be emailed back .
Flowers	this did not happen either .
Flowers	the service is shockingly disgusting .
Flowers	i just want my money back and i have insisted on this from iflorist .
Flowers	let ' s see how long it is to take for this refund .
Flowers	once again in case you have forgotten my advice in the first complaint : do not use this company !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i haven ' t ordered off your site before but the process was very quick and simple .
Flowers	i will_definitely be ordering again .
Flowers	my boyfriend ordered flowers on the 00th to arrive on the 00th_february as a surprise for me and considering the fact the office is normally open from 0 . 00am to 0 . 00pm , you would think the flowers would be delivered within that time .
Flowers	in fact the flowers didn ' t arrive by the time i left at 0 . 00pm resulting in my boyfriend having to leave work early , rush to the shops to spend another £_00 on roses , chocolates and a vase so i wouldn ' t be left without anything .
Flowers	the flowers turned_up at the office at 0pm and it was only by pure luck someone was still in my office to sign for them , but considering i ' m on holiday now till the 00th of february (!!!!
Flowers	), i find it astonishing that my boyfriend was told all he would get refunded was the delivery charge of about £ 0 . 00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Flowers	yes , someone in the office signed for them , but it was delivered after i left and the colleague , who signed for the order , didn ' t know i ' m on holiday with the 00th_february otherwise she would have straight_away rejected the order .
Flowers	you would think it ' s not unreasonable to deliver flowers to an office address within normal working hours , not after 0 . 00pm .
Flowers	my poor boyfriend spent considerable time and money yesterday not being_able to get through to iflorist and eventually spending more money buying me new flowers .
Flowers	i won ' t be able to enjoy these flowers as they will be dead by the time i return to the office and to top everything off , my colleague ( who i asked to open the box this morning ) has emailed me to tell me the flowers are of poor quality and already started to wilt !
Flowers	my boyfriend was told that as the delivery arrived on the day requested , he would only get a refund of the delivery charge ( i don ' t agree with iflorist that delivery at 0pm to an office address when the office normally shuts at 0 . 00pm counts at successful delivery as it was rather luck that anyone was still in the office , never mind i , the recipient , didn ' t even get the iflorist flowers and won ' t get to enjoy them till the 00th of february when they are completely dead ).
Flowers	my boyfriend spent about 00 £ on the iflorist delivery , which i can ' t enjoy and went all the way out to spent more money to ensure i wouldn ' t be left completely disapppointed on our first valentine ' s day together .
Flowers	to only refund the delivery charge in light of what happened is despicable .
Flowers	i would strongly_advise people not to order from this company !
Flowers	my boyfriend deserves more_than the refund of £ 0 . 00 for the inconvenience , quality of the roses and service provided .
Flowers	please arrange for adequate compensation .
Flowers	i ordered a bunch of 00 roses to be delivered on valentines_day for the missus .
Flowers	price was competitive not amazingly cheap , they arrived on time on valentines_day in a large box .
Flowers	the missus opened the box to find 00 roses , 0 of which were broken and one which didn ' t have a head and nor was the head in the box meaning that the rose must have been headless when they put them in there !
Flowers	i complained and was assured that this is not the usual quality of their products , they sent out a new set .
Flowers	when we received the new set we again only received 00 roses which all looked like the cheapest battered roses money could buy .
Flowers	another complaint and 0 weeks_later i am still_waiting for my money .
Flowers	my advice - don ' t use them at all costs more hassle than its worth , get friendly with a local_florist same - day delivery and two_weeks_later the flowers still look amazing all for only £ 0 dearer than iflorist !
Flowers	this site came highly_recommended .
Flowers	i found the site well_laid_out , easy to navigate , very aesthetically pleasing and with a great range of options .
Flowers	very impressed thus_far
Flowers	i ordered flowers for valentines_day , which arrived looking nothing like the flowers that i had ordered .
Flowers	it was missing all but one type of flower that it should have and in the other flowers place was just green leaves .
Flowers	i ordered flowers 0 days before i wanted them delivered , they were a suprise for my sisters birthday . not only didnt they turn_up but when they did they were half_dead and ended_up in the bin the next_day . absolutely no remorse from company so will never use them again .
Flowers	disappointed not to receive the flowers which were ordered by the date requested .
Flowers	it is difficult to allocated specific blame for this as appears to be a combination of factors including capacity to fulfil orders , weather , delivery logistics etc .
Flowers	that said , none of these issues are my personal concern , however , can be understandable to an extent .
Flowers	my main complaint with this company has been communication which has been appalling .
Flowers	telephones not being answered , online email messages not answered and the online_chat makes you wait a very long time between each interaction .
Flowers	i was given the advice that i should reject the order once this arrived late and i would receive a full_refund .
Flowers	i am still_waiting on this to happen !
Flowers	my overarching opinion is very negative , and sorting all this out is a giant waste of my time !
Flowers	really easy to order online and the photo was a good representation of the flowers that were received .
Flowers	excellent service & loved the fact we were kept_informed when the flowers were sent out and when they had been received .
Flowers	would recommend and use again !
Flowers	i ordered valentines flowers on 00 / 00 / 00 for my girlfriend that is currently in oz .
Flowers	by 0pm oz time there was no sign of the flowers ...
Flowers	i called eflorist , to be told that they have to contact their oz office to find out what the order status is and then get back to me after 00hrs ... t
Flowers	he occassion had been completely_ruined by now as a ) the ( over priced ) flowers were not delivered , and b ) i had to ask if the " suprise " gift had arrived or a " no one in " delivery card left behind ... etc .
Flowers	following my complaint , the flowers were delivered at midnight on 00 / 00 / 00 , waking_up the household .
Flowers	the flowers delivered did not resemble those in the online picture and half of the stock was dead or dying .
Flowers	later i received a smug email from eflorist informing that the flowers had been delivered on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
Flowers	i have complained again and now wait to see what eflorist have to say about this ...
Flowers	i understand from other posts that they will offer a 00_%_discount ( against what is essentially an over priced product ) but try not to pay , or , if you push for it , a full_refund !
Flowers	... that they also try not to pay .
Flowers	in short , don ' t put your faith in eflorist for special / meaningful occasions ... there is a real chance that they will let you down in more ways than one .
Flowers	i will not use them again and strongly_recommend others to go elsewhere .
Flowers	i purchased my flowers , wine and what i assumed would come with it was a box of free chocolate !
Flowers	not only did the wine that i paid for not deliver but the chocolates didn ' t either !
Flowers	when i phoned up i was assured that i was going to get a refund put through for that day which i understood would take 0 to 0 working_days to come through and the girl told me that she would send out the free box of chocolates like it should have been !!
Flowers	after phoning up for the second time last thursday i am only now getting an_email_stating i will get my refund that will take up to another 0 to 0 working_days and i am yet to see the chocolates !
Flowers	being a student in liverpool i tried to surprise my mum back home and thanks to iflorist ruined my surprise !
Flowers	may i add the first time i had rang iflorist querying about my purchase the girl on the phone was rude , cheeky and not very helpful at all !
Flowers	i do not recommend to shop here at all !
Flowers	even the flowers that were sent out did not look like much and looked dead !
Flowers	absolute_disgrace !
Flowers	ordered flowers to be delivered on 00th_feb to my wife ' s workplace , only to find out they have just been delivered today at about 0 . 00 - over 00_hours late !
Flowers	to make it worse , we left home yesterday for a long weekend so the flowers are sat at her work so she won ' t see them alive !
Flowers	plus it was also her_birthday yesterday .
Flowers	how embarrassing , not so much for me ( i ' m just a little furious ) but certainly embarrassing for her .
Flowers	i feel really bad but its certainly not my fault .
Flowers	i ordered the flowers in plenty of time ( monday 00th ) and paid extra for the before 0pm delivery .
Flowers	i followed iflorists ticket complaint procedure but as yet , no response .
Flowers	and cannot get through via phone .
Flowers	iflorist - please issue a full_refund so that something can be salvaged from all this .
Flowers	i did try to ask via your website but have been forced to ask on a public forum as this seems the only way that encourages you to respond .
Flowers	thanks ( i hope ) in_advance for your response .
Flowers	i addressed in this company the first time and , believe me , it was pleasantly_surprised with professionalism of people which here work .
Flowers	the order was delivered when should .
Flowers	as i am in other country , i can not check everything , now i don ' t worry_about it , i can trust in eflorist !!!
Flowers	good fellows !
Flowers	ordered flowers for mothers_day , they turned_up on time but were wilting and looked on their way out .
Flowers	i emailed serenata and provided the photographic_evidence they required .
Flowers	they offered me a replacement or a refund , i chose a refund which i still_haven ' t received 0 days_later .
Flowers	i emailed them about it last_night and was told they have no record of me asking for a refund and have no copy of the emails that were sent from me .
Flowers	awful company , don ' t use them .
Flowers	my sister lives in new_zealand so i ordered some flowers for her_birthday on the 0th_feb , to be delivered on the 0th .
Flowers	i became slightly nervous on the 0th when i couldn ' t track the order online and my sister had not received any flowers .
Flowers	i submitted my first email to iflorist to find out where the flowers were , as the live_chat feature was offline .
Flowers	no response .
Flowers	on the morning of wednesday 00th i submitted another email to iflorist as again the live_chat feature was unavailable .
Flowers	still no response .
Flowers	on wednesday_afternoon , i received an_automated email to say that the order had been allocated and would be delivered on the 0th .
Flowers	isn ' t time travel a wonderful thing ?
Flowers	a week_later , no communications from iflorist and the flowers are left on the doorstep in the new_zealand sun .
Flowers	wilted and a week late , an excellent birthday_present .
Flowers	serenata were brilliant .
Flowers	i placed my order ( quite late in the day too ) for flowers to be delivered to my mother many miles_away .
Flowers	as promised , they were hand - delivered along with my personal message the following_morning .
Flowers	she was very surprised and happy with the flowers .
Flowers	will_definitely be using this company again , and would recommend to anyone .
Flowers	great service , easy to order , no_hidden_fees and better prices if compared to other similar websites .
Flowers	ordene unas flores llegaron a tiempo sin ningún problema totalmente recomendado
Flowers	flowers did not arrive on special day as requested .
Flowers	full payment taken and email confirmation sent to me .
Flowers	i have contacted the company but still_awaiting reply and there is no telephone_number for me to call .
Flowers	very very dissapoonted
Flowers	take your money and do not deliver .
Flowers	these people are like criminals !
Flowers	nasty and horrible people .
Flowers	never again , a big joke !
Flowers	i was a bit_worried after_reading some of the reviews here yesterday , but everything arrived well in time and i didn ' t even pay the extra for the pre 0pm delivery - nice one !
Flowers	the website was incredibly simple , i had to ask a question about the picture as i wasn ' t sure if it was the standard bunch .
Flowers	i got an answer almost_immediately saying it was , as beautiful as they where i upgraded and my mum was absolutely over the moon with the flowers .
Flowers	i would happily_recommend this company to anyone and i will be using them again in the future .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	googled for a valentines florist , iflorist was the first result .
Flowers	unfortunately for me their service , communication , flower quality and experience is the complete_opposite .
Flowers	in all dealings i have made over the internet i have never ever had such a bad_experience , i received the email about the nottingham distribution center being delayed to the 00th .
Flowers	at this point i emailed to cancel the order ... to which i received no confirmation or correspondence .
Flowers	so the flowers arrived at 0pm on the 00th even_though they were unwanted .
Flowers	the next problem is the quality , if you want petrol_station forecourt flowers delivered by a courier then all i can say is this is the company for you .
Flowers	they were an actual embarrassment , weltered .
Flowers	on to the communication , the call_centre never answer and i have had no emails still .
Flowers	the grand summary is the " valentines_day flowers " i ordered did not arrive on valentines_day and arrived even_though cancelled which is neither what i wanted so i will be chasing a full_refund .
Flowers	the other inconvenience is the £_00 i had to pay a local_florist and the inconvenience of rushing around to sort this on valentines morning .
Flowers	to summarise i wouldn ' t wish this level of service on my worst_enemy .
Flowers	chose same day deilivery at 0 . 00 p . m . ( made it just in time !)
Flowers	and the flowers were delivered in less_than two hours !
Flowers	the recipient was amazed and impressed by the freshness and quality of the flowers .
Flowers	i will most certainly choose eflorist again in the future for any flowers i want to send .
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	lovely flowers which my mum loved and delivered at the expected time .
Flowers	great range of flowers and wonderful service .
Flowers	as above .
Flowers	do no deal with this company .
Flowers	they will not deliver your items , they will not respond to your raised support tickets and they are dodging refunds that are necessary due to their awful service .
Flowers	a sham of a company .
Flowers	a simple online ordering service culminating in a thorough and satisfying customer experience .
Flowers	my girlfriend loved the flowers and chocolates .
Flowers	i ordered the roses and lilies standard bouquet for my sister .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on wednesday around 0pm .
Flowers	when she opened it the roses had been completely worn out and were about to die .
Flowers	the lillies were brown too .
Flowers	she did not want to tell me and upset me .
Flowers	when i visited her on saturday i saw the flowers and was so annoyed , angry and sad to know that the money i had paid had only given such a low quality of flowers .
Flowers	i should have rather paid a bit more and got the flowers from john_lewis .
Flowers	when i contacted the customer_services they were not helpful at all and have replied ' regards to the roses , it does appear that only the outer petals are browning but if you remove these then the bouquet will look lovely ' also ' there are only minimal signs of any damage so we cannot send out a replacement bouquet on this occasion '.
Flowers	well i guess you get what you pay for .
Flowers	so i strongly advice not to use this website and get your money ' s worth somewhere_else .
Flowers	the customer_service was totally unhelpful .
Flowers	i went for the dozen luxury red_roses .
Flowers	really impressive .
Flowers	it was even nicer to find out afterwards that she had never been sent flowers before , so thanks serenata_flowers for helping me to make her day :)
Flowers	i pre_- ordered flowers to be delivered to my wife on valentines_day , not only did the flowers turn_up a day late , iflorist didn ' t respond to any_queries on valetines day when i ( and many others ) tried to chase up our orders .
Flowers	they also didn ' t answer phones , respond to tickets logged on their own ticketing_system , respond to tweets or facebook posts in the days after valentines_day when hundreds of customers were trying to claim refunds for late and undelivered flowers , do not use them !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	well , cheering up a friend with flowers is always fun ....
Flowers	i enjoyed the easy webpage and loved the comedic emails and tracking_information every_step of the way !
Flowers	keep up the great work x
Flowers	i stupidly didnt read the reviews before i placed an order for 0 x luxury hampers .
Flowers	firstly , delivery was late so i called to check .
Flowers	upon calling i was told that there were ' delays ' and promised delivery would be the following_day and was told i could have a full_refund if not .
Flowers	apparently they were delivered 0 days_later by which point , was too_late for xmas as i mentioned on the phone .
Flowers	we have no record of delivery and we have not recieved the hampers .
Flowers	they are conveniently claiming that they have no record of the call in which i was promised a refund if delivery was any later - such a lie .
Flowers	trying to get a refund but it ' s a long , painful process and emails were ignored for weeks .
Flowers	in addition to this , they send far too many marketing emails which i find insulting given the service .
Flowers	focus less on generating more orders until you can properly fufil your existing ones .
Flowers	i am still_waiting for a refund that i was promised 0 weeks_ago that should have taken 00 days maximum !
Flowers	i have sent yet another email today in order to get my money back .
Flowers	i ordered , on the 00th_december , 0 bunches of flowers for a special occasion .
Flowers	one bunch of flowers arrived a day late , half_dead and looking nothing like i had ordered so we refused the delivery !
Flowers	the second bunch of flowers has never appeared !
Flowers	i sent countless emails over the christmas_period asking for someone to get in touch as it did not mention anywhere on your website that you would be closed ( i assumed that was the case as no one has explained this to me !)
Flowers	i finally got hold of someone on the 0th_january who promised a refund within 0 - 00 days .
Flowers	i called again on the 00th day as i had received no refund !
Flowers	i was then told it would be this week .
Flowers	i still_haven ' t had a refund !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i am absolutely_furious , i am a first time customer and so far your ' customer_service ' has been diabolical from start to finish !
Flowers	i will never use your services again , nor will i be recommending you to anyone i know .
Flowers	not even remotely close to what i ordered in colour of flowers used with cheaper substitutes used to bulk out the bunch massively .
Flowers	the six large gerberas pictured were replaced with two mini - heads .
Flowers	the vibrant multicoloured bunch i ordered were delivered entirely white and yellow ( but for the two red mini - gerberas ).
Flowers	customer_service ' assured ' me that half a bunch of gyp and a stuffing of carnations are of equal value and quality to gerberas , lisianthis and chrysanthemums .
Flowers	avoid like the plague .
Flowers	just didn ' t bother turning_up with my flowers on mother ' s day .
Flowers	left my mother waiting all day for them .
Flowers	had no customer_service available on the sunday itself , so i waited until the monday .
Flowers	they have no phone number so you have to wait for an adviser to speak to you online - so they closed the service for the entire day .
Flowers	i finally got an_email and they offered to deliver the following_day ( mothering tuesday ?!)
Flowers	at full cost .
Flowers	out of the goodness of their hearts they did offer me £ 0 off my next order though , as if i ' d ever order from them again to benefit .
Flowers	i couldn ' t recommend enough using one of the ' proper ' flower retailers on line rather_than this bunch of jokers .
Flowers	i don ' t think i ' ve ever been so angry .
Flowers	mothers_day flowers not delivered - i was on holiday and so couldn ' t be with my mother on day so figured some flowers were the least i could do .
Flowers	thanks iflorist for ruining that for me .
Flowers	sent three emails so far and nothing in response - their livechat never seems to be on .
Flowers	essentially this company has stolen £_00 from me .
Flowers	ordered 0 bouquets for delivery , they were delivered on time but were both squashed into a single box ... not very special as they got a bit crushed ,
Flowers	i ordered a delivery for ( rather expensive ) flowers for valentines_day to go to an address in belgium .
Flowers	the flowers were not delivered on the day or on the following_day .
Flowers	as a result i emailed ( they dont have a telephone_number !)
Flowers	requesting a refund .
Flowers	i received no reply until 0 days_later when i received a ' reply ' completely ignoring my previous message and stating that the address was wrong .
Flowers	now given that the address was exactly the same address i had provided them with for a previous successful delivery this seems a little strange to put it mildly .
Flowers	so $_00 paid in return for which ... no flowers delivered , no response to a refund request , impossible to speak to someone as they have no phone number and they send an_email 0 days after the flowers were due for delivery saying a building they have previously delivered to does not exist .
Flowers	draw your own conclusions ...
Flowers	they were brilliant , delivered less_than 00_hours after i ordered , i got a 00_%_discount , and the flowers were amazing
Flowers	i choose to order flowers from iflorist to be delivered to a close family_member on christmas_eve as a surprise christmas_present .
Flowers	i choose certain flowers as they had sentiment to the person that was receiving them .
Flowers	after_reading bad_reviews for iflorist i ensured that i emailed them to confirm the order i had paid for .
Flowers	yet after getting a phone call from my close relative explaining she had received flowers i went round to see the quality .
Flowers	to my shock and disappointment i found that not only had they sent the wrong free chocolates but the wrong flowers completely .
Flowers	they seem to have provided me with a cheaper substitute to what i had ordered and it was pointless as the flowers were all the wrong_colour and not one of the flowers that were in the description for the product i purchased were correct , i am so angry that i choose to use iflorist on such a close relative to get flowers which have alot of remembrance of her late husband .
Flowers	i would have got better quality and have more pennies in my pocket by nipping down to garage and getting a bunch from there .
Flowers	angry , upset and disappointed !!!
Flowers	season of good will - clearly not at iflortist ... getting the order correct would be a start !!!
Flowers	also i found the support_team disinterested in the fact that my order was wrong .
Flowers	my order arrived on time as expected .
Flowers	and the selection is quite good , i must confess i got surprised with the real result , looks way better_than the pictures online .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	this was a great company to use , flowers were lovely and made the perfect gift .
Flowers	paid extra to get delivery before 0pm .
Flowers	would defiantly use again !
Flowers	the flowers themselves were a present for my mums_birthday , she loved them and the bright colours , however as i was the one who saw them online i was a little disappointed with the size , very small for the price but like i say mum loved them and didn ' t know the difference !
Flowers	great !
Flowers	great !
Flowers	great !
Flowers	i was already disgusted with this company as they failed to deliver my order on 00nd january and didn ' t respond to my complaints until 00th_march .
Flowers	however , my disgust has only increased after finally seeing the flowers which were delivered to my friend yesterday .
Flowers	most of them were dead on arrival ( and there weren ' t very many altogether anyway ), and it looked more like a cheap bunch of flowers from a petrol_station than what the picture suggests it should turn into .
Flowers	i will now do my utmost to make_sure that no - one i know gives a penny to this company - i am ashamed to have sent my friend such an awful ' gift ' for her_birthday .
Flowers	they sent me an_email my order has been shiped and i checked with my wife she said she haven ' t received anything , so i again checked with them they tried to convince me that order has been shipped ... atlast i reported it as a scam
Flowers	ordered a bouquest of flowers for my mother for mothers_day 00 . 00 . 00 .
Flowers	got an_email at 00 : 00 stating " we regret to inform you that delivery has not been possible on the date you selected !
Flowers	however we are happy to rearrange for delivery as quickly as possbile , including an upgrade to your order at our cost , by way of apology for the late delivery .
Flowers	of course you are welcome to choose to cancel your order and we will refund you in full ."
Flowers	i paid a £ 0 . 00 extra delivery charge to get them there for mothers_day .
Flowers	they havent even offered to refund that part and still deliver the flowers .
Flowers	this seems to just be a scam company offering next_day delivery fot mothers_day .
Flowers	they take your hard_earned money then send you an_email and deliver the flowers when they feel_like it .
Flowers	not happy
Flowers	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
Flowers	i certainly wont be using eflorist again and i will be telling everyone who will listen to me to avoid them .
Flowers	please reply eflorist ?
Flowers	even better phone me ?
Flowers	iflorist have delivered the wrong flowers !
Flowers	i ordered a purple bouquet for my wife ( her favourite colour ) which was supposed to have purple roses within it .
Flowers	whilst it arrived today on time , the flowers are completely_different to my order and to me they don ' t look to be in the freshest state .
Flowers	when i emailed their cusomer service department to request a refund i am told that their terms and conditions state that they can change the flowers for another set of the higher or same value in the instance that they run out of the ordered bouquet .
Flowers	well if what they delivered is the same or better , then i ' m a monkeys uncle !
Flowers	my suggestion is to avoid this lot .
Flowers	their customer_service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
Flowers	i ' m still arguing for my refund , so far i have only been offered another bouquet .
Flowers	i will post back if i do get a refund or further experiences .
Flowers	i ordered flowers with eflorist to send to my wife ’_s work place as we both had to work on valentines_day .
Flowers	i received confirmation that my order had been accepted and the delivery day ( valentines_day ) confirmed .
Flowers	i waited anxiously , constantly looking at my phone , waiting for my wife to ring and to hear the excitement in her voice about the flowers but i never received any calls .
Flowers	at 0pm i then rang eflorist , which took over 00_mins to get through to , to be told that flowers had been dispatched and will_definitely reach my wife by 0pm .
Flowers	my wife was working until 0 . 00pm so i was getting more and more anxious as each second passed .
Flowers	at 0pm i was absolutletlty furious !
Flowers	i send eflorist an_email basically asking where the hell my flowers were and it was at this point i received the most shocking reply ( see below ):
Flowers	“ please_accept our apologies for contacting you so late .
Flowers	due to an overwhelming amount of demand in your delivery area for valentine ’_s day , our local_florists have not been able to fulfil your order .
Flowers	please_accept our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience that this may have caused .
Flowers	“
Flowers	this is an awful company , please do not use .
Flowers	they absolutely ruined my valentines this year .
Flowers	even a full_refund , that i have requested , will not compensate for this experience .
Flowers	if they cannot cope with the demand then they should not of accepted the order , they should of told me by midday at the very latest , not lie to me when i rang them at 0pm and guaranteed me that my order had been dispatched !
Flowers	by 0pm most shops had shut , those that were open selling flowers had sold out of roses !
Flowers	basically , a ruined valentine ’_s day all thanks to eflorist .
Flowers	in future i wouldn ’ t touch them with a barge poll , and judging_by most of the other reviews on here , there seems to be a pattern with this awful company !
Flowers	i have requested a full_refund .
Flowers	i ' m disgusted with service and customer_service .
Flowers	mothers_day bouquet - never received on time
Flowers	a proposed upgraded bouquet as means of an_apology not delivered .
Flowers	0 emails ; a 00minute phone call letter - no upgrade , no refund
Flowers	disgusted
Flowers	i ordered some flowers online and they got delivered the next_day !
Flowers	flowers were beautiful and the text messaging service to keep you up to date with the order was exceptional !
Flowers	defo ordering with serenata_flowers again .
Flowers	janet :-)
Flowers	ok so i browsed a few different websites and came_across a lovely bunch of flowers on serenata , ordered was happy to pay nearly 00 pounds .
Flowers	wrote a little message for my mum .
Flowers	ladies and gentlemen that was as good as it gets .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	the flowers arrived in some amazon style fashion just left on my mothers door_step .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	the flowers look nothing like what i ordered on the website .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	i got buds , who in there right mind would give somebody buds as a gift ?
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	the buds are discoloured and already brown and worsening .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	there was no card or message on the flowers .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	they are small and pathetic
Flowers	i have been in touch via e_- mail sent photos yet your company says the flowers are ok . no they are not i ordered flowers not discoloured dying buds .
Flowers	i expect a full_refund and ill send the buds back and maybe one of you can give them to your mother .
Flowers	the worst service ever , avoid like the plague .
Flowers	nice fresh , bright healthy flowers .
Flowers	just as many buds as flowers .
Flowers	was amazed at the amount for the value .
Flowers	next door neighbour absolutely loved them as well when mum invited her in to show them , then she was off to tell her mum .
Flowers	i will be a repeat customer 000_%.
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my mother on mothers_day and within one day of being received they were all but dead .
Flowers	i emailed them angrily about this and the service i received was phenomenal .
Flowers	quick reply and got a fresh batch of flowers and a £_00 voucher with no minimum_spend .
Flowers	will use again .
Flowers	my mother was very happy with the flowers and i was very happy with your service .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	nadine rawlins
Flowers	fantastic service , ordered in the evening delivered free by lunch time the next_day .
Flowers	i have used iflorist many_times to send flowers to the uk and france from where i live in australia because it is my only way of sending presents to people .
Flowers	the flowers have always arrived on time and made the recipient very happy .
Flowers	but this last time in december i ordered flowers for christmas_present for my mum and they never arrived .
Flowers	i contacted the so called live_chat to try and find out what happened and was given a tracking link that made no sense as it was a lot of destinations in holland and france with a final destination being 00km from my mums home .
Flowers	i florist have sent flowers here many_times so i assumed they used a local_florist .
Flowers	this time the flowers had been sent by a courier across_europe in a van to my mum and never arrived !!!
Flowers	the live_chat kept cutting me off telling they had been been received even_though i told them twice they hadn ' t .
Flowers	i decided to email iflorist instead , after trying 0 times they finally replied and told me exactly the same rubbish that they had been delivered and they reeled off the address where they had been delivered to which was my mums but that someone called calles had signed for them !!
Flowers	i explained that no - one called calles lives at my mums house so they must have gone somewhere_else .
Flowers	i was then told there was nothing they could do and was given a customer_service number to ring .
Flowers	again , i rang and spoke to someone and explained the same_thing again !
Flowers	this person was polite unlike everyone_else who i had dealt_with , they took my number and said they would ring back and find out what had happened and they never called me .
Flowers	when he took my number i explained that it was an australian mobile and he needs to use the code and he said " yeh , yeh , yeh , i know what to do " which made me think immediately that he had no_intention of ringing me back !
Flowers	so after contacting iflorist 0 times i have still not received a refund or redelivery .
Flowers	since i spoke to them my mum rang me to say on 00th_january_0000 , which was nearly 0 weeks_later she received a delivery of dead , slimy flowers and the delivery person did not request a signature !
Flowers	so after all the lies that i have been given about the flowers being signed for by someone at my mums house , they arrive dead !
Flowers	if iflorist advertise to send international flowers they should be able to find out when there is a problem with delivery .
Flowers	what has obviously happened is the flowers have been delivered by a courier across_europe and over the busy christmas_period been lost and left somewhere ... then delivered after christmas .
Flowers	i would like my £_00 . 00 back please iflorist , your customer_service is appalling and unfair .
Flowers	it is very difficult to contact people from australia so would have appreciated a bigger effort .
Flowers	or just a refund when i told you they never arrived .
Flowers	i ordered some flowers at around 0pm for my mum ' s birthday the next_day and they arrived bang on time and looked fantastic .
Flowers	the website was really easy to use and understand and the prices were very reasonable .
Flowers	i could easily upgrade my order to ' deluxe ' for little extra_cost .
Flowers	i was updated via_email and text at every_stage of the process , thanking and confirming my order , telling_me when the flowers were out for delivery and when they ' d been delivered .
Flowers	the brand voice and experience was great from start to finish , very easy to use and i ' d definitely use them again .
Flowers	very happy :-)
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my mum today for mothers_day and i am more_than happy with the condition the package turned_up in .
Flowers	my mum absolutely loves the too .
Flowers	i will be using the company again
Flowers	i routinely order flowers from australia to send to my friends and family in the uk , the website is so easy to navigate .
Flowers	the quality of the product is great and is more_than value for money .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered on a very specific day .
Flowers	on the day , i was sent a nice email_saying they were out for delivery .
Flowers	they never appeared , there was no email_saying that the flowers had not been delivered , there was no phone call .
Flowers	00_hours_later , the flowers were left at the back door .
Flowers	customer_service are hopeless , can not tell you what happened , have no accountability and send you the same tired email time after time .
Flowers	this company is a joke , go elsewhere .
Flowers	the site was easy to use and ordering was very easy .
Flowers	i ordered quite late in the day and still had next_day delivery which was great .
Flowers	i was notified whent he flowers had been delivered and they are gorgeous .
Flowers	great service at a very reasonable_price , thanks .
Flowers	i ordered a bunch flowers from serenata for my mother , next_day delivery as promised .
Flowers	however , the flowers that came looked nothing like the flowers i ordered .
Flowers	they where a cheap tatty bunch that i could of bought from tesco ' s for £ 0 .
Flowers	i was seriously unhappy with what i received and want my money back as they where not worth the money i spent on them .
Flowers	i will never order flowers from these again , trip to tesco next time .
Flowers	i can ' t even describe how pleased i was when my flowers arrived on thursday .
Flowers	the colour matches my bridesmaid dresses perfectly and they are exactly_what i wanted .
Flowers	there was no way i could have had such a perfect match with real flowers and so i would definitely_recommend silk_blooms !
Flowers	they handled my order perfectly from start to finish with continuous communication and delivering on their promise !
Flowers	i will_definitely be using them again :-)
Flowers	flowers 0 days late - will they turn_up ?
Flowers	doubt it now .
Flowers	claim that their delivery policy is made clear on ordering - it isn ' t !!
Flowers	don ' t use this company .
Flowers	so disappointed for my friend .
Flowers	ordered my flowers on 00 / 0 / 00 for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 they have ' t arrived still no email or anything , i have called them 00times no one ever picked_up the phone ... avoid them !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	00 / 0 / 00 still no email or flowers what a scammers !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i happened upon this site through living_social by_accident and couldn ' t have been happier with my purchase !
Flowers	the site was so simple to use and there were some utterly beautiful bouquets available to choose from .
Flowers	you can even choose your own card design and personalise the message on the front as well as within to make it just that extra bit special !
Flowers	delivery was super cheap and i ' ve every confidence that my bouquet will arrive in pristine_condition .
Flowers	i know my mum will be utterly thrilled with them on mother ' s day , i can ' t wait to get the ' thank_you ' phone call !
Flowers	thank_you iflorist , i ' ll definitely be back !
Flowers	x
Flowers	simply unacceptable .
Flowers	i am absolutely_furious about the quality of service i have not received from serenata_flowers .
Flowers	to remind you of what has taken place :
Flowers	on 00 january i received an_email from serenata telling_me that the flowers that i had scheduled to be delivered the very next_day would not be delivered due to a ' technical issue '.
Flowers	i was advised to use the link to reschedule for another day , get a free upgade or arrange a refund .
Flowers	instead of requesting a refund or an upgrade , i replied quickly requesting that the flowers be delivered the very next_day at 00am .
Flowers	since then i have had no reply whatsoever , no flowers have been delivered and my mum received no flowers as a thank_you for something very special that she did for me .
Flowers	my father spent all day wednesday waiting inside for the delivery of flowers that never came .
Flowers	in short , i am immensely frustrated with serenata_flowers - you have caused disappointment to my mother , inconvenience to my father and have made me look like a complete idiot .
Flowers	i have ordered from serenata before and have been very pleased with your service , however after this experience i simply cant communicate to you how disappointed i am with you .
Flowers	i expect more_than a full_refund as an_apology for your appalling customer_service .
Flowers	i also expect a reply within 00_hours .
Flowers	james m lawrence
Flowers	the decision and ordering_process was made really simple !
Flowers	hard to go_wrong really !
Flowers	will_definitely use iflorist again !
Flowers	fantastic ordering_process which allowed me to order flowers for 0 different_addresses , simply , fast and inexpensively .
Flowers	i ordered a £_00 flower_arrangement and paid extra to have them delivered on mothers_day .
Flowers	they ' ve taken the money but no flowers have arrived .
Flowers	i called the number from the website which now says they are no_longer taking calls on the number and recently noticed the number has disappeared from the website .
Flowers	what an awful company .
Flowers	very pleased with my order .
Flowers	will use this florist again .
Flowers	ordered flowers for mothering_sunday knowing my mother would be in .
Flowers	picked prestige because they claimed to deliver that day .
Flowers	arrived saturday .
Flowers	found in porch in full view of passers by .
Flowers	wilting and dying by next morning .
Flowers	cost was £_00 . 00 before delivery .
Flowers	bouquet nothing like advertised its pitiful .
Flowers	absolutely_disgusted .
Flowers	always send flowers .
Flowers	never_experienced anything like this .
Flowers	totally ruined day for both of us .
Flowers	if only i had read all the reviews from various sites before .
Flowers	i don ' t know how they are getting away with it .
Flowers	i am very disappointed with the bouquet which my girlfriend received on her_birthday .
Flowers	on the 00st of december i ordered cherry lips bouquet from iflorist .
Flowers	everything went fine but the bouquet which my girlfriend got doesn ' t look like the cherry lips bouquet which i ordered .
Flowers	instead of beautiful red_roses , she got a few different colours carnations with a few green leaves .
Flowers	i must mention i paid an extra money to make the bouquet bigger . are you serious florist ?
Flowers	i will not get back to iflorist again and i will make_sure all my friends will avoid it as well .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my wifes birthday but they did not arive when i contacted the company i was assured they would come the next_day ( the day after my wifes birthday ).
Flowers	this again did not happen .
Flowers	the live_chat is terrible with advisors who obviously have no clue about customer_service .
Flowers	i would stay well clear of this company , i will apparently recieve a refund in 0 - 0 working_days however i am left with a dissapointed wife and no flowers !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered flowers from eflorsit , the cost was £_00 including a vase .
Flowers	this was for my wife ' s birthday .
Flowers	i selected the next_day for delivery and i ordered before 0pm , the only delivery option was royal_mail for these flowers , i didn ' t think this was a issue and assumed that i would get them the next_day .
Flowers	they arrived 0 days late , were dead and had no sign of the vase i ordered , the bunch was also smaller_than in the picture
Flowers	eflorsit said that they can ' t gaurantee next_day delivery with royal_mail ... so why allow me to pick a delivery date and not warn me at any point during the order process delivery isnt gauranteed ?!?!
Flowers	( turns_out they do mention this on their site in the small_print at the bottom of the page !)
Flowers	i emailed the customer care team and got no respnose , i was told to allow 00_hours for a response so 0 days_later after spending over 00_minutes on hold got my money back .
Flowers	and very good value as well .
Flowers	ordered 00 quid worth of flowers for v day yesterday , ordered them a week before hand .
Flowers	not delivered , says order was cancelled on website login on the day .
Flowers	not email , not phone call and the number they give is a dead line .
Flowers	taken the money out of my visa , no sign of a refund and i am angry !
Flowers	not to metion the gf who was upset !
Flowers	someone report these scamming twats and take them to court !
Flowers	fue cumpleaños de mi mejor amiga , y por trabajo no puedo estar cerca de ella .
Flowers	gracias a floraqueen pude enviar un hermoso bouquet de flores a italia .
Flowers	buen trabajo !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet for a friend ' s birthday which was supposed to consist of white roses and purple freesias and paid extra to include a further 00 %.
Flowers	it looked lovely on the website but when it arrived my friend sent me a picture and it actually only contained the white roses and didn ' t look very special at all .
Flowers	i contacted e_- florist and did receive an initial response stating that they hadn ' t realised that there had been a problem with the freesias from their supplier and that they had decided to go_ahead and send the bouquet without them .
Flowers	they offered to resend a new bouquet or offered a partial_refund .
Flowers	i responded to advise that as the birthday had passed their seemed little point in resending the flowers and enquired as to the value of the refund .
Flowers	i sent this message on the 0th_july , sent it again on the 00th_july when i received no response and then also sent a further message through the enquiry form on the website just to ensure that there was no way it could have been missed .
Flowers	unsurprisingly i have still not had a response .
Flowers	i am completely dissatisfied with the overall experience .
Flowers	eflorist may be slightly_cheaper but this seems to negatively impact their customer_service which in my opinion is not worth the saving , especially given the time you will spend trying to obtain a satisfactory response !
Flowers	i would not use this company again and would warn friends that were thinking of doing so .
Flowers	i wanted to send a bunch of flowers to my new girlfriend at her office .
Flowers	the selection and prices offered on iflorist were really good .
Flowers	i managed to get what turned_out to be a beautiful bunch of red_roses and a box of chocolates delivered on time and as promised .
Flowers	the website is really easy to use and i had no_problems whatsoever .
Flowers	i received acknowledgement as soon as my order was submitted as well as one soon after delivery .
Flowers	my girlfriend was really impressed too , so thanks to all at iflorist for making her christmas even more special !
Flowers	this was the first time i have used an online florist , but i will certainly be using iflorist . co . uk again for valentines_day !
Flowers	xx
Flowers	wouldn ' t recommend this lot to deliver anything ever again .
Flowers	reason being we ordered 0 days before the selected delivery date to an international address for a birthday_present .
Flowers	to my horror , the flowers did not arrive .
Flowers	looking on the order tracking from dpd , the order was picked_up in the evening before the selected date and arrived into the country being delivered to at 0pm that day .
Flowers	the flowers then sat in the warehouse all weekend .
Flowers	the customer_service response refused to accept anything of their wrongdoing and blamed it solely on dpd with the message attached being , ' we don ' t guarantee international deliveries '.
Flowers	having looked into the order tracking more closely .
Flowers	the flowers were sent on the most basic option dpd offer , which on the dpd website specifically state that all deliveries will be made within 0 - 0 working_days .
Flowers	considering the flowers departed the point of origin late_afternoon the day before , there wasn ' t a hope in hell the flowers arriving on the date selected .
Flowers	when trying to explain that point to prestige_flowers , the person who responded couldn ' t quite grasp the obvious and still refused to accept any liability .
Flowers	i asked for a manager to call me to discuss my complaint and i ' m still_waiting for that response .... 0 days and counting .
Flowers	the matter has now been raised to trading_standards and raised a dispute on the payment via my credit_card company .
Flowers	lesson to be learnt - prestige_flowers can ' t be trusted and with the standard of customer_service received , don ' t deserve to be in business .
Flowers	do not use and if you have already commented report them to trading_standards .
Flowers	i have had no replies to any emails no contact number , flowers didn ' t turn_up , not been refunded had to go to my bank and call it back with proof of purchase .
Flowers	i used serentaflowers to send flowers and chocolates to my mum for her_birthday .
Flowers	i ordered the day before and they got there on time , no_problems , no hassle and my mum was very happy .
Flowers	i would definitely use them again !
Flowers	i order my flowers for both my gf and mum weeks_ago .
Flowers	nothing has arrived , no email apart_from order confirmation .
Flowers	have been trying , unsuccessfully to get in touch with them since this morning via live_chat , they have no phone number ... completely in the dark !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i just want to know the tracking_numbers to reassure myself that the flowers will be delivered !
Flowers	never ever again !
Flowers	p . s .
Flowers	it seems their livehelp site has just crashed ...
Flowers	no issues .
Flowers	good , easy online system .
Flowers	helpful email_updates about dispatch and delivery .
Flowers	according to recipient the flowers were well_packaged and " really beautifull ".
Flowers	would recommend to all .
Flowers	i would recommend the service to anyone , it was quick and easy and i liked the updates to my phone and email of the flowers progress .
Flowers	ordered hampers from iflorist / ihamper for christmas_presents .
Flowers	hampers were meant to be delivered on 00rd_december .
Flowers	didn ' t turn_up .
Flowers	called on 00th was assured they would be delivered that day .
Flowers	they didn ' t !
Flowers	i then had to rush out to buy more presents !
Flowers	which is not what i wanted to do on christmas_eve !
Flowers	when the office finially reopened i was told they had to do an investigation with the courier !
Flowers	i called multiple_times a weeks for over a month being fobbed_off time and time again !
Flowers	i have finially been told the item had been delivered so i wouldn ' t get a refund !
Flowers	i didn ' t recieve the items and am over £_000 out of pocket !
Flowers	don ' t think it should be me out of pocket due to a delivery driver taking it to the wrong place !
Flowers	customer_service is shocking !
Flowers	never any one in charge to talk to when you call up and they have put the phone down on me multiple_times !
Flowers	awful company !
Flowers	will be sending letters to paper , watchdog , etc , anyone who will listen !
Flowers	my boyfriend ordered a surprise bouquet of flowers for a special day as he was away on a business trip .
Flowers	it arrived the following_day and to make the matter worse , it was left at the door unattended and badly_damaged in torrential rain and the heavy wind .
Flowers	it was found soaked and lopsided in the corner of my garage door .
Flowers	at that stage i knew from my boyfriend that he ' s ordered flowers and he was quite furious about the delay .
Flowers	he ' s made a complaint for which they responded many days_later stating
Flowers	hi ,
Flowers	please_accept our sincere_apologies for the delay in replying .
Flowers	we request you to contact our head_office on <_external link_removed > regarding this matter .
Flowers	regards ,
Flowers	iflorist
Flowers	we rang and spoke to the customer_service guy who sounded_like he couldn ' t care less .
Flowers	he promised to speak to the boss and ring us back re : refund and unsurprisingly never returned the call .
Flowers	it left a bad taste in mouth and it totally ruined what could ' ve been a sweet experience .
Flowers	we feel appalled this is how they run the business especially at the current economical climate and there is no way this company will survive .
Flowers	business is all about the trust .
Flowers	they lost more_than just two customers .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered on valentines_day for my partner .
Flowers	when i initially purchased them i recieved confirmation stating the flowers would be with her on the 00th feburary .
Flowers	this was not the case at all !!!
Flowers	the flowers came today ( 00th ) at around 0 . 00pm , when she had already left !
Flowers	after waiting till_0pm on valentines evening i then had to go to a local_supermarket and purchase a bunch of flowers which i should not have had to do at all .
Flowers	plus , considering the time i had to go , as you can imagine these were the left overs that nobody else wanted .
Flowers	the payment of £_00 . 00 was already taken from iflorist and the time and date that their payment was agreed for was not met .
Flowers	this is an_absolute let_down for both my partner and myself .
Flowers	especially with her travelling back to university today .
Flowers	she did not and will not even get to see the flowers .
Flowers	i have sent an_email to support stating my issue and have still had no response as of yet .
Flowers	i have also logged an online ticket and i am still_waiting to hear back .
Flowers	i expect a full_refund .
Flowers	ever since i first discovered them , i only ever order flowers from e_- florist .
Flowers	unlike many places ( where to bouquets are quite tacky ), there are lots of stylish bouquets to choose from .
Flowers	they are reasonably_priced too and always delivered on time and as quickly as you need .
Flowers	i go straight to e_- florist every time !
Flowers	this is the second time i ' ve used you , and its still great , thanks !
Flowers	i ordered flowers for mother ' s day and did not receive them until 0 days_later the day was ruined , i emailed for refund of delivery / flowers was not given i think the company is disgraceful and very poor customer_service and myself and others i have told will not be using your services again .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for a friends 00th_birthday .
Flowers	they never arrived .
Flowers	what is worse , is i have contacted iflorist two times ( they seem to have no customer support number ) and they have ignored both my emails , not even offering an explanation or apology .
Flowers	i would never recommend using this company .
Flowers	they just take your money and are an unreliable service .
Flowers	i was very happy with the service that i got .
Flowers	000_%
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet of vibrant roses to be sent to my mother - in - law for mother ' s day .
Flowers	the flowers were due to be delivered on friday 00th_march in plenty of time for sunday .
Flowers	when i tracked my order i could see that it still said allocated and not delivered .
Flowers	i tried to contact the company over the weekend using the phone , the ticket raising section and the online help but to no_avail .
Flowers	the flowers were not delivered .
Flowers	i then spent the rest of the week trying to contact the company via_email and phone to find out what had happened to the flowers and to arrange a refund .
Flowers	having finally gotten though to someone , after ten_minutes on hold , all they could do was find out from the florist they had requested the flowers from where they were and then email me back , i felt thoroughly fobbed_off !
Flowers	obviously i no_longer require the flowers as mother ' s day has long passed .
Flowers	they say on their site that they have a 000_% guarantee but i ' m currently at 0_%!
Flowers	all i want at this point is a refund .
Flowers	i would not use this company for flowers , the customer_service is awful and virtually impossible to get hold of and your flowers won ' t even arrive !
Flowers	i ' m giving them until the end of the week to sort this out and if i get no joy i ' m reporting them to trading_standards and watchdog .
Flowers	iflorist contacted me regarding this matter and said after investigating i was due a full_refund .
Flowers	i have yet to receive this refund .
Flowers	i have tried_contacting them a number of times regarding this matter but they once again impossible to get hold of .
Flowers	avoid at all costs !
Flowers	brought through cashback , very good transaction .... flowers lovely
Flowers	well_done !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i had a delivery arranged for valentines_day to deliver to my partners work address .
Flowers	i had her wait there until 0pm but unfortunately the flowers didn ' t arrived until after this time ( this was a friday_night and so they were not picked_up until the monday ).
Flowers	not only were they delivered outside of the agreed delivery time but office security told my partner they were thrown inside the door without any care by the courier .
Flowers	needless to say i was very disappointed .
Flowers	i tried_contacting them via the ticketing_system and weeks_later no reply except for them to close the ticket as resolved .
Flowers	the delivery issue is something they need to look at with the courier but the lack of customer_service is unacceptable especially_considering the cost of the flowers .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered to my friend in australia for her wedding on february 00th .
Flowers	today is february 00th and they have still not arrived .
Flowers	the occasion has now passed so even if the flowers reach her now it would be pointless .
Flowers	i spoke to someone on the livechat application the day after the delivery was supposed to arrived and they guaranteed they would contact the florist in australia who the order was with and email asap .
Flowers	two days_later i have still had no contact from anyone .
Flowers	today i rang the office number for iflorist and the call was answered by a completely disinterested member of staff .
Flowers	she tried to fob me off saying the flowers may have been left with a neighbour .
Flowers	when i explained to her that this was not the case as my friend had checked she didn ' t know what to say .
Flowers	she then_proceeded to tell me she would contact the florist via_email and get back to me by the end of today .
Flowers	when i explained there was a 00 hour time difference and i doubted very much the florist would reply in the middle of the night she didn ' t seem at all concerned .
Flowers	i now have no interest if the flowers are delivered or not .
Flowers	the occasion has passed and the surprise has been spoiled for a dear friend .
Flowers	all i want in a refund for the £_00 i handed_over .
Flowers	terrible , terrible service all_round .
Flowers	please avoid this company at all costs .
Flowers	how impersonal can you get with serenata_flowers .
Flowers	0 / flowers arrive delivered in a box .
Flowers	0 / left with reception and just left without passing them to my wife .
Flowers	i could have dumped them on reception for that matter .
Flowers	0 / i paid an extra 00 for grandissimo option , expecting beautiful white blossoms to break up the dozen red_roses .
Flowers	nothing , just a bunch or roses , shoved together .
Flowers	definitely not grandissimo .
Flowers	0 / the flowers were wrapped in the most basic of wrapping papers , very disappointed .
Flowers	ive spent far less at flower shops and got a lot more .
Flowers	will never buy from here again or off the internet come to that matter .
Flowers	service doesn ' t exist .
Flowers	just good at confirming your order taken and delivery thats all you get .
Flowers	no delivery on valentines_day , no communication and no delivery the next_day either .
Flowers	scam_artists , stay well away .
Flowers	update_: tuesday 00th still no delivery
Flowers	i have used serenata before and they have been great .
Flowers	i decided to order some flowers for my grandma ' s birthday last_week and they didn ' t just come very late in the day but the quality of the flowers were awful .
Flowers	they ' re already dying and only received them on thursday .
Flowers	i have been really impressed with their service but unfortunately after this i will not be using them again .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for international delivery almost a week before the delivery date .
Flowers	they failed to arrive on time .
Flowers	when i contacted online help all i got told was " well , we ' ve put the order through to the local_florist " and " perhaps if you leave it a couple more hours " the last one was at 0pm local time !
Flowers	i was worried when i read a lot of negative_reviews but can_honestly say i had no problem with the company !
Flowers	i ordered the flowers on the tuesday_afternoon to be delivered to a london office the following_day .
Flowers	the order process was easy , then i was getting email_updates re my order and then had an update once it had been delivered the next_day !
Flowers	all in all it was great .
Flowers	arrived on time , flowers were lovely and the choice to add like a balloon was a fab idea !
Flowers	thank_you for making my sisters 00th_birthday that bit more special .
Flowers	i was very disappointed with the daffodils i had purchased especially as i had upgraded the bouquet to a larger one .
Flowers	they arrived and were all fully open and dying with some already dead .
Flowers	i had expected the daffodils to arrive in a similar state as you would purchase them in a shop , a mixture of unopened and just starting to open flowers so they could be enjoyed for a number of days .
Flowers	when you send flowers it is usually for a significant reason and i was disappointed to find out the gesture was of shadowed by the poor quality of the flowers .
Flowers	couple this with the expense of sending daffodils ( in comparison to the couple of pounds you can buy them for in a shop ) i would not recommend serenataflowers . com .
Flowers	i highly_recommend serenata_flowers excellent service !
Flowers	will be using them again in future .
Flowers	flowers were sent half_dead and very small , ordered balloons but they didn ' t even turn_up .
Flowers	very difficult to get hold of them on the phone , waited for an_hour to finally get through , sent a pic like they asked but they wouldn ' t refund !
Flowers	do not use this company !!
Flowers	very bad service and terrible flowers !
Flowers	waste of £_00 !
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my mum for mother ' s day , and picked next say delivery , i was told they would be delivered sat 00th_march and also had an_email_confirming this .
Flowers	saturday went and i sent 0 emails chasing them up with no reply , sunday came and went and another 0 emails with no reply !!
Flowers	the flowers finally turned_up on monday after mother ' s day and as they had obviously been in transit for days we ' re half_dead !!
Flowers	a phone call made and staff were so unhelpful but have me a managers email , i emailed saying i wanted a refund , had no reply !!
Flowers	disgusting service !!
Flowers	surfice to say i will be taking this further
Flowers	i was told the flowers were lovely and the delivery was the exact day i asked for , would definitely use again
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my gf and have countless_times tried to contact iflorist to find out information_regarding its delivery time , and to track it a service i paid extra for !
Flowers	i have not received any reply apart_from a pathetic automated_response and there online_chat doesn ' t work .
Flowers	there is no way of calling them as there is no phone number , if the flowers do not get delivered today i will be furious !
Flowers	communication is disgraceful !
Flowers	i really needed to find some flowers for next_day delivery and i hunted through google and found serenata_flowers , ordered a bunch for next_day , then i began reading reviews !
Flowers	i was horrified , and very nervous that my flowers would not make it and i have been checking the status update all day only to have a very pleased mum thanking me for beautifull flowers .
Flowers	i ordered the flowers around midday the day before and they were with her by 00 the next_day !
Flowers	very happy customer and i will use them again !
Flowers	:)
Flowers	no issues , flowers were great , no_problems with delivery
Flowers	have used them a number of times and never had an issue .
Flowers	website ordering was very easy to navigate and ordering was very easy .
Flowers	asked for next_day and i received text and email_updates to let me know when the flowers were dispatched and when delivered !
Flowers	extremely good service and flowers were lovely .
Flowers	they arrived in a box which i found interesting !!
Flowers	will order from them again !
Flowers	et utroligt højt kortgebyr ( mastercard ) på 00 kr !
Flowers	som jeg_ikke føler at der bliver gjort ordenligt opmærksom på ( og selv fakturaen nævner det kun indirekte ved at lægge gebyret til buketprisen ... så ser det jo nok lidt mindre farligt ud ?).
Flowers	desuden er hjemmesiden sådan indrettet at det_er_meget svært at hoppe frem og tilbage i bestillingsprocessen , så_jeg 0 . måtte starte forfra et_par gange ved fejlvalg 0 . på betalingsskærmen ikke kunne gå tilbage for at se hvorfor at prisen med_et var 00 kr højere end jeg_havde regnet med , og derfor blev nød til bare at betale for ikke at skulle starte helt forfra igen .
Flowers	desuden er_der 00 prisintervaller fra 000 - 000_kr på div .
Flowers	buketter .
Flowers	på billedet ser man buketten til ca 000 - 000_kr , så hvis_man vælger en buket til under eller over dette beløb ved man jo reelt ikke hvor meget eller hvad man får for pengene .
Flowers	i always use serenata to order flowers for friends and relatives .
Flowers	not only are their costs extremely competitive , they are extraordinarily reliable and offer next_day delivery .
Flowers	i have never been disappointed by their service - always arriving on time and delivered by very competent and pleasant people .
Flowers	the flowers are also very beautiful and i have always had comments from recipients about how lovely the flowers are and how long they last .
Flowers	i recommend serenata regularly to my friends and would use the service again and again .
Flowers	my only comments would be 0 ) to add more design options for personalised cards and messages and 0 ) to maybe have an option for a sunday delivery - this is something offered by very few online flower delivery services and i think this would set serenata apart_from competitors if they could offer this service .
Flowers	perhaps just on certain sundays ?
Flowers	such as mothering_sunday ?
Flowers	look fab and arrived as expected .
Flowers	0st_class company couldn ' t have asked for more ordering on line was so easy and paypal accepted answell and i loved how i kept getting funny updates on there progress . 00 / 00 on every_aspect of the transaction 00 / 00 would recommend to anyone
Flowers	ordered 00 red_roses it is now 0000 still no delivery , i have emailed them no reply
Flowers	i was sent a email with a link to tracking and when i went on it the number i was given didnt match any order , well thanks iflorest you take my money but dont deliver surely they carnt get away with this the least you can do is refund all of us please beware and dont use iflorist .
Flowers	00 / 0 / 00 still no flowers well i florists i want a full_refund it is to late for the flowers now how can you treat people like this i managed to speak to some one and they told me their lorry got stuck in snow wot a load of rubbish refund please .
Flowers	00 / 0 .

Flowers	0000 on the 00 / 0 still no reply to my emails so you leave me no choice so i will be contacting tradingstandard on monday and taking the matter_further not happy my order no is p000000
Flowers	just had a email from i florist to say i am getting a full_refund , i will wait and see if i get it
Flowers	i have used the service of iflorist on quite a few occasions and they have never failed to deliver .
Flowers	there range of chose of flowers is brilliant , the ease of ordering on the internet is stress_free .
Flowers	they have always delivered on the date that i have put in and who every receives them always sends me a text to say how lovely they are and how happy the flowers make them feel .
Flowers	zoe
Flowers	on 00 february i ordered flowers to be delivered to my girlfriend in australia for valentine ' s day .
Flowers	the money was taken out on the same day .
Flowers	the flowers never arrived and i have not received a refund .
Flowers	i don ' t live in the uk at the moment and so cannot phone their 0000 number .
Flowers	the " live_chat " service has never been online when i have attempted to us it .
Flowers	i have not had a single response to any of the ten emails i have written .
Flowers	all in all the worst service from any company i have ever received .
Flowers	it was very disappointing as today was my birthday and my boyfriend wanted to surprise me with a cake and some flowers that never arrived .
Flowers	he placed an order with them and i had to stay in all day to wait for the delivery that never arrived .
Flowers	it is definitely a lack of customer_service as they didn ' t even border to give him a phone call and let him know what went wrong .
Flowers	more_than that when we tried to contact them we received no answer .
Flowers	i wouldn ' t recommend this company to anyone ... the experience was awful as my birthday past and i had no present delivered .
Flowers	good prices , easy to purchase .
Flowers	just simple and elegent would recommend to everyone .
Flowers	quick speedy_delivery and beautiful bouquet
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet of flowers on the 00th of december in order to receive them on the 00th of december as a gift to my wife .
Flowers	on the 00th we made sure that someone was in the house at all times and also mentioned to my neighbors to watch out in case we didn ' t see them being delivered .
Flowers	the bouquet never arrived , they were supposed to be delivered via yodel , and i received an_email_stating that they had been delivered , it also stated they had been left safe ( strange as i was at home ), so i ran around my house looking for them but found nothing , i then spent about an_hour knocking on neighbours doors trying to find if they had been delivered to the wrong_address , but noone had received the delivery .
Flowers	as they were closed on the 00th and 00th i proceeded to contact yodel to follow my delivery who stated that they had been left in the front porch .......
Flowers	i do not have a front porch ?
Flowers	i then contacted iflorist who can only be contacted via live_chat on their website and they take about 0 mins to answer any 0 line of questioning or response , very slow .... all i was told is that they will investigate .
Flowers	so now i have a very unhappy wife who thinks i forgot about her flowers for christmas and no response as to when or if they will be delivered
Flowers	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i emailed iflorist and chatted to them online on the 00th and still have no response after 00hrs
Flowers	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i have chatted to iflorist , they have told me to check with neighbours , which i had already done on the 00th and now the flowers were dead , they then gave me a phone number to call : 00000000000
Flowers	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i have called iflorist , they have told me they will be getting the flowers redelivered on the friday 0th of january so they will be delayed by a total of 00 days late , i also asked if they were going to do anything_else , and the answer was a simple : " no , company policy_states that all we can do is have the flowers redlivered "
Flowers	i was very pleased with the out come of my order from serenata_flowers , the flowers and vas were beautiful and the teddy was really cute and cuddly , they got there on time and nothing was broken :) i would shop with them again x
Flowers	could not fault the service , flowers looke fine , however when i arrived home to see them , i asked my fiance where she had put the rest of them , but there were no more .
Flowers	you must try this site .
Flowers	i ve ordered two bouquets today and i know my loved_ones will adore them .
Flowers	ive used the company before so i know what im talking_about !!!!
Flowers	xxx
Flowers	i am absolutely appauled by their service .
Flowers	specified for delivery on mother ' s day , as they offered .
Flowers	flowers were delivered saturday , however nobody was around to recieve them , as obv we were expecting them on sunday !
Package_Service	very good customer_service :)
Package_Service	despite me waiting in all day , my collection did not take place on the date arranged which was disappointing , but the reason i am still scoring 0 is because of the great service i received when i brought this to p0g ' s attention - within minutes , my agent richard_mileham had rebooked my pick_up for the same day that i contacted them ( using a more_expensive service ) - richard was very polite and helpful , so all in all , i am very happy .
Package_Service	just a side note , i have used p0g many_times before now , and up until this occasion , there has never been a problem , so can only assume that this mishap has been a one - off .
Package_Service	request them to import an item ( laptop that an employee was using ) from nepal , first of all it was delivered to wrong_address and after chasing them i found out after 0 days it has been delivered to wrong_address .
Package_Service	when i went to pick it up i was shocked to see , the laptop was damaged , box was opened , battery was missing and there were marks on laptop too .
Package_Service	terrible services , never using them again .
Package_Service	i booked yodel through p0g - they are useless and didn ' t turn_up .
Package_Service	i personally think p0g should not use them as a supplier .
Package_Service	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
Package_Service	she change our courier to a ups drop_off service .
Package_Service	i will_definitely be using p0g again because of samantha ' s help and just pay for a better 0rd_party supplier !
Package_Service	it would be useful if p0g had a number you could call - the live_chat was brilliant when i eventually found it though !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i was recommended by a family_member to use parcel 0 go .
Package_Service	i had two packages to send to two different locations and it couldn ' t have been easier .
Package_Service	you select the service , weight , dimensions , if you would like to insure for an extra_cost ( i did , as i had expensive goods but you don ' t have to ), and finally the details of the receivers .
Package_Service	once this has been completed , you are provided with the labels and simply print off .
Package_Service	because the website explained that their collections are anywhere between_0am - 0pm , i expected them to be collected at the later time but , to my surprise , they turned_up at 0am the next_day !
Package_Service	also , i received positive_feedback from my customers ( the receivers ) as they were updated via_email , from parcel 0 go , of when to expect their delivery .
Package_Service	really pleased and would definitely_recommend !
Package_Service	i needed to post off a parcel with some speakers which weighed a not - so - small 00kg .
Package_Service	at this weight royal_mail becomes ridiculously_expensive , so i looked to couriers for help .
Package_Service	firstly i went directly to the couriers , which i ( wrongly ) assumed would be the cheapest thing to do , and my favourite courier is ups .
Package_Service	so i logged_onto the ups website and got a quote of £_00 . 00 for them to collect and post my parcel .
Package_Service	this was too much for me to pay , so i researched and found this company , parcel0go .
Package_Service	so i went_ahead and got a quote from them , and gave me a huge list with various couriers and varied speeds that my parcel would be delivered .
Package_Service	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back £_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was £_00 . 00 for me ).
Package_Service	i did initially wonder_how it was so cheap , as it was half the price that ups are offering on their own site !
Package_Service	and i assume that parcel0go takes a share of the price i pay !
Package_Service	well , i should never have doubted anything as the next_day the ups driver came and collected my parcel , and was delivered the day after .
Package_Service	great service !
Package_Service	oh but a word of warning , don ' t use tnt or hermes as they receive a lot of criticism , just pay a couple of quid extra and use dhl or ups !
Package_Service	thanks a lot parcel0go !
Package_Service	i will_definitely be using you again !
Package_Service	had a little_bit of a problem with the website and initially thought it was a website problem but it was actually my mistake .
Package_Service	once i figured out what i was doing wrong it was plain_sailing and enjoying the ease of sending all my parcel out
Package_Service	catherine very polite & helpful service will use again .
Package_Service	i been using collect_plus many_times as ebay seller , they have really good prices and so many shops around where you can drop your parcel even after work .
Package_Service	tracking_system is amazing too , you don ' t need to worry what ' s going on .
Package_Service	i think the score is so low because people who had good experience usually don ' t come to write a good comments but people who had bad_experience coming here to complain straight_away , that ' s why there are so many negative_reviews .
Package_Service	once again i think it ' s the best delivery service and i am very happy that they are here .
Package_Service	i sent my parcel via their service , there was a problem with my parcel and it got kept in the custom .
Package_Service	they made no effort in updating me whatsoever , i tried to ring them many_times , emailed them , every time they just respond to me with a generic answer .
Package_Service	they were very rude and not helpful at all .
Package_Service	in the end it took them 0 months to get my parcel back , and i had to pay 00 pounds extra for it to be returned to me .
Package_Service	absolutely outrageous !
Package_Service	as soon as they take your money , they just won ' t care any more .
Package_Service	please do not use their service if you don ' t want to get ripped_off !
Package_Service	emma was really helpful today in queries .
Package_Service	she went extra_mile .
Package_Service	[_name ] helped_me with an order and was very efficient and helpful .
Package_Service	i have started using parcel0go as my courier of choice and they have been excellent so far .
Package_Service	keep up the good work !
Package_Service	the prices are great the service is great .
Package_Service	i always use this site and haver never had any_problems ever .
Package_Service	all the staff are really helpful if you ever have queries .
Package_Service	id like to mention a particular member of staff - [_name ], very helpful indeed , a credit to the company , keep it up !
Package_Service	a really good service with extremely_helpful staff .
Package_Service	an operator called jenny helped_me with an international shipment and looked in depth into a query for me .
Package_Service	i will_definitely use again !
Package_Service	seriously poor service .
Package_Service	p0g knew this was important and they charged over £_00 for next_day service .
Package_Service	on tuesday .
Package_Service	wasn ' t collected until thursday and now on monday , it ' s still not their .
Package_Service	their customer_service staff have no clue .
Package_Service	they are worse than useless - the entire company !
Package_Service	easy to use website , fast and secure .
Package_Service	collection is easy to organize
Package_Service	downside ( very small one but ...), pity collection times can not be more specific than 0am_till_0pm for example ?
Package_Service	not parcel0go ' s fault would be a nice addition in my opinion to their website .
Package_Service	also a surcharge for using paypal is disappointing as i use ebay and paypal a lot !
Package_Service	support staff both on facebook and website all very helpful and knowledgeable , a credit to their employers !
Package_Service	hi i booked 0 parcels through parcel0go never arrived to collect the parcels i contacted parcel0go on their website because they dont have customer_service no .
Package_Service	they said cant do anything never ever use parcel0go
Package_Service	have been speaking to ' rowan ' for an eta on my delivery .
Package_Service	have been advised it would be delivered 00 / 00 / 00 between_0am - 0pm .
Package_Service	hopefully this will happen and i will have a happy birthday girl on saturday : )
Package_Service	thanks again rowan .. excellent service
Package_Service	booked a parcel for collection today .
Package_Service	contractor on site turned the collection company away .
Package_Service	i got straight onto p0g and daniel sorted my problem out in under 0 minutes via the web chat .
Package_Service	very pleased , good service !
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	still unknown_reason_why i didn ' t get my collection today , so contacted customer_service on live_chat , and i was speaking to matthew , who quickly sort it out and re - booked my collection for next_day .
Package_Service	he was very polite and apologised for no show of the courier .
Package_Service	unfortunately my parcel will be delayed and have to wait another day at home with my fingers_crossed that they will show to collect it .
Package_Service	i don ' t use courier companies outside work but i had to send a package back to a retailer .
Package_Service	i sent it from london , it was picked_up from my house and went to birmingham .
Package_Service	i booked this in on thursday_morning and this was picked_up and delivered by friday .
Package_Service	it was not that expensive and i was shocked at the service .
Package_Service	i can ' t recommend highly_enough .
Package_Service	[_name ] made sending my parcel so easy .
Package_Service	even when i got it wrong , [_name ] fixed my mistake quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	a credit to your company !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i spoke to sam , she was so helpful and friendly .
Package_Service	i couldn ' t have asked for better service .
Package_Service	she kept in touch and checked everything was okay from start to finish .

Package_Service	thank_you sammie_taylor
Package_Service	this was the best customer_service i had from any company so far and i have to deal with a lot of companies .
Package_Service	sammie was very helpful and handled my problem with ease .
Package_Service	i wish all customer agents were as helpful as sammie .
Package_Service	thank_you sammie and i hope to deal with you again .
Package_Service	kind_regards
Package_Service	robin
Package_Service	katie at parcel0go was swift and efficient .
Package_Service	very helpful in deed , highly skilled individual and a great company .
Package_Service	i just had an online conversation with brian regarding some_confusion with a parcel .
Package_Service	he was on top of things withing 0 minutes !
Package_Service	and had an initial response time of 00 seconds or even less .
Package_Service	you were a great help , thanks mate !
Package_Service	i contacted jenny for abit of help and sorted it out straight_away , many_thanks again ;-)
Package_Service	excellent website easy to use and there online help is second to none .
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	cheap and fast !
Package_Service	better_than royal_mail !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	stephanie was i great help ( thanks )
Package_Service	catherine_corless is a very kind and efficient member of your staff , i highly_recomend this service to anyone .
Package_Service	i was served by sarah_hayes , which made everything in very efficient way
Package_Service	interparcel failed to deliver our parcel to the spanish islands , and now want to charge us £_00 for the privilege !
Package_Service	watch out for their small_print , which says they are allowed to charge for returns .
Package_Service	they say the delivery address is " unregistered ", which sounds_like a poor_excuse to me - especially since they managed to deliver a slip to our customer saying the parcel had been returned .
Package_Service	final moral of the story - always include a local recipient phone number on your parcel , that way the courier has less of an excuse .
Package_Service	we ' ll certainly never use interparcel again !
Package_Service	i am an ebay buyer and had refused a parcel from a seller i purchased for as i no_longer required the item .
Package_Service	since i told the seller this i have had problems with the seller who had been telling_me that i was responsible for the liability of the parcel if it did not arrive with them or was damaged .
Package_Service	i spoke to emma through the live help and she was excellent !
Package_Service	and i have now penned a dispute against the client - very concise and clear and made me feel more confident about my predicament - thank_you !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	brilliant as always , have been using parcel0go many_times within 0 years now .
Package_Service	today again received brilliant support from sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	you are an angel
Package_Service	thank_you parcel 0 go .
Package_Service	they ' ve picked_up two laptops which i sent at a reasonable_price .
Package_Service	would highly_recommend them .
Package_Service	[_name ] was the one to help my father in his venture ( with no facebook his son is writing this review ) thank_you for a most excellent level of customer_satisfaction .
Package_Service	hi ,
Package_Service	i just wanted to thank the team at parcel0go for making parcel sending so easy .
Package_Service	i sent a parcel with them in january and had no_problems , then received emails from them with offers so i logged on to send another .
Package_Service	i was wary as i had read a few negative_reviews on facebook and other review sites so was unsure , but i took a chance as i had no_problems with my first delivery .
Package_Service	i have to say the everything was brilliant :) i had a few queries when sending my parcel and wih my account so was in contact via the live_chat a couple of times and the team ( charlie , sammie , stephanie ) were very helpful and attended to my every need .
Package_Service	it is a very simple and easy process and i would recommend parcels0go to everyone .
Package_Service	the collection was made on the scheduled day ( by city_link ) at 0pm and was delivery was made to the recipient 0pm the following_day .
Package_Service	i am very pleased and advise_anyone who reads the negative_comments to ignore them , parcel0go are 0 *****
Package_Service	kimberley x
Package_Service	after royal_mail increased their prices i have been looking for a good quality service with good pricing .
Package_Service	i decided to give transglobal express a go , the item was collected promptly and arrived in great condition the next_day .
Package_Service	i would recommend transglobal to anyone , their prices are much_better_than going direct with some of the companies which is a big plus for me .
Package_Service	i will be using them again in the future without a doubt .
Package_Service	william was prompt , helpful and helped_me with everything i asked for .
Package_Service	i ` m impressed by these great people being there always when i need the help .
Package_Service	thank_you so , so much
Package_Service	very happy , will use again
Package_Service	pucka company , i ve been using them for 0 years and not only meeting my expectations but i am over the moon , customer_service is great too , just like emma i spoke to earlier and she was brilliant .
Package_Service	thanks a million
Package_Service	i love you parcel0go specialy katie , she was superb and genius , i have been using parcel0go for more_than 0years now , no_problems at all , best rates .
Package_Service	wwwooowww
Package_Service	great service , quick replies and all sorted .
Package_Service	was helped by sarah_hayes , she was quick with the information i needed , and was very helpful in sorting the query i had with my order .
Package_Service	many_thanks !
Package_Service	their website openly advertises the difference_between next_day ( 00h ) and two day ( 00h ) consignments on their inviting website , what they don ' t tell you is that if you pay a premium for a 00h service , you shouldn ' t apparently expect a next_day delivery .
Package_Service	this company has made our business look completely unprofessional to a high value client and has tarnished our name in doing so .
Package_Service	be very careful when using this site .
Package_Service	once they ' ve taken your money , they will not be any help to you .
Package_Service	always use parcel0go , easy to use website , great service and always sort any probs very quickly and effectively .
Package_Service	i booked a delivery for my parcel using parcel0go but there was a problem for the courier in delivering the parcel as i had the incorrect address on the parcel , so i was concerned that the parcel would not be delivered so i contacted parcel0go through there online live_chat and was very surprised to find how fast there service was in dealing_with quires as jessica was very helpful and she was able to re - arrange the delivery to the correct address with in just a couple of minutes
Package_Service	had a problem with my order quickly resolved and quickly replied to messages overall excellent
Package_Service	i got my product in 0 days from london to delhi .
Package_Service	and my product was absolutly fine .
Package_Service	there was no damage .
Package_Service	this is realy time saver and cheap from other parcel companies .
Package_Service	it has been 0 years now and we have used parcels0go regular each week .
Package_Service	we can send upto 00 parcels a week with them .
Package_Service	if i need any help they are always there on live_chat like sarah who i have just spoken to , to arrange change of address .
Package_Service	with having lot of customers our selves there are one or two parcels over the years that might get damaged or lost but as soon as i give the relevant info i have always had a good offer on return .
Package_Service	i have used the drop and collect service and was happy ( until yodel took over ) now i am using hermes again and never had a failed collection or any_problems with them .
Package_Service	i would high recommend these and all these people that don ' t you must be doing something wrong .
Package_Service	again thank_you to parcels0go for a great service
Package_Service	excellent customer_service query answered by samantha in super_quick time .
Package_Service	would def use this service again
Package_Service	received excellent customer_service from sammie_taylor at parcel0go .
Package_Service	will_definitely use again , thanks :)
Package_Service	made the order for collection , realised our printer didn ' t work , contacting the company via the livehelp , and was assisted extremely quickly by jessica ( which , apparently is her real name ), who sorted everything out for us in around a minute !
Package_Service	basically they are not the ones that do the delivery , they arrange it for you !
Package_Service	they are the middle_man !
Package_Service	unfortunately they are not very good at it and they don ' t really have much control of whats_happening !
Package_Service	their customer_service is a complete nonsense !
Package_Service	the team comes across incompetent and incapable to assist particularly with international deliveries !
Package_Service	i ' m not gonna go into details but if you have a choice go for another service !
Package_Service	and never ever ever choose parcelforce to deliver anything under no circumstances !
Package_Service	[_name ] on live_chat support was very helpful .
Package_Service	i had written the wrong postcode in the collection address but was all sorted with new updated labels within 0 minutes .
Package_Service	hassle - free !
Package_Service	i use parcel 0 go all the time , their prices are very competitive and great value for money !
Package_Service	it ' s so easy to book a collection or delivery with them and they have drop_off points all over .
Package_Service	the live_chat staff are great , they help instantly if you have any_problems .
Package_Service	i recently had a problem and lizzie sorted it out for me perfectly !
Package_Service	can ' t fault them :)
Package_Service	waiting for a parcel on a 0 - 0 day delivery - a birthday_present for my son .
Package_Service	after 0 days their site said parcel was delivered but i hadn ' t received it .
Package_Service	their website has no contact number on it but i managed to track one down and phoned up .
Package_Service	they refused to give me any info " because i wasn ' t the sender " but they would " raise a query " with the courier and i might hear in 00_hours .
Package_Service	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn ' t even been collected yet , it ' s been a tracking error ".
Package_Service	what ?
Package_Service	so you would think they would rush over and collect it and express delivery it on a 00 hour service .
Package_Service	but oh no - it ' ll just be 0 - 0 days from when it gets collected .
Package_Service	seriously ?
Package_Service	what a complete_joke .
Package_Service	and why don ' t they have their number on their website ?
Package_Service	" because we ' re a web based company ."
Package_Service	no , you ' re a human_being sitting in a physical office working for a company that has a website that doesn ' t bother to give customers their phone number .
Package_Service	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
Package_Service	had a few questions about using some of the international services and emma found local information on the carrier in greece quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	because of her service i will use parcel0go .
Package_Service	this is by_far the best experience i have had from a courier when rebooking collection .
Package_Service	thank_you parcel to go and especially sammie_taylor
Package_Service	the tracking -- 0k0000000000a000 -- said my parcel was delivered .
Package_Service	i emailled them to say we hadn ' t received it .
Package_Service	they replied later the next_day saying no one was home , so the parcel was left in the shed .
Package_Service	but ( a ) we were home all day and no one buzzed the door ( b ) i checked the shed and there is no parcel in the shed .
Package_Service	not to mention , if they had put a parcel in the shed , you ' d think they ' d leave a note .
Package_Service	i ' m sure the real reason no one rang my door and that there is no parcel in my shed is because their delivery man stole it !
Package_Service	kirsty has been very helpful and understanding :)
Package_Service	very patient and detailed service .
Package_Service	takes the hassle out of moving
Package_Service	my rep was a great help dealing_with my question , & was provided a fast & prompt service regarding my questions & was able to resolve my problem instantly -
Package_Service	would recommend again in the future for ( on - line support ) :)
Package_Service	would use again but slight dificulty recieving their emails in microsoft outlook , try another browser
Package_Service	been chatting with sammie_taylor on my first transaction with these_guys and she has helped_me through step by step with the transaction .
Package_Service	excellent !
Package_Service	thanks for the help sammie !
Package_Service	just chatted with rob on parcels 0 go . com brilliant sevice .!
Package_Service	answered all my questions .!
Package_Service	great :)
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go . com for a while now and they have always been great .
Package_Service	easy site to use and give the best prices out there .
Package_Service	i had my first problem today with the site saying i needed the live help to assist me .
Package_Service	i did and thanks to the very helpful and polite catherine my order has been organised and my parcel is being picked_up later today .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	wish more customer_service people were that helpful .
Package_Service	will_continue to use parcel0go for all my courier needs .
Package_Service	daniel from parcel0go was great .
Package_Service	very nice to chat to plus quick at fixing the problems .
Package_Service	top_marks for him and parcel0go .
Package_Service	great service every time .
Package_Service	i don ' t know how this company is still in business .
Package_Service	the customer_service is non - existent .
Package_Service	we ordered a painting for my parents wedding_anniversary and use interparcel as the courier it arrived to us 0 days day with no explanation or apology we opened the packaging to find the frame and glass smashed .
Package_Service	the answer we received was that its no there problem well i ' m sorry but if i am putting my faith in your company to complete a simple_task as to delivery my parcel to me in one piece so of us quite clearly can not do their job properly .
Package_Service	ill give you a clue , its not me !!!!!!!!!!!!
Package_Service	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single_person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay_away .
Package_Service	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
Package_Service	all correspondence i have had with this company will be being sent to trading_standards and also watchdog and would suggest everyone_else do the same .
Package_Service	its about time companies like these get what they deserve .
Package_Service	this company and there dodgy third_party companies have cost me a further £_000 in repair costs not to mention £_000 on a new painting for my parents wedding_anniversary .
Package_Service	i was like i have a problem and bang in comes samantha not only did she solve my problem but she is now my new bestfriend !
Package_Service	great service and i couldn ' t think of a better way to spend my thursday_night !
Package_Service	good services !
Package_Service	tom was extremely_helpful and very professional today on 0 separate_occasions !
Package_Service	regards
Package_Service	lindsey barlow
Package_Service	really amazing service .. i use them all the time and really the best .
Package_Service	am a power seller on ebay and i ship a lot , and they are always helpful .
Package_Service	just easy transaction and delivered on time .
Package_Service	they have some good deals specially with ups .
Package_Service	will sure use again
Package_Service	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
Package_Service	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
Package_Service	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
Package_Service	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
Package_Service	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer_service lines .
Package_Service	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
Package_Service	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
Package_Service	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer_service via his customer_service line .
Package_Service	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer_service line .
Package_Service	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
Package_Service	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
Package_Service	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
Package_Service	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
Package_Service	now , let me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
Package_Service	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
Package_Service	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
Package_Service	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
Package_Service	i had spent over £_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
Package_Service	moral of the story ?
Package_Service	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd ...
Package_Service	the silver lining .
Package_Service	lauren_w of parcel0go . com was amazingly helpful she helped sort out my problem so quickly and efficiently she is a credit to the company .
Package_Service	i had a really big problem with one of the delivery companies and she sorted it out no problem and talked me through processes and answered all my questions in a professional yet friendly_manner .
Package_Service	i was in such a bad mood about all this delivery trouble i was having but now i know its been sorted out im happy again and its all thanks to lauren_w , so thank_you lauren you were wonderful
Package_Service	i needed to reschedule a collection and sammie_taylor answered my request swiftly and very politely using the online_chat interface .
Package_Service	abousuley brilliant service and very helpfull spoken to a lady catherine_corless and she was so helpfull and talked me threw it step by step .
Package_Service	will_defo be using the service again thanks again catherine xxxx
Package_Service	help assist me in what i needed straight_away , thank_you
Package_Service	just want to say how helpful your on line chat service is .
Package_Service	i had a problem with collection today and isabella helped out by re arranging my collection for tomorrow .
Package_Service	thanks again parcel0go !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	0nd review : thank_you once again sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	you were most helpful and patient in helping me out again .
Package_Service	great customer_service from sammie h at parcel0go . com
Package_Service	great service thanks
Package_Service	i went via topcashback and as a first timer for using a courier it was really straight_forward and i liked all the options available .
Package_Service	and the prices were good too !
Package_Service	my declared dimensions were correct for the entire package .
Package_Service	i can prove that my dimensions were correct for this shipment .
Package_Service	as i said in my last e mail to your customer_services i have photographic_evidence .
Package_Service	where is yours ?
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	it the 0st time iv used parcel0go and what a great service .
Package_Service	i made an error when i book my collection which was sorted fast and with know problems by there online_chat helpline .
Package_Service	the young_lady ( leanne ) was great got me sorted out in 0 minutes flat .
Package_Service	i will be using this service again in the future .
Package_Service	00 out of 00 .
Package_Service	used collectmyparcel . com a couple of times and had no_problems .
Package_Service	booked the day before and the collection has always been made on time .
Package_Service	excellent service all_round .
Package_Service	my go to company for parcel delivery .
Package_Service	had an issue with cancellation was dealt_with effectively by a fantastic member of staff " sarah " should get a pay_rise , as she did her job very satisfactory to my requirements .
Package_Service	a ***** service !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	brilliant and very fast service from sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	she was very polite , helpful and quick to source the problem and fix it for us .
Package_Service	thanks so much !
Package_Service	i could not fault her .
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go so many_times i ' ve lost_count and each and every time the customer_service i ' ve experienced has been amazing .
Package_Service	i ' ve imported items from the us , shipped ebay items around the world and sent domestic packages across the uk without any hassle whatsoever .
Package_Service	this company really know how to look after me and with updates on twitter and facebook , it ' s great to know i can get hold of someone if i have any_questions about tracking or general questions .
Package_Service	a special mention has to go to kate and george who go the extra_mile .
Package_Service	thanks guys !
Package_Service	parcel0go also run competitions which is great because i hardly_ever win anything but it at_least gives me hope .
Package_Service	i also think they ' re great value for money ( a 0 day courier which usually arrives in a day anyway for about £ 0 - brilliant !)
Package_Service	and the ease of use of their website plus google_checkout / paypal for payment is so easy even a child could do it .
Package_Service	i thoroughly and wholeheartedly_recommend parcel0go to anybody looking for a trustworthy and reliable courier agent .
Package_Service	they ' re my courier agents of choice and i won ' t be using anybody_else .
Package_Service	i must_say i am happy with the quality of the delivery .
Package_Service	however , way too expensive .
Package_Service	i spoke with emma on a live_chat , she amended my invoice immediately and emailed it to me within_seconds .
Package_Service	very helpful and very fast !
Package_Service	[_name ] gave great service with a friendly and helpful attitude
Package_Service	the service i recived from sammie_taylor was probally the most polite and helpful ive ever recived i strongly sugges a pay_rise for this lady
Package_Service	i ' ve had a few issues over the last few_days with changing addresses and cancellations and i must_say , emma and elizabeth have been absolutely amazing with their help on the live_chat .
Package_Service	i am a strong believer in good customer care and yours in second to none .
Package_Service	thank_you for all your help parcel0go . com :) without you box frame canvas_prints would not run so well
Package_Service	very helpful and polite .
Package_Service	give her the prize !
Package_Service	first and last time i ' ll use them .
Package_Service	waited in all day to collect my parcel , didn ' t turn_up .
Package_Service	you also have to wait_until 0pm at night before you can question whether anyone is actually going to come for the collection - by then it ' s too_late to make alternative_arrangements .
Package_Service	the only thing you want from a delivery company is reliability and they failed .
Package_Service	when you speak to chat representative they just offer to reschedule your collection .

Package_Service	i have found my chat with rob very helpful yesterday :) best_wishes .
Package_Service	thank_you for help .
Package_Service	parcel0go were very helpful , they entered all the information for me via the live_chat so i only had to pay for the delivery , i would definitely use them again .
Package_Service	i will never use them again .
Package_Service	they failed to collect the parcel , failed to rearrange for 0 days , would not give me my money back ( even the extra i paid for next_day delivery - which clearly didn ' t happen .)
Package_Service	on chat to customer_services for over half an_hour and still no apology .
Package_Service	awful
Package_Service	made a review earlier , had apologies and now today ' s booking hasn ' t turned_up .
Package_Service	i am not shocked , interparcel is really struggling at the moment .
Package_Service	best to go elsewhere whilst they sort themselves out .
Package_Service	was booking a parcel going to zambia for work and kept getting an error_message ,
Package_Service	i spoke to very helpful and funny lady_called cathrine who sorted out a problem via the live_chat , i had to wait a little_bit but was offered a small discount which was very nice .
Package_Service	nice to speak to someone with a personality not not just a yes / no policy robot .
Package_Service	will_definately use again .
Package_Service	what a great company , would recommend to anyone !
Package_Service	will use again !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	absolutely_brilliant .
Package_Service	polite from the start , quick to reply and very helpful .
Package_Service	first_class 00 / 00
Package_Service	the company provide an great service for a good price .
Package_Service	if you ever have a problem , they are fast and efficient in helping you , especially if you use the " live help " option .
Package_Service	however , a third_party soils their good name , that third_party is yodel .
Package_Service	yodel damaged my parcel when it was being delivered , i was forced to return the contents to the seller , he arranged collection , again , through yodel , and they failed to arrive at all !
Package_Service	the following_day , he rearranged collection with tnt and i ' ll be ...
Package_Service	they didn ' t seem to have a problem with collecting a parcel .
Package_Service	a far_superior company .
Package_Service	my live_chat with emily was fast and solved the problem in a matter of moments .
Package_Service	conclusion ; highly recomment p0g but avoid using yodel where possible .
Package_Service	i needed a collection rebooked .
Package_Service	the agent i spoke to , sammie_taylor , was very friendly and helpful and sorted my issue out within_seconds .
Package_Service	wonderful service .
Package_Service	will_definitely be using again .
Package_Service	thanks sammie !
Package_Service	i always use these_guys , and very rarely have any_issues .

Package_Service	sarah_hayes was fantasic x
Package_Service	i entered my email address incorrectly and emma found the invoice .
Package_Service	thank_you so much !
Package_Service	i needed a quick response from parcel0go and that ' s exactly_what i got .
Package_Service	sam , who i spoke to , was polite and really helpful .
Package_Service	quick contact and provided the best support possible .
Package_Service	also put up with my confusion !
Package_Service	would definitely_recommend - a great service .
Package_Service	parcel sent to a wrong destination now it stuck in the custom can ' t move forward or go back .... now from 00th_december 00 these are the replies i receive when ever i ask ...
Package_Service	...................................................................
Package_Service	i am_currently awaiting some more information from the courier , unfortunately until i get this response i cannot advise any further .
Package_Service	.............................................................................
Package_Service	i am chasing this with ups xxxxxxx , and will revert to you as soon as i possibly can
Package_Service	..............................................................................
Package_Service	please_accept my apologies for the delay in my getting back to you .
Package_Service	ups have advised that it is currently with customs , and have not yet responded to my escalation emails .
Package_Service	................................................................................................
Package_Service	as soon as i have any information i will let you know .
Package_Service	.................................................................
Package_Service	when you made the original booking , you were given a selection of couriers .
Package_Service	on this occasion you selected ups , during the booking process , you agree that customs_charges may apply if a shipment is being sent outside the eu .
Package_Service	customs_charges can include duties , taxes , brokerage fees and disbursement fees .
Package_Service	all of these are beyond our control .
Package_Service	we do recommend contacting customs before shipping to check any charges which may be payable .
Package_Service	............................................................................
Package_Service	don ' t you have any better reply other than as soon as ..... and since 00th_december no update or direction i have received ....
Package_Service	transglobal depend on successful rate but are not prepared for a complex case which is the worst thing for a company ... a small issue can not be solved and it takes months ......
Package_Service	this is the third time i ship with ups and getting the same trouble .
Package_Service	imagine you are sending a parcel to london and ups delivered your parcel to scotland and then the ups broker gives you 0 options ( scotland and englan is u . k )
Package_Service	( 0 ) it is an international parcel so you can either come to scotland pay documents hand over fees and clear the parcel yourself or
Package_Service	( 0 ) pay a broker fees equivalent twice of monthly wage and we have no_idea of import and tax duty so wait but there is no time_frame as soon as we clear the parcel we will deliver it to you ...
Package_Service	how would you feel ?
Package_Service	remember this information is received after a week the parcel has arrived in transit not main destination and nor this information prior the booking , and when you complain you are told that we do not have any influence in custom or ups in your country so a receiver should contact ups local ...
Package_Service	sending the parcel back to a sender you are told to pay more_than sending cost
Package_Service	terrible for a parcel which cost less_than 00 pound to pay 00 x for only agency fee ....
Package_Service	fantastic help from richard_mileham
Package_Service	i use parcel0go as they help me deliver cycle parts to my customers on time and profitably , while still offering very good prices .
Package_Service	i have decided to top up the full_amount and keep the account ...
Package_Service	thanks to [_name ], one of the best advisors there , and fellew cyclist in exceeding expectations in customer_service at p0g and helping cyclesorted grow !
Package_Service	[_external reference_] <<<< cycle sorted ... cheers [_name ] p
Package_Service	was let_down by a rival company so tried these .
Package_Service	couldn ' t have gone smoother .
Package_Service	they even text me the minute my parcel was delivered .
Package_Service	spoke with richard_mileham who was extremely_helpful and helped be perfectly with my query .
Package_Service	was having trouble booking my parcel , up popped emma and she booked the whole_thing for me .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	will_definitely use again .
Package_Service	thank - you sammie_taylor for all your help , it was an easy and smooth process thank - you
Package_Service	i had never used this service before and had to use the live_chat option .
Package_Service	the girl that helped_me ( sarah_hayes ) was very pleasant and quick in responding to my queries !
Package_Service	parcel0go offer a good range of courier services , meaning you can chose economy or speed or something in the middle .
Package_Service	the website is easy to use to process orders .
Package_Service	their customer_service is great - always prompt answers to queries and any_issues quickly solved .
Package_Service	recommended for any courier needs .
Package_Service	sam was very helpful , as always , in an issue with printing labels .
Package_Service	their facebook_page is a great way to contact them .
Package_Service	i ' ve used interparcel many_times and never had a problem .
Package_Service	i always use parcelforce as the courier and never had a problem there either .
Package_Service	the website is easy to navigate , and the customer_service when you do need to call them is very efficient and helpful .
Package_Service	i will use them everytime i need to send items bigger than what royal_mail allows .
Package_Service	had problems with labels when printing order , assistant paul was extremely_helpful emailed me the labels within few mins - no_problems , great service !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	a terrible company to choose ,
Package_Service	i paid for next_day delivery , which had my dad ' s gift for his_birthday in it .
Package_Service	it sould have arrived as stated the next_day ...
Package_Service	it came in the evening 0 days_later ..
Package_Service	when i contacted the company 0 times they didnt bother to reply , thank_god for paypal !
Package_Service	who tried to contact them but were unable to and had got my money back !
Package_Service	if only people listened to the bad_reviews this company would be longer running , i used beginning of the year when my parcel never arrived i was told the label had probably come off , with lots of rude messages from an ebay buyer i refunded fully , it took another 0 weeks of constant emails to get refunded and that wasn ' t even in full even_though i had paid more to cover it , so last wed i thought i would give them another try and again low and behold my parcel has gone wallows again .... was collected so the tracking says and that ' s it .......
Package_Service	they don ' t know where my parcel is and got same response " the label may have come off " that label was stuck to that package the only way it could come off if it was cut with scissors !!
Package_Service	( because of them saying this last time ) something fishy going on here for 0 high priced covered parcels to go missing ....
Package_Service	even_though i am covered i bet again i don ' t get a full_refund and i will have another unhappy ebay member .... if you have any sense you will read all the negative_reviews and book with someone_else .
Package_Service	i gave them the benefit of the doubt and i am going to be out of pocket again :( worst service ever
Package_Service	[_name ] not only answered my question quickly , clearly and helpfully , but she also took care of my follow_up question before i even needed to ask !
Package_Service	one of the best customer_service interactions i ' ve ever had - this is the quality service that keeps me coming_back to parcel0go time and time again !
Package_Service	=) thanks so much [_name ], i hope our paths cross again !
Package_Service	excellent service .
Package_Service	the live help operator who dealt_with my query ( daniel ) was most helpful and professional .

Package_Service	i sent a glass hob via them , and it was smashed in transit .
Package_Service	parcels0go said it had been returned to them , so i didnt need to send photos of the damage , as they had the item .
Package_Service	0 weeks_later without compensation , they then sent the item back , and demanded i sent images of the damage !
Package_Service	what a joke !
Package_Service	they then offered £_00 compensation for a £_000 item !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	use someone who actually care about the customer !
Package_Service	i talked with jessica in the live_chat and she was very helpful .

Package_Service	every destination has been quick and affordable !
Package_Service	make_sure you read the " important information & restrictions " which is on the same page as the weight / dimensions and check the area you are sending .... as some areas may have a remote surcharge ?
Package_Service	was recommended to parcel0go by a buyer on ebay as was limited to buyer collect only for larger items .
Package_Service	parcel0go has allowed me to extend my delivery options to the whole of the uk .
Package_Service	their website is very easy to get quotes for and will tie all your orders together if you use the same email address and do not create an account at first , as i did .
Package_Service	there prices are competative and allow you to goes from a wide_range of dispatch methods varying on speed and cost .
Package_Service	i have only had one issue which related to not being_able to edit my registered email address , but their livechat service is very good and helpful .
Package_Service	i was assisted by craig who ' s messages came_across friendly and polite , which is not an easy task when only using text based communication .
Package_Service	as services go , parcel0go is very useful and from my experience , they have the back - up customer support to go with it .
Package_Service	i always get good online help from parcel0go !
Package_Service	i have sent a lot of parcels with parcel 0 go for pleasure and business and always find the service to be brilliant .
Package_Service	they are always , fast at responding and efficient .
Package_Service	a recent issue i had catherine sorted for me and was brilliant , if everybody was like her the world would be a better place .
Package_Service	i have no_problems in recommending parcel 0 go to anybody looking for a courier .
Package_Service	i would reccomend p0g to anyone , they are easy to use , friendly , and very helpful if you need it .
Package_Service	they even come to your door to collect your parcel , so you don ' t even need to go anywhere !
Package_Service	i had a collection scheduled but didn ' t manage to print the label in time , " no_worries , i ' ll come get it tomorrow " the driver reassured me .
Package_Service	i think we should be on first name basis now , it ' s always the same driver who collects from me !
Package_Service	however , when i ' d gotten upstairs i realised ...
Package_Service	i ' m moving_house at 0am tomorrow , and i have no_idea how i forgot !
Package_Service	i quickly got onto the website and logged in to get my p0g delivery number .
Package_Service	i used the contact page to use the live_chat option .
Package_Service	i was connected immediately to a friendly helper named lauren , i asked her if it was possible to reschedule the collection , but at my new address .
Package_Service	she checked if it was possible , and quickly came back to say yes , and if she rescheduled it for friday , would i get access to a printer in time , on confirming , she sorted it all out for me , sent me the emails through and wished me luck in my move !
Package_Service	a very friendly and painless service .
Package_Service	good job , p0g !

Package_Service	i have booked the collection / delivery by parcel0go .
Package_Service	i called to ask when would be the collection time as i need to go out on the day just for an_hour .
Package_Service	i was hoping that the call_centre agent would be able to tell me what sort of time ( morning or afternoon ) so that i can pop out before / or after the collection .
Package_Service	unfortunately , the answer i got was the time_slot given was 0am to 0pm , which means that i have to wait in all day .
Package_Service	when i call to cancel , the agent said she was processing the cancellation , but when i checked on the website , it still depicted that the collection had been processed and myhermes agent would come and collect the parcel .
Package_Service	this means that nothing has been done to cancel the order . the agent on the live_chat was quite rude , too .
Package_Service	very frustrating !
Package_Service	when i went there website for first time , i got a great response from their chat system .
Package_Service	best greetings by emma , too good to be true !
Package_Service	so , i ordered a delivery to deliver from my shop to my customer .
Package_Service	it ' s already 0th days & they didn ' t show up to collect my delivery box .
Package_Service	how lucky i am .
Package_Service	yup i am lucky , because if they are this late to only collect , then how can i trust to deliver my product on right time ?
Package_Service	collect when they say they will every time and i have never had anything ' go missing ' like other carriers .
Package_Service	after booking the services required i tried printing off the labels .
Package_Service	i had trouble because my printer died to put it simply lol .
Package_Service	after getting home i asked [_name ] ( not me lol ) if he could refund me the full_amount .
Package_Service	it was done without any trouble and we had a little laugh afterwards as well
Package_Service	spoke to a guy_named sam regarding a parcel that was sent with parcel0go . com .
Package_Service	he was very friendly , helpful , and straightforward .
Package_Service	need more customer_service like this !
Package_Service	0_stars .
Package_Service	i ' ve been very pleased with my overall experience with parcel0go so far - i was desperate to ship my christmas_presents back to france , and this is by_far the cheapest option .
Package_Service	also , i did a mistake whilst registering my order , and my chat assistant , sam , was incredibly rapid and efficient ; he fixed my mistake in no time while answering my questions .
Package_Service	keep the good work up , guys !
Package_Service	jeg_bestilte_en_pakke med hjælp fra shopusa og_det hele gik fint , indtil de sendte pakken fra deres terminal .. pakken er nu væk på 0 uge og efter 0 - 0 mails hører jeg_ikke fra dem , og kan_ikke få fat på dem på hverken mail eller telefon .
Package_Service	kan absolut ikke anbefale shopusa til nogen , for der_er ingen hjælp hvis din pakke bliver væk , så lader de som ingenting .
Package_Service	went on the website to purchase a parcel , decided to use the live_chat to get some information , and i spoke to katie , who was very helpful and efficient !
Package_Service	i would really recommend the website and the live support , and for katie ' s service i ' m sure she should get an award !
Package_Service	she was very polite and responded well to all the queries i had about the website , thank_you katie !
Package_Service	[_name ] is very patient
Package_Service	i am in a state of utter stress because of my move at the moment !
Package_Service	i had an urgent query , that seemed a hopeless case to me , but i thought i ' d try the live_chat help anyway .
Package_Service	and bang , a lovely person called gemma was there , immediately cheering me up by being really friendly and putting smileys etc !!
Package_Service	and what i thought was a hopeless request , was transformed into something that might actually work out now by her as well !!
Package_Service	top_marks for gemma !!
Package_Service	efficient , quick , helpful , friendly , positive !!
Package_Service	really refreshing to have a person that ' s working in customer_services who seems to actually enjoy her job for once !!
Package_Service	:))
Package_Service	thanks gemma , and i am praying for everything to work out at my pickup tomorrow !
Package_Service	let ' s hope , your great help helped !!
Package_Service	;))
Package_Service	used this website to send some boxes from the uk to ireland recently , after several astronomical quotes elsewhere i decided to chance these_guys , i ' m_glad i did .
Package_Service	i would thoroughly_recommend using this service , the pickups were all on time and friendly , the delivery was accurate and extremely quick and the whole service was very reasonably_priced and easy to use .
Package_Service	this company is a disgrace to all parcel companies .
Package_Service	they claim to do unbelieveable high tech deliveries but when it comes to basic common_sense they have none .
Package_Service	stupid drivers and even stupider depot managers who are a waste of space .
Package_Service	do not use u have been warned !!
Package_Service	i did not have this luxury
Package_Service	i locked myself out of my account and used their live_chat to speak to daniel , one of the customer_services representatives at parcel0go .
Package_Service	the chat was very friendly and he managed to fix my log in immediately .
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	brilliant help , when yodel yet again failed .
Package_Service	i had never used the service before .
Package_Service	i found the person i dealt_with , andrea to be very helpful .
Package_Service	won ' t hesitate to use the service again or to recommend it to others !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	spoke woth natalie on livechat as i booked a parcel , then realised i had to go out .
Package_Service	natalie was wonderful and told me i could rebook or if i felt it was safe enough along with other t &_c ' s , i could leave it in my porch for the dfriver to collect .
Package_Service	thank_you natalie :-)
Package_Service	the box here says ' write as if you are talking to a friend ', well after talking to jenny , i can safely_say i have made a true friend .
Package_Service	someone who is willing to go out of their way to help me with my problem .
Package_Service	then once she has found the solution to my problem , continues to help me though the entire_process , to make it as easy as possible for me to change some date ect .
Package_Service	she is a star , i think the sky will be a little darker tonight now she has fallen and is amongst us mere mortals .
Package_Service	hopefully one day i will have problems with my package again , and she will not hesitate to help me out with clean boxes and put a smile on my face .
Package_Service	give jenny a promotion , heck , give her your job mr manger who reviews employee reviews !
Package_Service	shame there is no 0_stars option .
Package_Service	go jenny !
Package_Service	another top quality service from p0g - i use these_guys on a regular_basis for sending parcels abroad and have had nothing but top quality service .
Package_Service	even when the website acts a little screwy the instant chat / help function is there to help .
Package_Service	- a big thanks to catherine who helped_me book a parcel to ireland when the website wouldn ' t ;¬)
Package_Service	i sent a parcel to america , the delivery slot was 0 am until 0 pm and they were at the doorstep for 0 am !
Package_Service	the delivery guy was very helpful , i was able to track the parcel right through to delivery when i received an_email telling_me it had been delivered .
Package_Service	the very next_day as well !
Package_Service	the process all the way through from using the website to being told the parcel was delved was faultless !
Package_Service	and the cheapest around !
Package_Service	would not hesitate to use parcel_hero again , amazing service .
Package_Service	nicole was amazing from the moment we started our live_chat !
Package_Service	she found the soultion to my problem quickly and changed my order without any_problems !
Package_Service	she was very polite and i felt completly at ease talking to her !
Package_Service	i was skeptical when i realised it was only a live_chat , but this has completly changed my mind .
Package_Service	thank_you nicole your cutsomer service was fantastic !

Package_Service	had a problem using the label i had to print and contacted parcel0go using the chat_function .
Package_Service	they replied and advised me instantly and rob the advisor sorted out my problem perfectly and was quick , polite and very helpful .
Package_Service	could not reccommend the service i received any better_than 000_% perfect .
Package_Service	plus good value for money and excellent company .
Package_Service	super !
Package_Service	adviser ' katie ' was very helpful :)
Package_Service	great on - line help from sarah_hayes at parcels to go , she dealt_with the problems i was having booking my collection quickly and efficiently .

Package_Service	stay_away i wouldn ' t wish this company on my enemies !
Package_Service	0 star is 0_stars too many
Package_Service	i think she should be promoted , or given a large pay_rise as she helped my business out hugely today
Package_Service	fantastic service ,
Package_Service	hi , i typed to catherine on the livechat feature on the website and she was very helpful and answered my question very quickly .
Package_Service	cheers catherine :)
Package_Service	had an issue all of my own doing and the help livechat assistant , richard_mileham , was so helpful , sorted my issue promptly , politely and with great ease .
Package_Service	yet more great service from parcel0go . com
Package_Service	i ordered a few items on wednesday 00th_june_0000 and paid for next_day delivery .
Package_Service	i was kept_informed_throughout whole_process , my order was delivered on thursday 00th_june_0000 at around 0am , by a lovely delivery driver .
Package_Service	i was given options brought text and email to rearrange my delivery if needed too !
Package_Service	so much_better_than other_companies i have used in past few_days !
Package_Service	will_definitely use again !
Package_Service	thank_you for your excellent service !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go a few_times now and have never been disappointed .
Package_Service	the service is always as committed and the customer support is first_class .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor is a star and never_fails to deliver :-)
Package_Service	most companies these days when you encounter a problem keep you waiting on the end of a phone line and nothing is ever resolved in your favour .
Package_Service	this has never been my experience with ' parcel 0 go ' they have always been most helpful even when the problem is of my own creation , they are also very quick to resolve issues .
Package_Service	i was drawn to them at first by their reasonable prices , but i have stuck with them for the service .
Package_Service	i would recommend them to any small business person such as myself .
Package_Service	i started the live_chat as i was unaware of the whereabouts of my parcel regardless of the parcel tracker .
Package_Service	emma assisted me and i was able to determine when my parcel would be delivered to me .
Package_Service	thanks emma :) merry xmas
Package_Service	interparcel are the ' middle - men ' agents between couriers and customers .
Package_Service	i dispatch all my sales through interparcel - they are cheap and cheerful !
Package_Service	all my collections have been picked_up when stated ( except when it was snowing - the customer_service team were outstanding at re - arranging collection with a different courier at no extra charge !)
Package_Service	and i have never had any reason to complain .
Package_Service	delivery status is visible at the click of a button and i can provide my customers with a link too !
Package_Service	personal use , again no issues what - so - ever !
Package_Service	thoroughly_recommend them for price , service and helpful ' ness !
Package_Service	first things first , parcel0go acts as a ' middle - man ' agent between the courier companies and the customer .
Package_Service	because they give so much business to the courier companies , they get bulk discounts !
Package_Service	unfortunately , parcel0go is giving honest couriers a bad name !
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go on two occasions , first time the parcel collection failed , twice .
Package_Service	hdnl were apparently instructed to collect on 00th_jan but the delivery driver had paperwork that suggested otherwise .
Package_Service	second time i had a time - dependant package to send !
Package_Service	the parcel was not collected so i cancelled the order only to find out that the 0 % surcharge on paypal payments is apparently non - refundable .
Package_Service	they do not state anywhere that this surcharge is non - refundable - so after arguing with a belligerent customer support agent ( who i later found out was a senior_manager and owner ...) for twenty minutes and threatening various actions they finally_agreed to refund my money i was rightfully owed !
Package_Service	finally , their only form of contact is via_email or on - line chat .
Package_Service	the on - line chat takes_forever to get connected to a person ( average 00_mins )!
Package_Service	this company is run by a bunch of crooks and hopefully they will go out of business very soon and save a lot of people , a lot of hassle !
Package_Service	had a quick query to do with an order i was in the process of making , and had a fully professional and prompt response to the query from the agent i spoke to ( samantha ).
Package_Service	highly_recommended
Package_Service	many_thanks for your help with sorting the delivery of our parcel .
Package_Service	any_problems we will be contacting sammy_taylor at parcels to go
Package_Service	i would recommend anyone to try collect_plus more affordable way to deliver items and more efficient than royal_mail .
Package_Service	i used parcel0go to find the best option to send a parcel to germany for christmas .
Package_Service	i had a question about one service which was quickly and sufficiently answered by the very lovely becky .
Package_Service	nice service , not too formal and i received the answer i needed .
Package_Service	i had a problem with an order but , sarah_hayes quickly came to my rescue .
Package_Service	all sorted thanks sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	as always , this company is leaving to our ( consumer ) expectation .
Package_Service	i ' ll surely continue to use parcel0go .
Package_Service	once again thanks sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	regards
Package_Service	i would like to say thanks to andrea on live_chat for amending some details on my order .
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	i made a mistake filling out information for a parcel i am sending to usa .
Package_Service	i jumped onto the help chat , and catherine_corless , came to my crying call .
Package_Service	she was friendly and clear with her help , and managed to reassure me that the parcel would get through customs fine .
Package_Service	with it being the first time i have sent a parcel to usa .
Package_Service	i really_appreciated how personable she was .
Package_Service	taking real interest in assisting me .
Package_Service	highly_recommended , and a high five for her friendliness .
Package_Service	it ' s something that should be valued much higher in businesses :-)
Package_Service	always good prices , will use again .
Package_Service	many_thanks :-)
Package_Service	i have never_experienced any major problems when using the p0g service either nationally or internationally .
Package_Service	i had a small blip this morning , when i could not see or access a customers order for the paperwork i needed .
Package_Service	after about 0 minutes with a very pleasant operator named ashley t , i had the paperwork emailed to me and the order was ready for dispatch .
Package_Service	thank_you ashley for a quick , easy and pleasant resolution to my problem
Package_Service	finish my problem . thanks a lot !
Package_Service	i was stuck in a pickle - i made mess of weight and only realised after purchase ...
Package_Service	p0g was there for me as usual , with an amazing price , charlie fixed my error and it was only 00p more - despite being a kilo and a half out !
Package_Service	and kept the same delivery slot , despite being well after hours ...
Package_Service	i mean , seriously .
Package_Service	time and again , p0g have been just brilliant , whether delivering or collecting .
Package_Service	i can ' t honestly recommend them enough .
Package_Service	that ' s why i keep_coming_back .
Package_Service	and now they have a mobile_app !
Package_Service	who knew ?
Package_Service	with parcels 0 go you can send your packages efficiently and at good value .
Package_Service	and more_importantly if you need help with the service ( or anything_else life style wise ) their team is there to help .
Package_Service	emma saved the day .
Package_Service	excellent all_round service by daniel :)
Package_Service	have now been waiting 0 months for my claim cheque for good which the courier damaged , have contacted parcels 0 go 0 times now and get told the same_thing " no problem the cheque is on its way i will make_sure the claims team contact you " still nothing .
Package_Service	they are useless do not use .
Package_Service	take your parcels to the post_office .
Package_Service	do not use do not us do not us utterly hopeless time after time .
Package_Service	well , predictably i suppose , yodel failed to show up today .
Package_Service	the collection was booked in and presumed to be all fine , but yodel being yodel had other ideas .
Package_Service	just used the parcel0go live_chat_function for the first time , very helpful and quick and efficient customer_service from lizzie , which is far more_than can be said for yodel ' s customer_service !
Package_Service	hopefully i won ' t need to use the live_chat_function again , but if i do i ' ll be confident and happy to do so !
Package_Service	top work parcel0go !
Package_Service	was given help from daniel with a problem i had with a booking .
Package_Service	very fast and friendly .
Package_Service	if only all customer_services could be this helpful !
Package_Service	many_thanks .
Package_Service	had an issue with parcel being collected on wrong day courier went to collect !
Package_Service	thought i would have to pay again but ( emma ) sorted it at no cost !
Package_Service	brilliant thank_you
Package_Service	live_chat is always instant and helpful .
Package_Service	prices are competitive and 00_% of the time cheapest .
Package_Service	it gets a 00 from len .
Package_Service	and a 00 from me .
Package_Service	all perfect , as it should be , nice and simple
Package_Service	i have been using fedex for years and never had any_problems .
Package_Service	i send parcels in australia and france , they are fast and always on time to collect and deliver .
Package_Service	i have used several companies but they are the best !
Package_Service	the online tracking is good as well .
Package_Service	great courier that i would recommand to anyone who wish to send a parcel abroad .
Package_Service	i needed help with a lot of different questions including price for sending a parcel , how it works with dropping off / delivering etcetera and i got very good help from stephanie at the chat !
Package_Service	i also spoke to andrea on the chat service whilst going through the process as i was using them for the first time , she was very helpful and guided me through the whole_process .
Package_Service	the total cost was an astonishing £ 0 . 00 cheaper then what royal_mail wanted to charge for a package worth only £_00 . 00 !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	will_definatley use this service again .
Package_Service	emma was a great help , couldnt have done it without her !
Package_Service	samantha has been amazing , i have been trying to book a courier to brazil for days !
Package_Service	one agent couldn ' t help me yesterday , samantha talked me through each_step , she has easily been the best agent i have spoken to on here , it now makes my decision clear !!
Package_Service	i will always use parcel0go for all my couriers just because of samantha !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	sammie_taylor - great quick advice and help
Package_Service	i had a few questions about parcel delivery prices .
Package_Service	i used livechat service and was connected to jessica .
Package_Service	she was very polite and patient .
Package_Service	jessica answered on all my questions with every detail i needed .
Package_Service	having such a great service i am sure that i will place an order soon .
Package_Service	william - representative has been absolutely amazing , and mega helpful especially that a person before him ignored me and disconnected .
Package_Service	very attentive , friendly and served me great advice .
Package_Service	well_done william .
Package_Service	thank_you for the excellent help and advise this evening - fantastic representative and went the extra_mile
Package_Service	this is the first time i have used this company and rest_assured this will be the last !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	and i ' d ask people to seriously think_twice before using them .
Package_Service	this company has a total disregard for any packages that have been placed under their care especially the ones clearly_marked with fragile and do not bend .
Package_Service	is it about time these types of companies and the courier they use were investigated to see how our valuable packages are actually handled ?
Package_Service	how many_times have you had a package delivered and it ' s been damaged , lost or stolen ?
Package_Service	as for compensation , think again , they ' ll try and wriggle out of any such claim .
Package_Service	i think investigations into these companies are long over due .
Package_Service	just had a chat with sammie_taylor who was ever so helpful !!
Package_Service	thanks a lot
Package_Service	great service until you don ' t meet the minimum_spend criteria as an account holder .
Package_Service	we were penalised around £_000 in one invoice .
Package_Service	great service for receiving and sending parcels but avoid_avoid_avoid setting_up a business account unless you are absolutely certain you will meet the minimum_spend criteria !
Package_Service	brilliant , speedy response and the super helpful emma is a star !
Package_Service	thank_you .
Package_Service	annie

Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	i run a couple of online stores and have always found couriers were just too expensive to use , despite the better servive they provide compared to royal_mail ( sorry royal_mail !).
Package_Service	a friend introduced me to this site and i thought it was too good to be true !
Package_Service	a dog bed that would have cost me between £_00 & £_00 to send on a 00 hour cost under £_00 for 00 hour service .
Package_Service	site was easy to use , very customer friendly and i will_definitely use again for business and personal use and have already_recommended parcel0go to several friends and customers !
Package_Service	keep up the good work !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	~ great company to use , helpful and easy to talk to if you have a problem and always handle claims respectfully and easily , deliveries are handled quickly and easily and there are many drop_off points so really convenient if you cant_wait in all day .
Package_Service	had a problem today and spoke to [_name ] who was very helpful and friendly !
Package_Service	highly_recommended !
Package_Service	i had a slight_issue with a parcel not being collected on monday , which was the fault of the courier company , not p0g ( remember that these_guys are facilitators and not courier ' s themselves ).
Package_Service	however , i used their online_chat tool to speak with george in customer_services and i have to say that i was thoroughly pleased with the service i have received .
Package_Service	george was extremely_helpful and rearranged collection immediately , reissued collection notes and uprated the delivery service to ensure my parcel still arrived on time .
Package_Service	parcel was collected today .
Package_Service	great service and will_definitely be using again - especially with their facebook discount_code !
Package_Service	parcel0go save a fortune posting anything over 0kg - and they collect from your door
Package_Service	have good xmas
Package_Service	sammie was very professional .
Package_Service	made reference to my name during the conversation and was also very very helpful .
Package_Service	great .
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	cut a long_story short : needed to send a package to the us .
Package_Service	went to the local post_office and they asked for silly money .

Package_Service	thank_you

Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go now several_times and will_continue to use them in the future , it ' s a fantastic service and the prices are extremely reasonable .
Package_Service	you get to pick the courier you wish to deliver the parcel and some can just be taken to local drop_off points so it saves waiting it all day for someone come collect it .
Package_Service	i ' ve also now used the live_chat as i made a mistake with the post code , [_name ] sorted this instantly and new labels were emailed to me within 0 minutes !!!
Package_Service	faultless service with a very polite attitude .

Package_Service	this is the first time i have used anything like this website .

Package_Service	quick , easy and simple to use the website and great delivery service - i would highly_recommend !
Package_Service	great prices and really easy to use - would definitely_recommend .
Package_Service	samantha was an excellent help to me today , she was swift and patient and offered me several options to resolve the problem i had

Package_Service	i use parcel to go on a regular_basis and never have any_problems with them , if there is a problem they always sort it out !

Package_Service	not only did parcel0go . com beat the competition in terms of value , but paul helped_me when i panicked and made sure i had everything i needed .
Package_Service	great service , excellent customer_service .
Package_Service	i ' ve had great service now , for over 00 parcels .
Package_Service	nothing has gone wrong , and now 0 of them have arrived the day after sending .
Package_Service	one even on a saturday .
Package_Service	to get that sort of service i would have had to pay just under £_00 from another courier .
Package_Service	it ' s a nice easy way to send a parcel , especially without the hassle of the long queue at the post_office .
Package_Service	my service didn ' t come on the dates it was due , i decided to get onto the team at parcel0go and spoke to an extremely_helpful member of the team ' ashley ' in about 0 minutes my service was rebooked free of charge quickly and easily .
Package_Service	im extremely happy with this service and ill continue to use over and over , also thank_you ashley , fantastic member of the team .

Package_Service	then to top it all off there isnt a telephone_number to call , just a typing service !
Package_Service	arghh !

Package_Service	superb service and very helpful staff ( samantha )

Package_Service	just wanted to cancel an order as i got muddled up who was taking what .
Package_Service	caught them on shift change over , but was handed very well .
Package_Service	i forget the first girls name , but rose and her colleague sorted my problem and fully answered all my questions .
Package_Service	nice to deal with a uk_based company that actually understands day to day problems and can answer any question in a quick and professional_manner .
Package_Service	being_able to have a chat and not feel pressured makes a pleasant change , keep up the good work !!
Package_Service	!

Package_Service	:-)
Package_Service	had a small problem with the website when booking my parcel but the handy work of the live assitant was amzing and helpful and got my parcel booked in today !!!!!!!!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	thank_you daniel from e . c . c .
Package_Service	superb prices , brilliant customer_service ..
Package_Service	simple , easy website ..
Package_Service	spoken to katie today as i had trouble loging in and she had sorted everything out in no time !
Package_Service	well_done and thank_you parcel0go !
Package_Service	x
Package_Service	am i dreaming ?
Package_Service	or do we still have organisations like parcel0go with great customer_service ?
Package_Service	maybe i was just lucky to have catherine serve me .
Package_Service	very impressed , quick , affordable and very organised .
Package_Service	this websites customer support and live help is the most easiest iv seen online .
Package_Service	things which take forever with other huge organization are done within_seconds via the online_chat .
Package_Service	things like full refunds due to bookings made by mistake , or re bookings of existing collections .
Package_Service	i feel absolute trust with this company , they have always resolved the countless issues that occur in the shipping business we operate in .
Package_Service	will_continue to be my first choice for shipping .
Package_Service	parcel0go are a terrible company to deal with that clearly have no regard for their customers or the service that they provide .
Package_Service	they failed to collect the parcel on the scheduled date , then when i took it to the depot the member of staff that i spoke to said that they were closed and they couldn ' t let me drop_off the parcel despite it already being paid for ...
Package_Service	when i took the parcel back and the depot finally accepted it , i was surprised to find that it didn ' t even show up as having been received at the depot and scanned on the tracking for 0 whole days , which was particularly disappointing given that i had paid for a 00 hour delivery service !
Package_Service	the parcel was eventually delivered to the recipient 0 days_later .
Package_Service	when i complained to parcel0go about their unacceptable performance , i was told that the terms and conditions state that this service was not guaranteed and so they didn ' t care .
Package_Service	i challenged that i was looking at the terms and conditions and that was simply not the case , however the representative simply kept stating that they do not offer a guaranteed service and that this is in their terms and conditions .
Package_Service	after such appalling service , i would never use parcel0go again .
Package_Service	i have previously had similarly poor experience with them deliberately delaying sending forms for an insurance claim in order to prevent a claim being made before the time limit .
Package_Service	with parcel0go , poor customer_service seems to come as standard .
Package_Service	thanks very much for your help paul
Package_Service	i use parcel0go alot , have done for about 0 years now and they have always been wonderful !
Package_Service	lots of choice , discount_codes , fab service and a company you can trust !
Package_Service	most packages arrive on time if not early and safe .
Package_Service	i have found out today that a package has been lost by the courier , parcel0go sorted this in just 00_mins !!!
Package_Service	i used live_chat to ask where the item was and was told it looked like it was misplaced and given a link to a form to fill , i filled and sent this back online instantly and was offered a refund moments later to the value of the goods plus the postage .
Package_Service	very very happy with the fast effective service and will_continue to use !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i was able to take my parcel to a shop near work and drop it off .
Package_Service	the company received it in good time without any hitches or problems .
Package_Service	it was also the cheapest option for me .
Package_Service	would use them again .
Package_Service	today i was making some work enquirers to parcel0go via the web chat .
Package_Service	i was chatting to [_name ]
Package_Service	[_name ] was great and helpful .
Package_Service	i think she may be the one !
Package_Service	i ' m in love with her ....
Package_Service	love you [_name ]!
Package_Service	xx
Package_Service	superb help , couldnt be more helpful with my difficult situation and was pleasent throughout , highly_recommended and would have no_problems in placing my trust for future parcels in sarah_hayes hands as she ' s fantastic and throughly professional .
Package_Service	sarah_hayes has brighten up my day - thanks for all your help and good news

Package_Service	people usually leave reviews when they ' re angry and want to vent .
Package_Service	in my case , i ' m doing none of those .
Package_Service	i ' m just here to share my impression .
Package_Service	i sent a laptop from belfast to a friend in croydon .
Package_Service	packed it up nicely and securely enough to hopefully make the journey in one piece .
Package_Service	selected the store to which i wanted it to be sent and popped_into the nearest centra to send it .
Package_Service	with the £_000 insurance and signature , i paid a few_pence over £_00 .
Package_Service	given that it was a valuable item , i didn ' t mind .
Package_Service	however what i did mind and still do , is the lack of information on the website regarding the time - frame related to shop - to - shop deliveries .
Package_Service	given the high price i was almost certain it would be a 0 day delivery , however there is no way to confirm that .
Package_Service	ergo , not the best on - line experience .
Package_Service	continuing on that thought , the tracking is weird .
Package_Service	things that happen for example at 0 in the morning , showed up in my tracking history after 0 hours ...
Package_Service	anyhow , parcel got there on thursday which makes this a 0 day delivery in the holiday season and from northern_ireland which is actually better_than royal_mail ' s delivery times ( my 0 day deliveries from amazon show up after 0 days ) at this time of the year .
Package_Service	the final note comes from my friend and it is regarding the picking_up process .
Package_Service	it sounds a lot like the service you get from western_union in their shops all around the uk .
Package_Service	they just don ' t seem to like you bothering them with parcels .
Package_Service	to use my friend ' s words " they were borderline rude ".
Package_Service	in any case , laptop is intact , and in working order which makes this delivery a success .
Package_Service	might use collect_+ again , but i am not necessarily impressed .
Package_Service	andrea was very helpfull and explain everthink with no time , thank_you
Package_Service	price is not comptetive .
Package_Service	can do the same service direct from direct companies and insurance cost is cheaper .
Package_Service	£_00 charging for £_000 insurance and when use same service without parcel0go charging only £ 0 , what a cheating .
Package_Service	parcel0go is full bad service .
Package_Service	got the brand_new item in factory sealed box as damaged on same area in different parcel .
Package_Service	both have same type of damage .
Package_Service	parcel0go refuse to give money back for damage .
Package_Service	never use again .
Package_Service	also another parcel delivered wrong person and not willing to say its them mistake ., so total loss is £_000 from me .
Package_Service	dont recomment .
Package_Service	also if they give refund , they want to put in them account .
Package_Service	infact , cant use that money for my purpose as still keeping in parcel0go account .
Package_Service	total stealers .
Package_Service	never use again .
Package_Service	accidentally booked collection on wrong date .
Package_Service	spoke to leanne via live_chat and she sorted out my mistake within minutes .
Package_Service	very good service .
Package_Service	cant comment on anything_else at present as havent had parcel collected or delivered yet but customer_service very good :-)
Package_Service	lauren was so helpful helping me understand how parcel0go work
Package_Service	i would like to say thank_you to daniel who helped_me today very quick and saved my life :)))
Package_Service	we use parcel0go a lot and cant_fault it , first time i ' ve needed to use chat and it was spot on !!
Package_Service	catherine_corless couldn ' t have helped more , was a pleasure :)
Package_Service	thanks alot david .
Package_Service	you are very good and helpful .
Package_Service	well i can ' t knock it at all .
Package_Service	less then 00_hours to arrive brilliant postage_costs and reliable service .
Package_Service	i will be using you again that is for sure .
Package_Service	thanx a lot .
Package_Service	was served by tanya at customer_service today on live help , very very friendly quick and accurate response , answered and dealt_with my query with upmost importance , all_round excellent customer_service , well_done tanya :)
Package_Service	parcel0go are a quick and relaible service who always aim to deliver or collect your goods on time .
Package_Service	placing a collection or delivery is simple but its the directions and location issue that most customers lack to share with the courier through parcel0go as this is vital if you address is in a awkward to find scenario .
Package_Service	all i did was contact live support and give them detailed_information to where i am located as this helped the driver very much as he had never been in local area before and sat_nav are not always relaible .
Package_Service	property was found with ease after leaving instructions with tanya on live help who was excellent from start to finish .
Package_Service	very well_organised and established company , will use again an again for future collections and deliveries .
Package_Service	well_done parcel0go :)
Package_Service	absolutely outstanding customer_service i got !
Package_Service	you are my hero hannah !
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	really pleased with the service in ordering ups delivery to ireland ... worked out cheaper_than checking a bag in !
Package_Service	emma did a great job in clarifying the restricted items and checking through the details with her manager .
Package_Service	only reviewing on customer_service as have not recieved parcel yet .
Package_Service	but sam on their facebook_page was very helpful , and quick to respond .
Package_Service	i found it quite helpful .
Package_Service	and easy to use .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	decided to use parcel0go and what an excellent service .
Package_Service	had a slight problem with the address and the customer_service rep william ... sorted it out double quick .
Package_Service	great service and very good customer care .
Package_Service	keep it up
Package_Service	only company i could find to return six sets of venetian blinds weighing in at 00 . 0kg .
Package_Service	parcel picked_up monday received by recipients on wednesday .
Fashion_Accessories	a couple of days after_placing my order i realised that i ' d measured my finger wrong .
Fashion_Accessories	i used the live_chat_function on their website to give them the correct_size .
Fashion_Accessories	no_fuss whatsoever , the same guy from the live_chat even rang me to confirm he ' d got the details right .
Fashion_Accessories	the quality of the ring is a0 , and the price i thought was very reasonable .
Fashion_Accessories	i really can ' t recommend this company strongly enough and i fully intend to use them again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	from the first phone call i new that we had chosen the right place to buy my engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	nothing was too much_trouble , from changing the ring size at the last_minute to the phone_calls from the team ensuring me that my ring would be with me by our specified date .
Fashion_Accessories	the service and quality of your products is 0nd to none and we will_definately be back !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses i wanted to purchase were extremely cheap and the exact pair / design i was looking for .
Fashion_Accessories	the postage fees were also fair so an overall bargain !
Fashion_Accessories	i expected to receive the items late , as they were making their way all the way from_hong_kong !
Fashion_Accessories	however , i was delightfully surprised when i came home just 0 and a half weeks after i placed the order , to find my new pair of glasses waiting for me .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses were of an exceptional quality and i literally cannot_fault them .
Fashion_Accessories	i cannot_fault the company , their customer_service and general services and i cannot_fault the products they have for sale .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely be making another purchase from them in the near_future .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely satisfied with the communication , the product quality and value for this price .
Fashion_Accessories	the shipment took a bit longer and was not initially indicated when the order was made but received notification from customer support in time .
Fashion_Accessories	in overall i recommend for everyone .
Fashion_Accessories	always has good service .
Fashion_Accessories	use chemical and juno for my 00 ' s
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely excellent website .
Fashion_Accessories	receive most orders next_day and they have great sales as well .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent returns service also the quibble , replacement item sent out straight_away .
Fashion_Accessories	not only is the website excellent , but the pricing of items is very very competitive across the web .
Fashion_Accessories	normally i would not go for the cheapest place i can find an item online , but purekit ( webtogs ) are such a strong brand i do not think i could shop elsewhere in the future without checking their site first .
Fashion_Accessories	in the event , the rab jacket i ordered was too small , but the returns process was very efficient and very simple .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately , due to the christmas_rush , they were sold out of the next size up and instead of a refund or alternative item , they went straight to rab and sourced a single jacket for me - tremendous service !
Fashion_Accessories	bought the latest ipad & iphone cases for my wife , got them on " free economy delivery " which said they ' d be there in 0 days - was expecting them on friday but they arrived tuesday
Fashion_Accessories	happy happy happy
Fashion_Accessories	very good shop .
Fashion_Accessories	don ' t be left in the dark .
Fashion_Accessories	check out red_hot sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	from now , the only place i ' ll shop for shades is with these chaps .
Fashion_Accessories	i only wear ray_bans .
Fashion_Accessories	red_hot have absolutely hods of them to choose from .
Fashion_Accessories	proper prices too .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery and all_round service was tip - top .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m walking on sunshine .
Fashion_Accessories	this is a prime example of a business for the customers .
Fashion_Accessories	theres a zero hassel returns_policy and customer_service is great !
Fashion_Accessories	prices are also much_better_than other_sites .
Fashion_Accessories	web togs serves their customers more_than any other company i know - i hope more companies can be like this .
Fashion_Accessories	:)
Fashion_Accessories	my fiancee and i went to diamond_heaven to purchase her engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	having chosen our design in the store , we waited three_weeks for the ring to be ready for collection .
Fashion_Accessories	upon collecting the ring , we discovered that the ring was without_doubt the wrong_size when my fiancee tried it on once i had taken it home .
Fashion_Accessories	it was clear that a mistake had occurred , given that the ring was far too large for my fiancee ' s finger , which had been sized at a j just three_weeks earlier .
Fashion_Accessories	the following_day i contacted diamond_heaven by phone to politely explain the mistake and see what could be done .
Fashion_Accessories	the member of staff that spoke to me immediately took on a dismissive and patronising tone , insisting that there was no possible way that the ring might be the wrong_size , and that it was impossible that there may have been a mistake .
Fashion_Accessories	instead , in a condescending manner , she explained that the ring may be loose because may fiancee may have lost weight since it was ordered just three_weeks before .
Fashion_Accessories	given that we are both medical doctors , we can categorically state that such a degree of weight_loss to one ' s finger thickness over such a short_period of time is an impossibility .
Fashion_Accessories	no apology was offered , and everything seemed too much_trouble .
Fashion_Accessories	no offer was made to help rectify this clear mistake , despite the fact that we had recently spent the best part of £ 0 , 000 on an item which was the wrong_size .
Fashion_Accessories	instead , i was told that we could ferry the ring back once again , where we could then pay for the privilege of having it resized .
Fashion_Accessories	i was truly appalled at this service .
Fashion_Accessories	rightfully annoyed and frustrated , my fiancee called back a few hours_later .
Fashion_Accessories	she spoke to [_name ], and explained what had happened .
Fashion_Accessories	[_name ] apologised on behalf of his colleague , and advised that she could bring the ring in on any weekday morning to have the ring altered free of charge .
Fashion_Accessories	the following week , she took the ring back .
Fashion_Accessories	it was sized as an m , rather_than the j that we were expecting , proving that the mistake had occurred , which i had been told was not possible .
Fashion_Accessories	even now , no apology was offered for the mistake , or for the poor attitude of the employee with whom i had initially spoken to about this .
Fashion_Accessories	after the resizing procedure , my fiancee brought the ring home , only to discover that the stone had come loose .
Fashion_Accessories	yet another problem .
Fashion_Accessories	we then had to arrange , at great inconvenience and worry , for the ring to be sent back yet again by special delivery to be fixed once more .
Fashion_Accessories	overall , this saga had taken over five weeks from when we first ordered the ring in store .
Fashion_Accessories	it had been unpleasant , and ruined what would have been one of the most special parts of our engagement .
Fashion_Accessories	one would expect a much higher level of customer_service when purchasing such an expensive and special item .
Fashion_Accessories	mistakes can happen , but the attitude and aversion to apology with which we were met was appalling .
Fashion_Accessories	we had initially planned to purchase our_wedding_rings from diamond_heaven too , but following this experience , we shall certainly be taking our custom elsewhere .
Fashion_Accessories	i would strongly_recommend that everybody else do the same .
Fashion_Accessories	great company to deal with , been buying shades of them for years .
Fashion_Accessories	picked a pair up in person once and they were great guys ... big phil is an_absolute angel behind those rugged good looks .
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend this company .
Fashion_Accessories	they are very informative and polite .
Fashion_Accessories	i will be using these_guys again when i need to renew my specs !
Fashion_Accessories	great customer_service , shoes arrived in a excellent conditions , good packaging , and thanks alot for a free silk tie !!!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	divine_trash is a lush shop that sells fantastic clothes at very reasonable prices .
Fashion_Accessories	you can buy outfits for every occasion .
Fashion_Accessories	they also have fab jewellry , shoes and make up too .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery service is quick and reliable .
Fashion_Accessories	the staff are wonderful and help you and give you great advice .
Fashion_Accessories	if you come to buxton make_sure you visit this lovely shop :-)
Fashion_Accessories	service was spot on , fast , effective , easy to use and just what i wanted after a hard day at work .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer is great and such good value for money , the quality os second to none also i love the way that when you buy a ring they sort of adopt you and clean your jewelery free ( even if it wasn ' t purchased from them !)
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recomended !
Fashion_Accessories	!

Fashion_Accessories	i had a custom engagement_ring made and it was brilliant .
Fashion_Accessories	they talked me through the entire_process , helped_me navigate the different qualities of diamonds while never being pushy or trying to up my limit .
Fashion_Accessories	and they paid close attention to my design brief and interpreted my less_than brilliant drawings superbly .
Fashion_Accessories	my wife adores the ring and knows there is no other one like it .
Fashion_Accessories	i have recommended this company to friends and family and would urge_anyone_else to give them a try .
Fashion_Accessories	i love this site , it offers cool clothes for such unbelievably low_prices .
Fashion_Accessories	definitely not a scam , lots of payment opinions including american_express and paypal so nothing to worry_about .
Fashion_Accessories	their elite club system is amazing , offering huge discounts to loyal_customers and a chance to feel special with your gold elite club membership .
Fashion_Accessories	one of the best cheap , high_quality and fashionable clothes sites i have ever come_across , super dry is just sh_* t in comparison .
Fashion_Accessories	had a problem with my glasses and when i contacted customer_services they were less_than helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	i wouldnt recommend them to anyone i know .
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs is such an easy site to use with so many different good quality products and the info to back the product up especially if your looking for particular qualities , would definitely_recommend it !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent and speedy_delivery , even faster with communication .
Fashion_Accessories	i needed a refund for an item and got it within days !
Fashion_Accessories	awesome products too !
Fashion_Accessories	top_class .
Fashion_Accessories	would use again .
Fashion_Accessories	my first experience buying specs online and at first i was unsure as the high_street opticians painted a negative view ( though to be expected i suppose ).
Fashion_Accessories	i bought some prescription ray_ban sunglasses and i ' m delighted with them .
Fashion_Accessories	i think i ' ve saved about £_000 from the high_street and they fit_perfectly .
Fashion_Accessories	i just sent my old sunglasses in to get an accurate pd reading and the ordering_process was very easy and straightforward .
Fashion_Accessories	i had to wait a couple of weeks for them to arrive but i could keep an aeye on their progress through the website .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived the day after i was advised of despatch .
Fashion_Accessories	recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	received product sooner_than_expected , exactly as i expected it and with good customer_service !
Fashion_Accessories	company seem to cancel orders on a whim .
Fashion_Accessories	i have only ever done 0 other review of a website because on the whole you dont generally receive a service from most websites that warrants any merit .
Fashion_Accessories	however i cannot_fault the service i have received from country_attire .
Fashion_Accessories	i have made 0 orders with them in the last_week , one of which i needed to change the postage for .
Fashion_Accessories	customer_service were more_than helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	they email you back instantly and nothing is too much_trouble .
Fashion_Accessories	the products are excellent , very reasonably_priced and fast delivery !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent !!!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i couldnt be_happier with the glasses i received .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect fit perfect perscription and speedy_delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	definatly going to use again and referred all my friends
Fashion_Accessories	my niece was over the moon , fantastic good value purchase with speedy_delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely buy again .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought my engagement_ring from diamondgeezer after being recommended from a work colleague .
Fashion_Accessories	i was totally happy with the complete service and especially the price .
Fashion_Accessories	my good lady loved the ring and said ' yes ' so all is good .
Fashion_Accessories	i have since recommended the site to my future best man and he has bought an engagement_ring from the site and is asking his girl this week in st lucia if she ' ll marry him - so fingers_crossed .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a ring for my anniversary while i was deployed to iraq , they helped_me everystep of the way and had a more personable and helpful staff than any place i ' ve ever_dealt_with before .
Fashion_Accessories	i highly_recommend them to anyone who is buying anything diamond related !
Fashion_Accessories	i have ordered from here several_times now and yes have had a few bumps along the way , mainly in accordance with delivery timing issues but that is to be expected of a company that offers such a large region of service .
Fashion_Accessories	the items i have received are exactly as_described , fitting and incredibly beautiful , the prices are pretty reasonable to .
Fashion_Accessories	will shop here til the day i die :)
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve had at_least 0 pairs of specs from selectspecs , every pair has been perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	the budget range is brilliant , and most pairs i ' ve had i ' ve worn everyday for a year plus .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered an epiphone electric acoustic_guitar package off the website and i was ( and still am ) thoroughly_impressed with the quality of the package , the speed of delivery service and the ease of transaction .
Fashion_Accessories	the guitar arrived in tune with no faults as well as the rest of the package ( amp , spare strings , tuner etc ...) and arrived next working day .
Fashion_Accessories	i would happily use giggear again and recommend to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	(",)
Fashion_Accessories	comfiest pants ive ever worn and i love that they come in so many designs !
Fashion_Accessories	cant_wait to see what designs are next .
Fashion_Accessories	for the past few_months i ' ve been hunting for the perfect engagement_ring for my girlfriend .
Fashion_Accessories	( not asked yet !!)
Fashion_Accessories	i had a budget of 0k and spent countless hours wandering the high_street jewellers trying to decide the best spec .
Fashion_Accessories	finding a balance between size , quality , colour , cut , polish and symmetry was a nightmare .
Fashion_Accessories	i found whilst the high_street guys were helpful they seemed to push the sale of rings i didn ’ t feel had the right balance .
Fashion_Accessories	it seemed to me that the high_street jewellers had very limited diamond selection and it was a hassle trying to pull together quotes for various different specs .
Fashion_Accessories	frustrated i decided to look online .
Fashion_Accessories	being a guy who_likes to research every purchase to death i checked out all of the online jewellers i could find .
Fashion_Accessories	i like how on most sites i could enter different diamond specs and generate a price .
Fashion_Accessories	by doing this eventually settled on a diamond spec and knew the look of the ring i was after .
Fashion_Accessories	i entered the diamond values into the top online providers and dg came out cheapest .
Fashion_Accessories	even if they hadn ’ t been the cheapest i would have gone with them anyway as they had a ring type that i thought suited my girlfriend perfectly .
Fashion_Accessories	without a word of exaggeration i saved over £ 0000 buying from dg compared to buying the same spec on the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	i took a deep breath and decided to purchase ... but before i did i wanted to email them and ask a few questions .
Fashion_Accessories	not because i had any but as a test .
Fashion_Accessories	they answered straight_away and demonstrated a great knowledge of their products .
Fashion_Accessories	impressed and after 00 emails in 0 days i ended_up changing my diamond spec slightly which ended_up cheaper .
Fashion_Accessories	rather_than up sell to something that wasn ’ t right for me they gave constructive information and helped_me reach my decision .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring arrived two_weeks_later on the exact day they said it would .
Fashion_Accessories	it is fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	i received an update email nearly every day of the two week wait .
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant service and price - can ’ t recommend them enough .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a pair of merrel winter boots for my wife in the sale in june thinking they would make a good christmas_present .
Fashion_Accessories	however , when she tried them on she didn ' t like them .
Fashion_Accessories	it was only then that i looked at the receipt and realised they had a 000 day return_policy .
Fashion_Accessories	we sent them back ( at minimal cost as they take care of most of the postage_costs as well ) then i got a phone call from webtogs to say they had received my boots and asked whether i wanted an exchange or refund .
Fashion_Accessories	the refund was then processed the next_day - amazing !
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t fault !
Fashion_Accessories	one of the few places i found with the sunglasses i wanted , good prices and even found a promo_code for extra discount .
Fashion_Accessories	very fast free delivery :)
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve been using chemical for years and according to my old orders i ' ve spent over £_0k at their store !
Fashion_Accessories	you always get your order on time and i ' ve found that if you spend enough , they bump your delivery up to the next level ( ie : i ' ve purchased first_class and they ' ve sent it via next_day courier ).
Fashion_Accessories	the few_times i ' ve spoken to them on the phone ( sometimes i ' ll add a ' friday shipping monday delivery ' item to my order then realise that i want the rest of the order this week ) they ' ve always been polite and helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	my only_gripe is that the site can be difficult to navigate , however , chemical have obviously noticed this as they have recently made changes , although it ' s still not perfect , i do believe they will_continue to work on this .
Fashion_Accessories	every communication was clear and made the purchase special .
Fashion_Accessories	questions were answered_quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	call_backs were very timely without delay .
Fashion_Accessories	i felt involved in the whole_process of ring manufacture .
Fashion_Accessories	ring delivery was fast secure and discreet as requested .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely no_complaints and would recommend the company very highly .
Fashion_Accessories	they delivered my order faster_than_expected , and i had no issues with them , not to mention they were the cheapest online by £_00 .. ill happily buy all my future sunglasses with them ..
Fashion_Accessories	i cannot recommend crown_brush highly_enough , the item arrived the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	the brushes are of a very high_quality , and the all eyes on you set is amazing ,
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s the only eye brushes i need to use on a day to day basis , they wash well , and are lovely to use , i wear make up on a daily_basis and my brushes get a lot of use , and these stand up really well to heavy use !!!
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t wait to place my next order
Fashion_Accessories	i was a bit_nervous_about buying from this website , after_reading all the negative_reviews .
Fashion_Accessories	however , i received my order this morning , and i have no_complaints .
Fashion_Accessories	everything is pretty_much how i expected , and the delivery was amazingly fast - it came sooner_than my order from h_& m , which i placed two days earlier !
Fashion_Accessories	they also shipped a couple of days earlier_than they said they would , which was a nice surprise .
Fashion_Accessories	however , i think you have to be_careful shopping on this site .
Fashion_Accessories	here are a few essential tips :
Fashion_Accessories	- use the ' ready to ship ' tab ( available on the left - hand side of the page ).
Fashion_Accessories	this means that you won ' t be looking at clothes that would take weeks to deliver , and it saves you so much time .
Fashion_Accessories	- when you find an item , carefully check whether the colour you want is in stock , and ready to ship .
Fashion_Accessories	i only selected items that were ready to ship within 0 - 0 days .
Fashion_Accessories	' out of print ' means that you won ' t be getting that item , so don ' t select it .
Fashion_Accessories	- look carefully at the pictures .
Fashion_Accessories	a lot of people seem to have thought they were buying another piece of clothing , from the way the models were dressed .
Fashion_Accessories	at the bottom of the page they sometimes have a photo of the garment on its own , which can be helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	it also shows you the thickness / weight / length of the item more clearly .
Fashion_Accessories	- don ' t expect amazing quality .
Fashion_Accessories	i only bought items under £_00 , so i wasn ' t expecting them to be very well - made .
Fashion_Accessories	however , i was pleasantly_surprised by almost all the items .
Fashion_Accessories	i didn ' t buy any handbags / shoes / jewellery because i thought there was a higher chance of these things being broken / poorly made .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d rather try on a pair of shoes in my local shop and pay a bit more for them than order a pair i was unsure_about the fit / quality of .
Fashion_Accessories	- double - check the measurement .
Fashion_Accessories	everything i bought was ' one size '.
Fashion_Accessories	luckily , i seem to be that size - and everything i bought was fairly elasticated anyway - but the site doesn ' t seem to cater well for sizes abover 00 .
Fashion_Accessories	- be prepared for a worrying ' you order is on hold ' email while they authenticate your credit / debit_card .
Fashion_Accessories	i got really nervous when they sent this to me , but they soon sorted it out and my order shipped the day after .
Fashion_Accessories	i hope that ' s been helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	in all , i loved shopping with this company - the website is gorgeous and the range is amazing .
Fashion_Accessories	i had no_problems with delivery or quality .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll definitely be back !
Fashion_Accessories	great service and communication , super_fast postage & products are gorgeous !
Fashion_Accessories	ordered some sunglasses after finding a great deal on groupon ( props to that guys ) on a sunday_night .
Fashion_Accessories	the order processing took a little longer_than_expected which is fair as the deal must be very popular .
Fashion_Accessories	my main problem with my order was that in ups .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	they delivered my order to an entirely random address where i don ' t live .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	they promised to collect the mis_- routed parcel and delivery to the correct address on the same day ... and didn ' t .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	they finally delivered my parcel , but to a neighbour without leaving a card at my address !
Fashion_Accessories	and this was all in the middle of the queen ' s jubilee weekend so my sunglasses will have been floating around some ups van / picking centre for almost a week .
Fashion_Accessories	not good ... but hey , that ' s not sunglasses_shop ' s fault .
Fashion_Accessories	also , the instant message chat help service isn ' t working too well .
Fashion_Accessories	i was passed around 0 separate operators and ended_up giving up and calling to get help when tracking incorrectly delivered order .
Fashion_Accessories	wish the delivery was free , would make me not think_twice about buying things , also annoying hasving 0 different prices , just show it with vat , we all have to pay it , so dont really care what price is without
Fashion_Accessories	easily the best underwear i ' ve ever had , love the designs and love how comfy they are .
Fashion_Accessories	love that they come in a cool little tin as well i bought some to give as presents at xmas were great gifts
Fashion_Accessories	simply the best .
Fashion_Accessories	i love chemical uk .
Fashion_Accessories	placed an order on tuesday , 00th_july_0000 .
Fashion_Accessories	i have contacted many_times , be told the glasses ship from_hong_kong , and they gave me the reason is " there is very good a chance that they have been delayed in the postal system and you should receive the presently ."
Fashion_Accessories	asked me wait 0 weeks for the respond .....
Fashion_Accessories	thanks for the brilliant costume , i will be using this website again :-)
Fashion_Accessories	from the customer_service to the design and to the ring quality the overall sevice from diamondgezzer was fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	everyone i spoke with were really helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	the design was exactly how i wanted it to be .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recomend them to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you to every who works at diamondgezzer
Fashion_Accessories	product was well described and dispatched quickly - very pleased with my purchase and will buy again from end clothing .
Fashion_Accessories	fed_ex deliver but this was the third time they have got my address wrong .
Fashion_Accessories	however , after me having to call fed_ex to explain the guy had yet again gone to the wrong flat he did come back in the afternoon , this time to the correct address !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks end clothing .
Fashion_Accessories	the funky designs attracted me to waxx .
Fashion_Accessories	but when they arrived the quality and feel was better_than what i expected .
Fashion_Accessories	i can say hands_down they are my favourites over calvins etc that i also own .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended
Fashion_Accessories	product as_described delivery quickly and efficiently
Fashion_Accessories	i have bought from red_hot twice and both_times my orders were delivered super speedily and correctly .
Fashion_Accessories	they are good value and have tonnes of choice !
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with my miu miu s and ray_bans !
Fashion_Accessories	first_class service and love the glasses
Fashion_Accessories	over the years i have bought a number of items from webtogs .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately a couple of times i have had faulty items ( no fault of webtogs ).
Fashion_Accessories	each time , the customer_service had been exceptional .
Fashion_Accessories	i could not wish for better customers care .
Fashion_Accessories	they were friendly , very helpful and prompt with their responses .
Fashion_Accessories	top company , and i would go out of my way to use them again .
Fashion_Accessories	the only_downside is their range of products can sometimes be a little limited .
Fashion_Accessories	but if they have the item you are after in stock , then don ' t hesitate to use them !
Fashion_Accessories	if i had the money , i would buy stuff everyday from crownbrush !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	excellent prices on supras , speedy_delivery , happy with the service !
Fashion_Accessories	these_guys made me feel_like one of the family !
Fashion_Accessories	i , ( like a vast number of blokes i imagine ) had little interest in jewelry , but began the laborious task of trying to find the perfect engagement_ring , trawling round anonymous high_street jewelers staffed with the identikit orange faced commission hungry girls .
Fashion_Accessories	bored and disheartened i turned to the internet , found there to be an equally bewildering number of options littered with terminology i didn ' t really understand .
Fashion_Accessories	clive at diamondgeezer was patient enough to explain everything to me , communication was great , the final piece arrived a day early and looked better_than i could have imagined .
Fashion_Accessories	i simply cant recommend the team at diamondgeezer highly_enough .
Fashion_Accessories	don ' t be put off by the grizzly name , the service and product are 0nd to none .
Fashion_Accessories	i received my glasses and couldn ' t see through them !
Fashion_Accessories	i ended_up going to another company and paying over £_000 for a decent pair !
Fashion_Accessories	after purchasing a dress from this site , the dress arrived the very next_day , and i ' m from the u . s !
Fashion_Accessories	also , the packaging is beyond stunning , you ' re going to want to keep everything from the bow to the box , they ' re that beautiful .
Fashion_Accessories	the dress arrived carefully_packaged and i was immediately contacted by a customer_services rep to be sure i was happy with my purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	lovely place to do business with !
Fashion_Accessories	this is the first time i ' ve ever purchased designer sunglasses online so it was a bit of a big deal and i needed a trusted website .
Fashion_Accessories	after googling ' designer sunglasses ' i came_across this site .
Fashion_Accessories	the reviews seemed good and they had the ray - bans i was looking for .
Fashion_Accessories	the price of the glasses themselves wasn ' t the cheapest i came_across but postage was less_than what other_sites were charging .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m_glad i chose this site a my gorgeous new sunglasses arrived within a couple of days in perfect_condition - thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	cant_fault these_guys at all - where else can you get a pair of prescription_glasses for £ 0 ?!?
Fashion_Accessories	they are a great backup pair , i then went and bought a pair of bench glasses for about half the price of what it was in the opticians !
Fashion_Accessories	they even answered my questions via_twitter , which was awesome .
Fashion_Accessories	the only annoying this was having to get hold of my pupilary distance - my optician refused to give it to me so i had to get the mrs to measure it with a ruler .. a bit worrying but it turned_out ok , as i can see through my new specs !
Fashion_Accessories	nice product , very quick delivery , reasonable_price .
Fashion_Accessories	you have to love jules_b and their service is second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	har inget att klaga på , allt är skött exemplariskt !
Fashion_Accessories	snabb frakt , bra paketerat och riktigt bra priser !
Fashion_Accessories	kommer handla här flera gånger igen :) tack !
Fashion_Accessories	placed an order for a north_face backpack earlier today - opted for the free delivery so was initially informed order would arrive before 00th_june , but i ' ve already had confirmation of its dispatch - so it should now arrive in time for my boyfriend ' s birthday - with no delivery charges !
Fashion_Accessories	and it was the cheapest price online i could find for the same bag .
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks , webtogs .
Fashion_Accessories	after writing a negative_review .
Fashion_Accessories	i received a phone call from a very helpful man .
Fashion_Accessories	offered full_refund or better quality kilt .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with the service i have received
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you very much
Fashion_Accessories	received my kilt this morning it ' s fantastic brilliant quality and super_fast delivery thanks again for all your help xx
Fashion_Accessories	have bought records from chemical countless_times .
Fashion_Accessories	have always been very happy with the service .
Fashion_Accessories	since i bought my first record they have always good taken good care of me and on the very very few occasions there were mistakes they were dealt_with swiftly and professionaly - my number 0 stop for drum n bass vinyl !
Fashion_Accessories	big ups chemical crew
Fashion_Accessories	cheap prices and a quick delivery time would make me buy here again !
Fashion_Accessories	i needed a new pair of sunglasses for when i go mountain biking , so i searched on google and straight_away sunglassesshop . com stood out as they were offering 00_%_off , the website itself is laid_out very efficiently and organised which just makes the job of finding yourself a new pair o shades that bit easier , once i came_across the pair i liked i confirmed my purchase with the use of their style guide , im sure everyone has had problems with finding the right sunglasses in the past that suit them , well the style guide serves that purpose , too bypass all the unnecessary trying on glasses and give you an honest opinion on what will suit your shape of head .
Fashion_Accessories	once i received my glasses they were packed very carefully with thought in a nice sturdy box , inside were my glasses in a protective case and my receipt carefully laid in the bottom , i could not ask for more and my sunglasses are the best thing ive bought this year .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you sunglassesshop . com for a great 0st time experience as your customer i will be sure to buy my next pair of shades in exactly the same way .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with my recent_purchase from waxx .
Fashion_Accessories	great quality and would definitely purchase from you again .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks very much .
Fashion_Accessories	very good service .
Fashion_Accessories	even_tho i had order the wrong_size you was happy to change it .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you
Fashion_Accessories	the service i received from diamond_geezer was superb .
Fashion_Accessories	they helped_me choose the right product without being at all pushy .
Fashion_Accessories	the price was fantastic and they kept me up to date with the progress of my order every_step of the way .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely be using them again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	i spoke to luke from diamond_geezer on the phone and he was the only person who understood exactly_what i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	the next_day he sent me an image of the ring i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	i then made a few tweaks to my personal choice and placed an order - much cheaper then the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	luke kept me updated_throughout the whole_process .
Fashion_Accessories	when the ring arrived and was presented to my finacee , she was blown_away .
Fashion_Accessories	we had to send the ring back for resizing which took less_than 0 days and we also had a slight problem with one of the stones and sent it back for inspection .
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer were great and gave it a full inspection and clean within 0 days again .
Fashion_Accessories	everytime i ring them i am impressed with their customer_service - its not often these days .
Fashion_Accessories	the valuation came to almost_double what i paid .
Fashion_Accessories	i am definatley buying my wedding_rings from here and any future stones .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks
Fashion_Accessories	having been recommended diamond_geezer by a friend i could not have been more pleased .
Fashion_Accessories	i was able to discuss the style of ring and diamonds , and select the perfect stone for me and my budget .
Fashion_Accessories	in comparison with a well_known high_street jeweller my d flawless diamond would have been over five thousand_pounds more if purchased through them .
Fashion_Accessories	my fiance absolutely loves it and we will_definately be going back for our_wedding_bands .
Fashion_Accessories	really impressed with the service from pure luxuries .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a messenger bag for my brother and it was perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	the delivery super_quick even at christmas and the system they use for delivery is really neat ; you get a text telling you the likely arrival time and can track the driver through their web app .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely_recommend pure luxuries !
Fashion_Accessories	hi , i received the outfit reasonably quickly but when it arrived i noticed the dress had a hole on the seam .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided to not send the outfit back for an exchange as i was unsure if i would receive the replacement in time for when i needed it .
Fashion_Accessories	i do not fault the service and delivery but disappointing that the outfit was faulty when it arrived .
Fashion_Accessories	lynsey thomas
Fashion_Accessories	the service and delivery from this company perfectly reflects the high_quality product they are selling .
Fashion_Accessories	in a panic i bought a last_minute travel wallet for my partners xmas_present .... 00_hours_later it was sat on my desk !
Fashion_Accessories	you get an_email when it is packed and then again when it is with the courier so you have every idea exactly where your item is at all stages of its journey which is great .
Fashion_Accessories	i wouldn ' t hesitate to buy from them again and again and again .
Fashion_Accessories	:)
Fashion_Accessories	well this shop is fab got a good mix of the old tunes that you wont and the new tunes and a great service top price ' s as to boot a one stop_shop fo all your dj need ' s
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t fault the service and quality of products !!
Fashion_Accessories	get all my shades from here !
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s nice to have nothing to worry_about when you are buying your sunglasses , especially given how stressful sorting your holidays out are !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	divine_trash is my all time favourite clothes shop !
Fashion_Accessories	everytime i visit the staff are always very welcoming and friendly .
Fashion_Accessories	i always find something to buy that i like , and the staff are always there to give you choices about what to wear it with if your unsure .
Fashion_Accessories	this is the shop i always reccomend to my friends !
Fashion_Accessories	great company !
Fashion_Accessories	buying from diamond_heaven was a great .
Fashion_Accessories	found the customer_service friendly and helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	all my questions were answered swiftly and i now have the perfect ring .
Fashion_Accessories	look_forward to buying again !
Fashion_Accessories	good quality service , fast postage and item exactly as_described .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks :)
Fashion_Accessories	i used diamondgeezer to purchase my first ( and hopefully only ) engagement_ring , the whole experience was brilliant and i was made to feel very valued and special throughout the process .
Fashion_Accessories	the order tracking which shows you how far your order has progressed was very useful .
Fashion_Accessories	sadly the first ring they had cast had bubbles in it and had to be recast so my proposal date went back another week , disappointing i know but these things_happen .
Fashion_Accessories	i was very pleased when the ring arrived and even more so when i had the valuation .
Fashion_Accessories	i am very much of the mindset that the items of jewellery i have purchased from diamongeezer will stay within our new family and the valuation has proved that investing in a good quality diamond and platinum setting will show its true value for years to come .
Fashion_Accessories	the engagement_ring and wedding_bands i have purchased all cost approximately 00 - 00_% less_than what i priced from the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	i was contacted shortly_after my emailed enquiry by clive who talked me through the several options available at my budget and was delighted with the whole service from enquiry to delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring i had pictured in my mind was close to the designs on the website but not exact .
Fashion_Accessories	diamondgeezer were happy to design an_alternative and send me pictures of what it would look like - a very useful service .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring is amazing and naturally she was delighted with it .... and said yes !
Fashion_Accessories	i also used diamondgeezer to purchase an_eternity some 0yrs later and was very pleased that the level of service hadn ' t slipped .
Fashion_Accessories	thoroughly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	trendsales er fabulous !
Fashion_Accessories	kææææmpe udvalg , søde brugere - fantastisk support fra ts side , nemt , hurtigt og sikkert handelssystem .
Fashion_Accessories	i have recently_purchased a few eye shadow and blending brushes from crownbrush . co . uk and they are great , ive_seen mixed_reviews on theses brushes but for me they are great , really soft and for the price i really cant_complain and i will_defiantly be purchasing a few more .
Fashion_Accessories	also the service is great delivery came within 0 days .
Fashion_Accessories	the only con i would say is they need to update the delivery section on there site , so it is more accurate !
Fashion_Accessories	great service , item as_described , item arrived ingood time for my daughter to stand out from the crowd on her school space themed day , a very happy child , thanx guys x
Fashion_Accessories	the ring was made to the timeline given at the very start and the ring itself is a true work of art !
Fashion_Accessories	i saw that someone commented on the valuation ( from a third - party ) not arriving - the valuation on the ring i bought took two months to come in but the independent assessor valued it as higher_than the price i paid !
Fashion_Accessories	:)
Fashion_Accessories	bought engagement_ring for my girlfriend from here after doing a little research into stones ( clarity , colour , etc ..), realising that the prices on the high_street were outrageous .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d be able to get a diamond half the size , riddled with marks or inclusions and near the yellow end of the colour scale for what i paid on here .
Fashion_Accessories	service was great , you get an_email at each_stage of the ring ' s & diamond ' s progress .
Fashion_Accessories	would highly_recommend , just need to get it valued now to see how much more ( hopefully ) it ' s worth over the price i paid .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks .
Fashion_Accessories	i visit chemicaluk every so often to look at the latest clothing as it ' s one of few places in the uk which fully promote street / skate wear brands .
Fashion_Accessories	i used to buy from the store quite regularly however i feel the emphasis has gone more towards typical high_street brands and styles rather_than sticking to it ' s original roots of streetwear and the pricing of new products when you include tax is at top end of the rrp .
Fashion_Accessories	the website has also now started to sell designer fashion wear which are at the top end price bracket rather_than promote the smaller low key streetwear brands which offer good value and something unique , i guess the unique element has gone_missing somewhere and it feels no different to any other menswear site online , which is not exactly a bad thing but is the reason_why i don ' t really shop at this store anymore .
Fashion_Accessories	the delivery is usually fast and efficient , easy check out service , great range of the latest music software etc , overall 0 out of 0 for the reasons stated above .
Fashion_Accessories	i was sceptical about ordering glasses online , but i found the site easy to navigate , input my description and choose the frame , glass , protection , persciption very quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	the worse part of ordering online is communication and customer_service , but fashioneyewear emailed with any delays , where abouts my order was coming from and emailed when it had been dispatched with a tracking_number .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend the site to friends .
Fashion_Accessories	i also found the quote inline with internet prices .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve purchased a few things from pediwear lately including loake 0000s , an ashwood leather briefcase , leather wallet and a luxury valet box .
Fashion_Accessories	each item has been sent out straight_away and with good communication .
Fashion_Accessories	the site is easy to use and there are some great brands on there including crockett and jones which i was pleasantly_surprised about .
Fashion_Accessories	i will likely buy all my shoes from them now .
Fashion_Accessories	only one piece of constructive criticism would be to update the product pictures .
Fashion_Accessories	gteat products .
Fashion_Accessories	great price ( especially in the sale ).
Fashion_Accessories	free delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	no_complaints .
Fashion_Accessories	well_chuffed .
Fashion_Accessories	amazing selection to choose from , been trying to find undies for ladies with big funky waistbands like this for ages , fast delivery , really comfy , epic website .
Fashion_Accessories	once all my xmas shopping is done i will_deffo be placing a large order with these_guys for myself !
Fashion_Accessories	oh , and i rather enjoy chatting to them on twitter ;) @ carlicirca0000
Fashion_Accessories	keep up the amazing work guys !
Fashion_Accessories	really pleased with my order and delivery was very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	best price i could find and i knew i was ordering from a reputable company .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered late on the 0th and it has yet to ship , of course payment was taken straight_away .
Fashion_Accessories	i was wary before ordering so i ordered £_00 ( 0 items / phone stuff ) so i ain ' t overly upset if it doesn ' t come .
Fashion_Accessories	i emailed them 0 days ago , took them today to answer .
Fashion_Accessories	they sounded polite , apparently it ' s because of the holiday so there ' s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there ' s no mention on the site ).
Fashion_Accessories	i shall see what happens from here .
Fashion_Accessories	update
Fashion_Accessories	i received my order a few_days ago and everything is as it was described on the site and came well_packaged .
Fashion_Accessories	however i ' m still annoyed from before .
Fashion_Accessories	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
Fashion_Accessories	whether they have delayed site updates or what i don ' t know why but whoever i emailed should have known my order was already shipped and never confirmed to me when it was shipped after i asked them to .
Fashion_Accessories	the site itself is not bad , they need better customer_service and to stop lying to customers about 00hour shipping that doesn ' t exist .
Fashion_Accessories	i had no_idea what i was doing with the engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	the advice i received was spot on , my fiance loves the ring and i could not have been happier with the service .
Fashion_Accessories	i went for a palladium ring , i have since had the valuation and it seems i got an excellent deal !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	save_yourself the hassle and hard sell at the shops and buy from these_guys .
Fashion_Accessories	i went into sunglass hut in town and tried on some sunglasses , turns_out the ones i loved were a pair of chanel avaitors costing £_000 .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided to go home and search the internet for a better price .
Fashion_Accessories	i found a trusted company who sold them for £_000 and decided to order them , however they were out of stock and would take 0 weeks for delivery , so i contiuned my search , i came_across sunglasses_shop who were selling them for £_000 but i noticed the did a price_match service .
Fashion_Accessories	i called them and spoke to chloe in customer_services who asked me to send details and they would confirm if they were able to match the price .
Fashion_Accessories	i called them back and they confirmed they could do them at the same price as the other company at £_000 with free delievery .
Fashion_Accessories	chloe checked the stock for me and said there was only one pair left ... determined to get this pair i asked her to put the order through asap after a few emails the order was in and payment was made .
Fashion_Accessories	this was on monday_afternoon and i was advised i would receive them on wednesday .
Fashion_Accessories	to my supprise tuesday_morning ups turned_up with my glasses !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	everything was perfect !
Fashion_Accessories	i dont normally_write_reviews but the level of customer_service i recieved was outstanding and chloe was really helpfull making_sure i got these glasses !
Fashion_Accessories	the delievery was extreamly quick !
Fashion_Accessories	i cant rate this company high enough .
Fashion_Accessories	if your reading this and deciding if you should buy from them , then i hope ive helped you make your desicion !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks again chloe , i will_definitely buy from sunglassesshop . co . uk again !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	as ever i forgot my girlfriend ' s bday , until a couple of days before the date .
Fashion_Accessories	in a panic i recalled she mentioned a pair of sunglasses she was after .
Fashion_Accessories	i went online and found this company .
Fashion_Accessories	luckily they had the pair she wanted , they came in mint_condition and more_importantly before her bday .
Fashion_Accessories	saved me a load of trouble
Fashion_Accessories	cheers
Fashion_Accessories	joe
Fashion_Accessories	i order 0 pair of glasses , its now 00 days and no glasses to be seen .
Fashion_Accessories	one pair shipped and the other held because its discounted .
Fashion_Accessories	they tell me its discounted after 00 days .
Fashion_Accessories	ask me to choose a different pair .
Fashion_Accessories	i do that but it costs more .
Fashion_Accessories	they confirm the order but fail to ask me to pay the difference .
Fashion_Accessories	00 days_later i found out i needed to pay .
Fashion_Accessories	i still_waiting for the first pair .
Fashion_Accessories	first : if items are out of stock and they still charge for it , then its there responsibility to tell us asap .
Fashion_Accessories	second : since its there responsibility why ask for more money there and then ?
Fashion_Accessories	thirdly : as customer_service , there role is make_sure if they fell short because of there responsibility the need to offer hugh apologies and compensation for the lost time , stress caused .
Fashion_Accessories	that ' s why i will never buy , recommend to any one to use selectspec .
Fashion_Accessories	stay well away .
Fashion_Accessories	that ' s my ticket # 0000
Fashion_Accessories	hal
Fashion_Accessories	i will send a letter to registered address at company house so the director has an opportunity to put things right .

Fashion_Accessories	i have never dealt_with a company who provides next_day delivery for free !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m so impressed with them i never knew people like this existed !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m 000_% satisfied with their service and couldn ' t have asked for more !
Fashion_Accessories	plus even better the jacket looks absolutely fab !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d advise_anyone and everyone to get their country gear from this place and i will most definitely be using them again .
Fashion_Accessories	they ' re so good i ' m actually shocked !
Fashion_Accessories	v . happy customer !
Fashion_Accessories	i was looking for some time for a series of límited edition vinyls that were sold out everywhere , but there they were at chemical online catalogue .
Fashion_Accessories	in the beginning i was a bit afraid about paying before confirming that the récords were available , as they has been so hard to find , but i went straight to online ordering and receive everything just find a few_days_later in canary islands , using the normal delivery service .
Fashion_Accessories	i will buy moré from you , thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	as an american buying overseas i didn ' t expect shipping to be fast but it did !
Fashion_Accessories	took 0 days .
Fashion_Accessories	not only was it quick but the packaging was superb .
Fashion_Accessories	i can see jules_b really care about their customers .
Fashion_Accessories	definitely will buy from again !
Fashion_Accessories	also customer_service was great .
Fashion_Accessories	replied to my email within the hour !
Fashion_Accessories	ps_: free shipping would be nice :)
Fashion_Accessories	clothes & music all under one roof .
Fashion_Accessories	what more could you ask for ?
Fashion_Accessories	i was amazed as my parcel arrived first thing the next_day , as i ordered only the afternoon before .
Fashion_Accessories	my outfit was amazing will_defiantly be buying from them again .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided to purchase glasses over the internet due to ever increasing prices on the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	selectspecs was an easy website to use and the glasses on offer were very reasonably_priced !
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was as_described and i loved my glasses when they arrived .
Fashion_Accessories	i mainly wear contact_lenses , however , since the arrival of my selectspecs glasses , i have worn the contacts much less !
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased and would most definitely use selectspecs again !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	web_site easy to use and the delivery was really fast .
Fashion_Accessories	the packaging felt_like christmas !
Fashion_Accessories	the best part is the customer_service when you need to retun an item .
Fashion_Accessories	efficiency and politeness all the way from mrs foster !
Fashion_Accessories	looking_forward to shopping again !
Fashion_Accessories	an engagement_ring is a purchase with a large degree of anxiety attached to it - especially if you can ' t see it in front of you ...!
Fashion_Accessories	clive was excellent to speak to and the service offered by diamondgeezer was brilliant .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring is lovely - i ' m just hoping she says yes ...!
Fashion_Accessories	clearly until she does , i can ' t comment on the resizing / returns_policy (!)
Fashion_Accessories	but i felt clive was a straight up guy and would recommend the company to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of glasses , however when i logged in to my account to see if they had been dispatched , i discovered they had been dispatched to a totally different address to the one i had stated , i contacted select_specs who deny having my actual delivery address and they they cannot do anything about it , they suggest i pick_up the specs from the address to which they have been delivered which is lanarkshire and i live in crawley .... no refund offered .
Fashion_Accessories	so paid for glasses i will never actually receive .
Fashion_Accessories	disgraceful .
Fashion_Accessories	items always arrive in immaculate_condition and in excellent time .
Fashion_Accessories	liaising with the customer_service department is always easy .
Fashion_Accessories	an awesome website !
Fashion_Accessories	some purchases i have bought from yesstyle were not as good quality and it is quite hard to tell if it ' s good quality from some images .
Fashion_Accessories	service is very good .
Fashion_Accessories	after being let_down by another retailer who said they had the stock but did not i ordered my rab jacket from webtogs and it arrived the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	great online - store , nice music on vinyl , cd - s , best prices on shoes , clothes and etc !
Fashion_Accessories	recommended !
Fashion_Accessories	i can only recommend this company to others very good service , very resonable priced , goods packaged very well , description of the products very accurate to the images on the website .
Fashion_Accessories	very good company .
Fashion_Accessories	i normally use a website for the first time with a sinking heart , having to learn it and re - entering all my details etc .
Fashion_Accessories	but i think real effort has gone into this site and it shows real ' politeness ' in the way it makes things easy for you .
Fashion_Accessories	it was a pleasure to use and i was truly flabbergasted to receive the gloves i ordered at 0pm on thursday delivered first thing on friday ( and this was near christmas ).
Fashion_Accessories	excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	great pants really comfy and nice original designs .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll definately be coming_back to add to the collection
Fashion_Accessories	wasn ' t entirely sure about ordering from them to start with .
Fashion_Accessories	not because they had a negative reputation , more that i had never ordered glasses online before and wasn ' t sure what website to use .
Fashion_Accessories	i took the leap and ordered a pair of rayban wayfarers .
Fashion_Accessories	i contacted them and they helped_me pick the right size frame for my big head ( i had actually chosen wrong to start with , but they changed my order for me !).
Fashion_Accessories	they had to order the frames from italy , so i wasn ' t expecting next_day delivery or anything .
Fashion_Accessories	they kept in contact with me , letting my know that the frames had arrived and that it would be sent next_day delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	they used dpd ( from personal experience , they are probably one of the best courier services available int he uk !).
Fashion_Accessories	package arrived in perfect_condition and the glasses looked amazing .
Fashion_Accessories	i got the elite coating on the lenses ( cost an extra £_00 ).
Fashion_Accessories	i must_say that i made a good choice picking the coating .
Fashion_Accessories	i wasn ' t expecting anything that hugely different , but it really does make a difference !
Fashion_Accessories	all in all , a very positive and clean experience .
Fashion_Accessories	if they are still about in a few_years time , i will happily order my glasses from them again !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks fashioneyewear . co . uk !
Fashion_Accessories	bought my engagement_ring and both mine and my husbands wedding_rings and they are all beautiful !!!
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant website and very helpful customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	all in all a well_deserved 0_stars
Fashion_Accessories	i bought my other_halfs engagement_ring from diamond_geezer and was very impressed witht he customer_service and design process .
Fashion_Accessories	they will make any design for your ring and suggest improvements a fantastic service and excellent prices top_marks from me .
Fashion_Accessories	nothing more to say .
Fashion_Accessories	thought the delivery was quick and the sizes are exactly_what i wanted
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered some prescription_sunglasses on the 00th_april , with plenty of time to receive them for my holiday beginning on the 00nd may .
Fashion_Accessories	i waited for 0 weeks , with no updates - it turned_out after some time spent investigating the frames were not in stock and i didn ' t receive any correspondence from them to tell me they had sold out .
Fashion_Accessories	( although they told me an_email was sent and i had checked my inbox and spam , i ' m aware they recently updated their site which may have caused their email dispatcher / service to fail )
Fashion_Accessories	i emailed them to find out what ' s going on and end up in a long and painfully_slow email chain trying to figure_out which glasses they have in stock ( each email takes at_least a day to receive a reply ) by the time i came to a conclusion they couldn ' t guarantee delivery before my holiday date .
Fashion_Accessories	no apologies were made or any effort to try and push through the order a little faster , even considering they ' d messed_up in the first place !
Fashion_Accessories	now i ' ve either go to :
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	go without
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	brave the prices of a high - street store .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks for wasting my time , you ' ve lost a returning customer in a very competitive and saturated marketplace .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service , very happy with my new eyewear , will_definitely purchase from fashion eyewear in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve bought a couple of things from webtogs now and they ' ve always delivered quickly and provided a competitive price .
Fashion_Accessories	the most_recent order included a top that needed exchanging for a larger_size .
Fashion_Accessories	i phoned up and spoke with a helpful person who got the replacement send out on next_day delivery and said i could return the smaller item as soon as possible and still not get charged for the return_postage .
Fashion_Accessories	very helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	never had a problem with these_guys , had a query recently and they got back to me quickly and sorted it .
Fashion_Accessories	deliver my records in super_quick time
Fashion_Accessories	personally , i would recommend that no one orders from this website , i had an torrid time dealing_with their customer_service and policies .
Fashion_Accessories	they make if difficult to return goods , only give you 00 days to do it , and only offer you a refund in yesstyle credit .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutly disgusting , i have been mugged by this unethical company .
Fashion_Accessories	i recently_purchased the crown concealer palette to contour .
Fashion_Accessories	it is amazing !
Fashion_Accessories	the quality of the concealer is really high , the packaging is classy yet understated and it makes contouring so easy .
Fashion_Accessories	i love it .
Fashion_Accessories	it could only be improved with a mirror , like the urban_decay eye palettes have .
Fashion_Accessories	great product , delivered super_fast .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect experience .
Fashion_Accessories	i spent a lot of time searching for a particular pair of ray_bans that i saw on someone when on holiday in dubai .
Fashion_Accessories	i went to my local sunglass shop and was told i ' d have to wait 0 - 0 weeks for them to be ordered and delivered .
Fashion_Accessories	as i ' m going to barcelona for the weekend this week that wasn ' t suitable .
Fashion_Accessories	i looked online and found them on fashioneyewear . co . uk at an unbelievable price of £_00 . 00 .
Fashion_Accessories	as my local retailer was selling them for £_000 i honestly thought this website was selling fakes or something like that .
Fashion_Accessories	i didn ' t order for about 0 days as i was so unsure , but after_reading the trustpilot reviews i thought i ' d give it a go .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered saturday evening and they have arrived today ( tuesday ) with amazing dpd delivery service with allotted delivery time_slot of 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived at 00 : 00 .
Fashion_Accessories	i am over the moon , they are beautiful , authentic and i ' m wearing them today !
Fashion_Accessories	came with a discount card of 0 %_off next purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	will be ordering another pair very soon !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you so much .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy customer and telling all my friends !
Fashion_Accessories	i heard of diamond_geezer through a forum and so glad i dismissed my fears of buying something so expensive from the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	the guys called me to advise on the ring size as i initially ordered it way too big for the average female hand .
Fashion_Accessories	the progress emails are fantastic and regular and reassuring where other_companies might not keep you up to date .
Fashion_Accessories	and , the resizing process ( i had to get it resized for the perfect fit ) - what can i say .
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer received the ring on thursday_morning , must have resized , polished and re - posted it that same afternoon .
Fashion_Accessories	it was back with us on friday_afternoon .
Fashion_Accessories	unbelievable !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	the guys are clearly passionate_about their business and put in so much effort to make this big event for prospective couples seamless , stress_free and with a stunning end product .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely outstanding .
Fashion_Accessories	avoid the high_street , and have complete faith in diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased an engagement_ring from diamond_geezer after seeing them on dragons den and the update show when james caan visited them .
Fashion_Accessories	the choice is wide and the staff extremely_helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	the price is more_than competative to the highstreet and the quality of the product is fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d recommend them to anyone and use them again .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you for making_sure my sons costume got here before book day at his school .
Fashion_Accessories	he is very excited about wearing his musketeer costume !!
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll be coming_back again !!

Fashion_Accessories	easy website to navigate .
Fashion_Accessories	friendly staff over the phone .
Fashion_Accessories	no_problems at all at any point .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery prompt .
Fashion_Accessories	quality excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	i was really impressed with diamond_geezer ' s website functionality & ring builder app .
Fashion_Accessories	made it really easy to design a perfect engagement_ring for my now fiancee .
Fashion_Accessories	the service over the phone pre_- purchase was excellent and reassured me about making such a significant purchase online .
Fashion_Accessories	the advisor was really helpful and not even the slightest bit pushy .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring was made to my exact specifications , came with all the appropriate documentation and the delivery was smooth , even_though i had to change the address at the last_minute .
Fashion_Accessories	my after sales experience has also been excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	i sent the ring back for a free polishing about 00mths after buying it and this was done and back to me within a week , all for free .
Fashion_Accessories	i would not hesitate in recommending diamond_geezer to people and would happily use them again in the future .

Fashion_Accessories	hope they grow and thrive .
Fashion_Accessories	a very good experience .
Fashion_Accessories	next_day delivery free of charge , and a the claims of ' no hassle returns ' are genuine .
Fashion_Accessories	moreover , the whole_process is very transparent with tracking options and a responsive customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	this review is based on a single purchase and return .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve been shopping at chemical for years now .
Fashion_Accessories	really good selection to choose from and i love the fact that nine times out of ten you get your order the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	from the very few minor problems that have arisen , they ' ve sorted it out very efficiently .
Fashion_Accessories	i do think they should reward their loyal_customers more often though , apart_from the recent tc promo_code there hasn ' t been much else .
Fashion_Accessories	also , wish they ' d put things up for pre_- order earlier like some other record shops do , it ' s the only time i drift to other shops .
Fashion_Accessories	but yeh , other than that , amazing shop and service
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased on the basis that select_specs were 0 / 0 the price of the high_street for designer police glasses and believed the sales_pitch and reviews that the lenses were the same .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve had several problems .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived a month after i ordered
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	despite the correct prescription being provided the lenses are extremely poor .
Fashion_Accessories	i got distorted peripheral vision which gave me headaches .
Fashion_Accessories	the advice on the website is to go to your optician and ask them to set them up for you .
Fashion_Accessories	not surprisingly my opticians told me to get on my bike as they didn ' t want to do selectspecs job .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	my opticians view is that the lenses are extremely cheap and as a result i have been experiencing the vision problems .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	the police frames i ordered were semi rimless and the lenses selectspecs provided were 0 - 0mm larger than the ones that police provided .
Fashion_Accessories	this ruined the look of the glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	there is no contact options except via e_- mail .
Fashion_Accessories	this become extremely frustrating when you have problems .
Fashion_Accessories	i have returned my glasses and 0 days in they have asked me the same questions again and i am no further forward .
Fashion_Accessories	my case is yet to be resolved .
Fashion_Accessories	we ' ll see how long that takes ..
Fashion_Accessories	so in summary i would say before like me you decide to purchase with selectspecs think carefully .
Fashion_Accessories	i will never purchase glasses from them or anyone_else online again .
Fashion_Accessories	life is too short !
Fashion_Accessories	ive used cr many_times over the last couple a years to purchase clothing and never had any_problems .
Fashion_Accessories	everything has always been delivered swiftly and in good condition
Fashion_Accessories	sunglasses - shop has all the information you need about your new sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	after searching the internet for prices for the sunglasses i wanted , i found that sunglasses - shop were extremely competitive .
Fashion_Accessories	not only that , they delivered my glasses the very next_day , which means a lot in terms of customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	i would not hesitate in recommending sunglasses - shop to other people .
Fashion_Accessories	ive used chemical on a few occasions whilst living outside of bristol and always recieved my orders well within the time_frame stated , and always arrives intact and undamaged .
Fashion_Accessories	recently placed an order now im living in bristol , and arrived either the very next_day or the morning of the second ( can ' t remember ).
Fashion_Accessories	once again very impressed with the layout of the website , the price for the quality and generally everything about chemical - records , word of mouth from friends is always positive .
Fashion_Accessories	will_continue to use them in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	highly reccommended (:
Fashion_Accessories	the ordering_process was simple and easy to complete , with a variety of payment_methods available .
Fashion_Accessories	the website is well arranged and easy to navigate with accurate item sizing guides and competitive_pricing .
Fashion_Accessories	the product was good and service outstanding throughout .
Fashion_Accessories	quick delivery
Electrical_goods	what i did find , however was a poor uncaring customer_service department .

Electrical_goods	ordered using royal_mail 0st_class delivery and it came 0 working day later .
Electrical_goods	this was especially impressive considering all the disruption caused by the heavy snow , but most_importantly well_done for hifiheadphones getting the order out within a few hours on the same day .
Electrical_goods	website is also aesthetically pleasing and joy to use .
Electrical_goods	will use again when i undoubteldy upgrade any of my cans or buy others presents .
Electrical_goods	so digitalrev have given me a canon_00d at £_000 cheaper_than the uk price and around £_000 cheaper_than the newer 00d which is not hugely different .
Electrical_goods	cant thank them enough .
Electrical_goods	dhl messed_around with the delivery but still received item less_than a week after purchase ( and would have been 0 days quicker had it not been for dhl in the uk ).
Electrical_goods	love the fact that the item came with an adaptor to charge the battery in the uk and the only negative is an instruction back in chinese .

Electrical_goods	havent properly used the item yet but from first appearances and a few photos taken very happy so far .

Electrical_goods	production_room is a great store full of awesome but competitively_priced gear .
Electrical_goods	the customer_service from their staff is second to none .
Electrical_goods	i always make the trip from doncaster to production_room ( leeds ) instead of seeking out audio_equipment locally .
Electrical_goods	00 / 00 will use every time .
Electrical_goods	s . d
Electrical_goods	i bought the amplifier at a great price , and although i found myself with a technical difficulty on arrival , that was due to my lack of inexperience .
Electrical_goods	hifi - tower emailed me back within a day or so and i was sorted !
Electrical_goods	0 / 0 for price / quality and speed of delivery !
Electrical_goods	i needed to transfer a lot of old photo negatives to positives onto my laptop and then print them .
Electrical_goods	the one i bought from hi fi tower worked_fine and was very easy to use .
Electrical_goods	the aga - t0 was delivered within 0 working_days with standard delivery , excellent service .
Electrical_goods	it performs superbly and was much_easier to set_up than other cheap re - buildable atomisers that i ' ve purchased before .
Electrical_goods	it really is extraordinary value for money .
Electrical_goods	a genesis style atomiser like this would have cost you a small_fortune a few_months_ago .
Electrical_goods	absolutely no leaks whatsoever .
Electrical_goods	its not for beginners but i highly_recommend it .
Electrical_goods	probably a good idea to also purchase some spare mesh and wire if you ' re starting out .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely give 0_stars !
Electrical_goods	but i received an_email instructing me to check the parcel and the content before signing :
Electrical_goods	====
Electrical_goods	important message : we strongly_advise you to check the parcel ’_s condition and contents before signing the delivery note . feel free to remove your product ( s ) from the box to inspect them , even if the outer_packaging doesn ’ t show any signs of damage .
Electrical_goods	====
Electrical_goods	the above message was in red and bold .
Electrical_goods	but when i received the parcel the delivery guy didn ' t allow me to open it ( obviously ) and said that i need to sign first as this is part of ups policy .
Electrical_goods	and to be honest , i think he is right ... how would you " open / alter " the package before signing ... you know , before signing it is still his responsibility and not yours !
Electrical_goods	be more clear next time .
Electrical_goods	other than that , great price and product condition .. so far at_least .
Electrical_goods	the service was brilliant !!!!
Electrical_goods	easy to place an order and they were quick to organise a delivery date .
Electrical_goods	the delivery company gave us a delivery time_slot to which they kept by it and were very helpful in bringing the product inside the property .
Electrical_goods	the staffs was very friendly and polite and will go out of their way to make_sure you are happy with the products you have brought and find other products that are similar if the one you are after is no_longer available .
Electrical_goods	i will use this again .
Electrical_goods	this was my first time ordering from digitalrev and it will not be the last , the price of the item was £_000 cheaper_than the uk and it was delivered in a couple of days .............. from bloody hong_kong how is that possible when companies in the uk can take a couple weeks sending something couple hundred miles_away .
Electrical_goods	have my eye on a canon 00 - 000 f0 or 0 . 0 now :_d
Electrical_goods	i purchased a nikon_d0000 from digitalrev . com , and it was an easy pleasant_transaction .
Electrical_goods	i received my item within a few_days from ordering .
Electrical_goods	as it was being shipped from hk , i expected more of a wait to be honest , but was pleasantly_surprised to receive it so quickly .
Electrical_goods	it was well_packaged and secure for the post .
Electrical_goods	the communication was top stuff , i received all emails and tracking_information asap .
Electrical_goods	not to mention that they have the best prices on the market for this piece of kit .
Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	the only_niggle was that the instruction manuals were all in japanese , however a sticker on the front of the manual directed me to a nikon web_page where i could download and print an english copy off .
Electrical_goods	so not a real problem at all .
Electrical_goods	cant_wait to purchase my next gear for this camera from these_guys .
Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	jim

Electrical_goods	i ordered a canon ef 00 -_000mm l from digitalrev and was more_than impressed with how quickly it got here .

Electrical_goods	well_done to kai and his team on that .
Electrical_goods	you will be always my preferred online_retailer from now on , one suggestion though .
Electrical_goods	have you thought about keep a record of repeat customers and a may be overwhelm them with some inexpensive but a trademark goodie like a " digitalrev " mug when a customer spends more_than 0000 gbp in a years time .
Electrical_goods	just a thought ?
Electrical_goods	may be a goodie for the person who has this brilliant idea ?
Electrical_goods	regards
Electrical_goods	jishnu nandy

Electrical_goods	i would recommended digitalrev to anyone with low_budget prices are really good .
Electrical_goods	very efficient delivery - i had my item at the door within 0 days travelling from hk , so it beats some free deliveries within uk .
Electrical_goods	in the customs declaration the value was about 00_% what i paid , good way to avoid duty , but should anything happen ...
Electrical_goods	anyway , that ' s the beauty of ' grey market '
Electrical_goods	will i buy next time they have some grat deal ?

Electrical_goods	i found pixmania to be very easy to navigate through there website
Electrical_goods	picking items and paying for them online was simple .
Electrical_goods	delivery was very fast too
Electrical_goods	i was very happy with the service .
Electrical_goods	i made my mind up on the canon 00 - 000 l series based on my budget and the digital_rev review .
Electrical_goods	so happy with it and the delivery was super_speedy very happy
Electrical_goods	i chose to order from hifi_headphones because their website offered lots of advice that enabled me to make an informed purchase , also the support they offer gave me peace of mind that should any_problems occur it would be sorted .
Electrical_goods	i was kept well informed of the status of my order and the headphones arrived in good time and well_packaged .
Electrical_goods	i ordered the headphones as a present for someone_else and so i am unable to rate the product , but i am very happy with the purchase experience and would certainly shop there again next time i need headphones .
Electrical_goods	they provided great advice on a couple of sets of headphones i was thinking about and really helped make my decision .
Electrical_goods	they delivered next_day and fast .

Electrical_goods	a big chunk of money for me .
Electrical_goods	roughly two and half thousand_pounds sterling .
Electrical_goods	to a random website store from honk kong ... i must be stupid right ?
Electrical_goods	well , the leap of faith paid off big time as i saved literally hundreds of pounds on rival company prices , the goods were delivered within a week and are in perfect_condition .
Electrical_goods	communication was spot - on , parcel tracking worked a treat , what more can i say ?
Electrical_goods	i ' ll be using them again .
Electrical_goods	fantastic service .
Electrical_goods	he never reply to your emails and he will never send the tracking_number .
Electrical_goods	i was forced to open a paypal_dispute and he canceled my account from his site .
Electrical_goods	stay_away from this store .
Electrical_goods	this website provide you with large_amount of products that you can choose from , with best possible deals available and good recommendation .
Electrical_goods	the shipping is fast and the product is in really good condition .
Electrical_goods	i had some initial apprehension about using an offshore company such as digitalrev for the first time especially around warranties .
Electrical_goods	i found a lot of reviews and success stories from acquaintances in a photography forum i am a member of and heard of people successfully using the digitalrev warranty when required to i decided to take the plunge and give it a go .
Electrical_goods	ordering was as easy as any ecommerce site but it was the delivery that blew me away .
Electrical_goods	dhl got the lens from_hong_kong to my house in 0 days !

Electrical_goods	i ordered a pair of replacement earpads for my headphones .
Electrical_goods	the confirmation and dispatch emails were quite funny .
Electrical_goods	the earpads were delivered promptly , and there was even a little surprise waiting for me with my earpads , which was sweet .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely_recommend hifiheadphones .
Electrical_goods	after a lot of deliberation about whether to order from here or pick one up locally , i eventually decided to ' risk it ' and save quite a bit of money by placing my order with digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	i needn ' t have had any concerns at all !
Electrical_goods	their communication from the moment i placed the order was great , and i was able to track my order from the depot in hong_kong right to my door in the uk .

Electrical_goods	highly_recommended .
Electrical_goods	looking to start a long_term business agreement with them but wanted to find out some information first , everything i wanted to know was answered by ellie mcdonald so i really do advise this company to people
Electrical_goods	i was somewhat cautious with ordering from a foreign company , but i ’ m very happy i took the risk .
Electrical_goods	the price was excellent , £_000 for a canon 00 -_000mm , compared to £_000 on uk rivals such as amazon and john_lewis .
Electrical_goods	delivery was very fast too – ordered on tuesday_evening and arrived friday_morning using dhl_express tracker .
Electrical_goods	very happy with the lens and the service .
Electrical_goods	i will be buying again !
Electrical_goods	ordered the bundle pack for £_00 , a package that i would recommend to anyone_wanting to get into vaping .
Electrical_goods	comes with an excellent array of tips to experiment with .
Electrical_goods	wonderful vapour production when used with a 00 / 00 vg / pg mix and the battery_life is immense .
Electrical_goods	the only flaw that i found was that the imist , awesome as it is , does leak a tiny_bit so i found that i was using more liquid than i should have , but i was walking for 0 hours a day with it in my pocket , so that was probably a contributing factor .
Electrical_goods	arrival time was prompt .
Electrical_goods	woould and have recommended to friends .
Electrical_goods	you ' d be crazy not to use safer cigs for your beginner - pro vaping needs !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	ordered a 00 " full_hd led_tv
Electrical_goods	when i looked up in order history the tv became hd ready
Electrical_goods	then i tried looking for that tv to see if i had a mistake ordering it , but the tv wasnt on the website anymore and the one they sent out , the hd ready one wasnt on it either ... so in my conclusion this was a scam an nothing more .
Electrical_goods	i contacted pixmania and told them the situation , but they said that was what i ordered ... but it wasnt .
Electrical_goods	and they said that if im not happy i can give it to the delivery guy when it comes to my door , and they will take it and give me full_refund , but when the delivery came i wasnt at home at the time and my friend signed the papers for delivery and stuff .
Electrical_goods	my friend didnt know that i was going to send it back so its ok , but i was disapointed that i got no call informing_me of a delivery date or anything and for that i had to send the tv back trough post wich costed me 00_euros wich i doubt will be refunded .
Electrical_goods	im still_waiting for tv to be returned to france where they are based so i get my full_refund ... full_refund .
Electrical_goods	i had order a lens from digitalrev even tough the price was expensive than other_companies who are importing the products in uk , but they promised a delivery time of 0 - 0 days compared to others .
Electrical_goods	they undervalued the cost of the lens ( even lesser than half of the price i paid for the lens ), that it was held - up at customs .
Electrical_goods	i logged a ticket reporting the issue and then escalated , but no action was taken .
Electrical_goods	i finally managed to call their customer_services , which has ridiculous opening_hours ( from 0am to 00am gmt ).
Electrical_goods	i was promissed that it would sorted and the product would be delivered to me within two days .
Electrical_goods	even after several days past their commited delivery date , the product is not delivered and the most frustrating is that no efforts are made by digitalrev to get it released from customs and get it delivered , where in the responsibility of delivery lies with them .
Electrical_goods	update_: received call from digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	they promised to resolve the issue at the earliest .
Electrical_goods	fast & cheap & good !
Electrical_goods	what more i can say ?
Electrical_goods	top_notch customer care , really friendly guys , couldn ' t ask for better service .
Electrical_goods	headphones are sick too !
Electrical_goods	very happy customer !

Electrical_goods	i had questions i was unsure_about and got a non - robotic from the sales book response within 00_hours as well .
Electrical_goods	no_complaints and already been passing the name around the office .
Electrical_goods	thanks to all at digital_rev :)
Electrical_goods	ordered bose headphones from hispek - great price which nobody else could get near to .

Electrical_goods	even if they don ' t like a product they stock or see weakness they are not afraid to say so even if it may hurt their sales which makes them much more trustworthy from the get go ).
Electrical_goods	they offer very reasonable prices and also offer a social_networking service , which lets you get to know the company better ( a lot of " bigger " businesses could learn from this model , if this is the future of online shopping its very bright !)
Electrical_goods	i ordered my lens at the weekend and 0 days_later it arrived .
Electrical_goods	they also provided a great tracking service via dhl ( literally step by step .
Electrical_goods	every few hours there was an update ) who delivered the product , well_packaged .

Electrical_goods	i was kept_informed via_email_notifications , ability to track my order , the site had a sweet looking logged in area with a good social aspect of the site to engage in members convo , and believe or not , i got my order in 0 days via fedex all the way to londontown .

Electrical_goods	everything was clarified to me and whole conversation turned into an great , friendly chat that i have never_experienced as a customer over the phone .
Electrical_goods	we all contact different companies to chase orders , change details , price plans etc .
Electrical_goods	but i have never felt as so valued customer before .
Electrical_goods	during conversation my baby was shouting in a background and what a surprise it was when among the stuff i have received there was a lolly pop for her .
Electrical_goods	that is a level of customer focus that you receive in a 0 * restaurants or your local_stores where you have done your shopping for last 00 years .
Electrical_goods	we had a chat about products and the information i have received was very important addition to what i have read about on the forums and in the reviews .
Electrical_goods	level of customer_service i have received is amazing but it was price and range of products that made me choose this site .
Electrical_goods	never regret buying from them you will .
Electrical_goods	curry ' s was amazed they were able to offer the tv at such a low price i cant_fault them .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve used them a few_times to buy gadgets normally smaller hard_drives and the likes but with this tv now i wouldn ' t think_twice about ordering again .
Electrical_goods	i bought a dsi mopho from the production_room via amazon and though there proved to be a manufacturing_fault with the unit when it was delivered , the customer_service team , and particularly andy nolan , were extremely_helpful in collecting the faulty unit and chasing a replacement .
Electrical_goods	there was excellent communication from andy throughout the process and a genuine willingness to help which was very refreshing .

Electrical_goods	their nikon_d0000 was much cheaper_than in the uk and the reviews were great so i gave it a go .
Electrical_goods	i was concerned_about many things , but mainly whether the product was new , did it come with a box , did it have a uk charger , would it work and whether it would arrive at all !
Electrical_goods	i ordered my camera on saturday and it arrived on tuesday .
Electrical_goods	everything perfect , as promised .
Electrical_goods	new , boxed , uk charger .
Electrical_goods	the box was opened before , as they put their warranty inside and ( i guess ) replace the japanese charger with the uk one .

Electrical_goods	i ordered a pair of headphones ( denon ah - d0000 ) in the morning and they arrived literally the next_day ( in the morning again ).

Electrical_goods	definitely recommended .
Electrical_goods	i never write_reviews unless i ' m either extremely happy or extremely annoyed at a product / service , and this is definitely the former .
Electrical_goods	i ordered 0 lenses on a monday , and was told they should be with me by saturday ...... they arrived on thursday , packed deep in bubble_wrap and exactly as_described , what else could you ask for ?
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	oh and they ' re considerably_cheaper and more trustworthy than a lot of other_places , with a cracking youtube_channel to match .

Electrical_goods	i ordered a shuttle pc on 00th_dec , - no delivery by jan 0th , so i filled out a customer_service form on the website .
Electrical_goods	no repsonse received , so i called ( jan 0th ) and they said they hadn ' t received any communication from me .
Electrical_goods	they checked and said it had been despatched and it would take up to five days for the courier to respond as to where the item was in the meantime , no refund or replacement was possible .
Electrical_goods	no further contact by jan 00rd - two_weeks_later .
Electrical_goods	i called again and they said the item ( shuttle pc ) wasn ' t in stock and that they had emailed me , but it probably was lost as spam .
Electrical_goods	- they hadn ' t sent an_email , it wasn ' t on our mail server .
Electrical_goods	i asked for a refund , which they said would take up to 00 days ' because of banking regulations '.
Electrical_goods	funny how the payment can be taken out in moments .
Electrical_goods	so in summary_:
Electrical_goods	they said item was despatched then when it didn ' t arrive they said it was out of stock .
Electrical_goods	they said they hadn ' t received any notification from me despite completing an order - referenced contact form on their web_site .
Electrical_goods	they said it would take five days to get back with an answer from the courier , they didn ' t get back at all .
Electrical_goods	they said they had sent an_email when they didn ' t .
Electrical_goods	they said it takes up to ten_days to refund money
Electrical_goods	tom
Electrical_goods	i had already my first experience , with my new nikon_d0000 , and was great .
Electrical_goods	great service ; quick delivery and item was securely_packaged and as_described .

Electrical_goods	they are fast at replying emails and are extremely clear with everything .
Electrical_goods	perfect besides the amp !
Electrical_goods	0 *
Electrical_goods	as expected after_reading all other reviews , there were going to be zero problems with this company and i was right .
Electrical_goods	in fact my only_gripe would be with myself for ordering just a few_days before all the easter bank_holidays kicked in meaning i ' d have to wait for dhl to deliver !
Electrical_goods	the camera was as_described , all the menus and stuff on the camera were in english , it was a body that had come from one with a kit_lens in - not that i ' m bothered .
Electrical_goods	the delivery could be tracked all the way from_hong_kong right to my door_step , and included in my box was a small piece of paper explaining their warranty which is basically the same as any other company !
Electrical_goods	i fully recommend saving the money , the company was excellent and thoroughly deserve all the praise that they get !
Electrical_goods	i wanted a good price for my camera as i believe it ' s in great condition .
Electrical_goods	this was the best quote i could find on the internet !
Electrical_goods	there were no_problems in sending my camera across and i got an_email within a few_days about payment .
Electrical_goods	i have received my cheque this morning and i would recommend your company to anyone for very quick and reliable service !
Electrical_goods	i got a sharp 00 amazing tv more cheap tham ever .
Electrical_goods	pixmania is the best place to purchase something ever .
Electrical_goods	digitalrev is an excellent seller .
Electrical_goods	dispite being based in hong_kong and me placing my order on a sunday over here in england , my new lens arrived on the tuesday_morning .
Electrical_goods	for free delivery that is incredible , and faster_than most paid delivery options from other sellers .
Electrical_goods	the company has a popular youtube_channel that offers a funny and interesting approach to product reviews .
Electrical_goods	the website was easy to navigate and the price was £_00 cheaper_than everywhere_else i looked .
Electrical_goods	i am completely_satisfied , especially with their international 0 year_warranty .
Electrical_goods	this company is 000_% safe and trusted by thousands of customers .
Electrical_goods	i will_definitely be coming_back again !
Electrical_goods	buy confidently .
Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	i know the subject heading sounds_like an over statement .
Electrical_goods	but i ' m being completely serious .
Electrical_goods	i ended_up having several conversations with robin that lasted over an_hour each .
Electrical_goods	not that i ' d want to encourage it and make life difficult for them .
Electrical_goods	but the level of his knowledge is outstanding .
Electrical_goods	and his enthusiasm is utterly invigorating .
Electrical_goods	i feel_like i ought to ring periodically as a general pick - me - up to remind me that there are people out there with a remarkable passion for what they do , going hand in hand with absolutely thorough knowledge , understanding , good taste , intelligence , courtesy , and general friendliness .
Electrical_goods	i ' m not just a friend writing them a good review .
Electrical_goods	although they quickly felt_like friends .
Electrical_goods	robin convinced me to buy a pair of hd000 headphones along with a headphone amp .
Electrical_goods	and after my first listen , i ' m so completely blown_away that i really think they ' re going to add a whole extra facet of happiness to my life .
Electrical_goods	sorry if this sounds ridiculous .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve never written one of these reviews before .
Electrical_goods	i just wish all shopping could be like this .
Electrical_goods	it ' s not going to happen though .
Electrical_goods	these_guys just stand out for excellence .
Electrical_goods	and they deserve your business .
Electrical_goods	in short , i had to return item to digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	the customer_service advisor ( sam ) i spoke to via_email was very helpful and sympathetic .
Electrical_goods	when the item arrived back in hong_kong , they refunded me the total cost and then sent it to canon for inspection and repair .
Electrical_goods	canon ' s inspection said it wasn ' t faulty , but sam still offered to speak to management to see if they could cover some of the postage cost .
Electrical_goods	whilst the situation didn ' t go as planned leaving me a little frustrated ( canon saying there was nothing wrong with the camera ) this was not digitalrev ' s fault and they were very sympathetic .
Electrical_goods	if the item had arrived without the issue , which was not digitalrev ' s fault , then the service was second to none - 0 days from_hong_kong to the uk is amazing and their prices are very competitive !
Electrical_goods	i ordered sennheiser hd00 / headphones / few_months_ago ...( made in ireland ) and they ' re working pretty good !
Electrical_goods	what a quality .....!
Electrical_goods	ordered canon_000d on friday and it came on the monday - very pleased , also was the cheapest i could find without the worry of having to pay import_duties , as digirev take care of these .
Electrical_goods	unlike_other sellers digirev also offer free tutorials which again is great !
Electrical_goods	don ' t be worried to order , they ' re brilliant and i couldn ' t be more chuffed with the camera :_d highly_recommended !
Electrical_goods	*****
Electrical_goods	to be honest , i first looked up reviews of digitalrev before placing my order of canon_00d with 00 -_000mm lens .
Electrical_goods	the reviews made me feel so positive that i was comfortable spending the amount of money that i did for someone based out of hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	it ’_s unlikely that a canon product will be defective , but even if it does there is a 0 year digitalrev international warranty .
Electrical_goods	but i was more surprised with the speed that they couriered it .
Electrical_goods	within 0 hrs of placing the order , my dhl_tracking_number was updated on the website .
Electrical_goods	now , i dint expect that quick service .
Electrical_goods	placed my order on the 00th of december and had the camera with me on 00st ( would have got it on the 00th if dhl hadn ’ t delayed it !)
Electrical_goods	as someone rightly said in one of the reviews that i read , if one wants to give a quality service then you can anywhere from the planet .
Electrical_goods	later i told my friends about it , someone pointed it out that they were already members of digitalrev community .
Electrical_goods	i have already_recommended digitalrev to my friends and to my dad .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they send full instructions on how to remove all your personal data from the individual handset before sending it back to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the freepost_envelope arrives quickly as does the cheque once you ' ve sent them your phone .. there is even a choice of ways to be paid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really great company , would definitely use again and recommend !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would use them again a +
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma_mobile proved to be a considerably easy and quick process , within a day or two i received the necessary documentation to post my old phone to them ( free !)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received confirmation of my old_mobile reaching mazuma , and within another day or two , my cheque arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	simple
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely perfect .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent the phone on the friday and got paid on the monday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no reservations_about recommending them to anyone and they paid more_than mazuma and envirofone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	superb and would trade with them again for sure .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cannot_fault this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they pay very competitive rates in the comparison_sites , but what drew me to them was that they pay the same day of receiving the phone direct to your bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you don ' t want to pay postage , you don ' t have to but i paid for special delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this money then went towards my new phone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma - i ' d use you again
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will use again 000 %!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	my phone took longer to get to mazuma_mobile than anticipated ( only by a day or two .
Cell_phone_Recycling	when i asked if my handset had arrived they responded with an_email_saying that i should not worry because my quote will not change because i have notified them of the date it was sent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if only every business was as decent as this !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found the prices were really fair didnt think i would get anything for my phones , and the pack and cheque were sent really fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i couldnt fault them on there service or how easy the website was to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a bag in 0 days , threw it in the mailbox and was tested by the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got price as advertised and had to wait 0 days for it to go into paypal .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had an 0gb iphone_0gs that was a little battered on the outside and scratched but mazuma_mobile said that if it was in full working order , could turn on and off etc then i would receive £_000 and i did !
Cell_phone_Recycling	before this i had it valued with envirofone . com who , because of the damaged outside , offered me £_00 , no thank_you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma_mobile are great !
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything was explained clearly , with as much care and attendion to details to make the whole transaction go smoothly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	from the moment i logged on , to the moment i got the money for my phone , each section was eplained , worked well and very understandable .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was also a swift service , which was great !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!

Cell_phone_Recycling	packaging came promptly and all i had to do was put my phone in the box and post it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was in my bank three days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely_recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy and efficent way to recycle your old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recieved money just 0 days after my phone was collected .
Cell_phone_Recycling	initially i was skeptical_about these kinds of sites that offer fast cash for your old_mobile , but i was hoping to sell my iphone 0 to make a few extra quid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i read the overwhelmingly positive_reviews online about mazuma and thought i ' d give them a try .
Cell_phone_Recycling	suffice to say i posted my phone ( registered delivery ) at 0 :_00pm on wednesday and the money was in my account by 0pm on the thursday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	less_than a 00 hour turnaround !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was worried that the quoted price may change after the phone had been expected ( the phone was in working order but had very minor surface scratches and cracks ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	but no , the quoted amount was sent directly into my bank_account with no question .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process of making the order was really smooth and i didn ' t feel left in the dark at any time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	every_step of making the order was highly informative and plenty of options were given as to the method of posting .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as well as this , the terms and conditions were really clear and the important stuff was highlighted on the relevant_information .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended and would definitely use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brillaint service this is my second phone with a massive price difference from the first one and i have always got the full_amount .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phones in to mazuma but relised a few hours_later that i hadnt put in the order form , i rang them and the lady i spoke to was very helpful and sorted it out for me , and i recieved the money into my bank a few_days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will definatly use mazuma again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a bit_dubious using this sort of website but after spekaing to a friend who used mazuma i was convinced that they were legit .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was first_class from start to finish .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was offered a great price , able to send it back for free and the money was transferred into my account the day after my phone was received !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend iit to everyone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	super_fast transaction and money transfer ,..., no_problems what so ever .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i highly_recommend mazuma as a way of selling an old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great idea and very easy to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	nice to get some cash for something that is otherwise just sitting around in the drawer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy service to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t be more happy with the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the voucher and envelope were delivered so quickly , and i received nearly doubled the amount envirophone offered me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely_recommend !
Cell_phone_Recycling	its an easy to use website , with fast service and payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would really recommend the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service and prompt payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend this company to anyone - they do much_better deals for recycling your mobiles than other similar companiesaking to a friend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it only took about a week from the moment i confirmed it on the website until i got the money for the phone and it wasn ' t too bad a price considering it was a fairly old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as much as we may look upon these tv ads and large organisations as rip_off_merchants , i think it is now time for people to become realistic .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma have taken my phone , and put cash into my account , simple !.
Cell_phone_Recycling	they have given me a better price than any small retailer , and trust me i have been to loads over the last 0 weeks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so .......... get onto mazuma and let the small rip_off shops rott .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this company is a success for a reason , they are good .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a friend who had previously used mazuma_mobile had highly_recommended them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after using them myself , i have found the service extremely fast and excellent value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	by using the " print your own pack " option , the money was in my bank_account within 0 days !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will_definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received my envelope in the post and sent it and the whole_process was a breeze received my money the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_reccomended
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was really impressed with mazuma ' s service - the freepost_envelope arrived the next_day and the money was in my account the day after i sent the phone in and i was kept_informed of progress throughout .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will use you again and will recommend you to fiends !
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant , fast and friendly !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was kept up to date throughout the whole_process and i enjoyed the witty one liners on the emails .... will_definately_recommend this service to all my friends !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazumamobile
Cell_phone_Recycling	i hear numerous horror_stories about other_companies where you send off the product for them to rip into it and grade it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the price they display is never what you actually get .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however with mazuma as long as the product matches the clear to see requirements the price you are quoted is the price you get .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve sent numerous phones and always get what i ' m quoted .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent in my iphone in the packaging that was sent out to me which was easy to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then got my money for the phone straight into my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t be better !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick and easy to post them off , very good price for the phones and the money came quicker_than i thought .... only 0 days from posting them
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent
Cell_phone_Recycling	i probably could have got more money by selling the phones on ebay , but then i would have had to go to post_office to send phones out , plus all the hassle of non paying bidders etc , so in actual fact when you consider the ebay fees and hassle , mazuma was probably a better option .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was easy , straight_forward and hassle_free .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended and would definately use again in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i placed my order on friday , sent everything on monday ( free post ) and had my money into my bank_account on wednesday without any problem .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a mobile to sell ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	cant recommend mazumba enough , easy process and got paid the day the phones were received .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they do what they say , what more do you want ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	00 / 00
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service and fast delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only took about 0 days all in all to get the bag sent to me , my phone sent off and my money in my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would really recommend mazumamobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very pleased with the service i received from mazuma_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast payment , same amount as quoted , unlike_other_sites i have used in the past .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will only ever use mazuma now and have recommended to friends .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fair and fast service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	great communication .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was emailed when they had received the phone and payment was transferred into my account the same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	despite the fact that i sent my phone off a bit late , and that it had some minor_scratches on the screen , mazuma still paid me very promptly in full .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you ' d be hard pressed to find similar service elsewhere .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the mazuma website was easy to navigate - explained everything that was going to happen and even showed me how to clear all personal info from my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the transaction was fast , with the pre_- paid post bag supplied making everything trouble free .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was in the bank fast - couldn ' t be_happier !
Cell_phone_Recycling	my phone was 0 months old and worked_perfectly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent it to mazuma in a bubble_wrapped envelope , inside the normal postal envelope they send .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then i get an_email_saying it does not charge , then try ripping me off for £_00 less_than the offer they made me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	bunch of con_artists i will be reporting to trading_standards .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would have tried to talk to them but there lines are not open .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was extremely happy with the quality and the expedited service that mazuma_mobile provides .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i highly_recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_thing was dealt_with within the week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast payment_method really was fast !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would strongly_recommend using special or recorded_delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	call me paranoid , but i also used a brown envelope instead of the ' mazuma branded ' one provided , as i believe these are just an invite for people to pinch your handsets before they reach mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	otherwise , excellent service which i have already_recommended to family .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was so quick and simple - it took less_than 0 days from registering my old_phones to receive my money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_quibbles , no stress .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve already started recommending mazuma to all my friends !
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy way to make some money and get_rid of those old_phones in the house !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i placed the order on tuesday , the postage bag arrived on wednesday and i posted the phone that afternoon , email to say it had arrived on thursday 0pm , £_00 im my bank at 0 . 00pm on thursday_night .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sweet .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to use website , clear_instructions , found my phone quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i returned my phone by printing my own labels and payment was received promptly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it couldnt have been easier .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service pleased with payment , no hassle , easy to deal with and quick payment
Cell_phone_Recycling	the process overall only took four days , that included me requesting a pack to send my mobile to mazuma in the post , mazuma recieving my mobile , and then me recieving my chosen payment option in the post .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i think the service is fantastic , fast and reliable and i would definately_reccomend it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i could easily keep_track of my order on the website so i wasn ' t in the dark about the process and from the emails i recieved and information on the website , it explained everything i needed to know so the process was easy , stress_free and fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i can ' t believe_how quick and easy the process was .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thought there must be a catch ... there wasn ' t
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	recived phone day after posting .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then got 0 emails over the day updating me on my order and had the money in bank by 0pm the same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma_mobile twice now to sell 0 old_phones and i have found their website useful - they send confirmation emails that eased your mind , and kept you updated with the process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s good to know that my old_phones are going to use elsewhere , and the amount i have been paid has been good .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is definitely a service i trust and will_continue to use in future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have recommended this to my boyfriend and friends too , who have all benefitted from this service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great prices for working and non working phones , fast delivery of sales pack and cheques .
Cell_phone_Recycling	can not fault them in any way .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommend !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend these_guys any day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they pay the price quoted online , and paid me the same day they received my phone ( one day after posting it !)
Cell_phone_Recycling	they offered me a better price than most of their competitors , too - only one company beat them , but i needed the cash fast , so mazuma was my choice .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended , will_definitely use again at the end of my contract .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend mazuma to any one , i was very pleased with how fast the service was and would use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was recieved into my bank very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted phone thursday , full_amount quoted in my bank_account by saturday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fifty notes for an old phone with minimum hassle !
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to use site and very prompt payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phines in on monday and the money was in my account tuesday_afternoon !
Cell_phone_Recycling	wow that was quick !
Cell_phone_Recycling	also the prices are the best vie found online .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used this company and am absolutely happy about their transparent and helpful service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' m always very sceptical of reviews .
Cell_phone_Recycling	were they written by the company ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	will it be ok for me ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	well , i had no_problems whatsoever with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i looked at several sites , some of which offered a fair bit more money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	but since mazuma has been well advertised and seemed more ' legit ', i went with them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	valuation was easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the bag came the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i popped my phone in and sent it off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the next_day i had the money in my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	bosh !
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy_peasy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d have no_qualms about using them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve thought about selling my old_phones for a while now .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i chose mazuma due to their other positive_reviews and was pleasantly_surprised at how smooth the whole_process was !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ordered the envelope from them , that arrived a few_days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received an_email a few_days_later as a reminder ( which is lucky as i had forgotten !
Cell_phone_Recycling	), popped them in some packaging and took them to the post_office .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a couple of days_later i received an_email_stating that they had arrived , a couple of hours_later and another email letting me know that they had been tested and that the payment would be with me by the end of the day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	00_minutes later the funds were in my bank !
Cell_phone_Recycling	could not be_happier !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve sold a couple of phones to mazuma and have had brilliant service both_times .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the reply package arrived within a couple of days of placing the orders and the money was in my bank_account within a day of them receiving it in their office .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a little concerned when i read the small_print , that when they receive your phone they may not pay the full price if they find any_issues with it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however , i needn ' t have worried as i received the full quoted amount .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole transaction was so easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they sent me an envelope , i popped the phone into it and posted it to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they emailed me to tell me it had arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they emailed me again to say that they had processed it and would pay me the full_amount on a specifed date via my chosen payment_method , paypal .... and they did !
Cell_phone_Recycling	perfect !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend to anyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	rubbish !
Cell_phone_Recycling	should have read reviews before using them !
Cell_phone_Recycling	after_reading reviews now it seems that others have had the same problem .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wonder_how many phones sent to them mysteriously go missing in the post ....
Cell_phone_Recycling	from start to finish , the process was simple and well explained .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the free post bag was a nice_touch as i never have a stamp so would normally not bother so is idiot_proof and great for the lazy person like me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the payment came quickly with an_email informing_me of its iminent arrival and the cheque cleared within_00hrs .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will be recommending this service to everyone
Cell_phone_Recycling	great !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick and easy to use and received my cheques very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	didnt get as much as i would have liked and 0 mobile we have didnt have any value but would recommend them :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	the process was very simple to complete and the credit was applied to the account quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my samsung_galaxy_s0 away for a guarantee price of £_000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however a few_days_later i was sent an offer of £_000 because the device tested faulty ( which it was not ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	in fact they had deducted over £_00 from the guaranteed price because of a very small crack on the corner of the device .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no where near the screen .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used to work in a phone shop and i know that this is classed_as slight cosmetic_damage not faulty .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i believe that a reduction of that much was unfair .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good service over all and very fast , however i won ' t be recommending them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this site is very simple to use , everything i wanted happened .
Cell_phone_Recycling	same day money transfered , good communication to summarise it up excelent site highly_recommended .
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything happened really fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	return packaging arrived next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	receipt of goods next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and payment ... next_day
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve collected a fair amount of ex - contract mobiles over the years , and having seen the catchy mazuma_mobile advertistment on tv i thought i ' d give the service a try .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i must comment on how extremely easy the whole_process was from start to finish , and how mazuma_mobile send you regular e_- mail updates as to where you order currently stands .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definately use their services again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cheekily sold my 0s the day before the announcement of the 0 and even after the prices dropped , they paid the higher amount when i sent my phone in 00 days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	prompt payment as well :-)
Cell_phone_Recycling	really fast had the cheque within 0 days from start to finish will_definately use this service again thankyou mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely fantastic service , received the pre_- paid envelope 0 days after requesting which contained a well explained and easy return procedure .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 days_later i received an_email_confirming my cheque had been sent out which i received the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely_recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s the easiest £_00 i have ever made !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	could not fault them in any way , they wher easy to use , quick on delivery and good with payment .

Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my phone into them perfectly_fine .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they send it back saying its faulty .
Cell_phone_Recycling	check my phone and the screen is completely damaged .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no compensation or anything .
Cell_phone_Recycling	joke of a company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	avoid
Cell_phone_Recycling	a lot_easier to use than i first expected .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received the money quickly too !
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definitely use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent 0 phones off to envirofone , the response and service was fantastic , would highly_recommend this service thank_you
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was quoted £_00 for a faulty htc one .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone was clearly damaged and did not switch on .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was then offered £_00 after review .
Cell_phone_Recycling	although this might seem like a reasonable_price for a faulty phone , the value of a damaged htc one is far_greater than £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i proceeded to send the phone to mazuma who offered and paid the full £_00 after inspection .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone will be disassembled and used to repair other phones for reconditioning and resale .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i do not recommend envirofone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i feel_like they were knowingly trying to hugely undervalue the phone and the more recent reviews from this site confirms that .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great prompt service , good communication of updates and swift processing of payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used envirofone several_times now and have never been disappointed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 ***** i love it
Cell_phone_Recycling	best service ever .
Cell_phone_Recycling	gave me a great price for my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted phone back on friday and money was in my account on monday_morning
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent communication and service was so much faster_than_expected , would definitely_recommend !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	selling my phone to mazuma was so much_better_than trying to sell it on ebay .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got a great price , the postage was free and it was all done and the money in my account in 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was amazed at the speed at which i was able to sell my phone to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they sent me the bag and documentation within a day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then sent my phone the following_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was kept_updated at every_stage , via e_- mail , about the progression of my order .
Cell_phone_Recycling	before i knew it , the money was in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely_recommend to everyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great stuff .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was very quick and straight to the facts .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i compared the price offered to other comparitable websites and mazuma_mobile was by_far the best .
Cell_phone_Recycling	personally i used the bank_transfer method of payment and only had to wait a couple of days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would absolutely recommend mazuma to anyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sold my phone on the 00 . 00 . 00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was received on 00 . 00 . 00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it successfully passed_testing on 00 . 00 . 00 and the payment line reads " your payment was sent to you on 00 . 00 . 00 at 00 . 00 "
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have checked my bank_account every day for the £_000 owed to me and on the 0th working day thought something funny was going on .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i decided to email envirophone only to be told i am not receiving the payment until 00 . 00 . 00 , 0 weeks after i started this whole_process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will never use this company again , i will be telling everyone i know not to use them and if i hadnt been working all the time would have sold it on the high_street and got the money the same day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i asked for the phone back and was told i could not receive the phone back as the payment has already been sent !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	so in summary they have my phone and they have my money !
Cell_phone_Recycling	utterly disgusting company !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process from start to finish was very quick , this is the second time i have used mazuna and would definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent
Cell_phone_Recycling	tried others and was not impressed but mazuma was a no nonsense effecient way of going about selling my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will recommend and use again and again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would highly_recommend this company to anyone who wishes to sell their phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick , efficient service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted phone one day and received payment the following night , you couldnt ask for more for this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	used a few ' recycling_companies ' over the past_year or so and can definately day mazuma is by_far the best .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a good price for my iphone_0gs , posted phone ( by special delivery ) and got same day payment the next_day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	amazing !
Cell_phone_Recycling	most other recyclers took about 0 - 0 days to pay and when they did , it took 0 days for their payment to clear in my account .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d half considered sending it to o0 because that ' s who i was with and they offered slightly more , however , i read some reviews which all said that o0 turn_around and offer you a much lower_price when they receive the handset so i didn ' t bother .

Cell_phone_Recycling	sold my galaxy_s0 for argos_vouchers , safe and securely with a free special delivery service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received confirmation e_- mail and passed test e_- mail next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received my gift_card in 0 working_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole transaction took less_than a week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after receiving my welcome_pack through the post on saturday i then posted my phone back to mazuma on monday_morning .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was made to me tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	could not believe_how quick the process was .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my phone was in perfect working order when it left - however , mazuma claimed it was damaged and not working on arrival to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	on top of this , i opted for argos_vouchers .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i did not receive vouchers , but a card which needs a 0000 number to be called to activate it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am profoundly deaf and unable to use a telephone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i merely use my mobile for texting instead of using a conventional phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they now have my mobile and i am unable to activate my cards - so i have lost out .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i won ' t use again .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i recieved an e_- mail the day after i sent the phones off just saying my phones had been recieved and to expect payment in the next two days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i choose to give my bank_details and sure enough two days_later the money was in my bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you do not want to give your bank_details there is the option to just get a cheque sent to you , but as you can guess it would take longer to get the money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	all in all it was every quick and easy to do and if i will no doubt do it again when i get a new phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website was really easy and helpful .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it took literally minutes to sell my old phone and 0 day after a weekend to receive the return pack .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definately use this service again in the future and will recommend this site to anyone who is selling an old_mobile phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast payout , no hassle , used many_times before .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as stated on their website , as soon as they recieve the phone they pay you the agreed amount .

Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you :-)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i looked around at a few mobile recycle sites , and thought i ' d go with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent of for a postage pack which arrived within two days , i posted the pack on the friday and by monday the money was in my account and it was the amount i was told , alot of sites give you less money when they actually receive the phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great company , great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	000_% recommended
Cell_phone_Recycling	i almost sent my phone to envirofone for about £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fortunately , i used a price comparison site and fonebank offered me almost_double .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my phone off with the paid envelope and the money was transferred over quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	found the process really easy and would deffo recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i like the fact that if they dont think phone is worth what was quoted they send it back :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had my reservation about sending off a phone with the promise of money ( good money ) being paid to me , i needn ' t have worried .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole proses was easy and efficient , less_than 00hours from looking at the website to receiving funds .
Cell_phone_Recycling	one piece of advice though , post the phone special delivery , it will cost £ 0 . 00 but in my opinion worth is .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a friend send his standard royal_mail and it got lost in the post , and was left out of pocket .
Cell_phone_Recycling	special delivery is insured for up to £_000 and guaranteed next_day with a receipt .
Cell_phone_Recycling	incredibly surprised how well everything went , i was prepared for a bit of a haggle with mazuma over the price of my phone but they sent me an_email a day after i posted my phone saying a check had been posted for me for the exact amount i was quoted and the check turned_up the very next_day , very impressed , thank_you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was quick and easy to use and the entire transaction was smooth and efficent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the pack to send in my old phone arrived earlier_than i expected it to , and the money was in my bank_account the day after i posted it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a great price for my nokia mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma were extremely quick in paying me - was very impressed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i provided my details to mazumba mobile online on a sunday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received the postage bag on the tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted the mobile wednesday_afternoon and the money was in my account by the thursday - excellent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault at all !
Cell_phone_Recycling	hey there !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!....
Cell_phone_Recycling	the overall experience was awesome , fast response & so efficient !!!.
Cell_phone_Recycling	i first heard of mazuma_mobile services on a tv ad that i had watched , i thought to myself " why don ' t i give it a go " since i have a few non - working mobile_phones laying around , why not trade it in for quick cash .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so i did .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have never seen or heard of a fast response service that keeps to its word .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve even got my friends talking_about it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	awesome stuff , quality reassurance , customer friendly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the 0nd time i ' ve used mazuma and the service was very quick and easy both_times .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use mazuma again
Cell_phone_Recycling	even if got less money then i would of got from others providing the same service ... i wanted a hassle_free transaction without unwanted surprises and it was exactly how i expected it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you !
Cell_phone_Recycling	prompt payment
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely_brilliant service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	so quick , the money was in my account before i even knew about it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they also offered the best price for my handset .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definately be using again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	without any doubt , i recommend this to everyone out there
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was looking around to trade in my phone and found a site that offered me £_000 i looked up reviews on the site and so many people complained about them saying they never recieved the full_amount , so i decided to trade in with mazuma for £_000 instead and i ' m_glad i did i applied online recieved the pack a couple of days_later sent out my phone and within about 0days of applying on the site i had £_000 in my bank_account !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	more_than impressed !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	my advice would be if your looking around for the best trade - in price for what may seem maybe £_00 more you ' ll get a much_better deal and service with mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	as an untrusting , paranoid cynic , i ' d read reviews and looked at the small_print .
Cell_phone_Recycling	other_websites quoted various percentage deductions based on the phones condition .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mine was in reasonable condition , but had its fair_share of scratches .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma_mobile was straight_forward , honest with price and fast with the payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	faultless .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phone on saturday_afternoon and got the money for it on monday_morning .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they also offered the highest amount for it , so couldn ' t have chosen a better company !
Cell_phone_Recycling	typed in handset details and got an instant quote , bag came a couple of days_later - in it goes and bye_bye .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money in my account almost the next working day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy , reliable - able to track throughout .

Cell_phone_Recycling	was very happy and am looking_forward to spending my vouchers !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i popped my two phones in the post ( i did through the post_office to get proof of posting ) and got the money transferred into my account on the next working day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so simple and fast to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only thing is the post bag , postage is paid but the bag has no protection for the phones so i wrapped mine in a little left over bubble_wrap just to make_sure they did not get damaged on the way .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very good service would use again .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phone special delivery and then between 00am and 0pm the following_day had four emails , two confirming the receiving and processing of my phone then the other two about the payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	there were no_quibbles at any point about the amount i was to be paid it was just put straight into my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	all in all from posting to receiving the money i would say it took about 00_hours and it ' s fair to say i was extremely impressed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma were great , fast , easy and hassle_free .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend to anyone .

Cell_phone_Recycling	whole_process from start to finish is seamless .
Cell_phone_Recycling	customer support is great !
Cell_phone_Recycling	always some one willing to help .
Cell_phone_Recycling	recommended to any doubters that are thinking of using any other similar company .

Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the 0th or 0th time i have used mazuma and yet again they deliver a hassle_free , easy to use service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i always recommend to friends and family !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i simply typed in my details and a pack arrived in 0 days at my door with a pre_- paid bag to send my phone back in as well as clear_instructions as to how to pack my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone itself was , for lack of another word , fucked and they still paid a fair amount for it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you very much mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	i decided to enquire_about mazuma , after i accidentally caused a bleed in my phone due to dropping it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i hadn ' t owned my phone for very long and was gutted at what happened .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my phone was valued at £ 0 . 00 by mazuma in it ' s current condition .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and had it not been broken and still in working order would have only been valued at a mere £ 0 . 00 !
Cell_phone_Recycling	not recommended as devices are valued far too poorly , unless you are not really concerned at the amount offered for your phone , and would just at_least like to recieve ' something ' for it , however little .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was very happy with the service from mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i intially went to envirophone and despite only having the hanset only a month brand_new they tried to claim it had some damage and cut their offer by half !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was absoloutely appalled .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i requested it back and sent it off to mazuma instead .. they had it the next_day and i had the full payment in my account that day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_qualms , no questions :), just a good honest service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was very pleased with service provided by mazuma_mobile . so quick money straight on my account very pleased .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got my phone valued on the monday got my envelope to post it on the tuesday which i did that afternoon got a confirmation e mail on the wednesday and as i chose a bank_transfer got my money in my bank that day absolutely_brilliant service !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	to start i had reservations_about sending my mobile off , but these were to be short lived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma mobiles customer_service was simply outstanding .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and the most_important thing ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	the full_amount originally_quoted for my phone was in my account the same day i received confirmation from the post_office that they had received the handset !
Cell_phone_Recycling	best price i could find , quick delivery of post pack and transferred the money to me quickly too .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend this shop to anyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	gave me a fair price for my phones , reviewed them straight_away and sent payment very fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no bad points at all !
Cell_phone_Recycling	loved it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	:)
Cell_phone_Recycling	having not heard of money for your phone my wife was apprehensive_about using them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however they were offering the best price so i went for it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got the free postage envelope quite quickly and sent my phone away .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend using recorded_delivery for security although i myself did not use this .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received an_email to say they had my phone and quickly received another to say it had been tested .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was given a date fro payment which wasn ' t too long a wait and it went in as they said with no issues .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i am selling my old phone from last 0 year ' s on the net and this is one of the best website who deal every cases very quick and efficiently .
Cell_phone_Recycling	nb : their is lot ' s of company who buy old phone and pay you bit more then mazuma_mobile , but when the pay time come you find out they are scam or making delay with the paymeny , so pleas read the review before you chose whom to sell your old_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	koney
Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault the service from start to finish payment made withing hours of them receiving my old phone
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma were to be frank , absolutely_brilliant .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i had no_problems at all with them , i was sent a postage pack the next_day , i posted my phone and 0 days_later i was sent the cash straight into my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma offered me the most money for my old phone , a blackberry 0000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	everywhere_else ( pawn shops etc ) were only offering my £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend this service to anyone_wanting to sell an old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	unless it is in perfect_condition where ebay is an option , mazuma is brilliant .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent in an old phone to mazuma and it was quoted at £ 0 because it was very old but i wanted it to be recycled and put towards a good cause rather_than me throwing it in the bin .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i requested the freepost_bag and 0 or 0 days_later it arrived swiftly in the post and i packaged the phone safely along with its paperwork and sent it back to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	two days_later i received confirmation that the phone had been processed and received .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast and effecient service and i am very pleased with how effectively the whole setup worked .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definitely be using again in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very simple to use and follow step by step instructions that are shown on the screen at all times
Cell_phone_Recycling	made me a realistic offer for the phone which admittedly was quite old , and paid the money direct into my account within about 0 days i think .

Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy , no hassle got exactly_what i was promised !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i think they are great !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma was great , free postage bag sent out immediately and the return was smooth and money in the bank 0 days_later , very pleased
Cell_phone_Recycling	i did a lot of research into all the different companies that offer this service and for several key reasons mazumamobile came out on top .
Cell_phone_Recycling	- the website was easy to use
Cell_phone_Recycling	- they accept broken phones too ( i had my old iphone_0gs that would not turn on and still got £_00 !
Cell_phone_Recycling	).
Cell_phone_Recycling	- i sent my phone of with their pre_- paid envelope and they emailed me to say they had received it the next_day and by tea time i had the money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	- the price was not the best but it was less by only a couple of pence and considering everything else there is a value attached to peace of mind that puts them back on top again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	envolop was delivered quickly , and money came through very quickly , very good service , would use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	opted for payment via_bacs transfer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	notifications were prompt and payment arrived within agreed time .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a really good experience using mazuma , i was offered £_000 for my iphone_0g on monday , delivery envelope was received on tuesday and i had received my cheque for £_000 by saturday .

Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wanted to sell my old sony_ericsson k000i phone , but was unsure what to do with it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then i saw the tv adverts and said , i must get around to doing that - post my phone off and get money in return .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i chose envirofone over the others as they gave the better price and looked a better company to deal with .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was not wrong .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i registered online , entered my details and found my phone using the imie number ( by the battery ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	the next_day i got a padded_envelope and a sticky address label ( postage paid ) to post my phone off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got an_email a few_days_later saying , they had tested my k000i and was working and would post a cheque out to me in a few_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got the cheque and letter for envirofone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a brilliant service and i would highly_recommend .

Cell_phone_Recycling	best phone_recycling company there is !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be telling all my freind and family

Cell_phone_Recycling	it took a little longer_than i thought but i got the money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sorry for bad review
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to use website , simple process to post off my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fab communication at every_step of the way via emails .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very speedy bank_transfer !
Cell_phone_Recycling	all in all faultless ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	my only worry is with royal_mail .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i made sure i posted my device special delivery for insurance level purposes .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am very disappointed with the service which i received from this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used them many_times in the past however , on this occasion has changed my opinion i sent off a perfectly working phone with no damage !
Cell_phone_Recycling	however i was told this arrived with a cracked_screen !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	the fact they only give you a pathetic jiffy_bag and if dropped or chucked around by royal_mail can damage the goods i get penalised for it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	- what a joke so i was forced to accept a small amount for the phone or they return the damaged which has no value to me now .
Cell_phone_Recycling	secondly i wrote an e_- mail expressing my feelings as i disagree that i should be deducted the damage incurred through postage they haven ’ t even replied - what great service i re - sent the e_- mail 0 days_later as their auto response said a response within 00_hours and still no reply .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i put a read receipt on and a person called kayko ( or something like that read it and clearly just ignored it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have spoken to many people and this too has happened to them !
Cell_phone_Recycling	watch out as you won ’ t get what they offer you because apparently it will be damaged !
Cell_phone_Recycling	take photos of phone before sending to any phone place !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was kept_informed at every_stage of process
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick sending of envelope and final cheque
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a good price for item , reflective of age and condition
Cell_phone_Recycling	would reccomend !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	00 hour turn_around from posting to payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone away special delivery with an envelope provided and they paid money in to my account next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_messing_about !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma provided a fast and efficient service exactly as_described on their website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got the money exactly on the same day !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	keep up the good work !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you mazumamobile !
Cell_phone_Recycling	found six old_phones in my draws , sent them over and got over £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	registered , input phone details and waited for the packaging to arrive to post the phone in .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got the packaging a day later and decided to wait for the beginning of the week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i put my phone in a padded jiffy_bag then put it in the main parcel bag and took it to the post_office so i could track it and it was insured for upto £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the following_day i got a email_saying they had received it and it had been processed and i should expect the money within 00_hours , a few hours_later i had the money in my bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received a email 0 minute after they sent me the email_saying the order was complete saying they sent me a payment confirmation_email_saying they transfered the money via faster_payments .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this was much faster then i thought and they were the second highest price on the internet , the highest website didn ' t look very good and got alot of bad_reviews .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be using mazuma again in future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very good company , professional and never let you down , i am such a happy customer i ' ve sent 0 phones off in the space of 0 years .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recommend this service to anyone who_wants to sell their phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the money was in my account 0 days after posting mine !
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted phone to them and received the full money in my account the following_day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was a very easy service to use and i would recommend this to a friend or family or anyone that would want to have a quick and easy way of selling their old_mobile phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you mazuma_mobile !
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick transaction , the whole_process , from booking the order online , to receiving the money in my bank took about 0 days !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very impressed , i wish i had more old_phones to sell !
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service , got the money very quickly and got the amount my phones were valued at .
Cell_phone_Recycling	was very pleased i was able to make money from my broken phones !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was really happy with mazuma as it was all done so quick and easy and its exactly how its advertised so have no_complaints and completely_satisfied
Cell_phone_Recycling	great prices , easy to navigate website & fast response .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the only problem is that the packages sent out for delivery are sometimes too small .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the same size of package is sent out for six phones as well as ten phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it can be a tight squeeze sometimes .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was not the first time i used mazuma service and again they proved to be nothing less_than excellent really simple and speedy process no hassle at all .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will_definitely use it again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was excellent loved it :) thank_you x
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sell a used blackberry 0000 for £_00 which is reasonable given the speedy process in mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	does what it says on the tin , yeah you could get more on ebay ... but try selling a mobile on ebay !
Cell_phone_Recycling	impossible !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	no end of nigerian scammers bidding and not paying .
Cell_phone_Recycling	envirofone is easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received the best price with zoomfish , although i was a bit_wary as id never_heard of the company before - but i read some reviews which put my mind at rest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( which is why im doing a review myself , for others to read ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was fast , easy and just brilliant .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was kept_informed of progress and money paid into my bank very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant site !
Cell_phone_Recycling	can ' t fault mazuma at all .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had the return packaging at my home within 0 days of applying and my money in the bank within a week !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the instructions were simple and the whole_process very straightforward .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma were very quick and very reliable , i sent my phone off in the post and 0 days_later the money was in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i also sent another phone off to envirophone to which they said the phone has a slight air line crack in the camera lense to which they offered me under half of what they said i would be given this has happened twice now with envirophone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i dont reccomend any one uses them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	where as muzuma are fantastic ive tried them a few_times now and they are fast reliable and are exactly_what they say they are but a bit better .
Cell_phone_Recycling	defininatly use muzuma mobile !
Cell_phone_Recycling	u cant go_wrong .
Cell_phone_Recycling	im a very satisfied customer !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	as before , service excellent and very quick despatch of postage pack and payment same day handset arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they advertise on their site about fast payments - i decided it would be worth to take a much lower payment than walking around second_hand mobile shops as it would only take 0 - 0 days longer and i could just send it off rather_than walking around town .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however , i sent my phone on monday 0th_july and they emailed me 0 days_later to tell me i would be getting my money on the 00th_july .... 0 days from sending is not what i was looking for ....
Cell_phone_Recycling	there are companies that can turn this around alot quicker , i wouldn ' t of sent them my phone if i knew it would take this long - i didn ' t need to sell it if i couldnt get the money within 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	total scam .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am really happy with my deal , good prise , fast money transfer to bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent the phone on the saturday , and the money was in my account on monday !
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant !
Cell_phone_Recycling	so simple and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	within a day the package had arrived , i popped it in the post and a few_days_later a cheque came .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no questions_asked , just perfectly straight_forward
Cell_phone_Recycling	good value for money , very quick and hassle_free service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would defiantly recommend mazumamobile to a friend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very simple process and the full_amount initially quoted was cleared in my account the day after i sent my phone in .
Cell_phone_Recycling	recommended .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have now used mazumamobile twice and have enjoyed both experiences as they are fast and efficient , i have had no_problems what so ever .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would highly_recommend the service they provide .
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely no_complaints .
Cell_phone_Recycling	super - easy to do , they transfer money to your account very promptly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast and easy way of making a few_quid for old_mobiles ya find laying about your house !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ll be using this service and recommending it to others , thank_you :-_d
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to use , good price paid for phone , and funds were in my account the day after i posted the phone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	though you may not get as higher price paid using ebay , there are no fees ( postage is free ) and it ' s hassle - free , no need to spend time creating an advertising page or dealing_with scammers .
Cell_phone_Recycling	recommended !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i registered on saturday , by the monday the envelope and details for posting arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i popped the phone back in the post as instructed and within_00hrs the money was being paid to my bank directly .
Flowers	so sunday came , no flowers , how very embarassing , and disappointing for my mother , when they did arrive they were already bloomed & starting to die .
Flowers	i contacted customer_service who ignored my emails , until they recieved 0 emails from me theye eventually replied .
Flowers	the reply was rude , & with numerous grammatical errors .
Flowers	they refused me a refund because i used a voucher_code ( which they gave me when i received flowers from them ).
Flowers	i suggest they dont give customers voucher_codes if they dont want to accept them !
Flowers	i would never use them again , too expensive for the few flowers you get , and very poor delivery service !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	ordered at 00am the flowers were delivered by midday - fantastic !
Flowers	i ' ve used serenata a few_times and have always been impressed with the punctual nature of the service though of late i ' ve taken time to read the emails and had to chuckle to myself .
Flowers	i would gladly use them again and i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend them to other people .
Flowers	a top_class service with a dash of humour thrown in .
Flowers	ordered flowers online from iflorist nothing showed up , they offered another redelivery and voucher but still dissapointed
Flowers	great fresh flowers every time !
Flowers	plus the delivery has never let me down after using these twice now !
Flowers	would definately_recommend .
Flowers	i ordered as a thank_you gift , the price for the amount of flowers was very reasonable and the bouquet beautiful .
Flowers	from order placement to delivery the communication was excellent and highly personalised to my order .
Flowers	all was delivered without a hitch and both myself and the recipient are delighted .
Flowers	many_thanks .
Flowers	i ordered the flowers the night before for my nan and they arrived as promised the next_day .
Flowers	she was so pleased with them for her_birthday and said that they were really unusual and beautiful !
Flowers	i ordered aztec sun flowers .
Flowers	thank_you so much !
Flowers	well i ordered some flowers for my fellow business owner ' s studio launch as a " good luck " not a problem for saturday delivery .
Flowers	however , 0 :_00pm i recieved a telephone call to state that they were unable to deliver the flowers , and they could try again for monday .
Flowers	unfortunately her launch party was today ( saturday ) and not monday .
Flowers	disappointment is an_understatement , i am so unbelievely upset that something nice i was trying to do for someone is completely thrown back into my face - they can offer me a refund , which is fine , but it doesnt rectify the situation .
Flowers	or the poor service .
Flowers	if they had called me earlier this morning , then i may have been able to find someone_else to deliver them .
Flowers	i will never order via these_guys again .
Flowers	flowers speak volumes , for once she was lost for words !
Flowers	placed an order days in_advance !
Flowers	was not delivered on time .
Flowers	family now thinks i do not care and took some convincing that i did make plans for stuff to be delivered .
Flowers	i am mortified that i had to make excuses for something i was prepared for !
Flowers	their customer_service dept is horrible .
Flowers	cant phone them , just this silly online thing .
Flowers	it took me throwing my toys to get a delivery charge refund !
Flowers	i will not recomend this company !
Flowers	please go to interflora !
Flowers	much_better !
Flowers	nice flowers delivered very fast .
Flowers	unfortunately no email was sent to confirm the order had been received , and the invoice is sent as a pdf attachment , which is much less convenient than just having the details written in the email .
Flowers	right , to set the scene - i had this date lined up with an absolutely_stunning girl and thought flowers were the perfect present .
Flowers	sadly this was not the case .
Flowers	now i ' m no connoisseur of bouquets , so i had no_idea of the quality .
Flowers	sadly the girl was a bit more educated in floristry than i .
Flowers	she took one look at these flowers and cried , and proceeded to throw them back in my face before legging it .
Flowers	her final words ?
Flowers	' not even a bee would go near those '.
Flowers	and that was it ...
Flowers	i believe this awful bouquet i received cost me my first choice wife .
Flowers	no but seriously , they were not the bouquet i was expecting by any stretch of the imagination , and i ' ll be using another florist in the future .
Flowers	my partner was very happy when she received the flowers and them red_roses were absolutely beautiful .
Flowers	i can only say thank_you serenata and i will_definitely use your service again
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my mother for mothers_day , received an_email_stating they will arrive on saturday .
Flowers	it didn ' t arrive on saturday hoped they will deliver on sunday .
Flowers	i waited and waited it never arrived !.
Flowers	i am so angry and disgusted , i will never order from iforist again , and will ensure i spread the word how unprofessional this company is .
Flowers	the fact i constantly receive e_- mails to remind me of what florist company i will never use again is annoying , the one time i attempted to use iflorist the delivery failed at first - basically it wasn ' t delivered at the desired date and time , so i contacted the company , not by phone to speak to a person , but by email , which is also ridiculous , surely the company has an office where someone can answer a phone ?
Flowers	the second attempt to deliver my flowers to my girlfriend also was forgotten about , so naturally i contacted the company once again .
Flowers	by this time the flowers were going to be a week_later than the desired date ( which wouldn ' t really have impressed my girlfriend , being one week after her_birthday ) therefore i demanded a refund , the only thing the company successfully achieved during this order .
Flowers	they took my money but never delivered .
Flowers	they have not replied to my emails and do not answer their phones !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	worst service i have ever received !
Flowers	avoid this company like the plague !!
Flowers	ordered 0 days ago still no delivery of valentines flowers that cost £_00 .
Flowers	rang twice and sent emails yesterday to get told they will be delivered !
Flowers	still nothing , and now they have closed the phone_lines !!!!
Flowers	order number 000000 !
Flowers	thanks for the great service !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered for next_day delivery , quick and easy to use service .
Flowers	no_hidden_fees .
Flowers	great communication all the way through from order to delivery .
Flowers	would recommend .
Flowers	i ordered 0 bouquets to give out to the mothers on my wedding day .
Flowers	they weren ' t the cheapest but i liked the fact they could be delivered to the venue without me having to physically go into a florist the morning of the wedding .
Flowers	i was shown the flowers before the wedding meal and i was extremely disappointed - not only did they already look half_dead there was barely any flowers actually in the bouquet - definitely not as many as was advertised on the website .
Flowers	i made the decision not to insult my parent / mother in law and told the venue to discard the flowers ( they really were quite pathetic looking ).
Flowers	i then sent one of my guests out to buy a nice bunch at the local_supermarket - cost half the price , were still alive and had a decent amount of flowers in it .
Flowers	i did contact serenata_flowers and they asked for images which i couldn ' t provide ( they basically got hidden behind a curtain out of embarrassment and i definitely didn ' t want to insult our parents by handing out such a crappy bunch of flowers and i didn ' t want to take them home with me either .
Flowers	they did turn_up when they are supposed to though - despite using the worst delivery company known to man ( yodel ).
Flowers	really bad_experience - would not recommend or use again .
Flowers	ordered flowers for delivery on monday , ( it now being wednesday ).
Flowers	after multiple messages to yodel to confirm the status of my package and countless assurances that my flowers would be delivered .
Flowers	i eventually contacted iflorist directly to only be cut_off in my first attempt to talk to an advisor and then only being offered a refund after being informed that yodel had in fact lost my package .
Flowers	despite talking to them that morning and them confirming that it shall be with me today .
Flowers	absolutely_terrible customer_service and well i can ' t really say anything about the flowers as they never arrived .
Flowers	avoid like the plague .
Flowers	i ordered a floral tribute for a funeral service last_week to be in the hearse and then placed outside with the other tributes .
Flowers	they were not in the hearse and did not arrive while we were at the service at all .
Flowers	myself and the other family_members are all witnesses to the fact that they were not there .
Flowers	as if this isn ' t bad enough , i have got in touch to obtain a refund and they are insisting that they were there and are at the crematorium for me to collect now ( a week_later !!).
Flowers	they have had me ringing the crematorium directly to check ( presumably because i ' m mistaken ???)
Flowers	and have fobbed me off on numerous_occasions regarding my refund .
Flowers	one week_later , still no refund .
Flowers	very upsetting and humiliating .
Flowers	don ' t entertain using them as they cannot be trusted and offer shocking customer_service .
Flowers	puntualidad en las entregas
Flowers	good service , nice flawers .
Flowers	i first used iflorist to send flowers to my sick mum in the usa , i have used other florists in the past but they are becoming so expensive and the choice of flowers are always the same .
Flowers	iflorist are a creative team who you can tell actually love their job by their posts on facebook .
Flowers	i have recommended you many_times to friends , sometimes it ' s good to search for better choices than stick to the ones that we know best .
Flowers	fab service :))
Flowers	i ordered the chocolate hamper for my mothers birthday , the order was placed 0 days in_advance .
Flowers	by 0 . 00 pm of the delivery day the hamper has still not been delivered .
Flowers	i have tried to contact the customer_service number provided on the webpage but it won ' t dial .
Flowers	i have contacted eflorist by email but have only received an_automated_response .
Flowers	i am completely disapointed with the service , and very embarrassed that my gift did not arrive .
Flowers	i wanted to get some flowers for a friend to brighten her day ; unfortunately , she lives in liverpool and i live in northamptonshire .
Flowers	i googled ' flower delivery liverpool ' to see if there were any local_florists nearby and came_across serenetaflowers which looked ace !
Flowers	i ordered the adore bouquet as she_loves red_roses and once they arrived i received a lovely text from her thanking me .
Flowers	she says they were absolutely beautiful !
Flowers	i ' ll definitely use this service again , thank_you !
Flowers	so it was my mother - in - law - to - be ' s birthday .
Flowers	i ' d already decided i needed to get her some flowers but i could leave the house due to having to wait for building regulations guys to come check out the work done on our house .
Flowers	i placed the order around 00am and , guess_what ?
Flowers	the delivery girl was knocking on my door by 0pm !
Flowers	i was absolutely amazed at how quick and easy the service was .
Flowers	though the bouquets themselves plus delivery is a bit much pricewise , i ' m still impressed at the service and will most_likely use again !
Flowers	vackra blommor levererade i tid
Flowers	very reasonable prices and speedy_delivery .
Flowers	gorgeous flowers .
Flowers	would recommend to others and definitely will be using again .
Flowers	it ' s now 00days later , still nothing .
Flowers	asked for a refund but hasn ' t arrived and i doubt it will after_reading the other reviews .
Flowers	total_con .
Flowers	i live in america and my mom lives in england .
Flowers	i am never able to have flowers delivered to her due to the high prices i am usually presented with online .
Flowers	i ' m really glad i found this place !!
Flowers	i was able to send her a very nice bouquet of chrysanthemums and chocolates for an extremely reasonable_price , with free shipping !
Flowers	she was overjoyed with them and said they were lovely .
Flowers	i used the chat customer_service twice , and while i can ' t remember the names of those who helped_me they were very efficient .
Flowers	i also liked the fact that they emailed me to notify me that the flowers had been delivered .
Flowers	thank_you , i will_definitely be using your services again !
Flowers	i purchased some flowers from serenata for mother ' s day and paid premium for sunday delivery .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn ' t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn ' t as special .
Flowers	when my mother opened the box , the flowers were on their side and looking really limp and fragile .
Flowers	the pot with some wadding in was bone dry and it seemed as though the flowers had been in the box for some time .
Flowers	when paying so much this is not acceptable .
Flowers	i wouldn ' t use serenata_flowers again .
Flowers	we have just returned from our_wedding in cyprus and used silk_blooms to purchase our flowers .
Flowers	the service we received from the beginning has been fabulous , mara would do anything to help you ( i kept adding on bits and bobs up to the last_minute ) and nothing was a hassle for her .
Flowers	our flowers travelled perfectly to cyprus and back to scotland .
Flowers	i would use silk_blooms again and would thoroughly_recommend them to anyone !
Flowers	ordered a bouquet of roses , lilys and sunflowers for my mum on mothers_day , selected the delivery date of mothers_day .
Flowers	recieved email the day before mothers_day stating they would be delivered today ?!
Flowers	this was obviously not what i wanted so i contacted them ( have not yet recieved a reply to the first contact i made ).
Flowers	saturday_morning the flowers arrived at my mums house , mothers_day she opened them .
Flowers	what had arrived was a disgusting bunch of yellow and white carnations !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	now everyone_knows that carnations are probably the cheapest flowers available .
Flowers	i used to work in a florist and so know this too well !
Flowers	my mum hates carnations !
Flowers	so do i and had i known this is what would be classed_as the subsitute for a bunch of gorgeous roses , lillys and sunflowers .
Flowers	i would never had ordered in the first place !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i contacted i florist on mothers_day to voice my disgust ... 0 days_later no reply ... contacted them again saying i have now sent two emails and recieved no reply .... no reply for another 0 days !
Flowers	contacted them again ... no reply !
Flowers	finally after two_weeks i recieved a generated message which must be sent to all saying they are sorry and value customer feedback ( which they dont ) i replied to this message again saying how i am not happy both with the deleivery date , the flowers , their service , basically everything about them !
Flowers	didnt receive a reply for another couple of days !
Flowers	then finally i am offered " a maximum gesture of £ 0 . 00 voucher " which is obviously no use to me as i will not ever use them again !
Flowers	i am still in the process of actually recieving a reply that is from a real_person ... looking exactly at my case and not just copying and pasting their ready made responses to complaints !
Flowers	i sent pictures of the flowers i had received but this has not been mentioned at all .
Flowers	the proof is there , just wish i could upload the pictures on here somehow to show you all .
Flowers	please do not use them - they will ruin whatever occassion you are sending them for and then do not even bother to reply to your complaint unless you do all the chasing .
Flowers	there are so many other genuine and caring florists available with great prices that wont let you down ... use them not iflorist !
Flowers	i ordered a premium service to have flowers delivered on mother ' s day .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on a different day , altogether losing that ' special ' factor to the gift .
Flowers	like many people on here , i ordered mother ' s day flowers for delivery to france last_week .
Flowers	despite numerous_calls and reassurances , no flowers were ever delivered .
Flowers	they are now " looking into it ".
Flowers	i have asked for a refund - according to my consumer_rights , if a delivery date was agreed ( which is was ) and the goods have not arrived by that date , that is a breach of contract and you can request your money back .
Flowers	i have been told someone will call me back in the next three days !
Flowers	i have reported this company to watchdog and would advise any other uk citizens to do the same .
Flowers	they cannot be allowed to get away with this awful service !
Flowers	ps you will notice after how every bad review there are a flurry of 0 star ones , all sounding quite alike !
Flowers	apparently iflorist have already been investigated for posting their own excellent reviews .
Flowers	i received a tin vase worth less_than £ 0 when i was meant to receive a vase that i paid £_00 . 00 for with my purchase of flowers .
Flowers	i contacted the complaints centre and offered to return this vase as it was clearly worth less_than was advertised .
Flowers	however all i received were some cut and paste replies from the company that completely denied any wrong doing .
Flowers	i ' ve sent three responses to this email over a period of three_weeks and have received no reply from them at all - what horrendous customer_service .
Flowers	i shall now be reporting them to the office of fair_trading for misleading marketing .
Flowers	absolutely deceitful and awful company - do not use !
Flowers	hi , im a student and wouldnt normally_write a review .
Flowers	i ordered for valentines and no delivery , and tried to contact with this company via_email and phone_calls , no response , i spent 00 . 00 on ordering from this website , and not only did they change my delivery date to the 00th ( after clearly having a confirmation_email_saying 00th_feb ) they failed to deliver on this date as well .
Flowers	if you were honestly considering ordering please do not order !!
Flowers	i normailly ignore bad_reviews on the internet thinking it was customers being fickle .
Flowers	do not order , do not order !!
Flowers	please tkae ym advice .
Flowers	arrived on the chosen date and my mum really liked them
Flowers	i just got a phonecall from my frail , upset grandma after she received a valentine ' s rose from me a day too_late , which was headless with dying leaves .
Flowers	she didn ' t want to tell me about it and had been wrestling with her conscience before calling , leaving her very stressed and confused .
Flowers	the customer_service assistant i finally got through to on the phone was very kind and apologetic , and offered a refund at once , but this really shouldn ' t have happened in the first place .
Flowers	terrible experience .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for next_day delivery .
Flowers	they looked nothing like how they were presented on the website .
Flowers	certain flowers were missing and some much smaller_than represented .
Flowers	they wilted after a few_days and did not last the 0 days guaranteed .
Flowers	when contacting them i they were not prepared to refund even with photographic_evidence and i was unable to obtain a refund even when submitting a dispute through paypal .
Flowers	overall i was very unsatisfied and would not recommend tele florist or eflorist !

Flowers	the webpage is easy to use and great for any given occasion .
Flowers	from the first moment you start to build your shopping_cart everything is simple .
Flowers	the follow - up emails that i received with a little sense of humor were a nice_touch even when there are so many of them .
Flowers	at one point i received three 00_%_discount emails for the same order .
Flowers	the only one and huge problem is the product itself .
Flowers	not only did i order a beautiful mix of flowers that looked awesome on your webpage but i order the deluxe version .
Flowers	and what i find out is that the person who received the flowers was delivered the vase the flowers and the balloon all separate and also there were just a handful of flowers .
Flowers	everything from the logistics planning to the customer_service follow - up are great ways to satisfy the customer , but if your product doesn ' t at_least fulfill your customer ' s expectations then the service as a hole will be lousy .
Flowers	i was trying to complain_about some flowers that i received yesterday from my son and his wife from serenata .
Flowers	they arrived with yellow leaves and looking quite dead looking and very sad .
Flowers	my daughter has made several_attempts to e_- mail photos and it keeps being rejected .
Flowers	not impressed !
Flowers	the link to reply with a photo has no way on the page to respond with a photo making a complaint impossible by seranata the comapny itself .
Flowers	it ' s very frustrating and costly trying to send photos by an i - phone ....
Flowers	i have found this company to be awful and in all my attempts to email a photo of the flowers has been rejected ... a complete_waste of my friday_evening trying to sort this out ... dont use this company
Flowers	really thrilled with the flowers , beautiful choices of bouquets and very speedy service .
Flowers	i liked the constant_updates by text so i knew when the flowers had been delivered etc .... only thing missing was the plant food .
Flowers	would definitely use again and recommend to others .
Flowers	not only do they fail to deliver valentines flowers as per their own 000_% satisfaction_guarantee , but they then switch the phones lines to a recorded_message so no one can get through to them and hide_behind facebook and twitter to respond to complaints .
Flowers	do not use ever .
Flowers	i recently_purchased a beautiful bunch of sympathy flowers for a close friend who is in mourning .
Flowers	as the property does not have a secure porch or external area , i requested that the flowers were left with a neighbour if there was no answer at the door .
Flowers	unfortunately this request was completely_ignored and i received a text alert stating that the delivery had been made and the flowers left ' securely at the front of the property '.
Flowers	i have no_idea where they were left but there is no accessible secure area at this property .
Flowers	not to mention the fact that the weather was appalling on the day in question , with heavy rain and winds , meaning that the flowers would be in no state to be fit for delivery .
Flowers	as it was , the flowers were never received , so i can only assume they were stolen or were delivered to the wrong_address .
Flowers	upon_receipt of the text alert , i immediately tried to make contact with your company and found it extremely frustrating that there was no telephone_number available .
Flowers	i therefore completed the ' contact us ' form and have received no correspondence since to give me any explanation or apology .
Flowers	well i ordered the bunch called wow as iv ordered them before for a friend and they arrived looking exactly as the picture .
Flowers	wow consistes of reds , pinks , purppless , green , yellow , orange roses .
Flowers	instead yesterday my little sister got delivered a aldi quality bunch of flowers consisting of yellow flowers mainly , a white carnation and a couple of purple flowers .
Flowers	awful colour match , awful substitutes not on the same value as the wow bunch at all iv requested a refund .
Flowers	another time i ordered from eflorist was mothers_day , i ordered sea breeze as it had gorgeous lilys and blue flowers .
Flowers	instantly when they arrived i was in shock , purple white and green weeds it appears is a suitable sustitute .
Flowers	had to quickly get online and ordered a beautiful bunch from serenata_flowers which where delivered exactly as they looked ( beautiful ) and were alot cheaper .
Flowers	eflorist said this was a suitable substitute .
Flowers	im only guessing the site is a con , offering gorgeous flowers and sending weeds
Flowers	disgusting vile service .
Flowers	they still_havent got back to me .
Flowers	hannah
Flowers	delivery service was brilliant , i recieved an_email on dispatch and also upon delivery , the flower was wonderfully presented !!
Flowers	the image does not do the actual product justice !!
Flowers	better_than i could of hoped for .
Flowers	after thinking i had received nothing today off my boyfriend , he rang and asked me if i ' d had a delivery .
Flowers	i said no and assumed they would be next door .
Flowers	after lot ' s of investigating we found them at number 0 - 00 houses out - on the doorstep !
Flowers	they had been delivered at 00am , i finally got them at 0pm - pretty_much dead !
Flowers	00 roses on valentines_day half_dead , especially after thinking he didn ' t care has left me and him upset !
Flowers	he works away during the week which makes it feel worse !
Flowers	i have tried_ringing them , i ' ve tried every number and each one just leaves a dead tone .
Flowers	please add me to your trading_standards letter - i ' ll be only too happy to complain !
Flowers	the service was quick and the website was easy to use .
Flowers	brilliant that delivery is free over mother day weekend .... thank_you thank_you thank_you x
Flowers	i wanted to surprise my wife at work and order the flowers from the site in the am for same day delivery ........ all now no delivery or response to emails .
Flowers	not even sure if i will get my monies back .
Flowers	i am truly disappointed and will not be using this service again
Flowers	please_note still_awaiting response from customer_services
Flowers	i am really really annoyed with the way the have dealt_with my order i ordered lilac and lime and got other order they cud have informed me really i wish i could have order something else i am really put of really put of
Flowers	better flowers from my two year_old picked from the park
Flowers	the only time you get a prompt response from this company is when you make your order , spend your money and possibly update your order .
Flowers	after that their customer_service is more or less non_existent .
Flowers	no contact number , ubless you have ordered with them and even then they dont pick_up the phone .
Flowers	i paid £_00 for flowers to be delivered in spain ( i live in england ) requested same day delivery .
Flowers	its now 0 days_later , i have recieved no confirmation of delivery email .
Flowers	i dont believe the flowers have got there .
Flowers	god_knows what i am going to do now .
Flowers	i should of just used [_external link_removed_] a like i was going to in the first place .
Flowers	thanks for the stress caused flora_queen .
Flowers	if you are happy to gamble with your money , like stressful situationsand generally like crap customer_service then please , use flora_queen .
Flowers	you have been warned !
Flowers	flowers where a gift to my nan for her_birthday and she loved them along with the little cake we included however they where delivered a day earlier_than requested when we kne she would not be in so nan had to go and collect them herself which wasn ' t great .
Flowers	simple ordering quick response from customer_service will now ditch interflora and use seranata , great value and my mother in law loved them !
Flowers	not only was i not able to place an order sucesfully via_paypal at the weekend ( apparently teething issues , which fine i can accept ), but the flowers that were delivered weren ' t even close to the image on the website .
Flowers	really don ' t bother , these were for my partners_birthday and i ' m so disappointed in the flowers
Flowers	wish i read reviews first ten i would of not brought from this company , i brought flowers from iflorist from my daughter to mum for mothers_day , first they were delivered earlyer then said , and when opening the box the flowers were all limp and the look like flowers you would buy from a garage fore court but at 00x the price and it came with a ballonoon which is a joke on its size , have left a email two days ago but they have not bothered to answer back .
Flowers	stay clear of this so called florist and tell your friends to .
Flowers	ik woon in engeland en wou bloemen bestellen voor mijn zus in amsterdam : de dienst was perfekt en de bloemen waren top kwaliteit !
Flowers	do not use !!!!!
Flowers	ordered for mother ' s day , confirmation order received to say it would be delivered on mothering_sunday .
Flowers	received an emai on the friday at 0pm to say they will be delivered on saturday .
Flowers	this is not mothering_sunday .
Flowers	called and spoke to a rude man , who told me it was better to receive them earlier then late or never at all !!!
Flowers	advised i won ' t get a refund .
Flowers	also then put down the phone on me .
Flowers	email sent to customer_services , which i ' m sure judging_by previous reviews might never be answered !
Flowers	had to explain to my mum why her surprise was now ruined , and why she now won ' t be getting any flowers at all .
Flowers	disgusted with the lack of customer_service given .
Flowers	do not use !!!!
Flowers	i am completely appalled at the whole situation , i have rang them three times now .
Flowers	all of those occasions i have spoken to poorly trained staff , who have never once apologised or offered any compensation .
Flowers	i have now ordered from interflora , a reputable company who i have used before .
Flowers	it goes to show a good price is too good to be true , because the service is shoddy .
Flowers	£_00 wasted , and £_00 i have been told apparently will be refunded when the " escalations team " reply to me , only if i refuse the delivery .
Flowers	which , isn ' t possible as its being delivered to a business address where my mum won ' t be on saturday !
Flowers	also advised that theres an option at checkout for gaurenteed sunday delivery .
Flowers	what a load of crap !
Flowers	i have gone_through the checkout_process again , and this option does not exist !
Flowers	useless .
Flowers	i will be reporting them to trading_standards , and i suggest looking elsewhere if you are considering buying from them .
Flowers	* updated on 00 / 00 @ 00 : 00 *
Flowers	just to update , i have had an_email from a manager stating that i didnt select gaurenteed mothers_day delivery , therefore will never get a refund .
Flowers	i have called , and asked the person on the phone to go through their process with me , as i cant see this option at checkout .
Flowers	when asked what website i was on , i told him iflorist . co . uk , he told me no thats the wrong one , you use m . iflorist . co . uk ( which i have checked now , and does have gaurenteed delivery option ) however , the usual iflorist . co . uk does not have this option .
Flowers	he told me i was lying , and that i needed to refuse the goods in order to actually get a refund , which i again told him was impossible , due to this being delivered to a business address and not a home address - so i have no control over who accepts it and who doesn ' t , as my mother wont be there today !!
Flowers	completely appalled with the service , so much for their no_quibble gaurentee !
Flowers	more like , take your money and run !
Flowers	i have reported them to the advertising agency , and will wait to be assigned a case manager for this .
Flowers	i will also be contacting_trading_standards first thing monday_morning .
Flowers	please_please_please do not use this company !
Flowers	they are a liability , and will not be in business for much longer if they operate like this .
Flowers	they are liars , and you will get a crap standard of service !
Flowers	save_yourself the time and money !
Flowers	emailed over a week_ago with a product enquiry , zero response .
Flowers	very poor ( non_existant ?)
Flowers	customer_service .
Flowers	i ordered a ' bouquet ' of roses for valentines_day for my partner .
Flowers	there was a change of plan on the day as i was working from home and i ' m_glad i was .
Flowers	my partner came in and told me she was thrown a box by the delivery driver who was rude and then she opened up to find some small stems with what looked like roses on the end .
Flowers	i was absolutely_disgusted with the product and delivery method .
Flowers	no where does it mention a delivery company will deliver these , not to mention ' in a box '....
Flowers	there was no effort made what so ever and the product was appalling .
Flowers	after complaining and sending 0 emails back and fourth .
Flowers	the company refuse to acknowledge what i am complaining_about and keep sending stupid responses to make there product sound amazing .
Flowers	part of the product is delivery and presentation to which no effort was made at all .
Flowers	the first thing they do is blame it onto the florist .
Flowers	no ... its not the florists fault !
Flowers	it is the fact the product does not match what is advertised on the website !!!
Flowers	image nor description .
Flowers	avoid this company with all means ..
Flowers	for £_00 i could of got a much_better bunch from asda and even £ 0 more_than what i paid would have given me an amazing bouquet from a florist and i know this through experience .
Flowers	i am now having to perform a chargeback through my card company .
Flowers	if i wasn ' t in when they were delivered , i probably would have got back to find the locks had been changed !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	update_: the roses are finally dead !!!
Flowers	well they didn ' t last long !!
Flowers	rip_off_merchants !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	thought this was a great website and overall service .
Flowers	was late in from work on the 0rd other flower websites would only allow to order until 0 for next_day delivery .
Flowers	your website till 00 was really useful and quite surprising you can still do to this time .
Flowers	flowers came well_protected packed and presented well .
Flowers	flowers themselves were very nice .
Flowers	delivery driver very pleasant .
Flowers	best of all was the funny emails i received as they had been sent and delivered .
Flowers	nice to go the extra_mile for a customer with things like that .
Flowers	made it a very pleasant buying experience .
Flowers	plus good price .
Flowers	defiantly recommend and would buy again .
Flowers	tom wells .
Flowers	i had ordered a bouquet of flowers and a box of chocolates to be delivered on my sister ' s birthday and on that day i got a message_stating that they had been delivered , but turned_out to be the opposite .
Flowers	not only did they not arrive , i had to ruin the surprise after asking my sister if she liked the flowers .
Flowers	how can you run a flower delivery business if you can ' t even send them at the promised date and time .
Flowers	never again !
Flowers	great service , quite fresh and lovely flowers .
Flowers	ordered it for my friends birthday and it was a surprise .
Flowers	she loved it but when i saw the greeting card i was disappointed .
Flowers	instead of nice greeting card which i paid for , it was the free card which was sent to her .
Flowers	it was too_late to do anything so i had to just deal with it and say nothing about it .
Flowers	i would definitely buy flowers again but would not trust with anything_else .
Flowers	received an_email_saying my flowers had been successfully delivered this morning , only to ring my girlfriend for her not to know what flowers i was talking_about .
Flowers	ruined the surprise and will now be looking for a refund unless they magically appear in the next few hours .
Flowers	extremely disappointed to say the least , i realise today is a busy day but i ordered two_weeks in_advance .
Flowers	will update if they appear ....
Flowers	i am very dissapointed with this website !
Flowers	its a total lie !
Flowers	i ordered flowers for a friend , i wanted somethig different but nice !
Flowers	they were flowers in a basket !
Flowers	but the ones delivered were absolutly crap !
Flowers	less flowers , looked messed not neat at all !
Flowers	they look nothing like what i had ordered , i paid decent money for quality not for something that looks crap , im very annoyed and will never be ordering flowers ever again from u ... sites like urs people should be able to trust !
Flowers	i want to put in a formal_complaint for the flowers that were delivered , i probably would have got a better service from morrisons ,!!!
Flowers	i came to serenata_flowers because i stupidly taught i would get my moneys_worth , i was just fobbed_off !
Flowers	ordered some flowers that were guaranteed for mothers_day .
Flowers	the flowers were never delivered .
Flowers	i spoke to customer_services and they called me a liar .
Flowers	this is unacceptable .
Flowers	i will never use them again and i would advise other people not to use them !
Flowers	delivery was very quick , although the driver did have to phone my partner to find her address , which spoilt the surprise somewhat - he could have phoned me or just checked google_maps etc ...
Flowers	also , the flowers looked fairly tired , which is a shame because at £_00 i ' d have expected better frankly .
Flowers	this is the second time i ' ve been disappointed with seranta ; i won ' t be using them again .
Flowers	ordered deluxe roses and lily bouquet 0pm and arrived at 0pm the next_day for free .
Flowers	my mother in law was over the moon and said they were really beautiful .
Flowers	very happy !
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	my flowers were not delivered on the day requested .
Flowers	when i complined they got back to me with a assurance of redelivery .
Flowers	i gabe them a second chance to deal with my order but they messed_up again .
Flowers	they keep forgetting ur order even after u complaint 000 times
Flowers	really not happy with this company i have sent so many emails about this and that i am getting sick of being ignored .
Flowers	the flowers was brown and dieing and not like the flowers on the picture and i never got the bubbly i order which cost me 00 . 00
Flowers	i spent £_00 . 00 on this company and got bad results never using this service again i have try calling emailing and calling the chat thing always offline got one email to send pictures as told and got nothing . i want a full_refund or i going take this further
Flowers	i ' m still_waiting for a response to my email or i will get trading standard '' s involve and watchdog
Flowers	it left my girlfriend speechless , so that ' s got to count for something !
Flowers	i was able to go on line with no difficulties , choose what i wanted and process within a short time .
Flowers	very user_friendly website .
Flowers	will be using it again soon !
Flowers	well firstly , this was meant to be a supprise , but the delivery failed as no access to the building , i questioned this , as the building is fully staffed from 0am - 0 :_00pm and had a reception with directions to deliver , i was told that the package was mis_- scanned and the driver came back and delivered the parcel within an_hour of my complaint .
Flowers	serenataflowers did a great job , flower are lovely and the girl i sent them too really really loves them , however her special supprise was ruined when i was forced to phone her before they eventually arrived to be on the lookout for a package .
Flowers	not happy with the delivery company .
Flowers	i ordered some flowers to be delivered to my parents who live in france for christmas .
Flowers	i was given a day and paid for them .
Flowers	they have never arrived !
Flowers	i have tried to contact them by phone and email .
Flowers	i was on hold for 00_mins with no answer - shocking customer_service !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i am really angry about this and would never recommend this company to anyone !
Flowers	totally disgusting !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	cant even get in touch with them to get a refund ................
Flowers	this is my second order with clare florist - order arrived on the specified day , in good condition .
Flowers	i would recommend this company without any reservations .
Flowers	dear christina
Flowers	email on may 00th :
Flowers	" dear christina ,
Flowers	thank_you for replying to our email .
Flowers	i have checked the details of your order and can confirm that the rose has been despatched form our rose nursery this week and will be with you very shortly if not already received . the tomato indigo rose is due to be sent the week commencing june 0 and will be received by the middle to the end of that week .
Flowers	please let me know if there is anything_else i can help you with .
Flowers	regards
Flowers	nathan timblin "
Flowers	nb : i called them directly a two days earlier and i was given different delivery dates , and the customer_service team admitted that my rose plant are already a week late .
Flowers	update on 00th_may : rose has not arrived and i ' m not counting that my tomato plants will be either .
Flowers	please could a member of sutton seeds contact me to arrange a refund asap .
Flowers	a very , very poor service .
Flowers	i ' m_afraid that i won ' t be using your services again in the future .
Flowers	ordered on the thursday , delivered saturday_morning as stated .
Flowers	quick response to my email enquiry , and very friendly tone .
Flowers	delivery driver very friendly too , which was refreshing !
Flowers	yet to give the flowers to the girl , but am sure she will be very please ;)
Flowers	thank_you very much !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	rich
Flowers	company kept me very updated on everything , from the time my order was made , till the point it was being dispatched and even to the point of where it had arrived .
Flowers	my girl arrived from work and saw a big bunch of roses , hasn ' t stopped playing with them since and telling_me how much she_loves them .
Flowers	i ' d suggest getting the bigger set of dozen roses , they can instantly fix any fight regardless how big it was
Flowers	great flowers .
Flowers	on time .
Flowers	good prices .
Flowers	also i once ordered an orchid from them and was mildly concerned_about a mail order plant from a species that often drops the flowers in 0 minutes and turns into a £_00 stalk .
Flowers	the arena_flowers one is immortal .
Flowers	it ' s still going strong !
Flowers	very pleased with flowers and had a very happy loved one who was so chuffed she sent me a photo of them !
Flowers	the flowers were gorgeous , however if i had not gone for a delux bouquet them i ' m not sure that there would have been enough in the bunch .
Flowers	delivery was very speedy , i placed my order on saturday_night for a monday delivery at no extra_cost and they arrived monday_morning , i received a text_saying they had been delivered .
Flowers	the only negative with the delivery is that my message said ' the flowers have been delivered and left securely at the front of the property ', i . e .
Flowers	had been left in a box on the front_door_step .
Flowers	overall great service and lovely flowers :)
Flowers	ordered flowers for my wife on behalf of our child for mothers_day .
Flowers	flowers arrived on the day ( at a charge ) in a box .
Flowers	on opening the box , the flowers were in , what can only be described , as a sad state .
Flowers	the roses were wilting with the head of one completely removed , the foliage was riddled with holes and chunks missing and remaining flowers looked dismal .
Flowers	the ' deluxe ' option was small .
Flowers	the 0000 number is constantly_engaged and their automated customer_service option fails to provide a response to any complaints made .
Flowers	biggest waste of almost £_00 , leaving myself and daughter thoroughly embarrassed .
Flowers	ordered flowers on friday for mother ' s day even paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to have them delivered on sunday due to living so far away from my partners mum , they waited in all day for them to be delivered and the flowers were a no show .
Flowers	called to complain and am still_waiting on hold 00_mins +
Flowers	i ordered flowers for mum ' s birthday and it was my first time ordering flowers online .
Flowers	the idea didn ' t sink that well until i actually had them delivered in perfect_condition .
Flowers	they were absolutely beautiful .
Flowers	not to mention the prices are reasonable too !
Flowers	i was quite anxious about the delivery , whether or not it will arrive on time ; but it arrived within 0 . 0 hrs after the despatching process was completed .
Flowers	overall , i was impressed with their service and would definitely_recommend it to flower lovers out there !
Flowers	i order my gf some flowers for valentines_day they turned_up but wasnt the right flowers i paid extra £_00 . 00 for luxury they suposed to have been valentine cupid with red_roses and lillies but wot i got was 00 red_roses and red berries i paid £_00 . 00 thinking they was going to be very good quality but i coud bought red_roses from the market for £_00 . 00 they are refunding me in 0 to 0 days but they said that on valentines_day so if i dont get refuded by next week i will be informing trading_standards dont buy from here total ripp off i coud get these better from interflora i will update when refunded
Flowers	ordered some flowers to be sent to my partner at her work for friday 00th_december .
Flowers	decided to choose the christmas kisses selection .
Flowers	ordering was quite straight_forward and with free delivery it seemed too good to be true ... well it was ....
Flowers	i decided to pay the extra £ 0 . 00 ish which stated ' guaranteed immediate email when flowers delivered ' as i thought well at_least that way i ' ll know everyone has gone_smoothly .
Flowers	well about midday i got a txt from my partner to say she had received that ...
Flowers	yet no ' guaranteed ' email which i paid the extra for !
Flowers	i emailed them ... no reply .
Flowers	i then got my ' guaranteed immediate email ' from them yesterday_afternoon to which i then forwarded this onto them stating they should at_least refund this charge to me .
Flowers	no reply .
Flowers	i went to visit my partner last_night and asked to see the flowers and oh my god iv never felt so embarrassed in my life !!
Flowers	they look nothing like the flowers i ordered .
Flowers	instead it ' s all green rubbish - i have no_idea what it is apart_from foliage i think it ' s called - i ' m not a flower person .
Flowers	but yes they looked dreadful !
Flowers	imagine my surprise when i then looked on here to see what the reviews were like and everyone is complaining_about the same_thing and that the company never reply to emails .
Flowers	well i ' m not gonna waste my time phoning the premium_rate number as i can ' t be wasting anymore of my money when they aren ' t in any way helpful or apologetic and don ' t seem to care .
Flowers	i ' m a team_leader in a call_centre myself and blimey if we treated our customers like that , we wouldn ' t have any and would have rubbish reviews like this !!
Flowers	seeing as our reviews on trust_pilot are 00 . 0 i think it speaks for itself .
Flowers	i florist need to get their act_together or they won ' t have any customers left .
Flowers	you are a disgrace !
Flowers	and i can ' t believe you don ' t even get back to customers who email you !
Flowers	disgusting service and i won ' t use them again .
Flowers	stick to what you know for future people
Flowers	i have given my scathing review of this company below , and it seems sooooooooooo many others were defrauded over the last few_days .
Flowers	this may help everyone , i finally have a refund for these_cowboys on the way - 0000 000 0000 - that is their phone number .
Flowers	option 0 - customer_service .
Flowers	i ended the call thanking them for ruining valentines for me and many others !
Flowers	:-)
Flowers	this is a review of the terrible service after ordering mothers_day flowers .
Flowers	i ordered these on friday the 00th of march and requested ( and paid more for ) delivery on sunday the 00th of march , mothers_day .
Flowers	i paid 0 separate delivery charges due to ordering 0 separate bunches for my mother , grandmother and aunt .
Flowers	well no flowers were delivered on mothers_day , or the day after ..... only my mother has received hers at 00pm today ( tues 0st april ).
Flowers	and they are of poor quality , stems are wilted and dying , they weren ' t even in water ?!?!?!?!
Flowers	they had a damp cloth around the bottom which is obviously not adequate or acceptable !
Flowers	i have tried in vain to contact them to complain and try and get a refund of some description , but to no_avail .
Flowers	0 separate calls to their helpline , which_resulted_in being held in queues for over 00_minutes at a time with no answer each time !
Flowers	i also tried the live_chat on their website - no answer and kept expiring my query and logging me out ?!
Flowers	i ' ve also emailed them , lets_see if that is any more successful ......
Flowers	overall extremely dissatisfied mothers_day flowers that just never came and when they did they were extremely poor quality .
Flowers	amazing bitching flowers
Flowers	i used eflorist in the past without problems when they were a relatively_small company .
Flowers	now they have grown they seem to not care about service .
Flowers	having ordered mothers_day flowers i received a text to tell me they had been delivered at 00 : 00 , this was a lie , they were not attempted to be delivered until 0pm on mothers_day , or what was left of it .
Flowers	the size of the flowers given what was spent was pathetic and they were all wilted having been driven around a van all day .
Flowers	immediately i sent an_email to eflorist to demand a refund and explanation for this poor deceitful service ............... as the time of writing this review i am still_waiting for a response .
Flowers	0 weeks_later ...... do yourself a favour and look_elsewhere as somewhere down the line they will let you down .
Flowers	if i could give 0_stars i would .
Flowers	ruined mothers_day for my mum .
Flowers	i ordered these flowers for my mother in law , time was against us so i used prestige - 000_% satisfaction , guaranteed delivery .... yep i fell for it all .
Flowers	i asked for these to be delivered on the saturday ( paid over £ 0 for this ), after checking the tracking detail , these were now going to be delivered on the sunday .
Flowers	not the end of the world i thought , someone will sign for them and she can collect when she returns to work .
Flowers	i have tried to contact prestige around 00 times , had 0 responses , your order has been delivered , the latest response , left in a security office .
Flowers	all security offices have been checked ( 0 ) i believe and no flowers have been received .
Flowers	now this may be the delivery company at fault , as i struggle to understand_why these were left in the security office during opening_hours . i have spoken to the delivery company who say that its down to prestige to open an investigation .
Flowers	i cannot get a response from them now , via phone , email , twitter or facebook , online_chat .
Flowers	they seem to have washed their hands of the matter , so they have stolen my money , not a small amount of money either .
Flowers	i want them to investigate , refund me , or at_least respond . dont ignore your customers .
Flowers	i paid for flowers , these have not been delivered .... sort it out prestige .
Flowers	its not about the money , its about a disappointed family_member who thinks we dont care , broken_promises , shoddy service
Flowers	highly_recommend service was excellent and was kept_updated all the time .
Flowers	beautiful flowers too and excellent value for money !
Flowers	ordered the flowers for a work colleague and she was absolutely_delighted .
Flowers	said they were beautiful and made her day .
Flowers	service was quick and hassle_free and was pleased with the email_updates on despatch and delivery confirmation .
Flowers	this was the third ( and last ) time i have ordered from serenata_flowers .
Flowers	the first two times all went well , that ' s why i decided to order from them even this time and to recommend it to my friends as well .
Flowers	today was my friend ' s birthday .
Flowers	she leaves miles_away so i wanted to surprise her with a flower bouquet .
Flowers	at 00 : 00 i received a text telling_me the order was out for the delivery , but at 00 : 00 still nothing so i emailed them and i was told at busy times orders can be delivered until 00 : 00 .
Flowers	even_though i did not think today was such a special day , i waited until then .
Flowers	at 00 : 00 i received a text informing_me the delivery failed because driver was unable to deliver on time .
Flowers	i sent a message straight_away through the website and the only answer i received was a request to specify the reason_why i was writing .
Flowers	so sent it again and now waiting for a reply ( and a refund ).
Flowers	i am very disappointed .
Flowers	when i read the order was sent via yodel i knew they would be trouble .
Flowers	but even serenata from their side should make it easier for customers to get hold of them .
Flowers	no phone numbers or emails provided , only a stupid form to be completed online each time .
Flowers	and even that one doesn ' t seem to work properly .
Flowers	when i complained the first time about the delay , they should have checked with the driver what was happening .
Flowers	at 00 : 00 is way too_late for anything .
Flowers	the surprise was spoiled and nothing will bring it back .
Flowers	i was waiting for plant over 0 month !!!
Flowers	faster could be from china .
Flowers	no respond to any of my emails !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	plant came with disease .
Flowers	i find the same plant in blackmoor much cheaper .
Flowers	i will never buy from suttons again .
Flowers	despite assuring me that prestige_flowers could deliver on mothering_sunday , i chose them as a flower delivery company because of this .
Flowers	i then paid for them to deliver on the sunday , happy that this would be met by htem as they had specifically advertised mothers_day flowers .
Flowers	to my horror , the flowers were actually delivered a day early and ruined my surprise completely .
Flowers	prestige_flowers used royal_mail to deliver the flowers , not a particular courier so it wasn ' t surprisingly they didn ' t deliver on a sunday !
Flowers	i then wrote to prestige_flowers explaining my upset and reminding them that their website states 000_% satisfaction guaranteed which i was not .
Flowers	the reply i received was most unhelpful and i was offered no consolation or attempts to keep me 000_% satisfied which is a guarantee they pride themselves on .
Flowers	after further e mails from my part i was eventually offered a measly £ 0 off my next purchase with them .
Flowers	i will never use their awful service again and urge you to do the same .
Flowers	all you have to do is a web search of the company and read the plethora of negative_reviews !
Flowers	quick and easy with fast delivery , flowers were truly appreciated .
Flowers	i ordered 00 red_roses ( premium size ) to arrive 00 feb for a price of £_00 . 00 .
Flowers	delivery time was fine ( notstanding the website didn ' t work properly when i ordered the flowers initially and i had to call their customer_services line to arrange a refund ) but when they arrive the quality of them was appalling .
Flowers	not only did they look nothing like the picture on the website , but the roses were tiny and the foilage was hardly noticable .
Flowers	i literally could have picked_up a better set at tesco for £ 0 .
Flowers	i ' m so disgusted i ' ve taken pictures and saved the image off the website and i am considering sending a letter to the oft .
Flowers	iflorist : i ' ve sent you an_email to the above setting out the same complaint , so please have the decency to respond .
Flowers	placed my order on tuesday_afternoon .
Flowers	received email confirmation and sms confirmation .
Flowers	received further confirmation on despatch , out for delivery and then finally when it was delivered .
Flowers	great overall experience
Flowers	flowers delivered on time and the recipient said they were outstanding
Flowers	serenata_flowers kept me up to date with all stages of the process , the flowers were great and they did the job far better_than i had imagined .
Flowers	great service .
Flowers	ordered these red_roses for ellen as it was our 00 wedding_anniversary 0n 00 / 00 flowers arrived mid morning very well_presented and a pleasant_surprise for her
Flowers	i usually use another very popular internet florist ( rhymes with tinterflora !)
Flowers	but they had run out of all mothers_day bouquet in my ( large ) town .
Flowers	this was a good week before mothers_day .
Flowers	i am furious so i tried iflorist with some hesitancy as i hadn ' t used them before and mothers_day is a high pressure situation .
Flowers	to my delight my mums flowers were amazing and delivered at the exact time they said theu would be ( on mothering_sunday for no extra charge ) and everyone was happy and delighted , especially my mum who had an amazing bouquet .
Flowers	thanks i florist for saving my skin .
Flowers	i think i will convert to you for all my flowers .
Flowers	i bought some flowers , chocolates , a balloon , a vase and a teddy_bear for my mums_birthday !
Flowers	once the flowers opened they were beautiful !
Flowers	i had my mum take pictures for me too see !
Flowers	everything arrived on time and in one piece and my mum also said the chocolates were delicious too !
Flowers	one thing tho is the lillie ' s only lasted a week !
Flowers	so them coming unopened really didn ' t make a difference in them lasting longer ... just made us wait longer to see the pretty orange flowers .
Flowers	part from that everything was great .
Flowers	will be happy to use this website again !!
Flowers	:)
Flowers	i was sending flowers to a friend for a wedding and was helped along the way by a sales representative via_email who was extremely_helpful :-) i will_definately be using eflorist again as it is so simple to send flowers and gifts to loved_ones without even leaving your home .
Flowers	the flowers are magnificant and fresh also .
Flowers	first_class service from start to finish .
Flowers	thank_you eflorist !
Flowers	ordered flowers for valentines_day , never arrived on the 00th and when delivered on the 00th contained the wrong flowers ( roses my fiancee hates instead of tulips ), a broken vase and chocolates instead of the balloon .
Flowers	to top it off the horrible roses we recieved barely lasted the day .
Flowers	raised ticket on the 00th and still not heard_anything back .
Flowers	i find it quite shocking that we never recieved anything to say there was replacement items , the delivery was late and they have not replied to my ticket .
Flowers	i expect a full_refund and apology .
Flowers	stated next_day delivery , and that is what i got .
Flowers	i received a text_saying the flowers had been dispatched and then another text when they had been delivered .
Flowers	very happy with the service and would recommend to friends
Flowers	i ordered some flowers from serenata_flowers .
Flowers	com as part of a valentines present which were described as deluxe along with a heart shaped balloon at a cost of £_00 .
Flowers	when the package was opened i found the balloon had been popped in transit and the flowers were no different to those being in tesco for £ 0 .
Flowers	i have left several messages to complain to which i have received the same response stating my flowers had been delivered on time but nothing in response to the popped balloon .
Flowers	if you have money to throw_away , feel free to do business with serenata because that is exactly_what you will be doing .
Flowers	it was easy to order some beautiful flowers , and the step by step updates allowed me to be aware of their dispatch and know that they had been delivered safely !
Flowers	the flowers were very much_appreciated and had numerous comments on their quality and beauty !
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	the flowers went down a treat , and i was particularly impressed by the communication - a delivery confirmation_email - as i was out of the country and this was great reassurance !
Flowers	i ' ll start by saying i am truly shocked by the number of positive_comments on this page ( even if a lot of them look like they were written by the same person ).
Flowers	i don ' t usually_write_reviews but the service i received from was so bad that i thought i would share in the hope that others do not turn their backs on other trusted retailers and order from iflorist .
Flowers	it started back on march 00th - as i usually do around that time of the year , i decided to order some mother ' s day flowers .
Flowers	after browsing online for a while i came_across iflorist - they had a nice looking website , the flowers seemed great value for money and they offered delivery on mothering_sunday ( for an additional £ 0 . 00 ).
Flowers	so impressed was i that i decided to place an order with them rather_than interflora ( who i have used before ).
Flowers	big_mistake .
Flowers	i ' d like to be able to comment on the quality of the flowers but quite simply they never arrived ( something i only found out late sunday_evening ).
Flowers	when i queried the disappearance with iflorist support i was told that the flowers had been ' lost in transit ' and that they would be re - delivered ( same flowers or new flowers i don ' t know ).
Flowers	i said this wasn ' t the point and emailed them asking for a refund and suggested they send something to my mother by way of an_apology .
Flowers	i then emailed them again asking for a refund .
Flowers	and again asking for a refund ( they are not very responsive ).
Flowers	eventually ( after contacting my bank ) i was issued with a full_refund ( or so they say ) but i sincerely doubt my mother will ever receive anything by way of an_apology from them .
Flowers	in the past i ' ve used quite a few different online florists and the service i have received has always been of an excellent standard ( something i expect when paying so much money ) and i wouldn ' t want to tarnish them with iflorist ' s brush but in short , if you are considering ordering from this company then don ' t - you would be better off buying flowers from your local petrol_station .
Flowers	buying process was simple and form easy to understand .
Flowers	range was good and special_offers made it all good value .
Flowers	my boyfriend ordered flowers from this company to give to me on valentine ' s day .
Flowers	after being told to stay in the house and await a delivery they never came , so my boyfriend had to tell me what he was expecting .
Flowers	i was appalled .
Flowers	the flowers didn ' t arrive until the 00th_february at about 0pm , by which time they were dead .
Flowers	i wrote a lengthy email to the company telling them about the incident and how it was unacceptable that a flower delivery service could be so careless .
Flowers	i received a dry and careless reply of about 0 words and then the status of my case was changed to ' closed .'
Flowers	in my opinion , a flower delivery service that cannot be on time on valentine ' s day is just a disgrace .
Flowers	yet , they barely bothered to say sorry .
Flowers	to add salt to the wound they offered my boyfriend a voucher for £ 0 off his next purchase .
Flowers	ha .
Flowers	like we would ever use them again !
Flowers	don ' t touch this company with a barge_pole .
Flowers	i was very impressed from start to finish , kept in the loop at all times and i have been told that the flowers were the most beautiful they had ever received : ) will be using again for sure !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for valentines_day and paid for delivery guaranteed by 0pm on the day .
Flowers	the flowers did not arrive until 00am the next_day , i was not informed that this would be the case , and the tracking link i had been sent was not working .
Flowers	i could not contact iflorist through their online customer_service as it said there was nobody online , so left a ticket , with no response .
Flowers	when the flowers did arrive , they were not what i had ordered , again i was not informed that this would be the case .
Flowers	because of this i opened another ticket to complain that now even_though the order had arrived it was late , and was not correct .
Flowers	i had no response to these tickets , despite updating them , until today ( 00 / 00 / 00 , 0 days after the original complaint ) and so used the online_chat service .
Flowers	i was told they would substitute goods when what was ordered was not available for something of equal or higher value .
Flowers	i accepted this , although it would have been helpful to have been informed of the change , even now the order does not state that what was ordered was not what was delivered .
Flowers	i was also told that the delivery was late due to adverse_weather_conditions beyond their control .
Flowers	that is acceptable , but i was not offered a refund on my guaranteed delivery until i asked for one .
Flowers	i will not be using the company again
Flowers	i would never ever use this company again ,
Flowers	worst company ever and not told when delivery did not go through ,
Flowers	do not use this company , go to interflora , only used because were cheaper and recommended , never had this problem with if ,
Flowers	will never use again ,
Flowers	complaining to everyone on this poor poor company ,
Flowers	save_yourself a headache and never use
Flowers	serenata_flowers add a little something extra to sending flowers to a loved one .
Flowers	i was so happy with their service and the personalised and funny emails i received were a special touch that made me smile .
Flowers	i would definately use them again :)
Flowers	awful ordered flowers for valentines_day a week earlier didn ' t turn_up no email nothing :-(
Flowers	i have never sent flowers before so i have no comparison for this service but it completely exceeded my expectations !
Flowers	right from recognition of order to the delivery of the flowers to my friend i received notification of the status of my order , both via text and e_- mail , which i found a very reassuring for a service that i have never used before .
Flowers	although i never saw the final product my friend said that they were beautiful .
Flowers	i am still_waiting to hear how yummy the chocolates are .
Flowers	i use the next_day delivery service which was a complete bargain compared to the extortionate amount of money other_sites are charging !
Flowers	i would definitely highly_recommend serenata and use again .
Flowers	thank_you so much !
Flowers	!
Flowers	very good !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	very good communication from serenata .
Flowers	helped with an issue with discount_codes and made me feel the most_important customer .
Flowers	the courier was polite and punctual .
Flowers	definitely_recommend using again .
Flowers	this was the second purchase for new this year !
Flowers	flowers delivered to my partner at her work , genuinely the bouquet looked pathetic and nothing like the picture .
Flowers	complaint made and received no response !
Flowers	the easiest_way to explain the quality of product from this company is to imagine buying a bouquet of gas station flowers and accidentally dropping them in petrol before setting them alight then leaving them on top of the roof of your car and driving off and waiting for a few weeks of cars to repeatedly run over them .
Flowers	going back , finding a dog defecating on them and then delivering the flowers to your loved one and actually having the audacity to pass them off as a £_00 bouquet .
Flowers	disgusting .
Flowers	oh , and the " customer_service " line that is open 00 / 0 has taken 00days to reply to my message ...
Flowers	so don ' t bother complaining .
Flowers	here a copy of the email i sent the company , this should explain everything .
Flowers	this is the second time i have had to contact you regarding this issue .
Flowers	the fact that you are responding to queries raised over facebook before the queries that have been raised via your website is disgusting .
Flowers	here goes , again .
Flowers	i ordered on the 00th_february_0000 , you guaranteed that my order would be delivered on valentines_day , it wasn ' t , you ruined valentines_day for fiancé and i . i paid £_00 . 00 , the flowers arrived today , in poor condition .
Flowers	i can safely_say that you are the worst company i have ever_dealt_with , you couldn ' t even answer my phone call yesterday , guess this shows how big of an issue this is and how many customers you have upset .
Flowers	i hereby request a full_refund for your incompetence .
Flowers	yours regrettably ,
Flowers	mathew
Flowers	lovely flowers arrived next_day and were wrapped beautifully , my mum was very happy
Flowers	i bought the strawberry sundae and oriental breeze from you .
Flowers	i was expecting a big bouquet , of beautiful blossomed flowers .. little did i know i as a student and money doesnt come round easy for me , was spending my hard_earned money on nothing better_than a bunch of flowers that looked like i bought them from a garage for nothing over ten_pounds .
Flowers	i made two complaints as both of the bunches i bought were a minuscule bunch of flowers and were ' waiting to bloom ' as one of your computers told me , to which i thought was a person replying to me but no it appeared to be a computer replying to me as i received the same message over and over .
Flowers	not only were the flowers awful , but so is the customer_service .
Flowers	i asked for a telephone_number and you declined me of giving me one and said the same excuse that i had previously heard twice saying ' we deliver the flowers at different stages of their lives '.. as far as i ' m concerned the flowers looked like i could ' ve gone to a florists and put them together myself .
Flowers	you advertise your flowers to be beautiful but is the opposite of what you deliver .
Flowers	i am extremely disappointed with the products delivered , the customer_service and how you go about dealing_with customers .
Flowers	i will not ever be shopping with serenata_flowers again and will not be telling my friends to use them either .
Flowers	also , my friend ordered some flowers of the same price to my house through inter flora , i sent a photo to serenata_flowers , the photo clearly shows a difference in the look , amount and care that has gone into them .
Flowers	serenata_flowers replied with ' the flowers are at a different stage of their life ' once again , i am so disappointed , not only for the people i sent them to as it looks_like i haven ' t even bothered to get them a nice bouquet of flowers , also i am very disappointed with your company as i trusted the company , to deliver good quality flowers to my loved_ones and i trusted them with my money which they have completely taken for granted .
Flowers	one star isn ' t even deserved .
Flowers	the communication with the company was good .
Flowers	i had a text at 0 in the morning saying my flowers had been delivered , then again at 0pm then they was delivered around 0pm .
Flowers	they was left outside my front_door , for anybody to come a steal .
Flowers	then at 0pm i received a text_saying that they had been delivered , but they was badly delivered 0 hours before .
Flowers	the flowers i had ordered was nothing like what i expected , they was dead and was a very small bunch of flowers .
Flowers	waste of my money and my time !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	roses were well_packed and delivered on time but it was a very small and pretty shabby bunch for £_00 . 00 .
Flowers	i could have got a much_better valentines bouquet for less_than half the price from morrisons .
Flowers	i live in the uk and sent some flowers to my girlfriend in chicago , us .
Flowers	arrived on time and in good condition , girlfriend loved the surprise !
Flowers	i don ' t normally_write_reviews but have seen theregister . co . uk article and hoped my experience would help .
Flowers	serenataflowers are great
Flowers	, nice packging , fresh flowers n yep birthday cake is nice aswell .
Flowers	.
Flowers	.
Flowers	erm just one thing i will say please on your site just allow the one who ordered to change or edit the recipent address before a limited time or may be one day before the delivery .
Flowers	nice deal n on time delivery just happy ;)
Flowers	many thanksss
Flowers	saqib
Flowers	they ' re professional and the website is really easy to use .
Flowers	i used same day delivery ordered at 0am and they were delivered by 0am .
Flowers	an absolutely fantastic service given from start to finish , initially stopping their journey to take my phonecall then keeping me totally in touch throughout the process .
Flowers	wildflower favours performed incredibly to get my 000 save the date cards sent out so quickly and when they arrived they were posibly even better looking than on the website .
Flowers	i can ' t recommend this company high enough .
Flowers	thank_you so much .
Flowers	my mother lives a few_hundred miles_away so iflorist ' s delivery service seemed like a great idea - a combo of flowers , chocolates and cards with guaranteed delivery by mothers_day .
Flowers	i received my order confirmation with a delivery date of saturday ... saturday rolled around with no phonecall from my mum .
Flowers	fair_enough i thought , they ' ll get there tomorrow .
Flowers	called my mum yesterday and she was disappointed that she hadn ' t received anything , and i felt_like a terrible daughter .
Flowers	i have since contacted iflorist via_email , through their support centre , twitter and facebook .
Flowers	they have ignored every message i have sent , and have even gone so far as deleting my a facebook message i posted requesting a response .
Flowers	absolutely_terrible company that i will not be going anywhere_near again .
Flowers	i expect a refund immediately , and an_apology , though with the level of customer_service i ' ve seen here i imagine i ' ll be fighting for it .
Flowers	oh , and if you want a laugh , have a look at all the photos of dead flowers people have received on twitter - it ' s hilarious !
Flowers	maybe it ' s a blessing in disguise that nothing was delivered .
Flowers	the colours shone through on the web_page dispaying the elegance and sophistication of every boquet combination , a joy to send to my mother .
Flowers	the process was simple and stress_free taking moments to secure a touch of brilliance for the recipient of the present - my mum
Flowers	ordered flowers and chocolates on 0nd feb for delivery on the 00th ( specifically ).
Flowers	had email to say delivery would be week commencing 00th .
Flowers	i am sending these as a gift to my long_distance partner and she is so disappointed that they have not arrived today .
Flowers	frantically tried to contact iflorist in every way possible but no reply .
Flowers	really disappointed with their customer_service and will never buy from them again .
Flowers	will re - post if by some miracle they arrive late today , however i doubt it .
Flowers	ordered a dozen roses to be sent on valentines_day a fortnight in_advance , only to be told on the afternoon of valentine ' s day that they could not fulfil my order , despite the fact they " 000_% guaranteed " it .
Flowers	shoddy .
Flowers	no option of a total refund , just a 00_% refund .
Flowers	so , they keep 00_% of my money whilst i am left aggrieved , with 00_% of the cost down , no flowers and a very annoyed girlfriend !
Flowers	rubbish .
Flowers	will not be using again .
Flowers	i was a little hasty when ordering flowers online for my mum for mothers_day , however i was very pleased with the email_updates_throughout my order and dispatch process , and my mum was over the moon with the results !
Flowers	especially the cute little instruction cards that came with the flowers .
Flowers	thankyou very much
Flowers	eflorist are a company i would recommend .
Flowers	the ordering_process is simple and effective .
Flowers	there were no_problems using this site to place an order unlike a very well_known florist .
Flowers	an_email to confirm the order was sent , which was good as it put my mind at rest , knowing that the order was registered , again , unlike a very well_known florist .
Flowers	the flowers were beauitful and it was a smooth_transaction .
Flowers	the discount was much_appreciated and the fact that there is another discount for my next order is great .
Flowers	i would recommend this company to anyone_wanting a smooth , simple , trustworthy and effective florists and i will use them again when i next need to send flowers .
Flowers	an_email / text confirming the flowers have been successfully delivered would be even better .
Flowers	there was no sympathy option for flowers to the us so i chose a florist ' s choice bouquet to send my condolences .
Flowers	i had emails from two people commenting on the beautiful flowers .
Flowers	sounds_like a good job to me .
Flowers	thank_you .
Flowers	when i came_across your website i was immediately attracted to the arrangements and the variety and for very reasonable prices .
Flowers	i was taken with you and found what i wanted immediately .
Flowers	i was very reassured receiving texts at every point of the transaction and really_appreciated the delivery options as my mum is not always guaranteed to be in .
Flowers	your choices of bouquets and arrangements are second to none and really different .
Flowers	i will_definitely use your services again .
Flowers	thank_you for making my mums day .
Flowers	je vois que_je_ne suis pas la seul à m ' être fait avoir !!!
Flowers	j ' ai_commandé des fleurs pour ma compagne habitant au royaume - unis avec une date de_livraison au 00 / 00 .
Flowers	j ' ai inventé un stratagème afin que celle - ci reste à_l maison pour pouvoir recevoir le bouquets .
Flowers	non seulement elles n ' ont jamais été livrées mais malgré mes e_- mails à floraqueen aucune réponse ne m ' a été faite .
Flowers	a fuir absolument !
Flowers	ordering was easy , delivery was fast and the flowers were amazing .
Flowers	00 / 00 , would recommend .
Flowers	wanted to send my aunty in france a thank_you bouquet so found iflorist online .
Flowers	they offered delivery to her address at reasonable rates .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on time in perfect_condition and she was very pleased with her surprise !
Flowers	will_definitely use their service again .
Flowers	ok correct me if i am wrong , i florist relies on you handing_over your money online and then the order being delivered .
Flowers	i don ' t accept the excuse that valentine ' s day is a busy day , if you sell flowers what the holy crap do you expect !?
Flowers	it ' s hardly a bloody surprise you have had at_least a year to sort your delivery line out .
Flowers	i ordered flowers yesterday , paid all the extra £' s to make_sure it was delivered and here we go nothing .
Flowers	i am looking for a reply iflorist ( i have lodged two tickets and tried to call you ), within the next_day or i will be reporting you to ts for taking all our money and then disappearing off into the sunset .
Flowers	honestly what a bunch of amateurs ; having a flashy website doesn ' t make you a reputable company , don ' t use these_jokers
Flowers	i ordered well in_advance a nice bunch of flowers for my mother to be delivered on saturday as she works on a sunday .
Flowers	it is now 0pm on the monday and they have still not arrived .
Flowers	i payed a lot of money for these flowers and feel totally let_down .
Flowers	when i eventually got though to iflorist on sunday_night ( they had been offline all day ) i got no apology .
Flowers	they gave me a link to the delivery tracking website which showed by flowers had been " in transit " since friday .
Flowers	if they do ever arrive the flowers will be approaching the end of their natural life .
Flowers	iflorist should not be taking our money if they cannot uphold their end of the bargain .
Flowers	had they said they could ' t deliver on the saturday then i would have simply sent something else .
Flowers	i have emailed demanding a full_refund and have not received any word back as of yet .
Flowers	very distressing interaction which has caused a lot of stress over the last few_days .
Flowers	i will never use this company ever again .
Flowers	given the number of other negative_reviews showing others being let_down also , i ' ve decided to write to trading_standards .
Flowers	love the flowers and delivery time
Flowers	ordered some flowers today for the mother ' s day weekend for my mother in law today and i always find browsing sites for items daunting but i must_admit that when i went on i found that what i would want is how it was all laid_out in front of me .
Flowers	like a sit_down brochure .
Flowers	i found something i liked really easy because of the lay_out of the pictures i even found a little gift balloon i could add .
Flowers	bonus too was they gave the offer of free chocs and a card .
Flowers	don ' t get that everywhere !
Flowers	anyway i ordered my flowers card balloon and put what i wished for them to put in the card and continued with ease to the checkout and voila !
Flowers	all done .
Flowers	instant email confirmation came through and not over stressed by the whole experience .
Flowers	probably took longer to write this than order . lol it ' s that easy .
Flowers	;).
Flowers	congrats on a site that ' s not confusing . com !
Flowers	;)
Flowers	last_year i ordered valentines flowers from iflorist for my girlfriend ... that arrived a day late with no apology or reply when i emailed their seemingly non - existent customer_service department .
Flowers	i then completely forgot about this and made the mistake of ordering from them again this year and guess_what , flowers for valentines_day delivered on the 00th despite them saying they would deliver on the 00th !
Flowers	seriously what is the point ?
Flowers	they even sent me an_email on the 00th saying how my flowers had been ' successfully delivered as requested ', are they taking the mick ?
Flowers	!
Flowers	and to make it worse the flowers were supposed to come with champagne , which they randomly substitued for bucks fizz with no warning .
Flowers	i sent them an_email on the 00th to complain but after last time don ' t expect any response , if anyone from iflorist is reading this don ' t bother_replying now i will make_sure i never order from you again and will tell anyone who asks me the same_thing !
Flowers	do not use this service unless you enjoy being left endlessly on hold once your order fails to turn_up .
Flowers	having ordered a bouquet for mother ' s day ( ironically at the recommendation of a banner advertising specifically mother ' s day services ) four days in_advance , i was surprised to learn that the next_day , my order hadn ' t turned_up .
Flowers	i emailed twice and received useless automated_responses and then decided to ring them .
Flowers	i was on the phone to an unhelpful operator who specified a ' technical difficulty ' which had prevented the flowers from being delivered .
Flowers	i quite reasonably requested a refund but again , my query had to be passed on to the ' customer_service escalation manager '- who sends one automated email to confirm your phone call and nothing more .
Flowers	after three days of no contact i decided to ring again to be told that a refund had been authorised - and yet i had not been notified of this .
Flowers	no email with an_apology , no compensation , not even a lousy refund confirmation .
Flowers	i wanted to show my appreciation on a public holiday for someone i care about - and the one service that they are supposed to provide apparently is beyond them .
Flowers	terrible customer_service , didn ' t even notify me that there was a problem with my order .
Flowers	i cannot stress this enough , do not order from them .
Flowers	my family received nothing for christmas as a result of ordering from this company .
Flowers	i ' m not someone who can normally afford to buy flowers in any case , so when i discovered that my flowers had not been delivered and then found them uncontactable i was naturally very disappointed .
Flowers	please do not use this company .
Flowers	at_least my parents got to see a picture of what they would have looked like and appreciated the sentiment .
Flowers	such a waste of money for effectively thin_air !
Flowers	i placed my order sunday_afternoon , and had an_email and a text promptly confirming my order .
Flowers	i had a further text and email early monday_morning to say the delivery had been dispatched .
Flowers	i had a final text and email a shortly_after confirming delivery .
Flowers	i also had a very happy mother .
Flowers	if only all service providers were this flawless and efficient , the world would be a much_better place .
Flowers	would not hesitate to recommend , and serenata will be my first choice for any future flower deliveries .
Flowers	thank_you .
Flowers	i purchased flowers for valentines_day on 00th_feb and paid extra for recorded_delivery for 00th_feb . my fiancee was at work all day and nothing arrived .
Flowers	i checked online today to find that an apparent attempt at delivery was made around 00 :_00am yesterday .
Flowers	this just isn ' t so .
Flowers	it ' s a training college for nurses and health practicioners .
Flowers	the doors are always open and at the very least , there is a buzzer .
Flowers	i have come to the conclusion that they were simply not delivered .
Flowers	apparently they are out for delivery today but i no_longer want them as a ) they are no_longer fresh and b ) i paid extra for delivery yesterday c ) the service i have recieved is non_existent and i am_appalled .
Flowers	i hereby ask that you don ' t deliver and i would like a full_refund .
Flowers	my fiancee is very upset and i am livid .
Flowers	i am now considering contacting my friend from trading_standards who will advise us further .
Flowers	regards
Flowers	alistair darby
Flowers	i ordered two of the fruit pastille bouquets for mother ' s day 0000 , described on the website as ' a collection of stunning mauve and orange coloured miniature gerberas , nestled amidst green trachelium and lime hypericum .'
Flowers	( see photo ).
Flowers	i chose these as i was fed_up with the usual pink & white bouquets .
Flowers	what was received by both mum ' s was a pink & white bouquet ( see photo ).
Flowers	i do appreciate that mothers_day is a busy time for florists & that stock may run low on certain flowers but i would rather have been told the bouquet i wanted was unavailable or out of stock so that i could choose an_alternative myself than for a pink & white bouquet that i didn ' t want to be delivered .
Flowers	the only saving_grace to my disappointment is that both mum ' s loved having fresh flowers delivered .
Flowers	el servicio es excelente .
Flowers	fue una excelente sorpresa para mi novia recibir el arreglo de noche , cuando no lo estaba esperando .
Flowers	todo salió perfecto .
Flowers	le encantaron los chocolates y el champagne fue mejor de lo_que esperaba , y por supuesto las flores hermosas !
Flowers	got my wedding flowers from silk bloom , such a personal service , adapting to what you need and very efficient .
Flowers	the flowers are beautiful with such attention to detail .
Flowers	i have had the same issues .
Flowers	no response to my emails , or telephone_calls .
Flowers	i think we should all get together and do something about this - does anyone_else agree ?
Flowers	the services was great and texted me at every_stage from taking the order online to dispatch and delivery .
Flowers	i would reccommend serenata to anyone and already have at work .
Flowers	thank_you for making my mum ' s birthday special
Flowers	if you can ' t keep up with the demand state this or do not accept more orders than you can handle !
Flowers	!
Flowers	it ' s valentines_day , i ordered my flowers to be delivered yesterday just in case and you couldnt even deliver it the day before !
Flowers	!
Flowers	made my order on the 0nd of feb !!
Flowers	rubbish .... now i ' m not happy neither is my girlfriend !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i would recommend floraqueen , i have used the service twice and may i say the customer_service was impeccable !
Flowers	super_fast response , order was delivered on the same day requested !
Flowers	mind you i was ordering from saudi arabia to be delivered into agadir , morocco !
Flowers	it was great experiance with positive_feedback and happy :)
Flowers	firstly let me know at 0pm on valentines_day that they would not be able to fulfill ( which defeated the object and forced me to go to a local_florist who gave me their last rose , but it was awesome !!
Flowers	), but would give me 00_% back , and double the roses , and 00_%_off my next order ( which i will not be using !!!).
Flowers	the roses then came the next_day squashed in a box , with two bunches of 00 ( very random ), all closed .
Flowers	when i complained was told that the outer petals are for protection , and that they ship them to give the maximum time to last , and 0 weeks on 0 out of 00 actually opened .
Flowers	awful customer_service , awful flowers , just plain awful .
Flowers	pay the extra and support a local_florist instead , totally worth it .
Flowers	brilliant communications , sending me texts keeping me updated with my order .
Flowers	flowers were beautiful , as expected .
Flowers	definitely_recommend !
Flowers	a friend of mine who has been suffering from a very bad bout of ' flu , received your delivery of flowers yesteday , as promised , and these have raised flagging spirits .
Flowers	i got a telephone call to say how wonderful and what a nice surprise .
Flowers	this is the first time i have visited this website upon recommendation from a friend .
Flowers	i am not disappointed !
Flowers	lovely interface , very pretty website and a expansive range of flowers .
Flowers	i am especially touched by the free chocolates that came with the order and also the personalised card .
Flowers	my grandmother is 00 years of age and is like a second mother to me so i want only the best for her , and i know that the rose is her most favourite flower .
Flowers	thanks to iflorist . co . uk i am assured that my gift to her on mother ' s day will make her so happy .
Flowers	i am now recommending this website above my previous favourites ( marks and spencer , interflora )
Flowers	thank_you very much !
Flowers	after ordering a bouquet of flowers for my girlfriend for the 00th_feb .
Flowers	the bunch that arrived were not the ones i ordered .
Flowers	so obviously i complained , can ' t ring only email which is annoying for me but the first response was apologising about the quality .
Flowers	i wasn ' t complaining_about the quality , i was complaining that the wrong bouquet arrived .
Flowers	second email arrived saying sorry for the confusion but wanted photos , that i sent .
Flowers	a reply asking if i wanted a replacement bunch sent or a 00_% refund .
Flowers	i ask for a refund .
Flowers	this was on saturday .
Flowers	i ' ve now sent 0 emails saying i wanted the refund with no response .
Flowers	all other responses were done within an_hour but amazing these emails have been ignored .
Flowers	very poor customer_service and actually just rude !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i paid 00 pounds for a dozen red_roses to be sent on valentine ’_s day .
Flowers	the product received consisted of 00 small roses which were in the process of decomposing with black and white marks all over the petals .
Flowers	go for 00 pound roses at a supermarket and save_yourself 00 pounds and a very embarrassing moment .
Flowers	daniel
Flowers	bright , friendly , well_laid_out website makes the whole_process of buying flowers easier ( being a man who_knows little of flowers , that ' s a big positive !
Flowers	).
Flowers	plus with the added_bonus of nectar points , i ' ll definitely be using the site again .
Flowers	i had 0 bridesmaids and 0 different wedding colours and a lot of variations happening but silk_blooms were fantastic , even wen i was confused by how complex it was all turning out to be , they were very organized and patient and the flowers turned_out better_than i had ever imagined .
Flowers	i highly_recommend them just like my friend_recommended them to me .
Flowers	if you ' re looking for artificial flowers for your wedding this is the place to go .
Flowers	i cannot complain_about the size of the bunch as it was big ( and i should think so after purchasing the grandissimo size but i dread to think how small the small size must be ).
Flowers	but what i will complain_about is that the bunch received contained only small yellow and pale pink flowers , not the large vibrant pink and reds demonstrated in the photo .
Flowers	as people usually use this service to deliver straight to a loved one i assume that the company believes they can get away with sending flowers that are similar to the ones the buyer believes they have bought in the likelihood that they won ' t actually see the product .
Flowers	i ' m quite disappointed by this but mum loved them nonetheless , so that ' s a bonus !
Flowers	really easy to place my order , confirmations throughout the whole_process to keep your mind at rest throughout the tense time before your surprise is delivered !
Flowers	!
Flowers	would highly_recommend this service : ) and will be using again no doubt !
Flowers	i could not be stronger in my recommendation that people go nowhere_near iflorist . co . uk .
Flowers	i ordered wine as a wedding gift , received confirmation that it would be delivered on the specified date ( i . e .
Flowers	before the couple got married and left to go on honeymoon ) but it didn ' t turn_up .
Flowers	i had paid extra to be able to track the order but all that the tracking said was that the order had been allocated .
Flowers	i tried to contact them online but online_chat just brought me through to logging a complaint .
Flowers	the only response i got from that exercise was a request that i be patient .
Flowers	nothing was delivered and i have received no further communication from them .
Flowers	the money was efficiently deducted from my account , which appears to me to be the only thing the people running this site are capable of doing .
Flowers	it ' s a very slick - looking site but is apparently run either entirely inefficiently or else by fraudsters .
Flowers	i will have to buy another wedding gift for my friends , which they won ' t get until they return from honeymoon .
Flowers	next time , i will ensure that i read all reviews of the company i use .
Flowers	this is a good company and i wouldn ' t use anyone_else now , having discovered them .
Flowers	great communication too .
Flowers	the flowers look lovely but scent is sadly absent .
Flowers	guess this is to be expected nowadays .
Flowers	pity .
Flowers	my bf paid 00 pounds for the flowers and paid extra on top on that to get the flowers delivered on valentine ' s day .
Flowers	it didn ' t get delivered until the day after , and the flowers were so small and half_dead .
Flowers	never been so disappointed !!!!!!
Flowers	never order from there !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered some flowers in november for the saturday before_christmas , asking the family to stay in so that they would receive them .
Flowers	i presumed that ordering them so far in_advance and for a few_days before_christmas would mean that there would be no_problems ... boy , was i wrong !
Flowers	they did not arrive , and after_speaking to three members of the online team i got no explanation of why they did not arrive other than the mysterious umbrella of ' technical_issues ', and got offered a voucher for £ 0 . 00 off my next purchase .
Flowers	the online_chat cut_off before i could receive my voucher , but after another 00_minutes with another member of the team i received it .
Flowers	i had worries about ordering from iflorist again , but ignoring my instinct i nevertheless ordered a new bunch for christmas_eve , asking the family to stay in .
Flowers	again , no flowers arrived .
Flowers	there was no email or contact from the company with any explanation , and after i spoke to the online team again , i finally got told that ' your product got out of stock ' and ' it should be tomorrow '.
Flowers	seeing as this was the second time i had tried getting flowers and it was too_late to send them now anyway , i just asked for a refund as there was no guarantee of them getting sent .
Flowers	i had to speak to two of the online team over a painstaking 00_minutes before i they said that they could not give me a refund without speaking to the warehouse .
Flowers	they invited me to ' come on chat tomorrow for the same ' to further discuss the issue , as ' due to hectic schedule we are unable to get back to most of our customers ' and they ' would appreciate if you can come on chat to sort it out '.
Flowers	thanks a lot .
Flowers	i still have not received any information .
Flowers	absolutely_fuming .
Flowers	i can understand_why there is no phone number , but i have found that the online team is slow with no tact or explanation .
Flowers	they are , however , better_than the email team who do not respond at all to issues .
Flowers	i do not usually complain_about companies , but was so appalled by the lack of communication and help with this company that i felt as if others should be warned .
Flowers	i purchased some flowers for my mum for mother ' s day and straight_away i regretted it !!
Flowers	! they took the payment for the flowers out of my account twice !
Flowers	i immediately contacted them about it and its been two_weeks and still i have yet to receive my payment back !
Flowers	not only that but they were also delivered 0 days early which is better_than late but still when i order flowers to be there on a certain day and pay for it i expect them to show up on that day !!!
Flowers	i will never again order from this company and warn_everyone_else to stay_away !!!!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered flowers for a friend ' s birthday which did not arrive .
Flowers	the next_day i spent over 0 hours trying to get the flowers delieverd .
Flowers	the phone number for customer_services is very hard to find on the web as they like you to submit emails to them which they say they will relpy to within the hour ( but actually makes things much harder to sort out ).
Flowers	i have so far sent 0 emails and have tried to phone their number which just appears dead .
Flowers	i have emailed them twice and asked them to phone me and have requested a full_refund twice .
Flowers	i have not had a call nor has the request for the full_refund been acknowledged although on their site it promises 000_% satisfaction .
Flowers	they have said that they will try to deliever the flowers tomorrow which will then be 0 days late for my friend ' s birthday , i will never use this company again .
Flowers	this is such an easy way to get flowers delivered to anyone !
Flowers	!
Flowers	easily select over so many choices .
Flowers	adding various accessories !
Flowers	fantastic , delivered on time .
Flowers	receiving emails notifying me when delivered .
Flowers	definatly using again !
Package_Service	online tracking very useful .
Package_Service	would recommend :-)
Package_Service	cant_complain at all
Package_Service	we ' re a regular user of parcel0go .
Package_Service	send many parcels all over the continent with them .
Package_Service	their live help is particularly_useful , particularly catherine , who helps with the order queries .
Package_Service	very good prices , can ' t be_beaten anywhere .
Package_Service	i have used parcel to go a number of times and can say that the chat_function is great .
Package_Service	have had a great service today from sammie_taylor
Package_Service	complete mess , courier couldn ' t be bothered to deliver my parcel .
Package_Service	neither courier or parcel0go wanted to listen to my complaint .
Package_Service	kept getting passed between the two .
Package_Service	avoid
Package_Service	even on late sunday_night my problem was resolved within the minutes .
Package_Service	katie was very professional and quick .
Package_Service	great customer_service !
Package_Service	vidas
Package_Service	i was connected within a minute .
Package_Service	my issue was that i had ordered a duplicate parcel , and needed to cancel one .
Package_Service	the service i received ( from sammie_taylor ) was very quick and polite .
Package_Service	very friendly and efficient customer_service .
Package_Service	all my queries have been responded swiftly .
Package_Service	thank_you very much , emma !
Package_Service	do not use dpd !
Package_Service	dpd are hands_down , the most unreliable delivery company in the uk .
Package_Service	i have lost two days work waiting for deliveries that never arrived .
Package_Service	on their online parcel - tracker , it claims i ' refused ' the delivery and therefore the package has been returned to the sender .
Package_Service	this is obviously complete nonsense .
Package_Service	i have read similar reports all over the internet and find it baffling that so many retailers still use this terrible company for their deliveries .
Package_Service	avoid at all costs .
Package_Service	they missed the collection date , then when i rang up to find out why , they had no answers , by the looks of the tracking the order had not even gone_through to the courier .
Package_Service	all they could offer was to collect the item another 0 days_later , which was 0 days after i placed the order - even then could not guarantee it was going to be picked_up .
Package_Service	i asked for a refund and the phone operator took on an attitude .
Package_Service	total disgrace !
Package_Service	* edit to add ...* far too many 0 star / 0 review for this company .
Package_Service	trust_pilot should investigate .
Package_Service	if they spent as much time woking on their service as they do bombing social_media sites ,, they might have a good company .
Package_Service	also , either they ' re incredibly racist employers , or they do not give their staff the dignity to enable them to use their real name .
Package_Service	has anyone spoken with someone on live_chat that didn ' t have a biblical ' white ' name ?!
Package_Service	all hints at what a sneaky , deceitful company this really is .
Package_Service	following a number of bookings for supposed ' next_day ' service , with such a low collection rate ( from collections in central_london - hardly the outer hebrides !)
Package_Service	it is clear this company easily maintains it ' s ' low ' rates by simply only managing to complete x % of the collections .
Package_Service	it ' s clear when you phone to complain ( after realising that the obvious move of allocating your failed collection to the following days service isn ' t automatically done !)
Package_Service	they clearly know and expect such a regular occurrence to be part of their business .
Package_Service	their review %' s are disingenuous ( almost laughable ) and simply an example of the fraudulent practices of this company .
Package_Service	i shall be reporting them to trading_standards as they are deliberately overstating their abilities .
Package_Service	do not use !
Package_Service	absolute_joke of a company , there customer_service is none existant , rediculous live_chat system allows them to disconnect the chat whenever they dont like what you have to say .
Package_Service	i asked 0 times to actually speak to a manager and was told they could not give me their numbers out , so i asked for the email address of the md and i was told he did not have one .
Package_Service	asked for a refund .......... got no response , asked for tracking_details ........ no response .
Package_Service	i really do hate this company and i will be so glad when i read that they have gone to the wall .
Package_Service	surely not long away now
Package_Service	i made an error on my parcel and p0g ' s sarah_hayes helped_me very quickly , best service i have had from anybody at p0g so far , she is great :)
Package_Service	i really love the p0g live_chat and the agent are very helpful .
Package_Service	my queries were resolved asap and i have saved a lot of money on phone_calls .
Package_Service	it takes seconds to connect to an agent .
Package_Service	i will like to mention sammie_taylor in particular for great customer_service experience .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	dealing_with sammie is always so easy as she knows what shes doing and susses the problems out instantly very good service thank_you craig
Package_Service	interparcel offers a fantastic service and is a worthy alternative to the usual royal_mail services for anything from small packet size upwards .
Package_Service	the site is easy to use and takes the hassle out of having an account with one of the couriers directly .
Package_Service	highly_recommended if you post anything .
Package_Service	sammie was great at helping me and done everything i expected an advisor to do :)
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	problem solved in less_than 0 minutes would recommend this company to anyone .
Package_Service	( well he would be if i ran the company !)
Package_Service	a huge thank_you to ben who has spent time and effort resolving a problem with the delivery of my parcels .
Package_Service	he was very professional , courteous and a credit to your customer_service team .
Package_Service	thanks ben !
Package_Service	wendy
Package_Service	quickly resolved the issue
Package_Service	after using parcels to go for some time , we have changed business premises , we were unable to book collections at our new address due to something that happened back a few_years_ago before we moved in , i have been in contact with the company before this time and was advised that they could not collect from out area , i have chatted today with emma , and she has managed to arrange our new address to be able to have collections again , which will now save us money on collection charges !!..
Package_Service	she went above and beyond her duty to help me and was also very helpful ..
Package_Service	thanks you emma , you have made my day !
Package_Service	very helpful , attentive and thorough service .
Package_Service	my rep , emma , answered all my queries and helped_me solve my problem .
Package_Service	i definitely_recommend their services to one and all .
Package_Service	thanks emma .
Package_Service	good service , affordable price and the live_chat for queries are straight to the point and answers all the doubts .
Package_Service	unfortunately my parcel went missing & after being investigated it could not be found .
Package_Service	philip marsh , executive service co - ordinator was very helpful and is very good at his job .
Package_Service	i have just spoken with jenny via live_chat and it was a pleasant_experience , veto professional and polite .

Package_Service	i had help from hannah , she was thorough , extreemly helpful and seemed cheerful and happy to help .
Package_Service	i appreciated her speedy work to ensure that i made it out in time .
Package_Service	she was efficient and i would definatly recomend parcel0go .
Package_Service	organised courier for a ebay transaction , deliveree was out when supposed to be in .
Package_Service	parcel0go tried several_times to re - deliver , then came up on the tracking screen as awaiting instruction .
Package_Service	went_onto the live_chat , spoke rose who was very helpful and had sorted re - delivery out within 0 minutes .
Package_Service	many_thanks
Package_Service	catherine was extremely_helpful and professional .
Package_Service	she was thorough with her questions to enable an exact quote and emailed the details for later use .

Package_Service	great service you have their keep up the good work .
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	matt - comms consult
Package_Service	i ' ve used interparcel maybe 00 times before - and about 00_% of the time there has been an issue .
Package_Service	the latest issue is that they have re - arranged collection 0 times now as the courier didn ' t bother coming to collect the parcel .
Package_Service	the email responses from the heads of customer ' service ' were bordering on obnoxious , and quite_frankly , i ' m seriously disgusted with the service and the manner in which i ' ve been treated .
Package_Service	i ' d rather take a cheese grater to my eyeballs than have to deal with interparcel again .
Package_Service	so far i only used the chat option to clear up some queries of mine .
Package_Service	daniel has been more then helpful and very speedy in his replies to me .
Package_Service	many_thanks
Package_Service	dani
Package_Service	answered my questions without any delay , i wasn ' t expecting live_chat to offer such good value .
Package_Service	i needed to send a parcel and catherine at parcel to go was very helpful .
Package_Service	she guided me through the whole_process .
Package_Service	will_definitely use again
Package_Service	i use this service a lot and it is hassle_free and great value .
Package_Service	i had a message came up with my last order to speak with a member of staff over live_chat .
Package_Service	i spoke with a lady_called emma and she was very helpful and polite and . manually entered a few details for me .
Package_Service	i decided to use collect_+ for the first time after trying to sell a few items to pay for expensive vets bills .
Package_Service	i used the standard two day delivery service and it was not overly clear to up the insurance value on the item ( my fault completely , assuming the claim was accepted )
Package_Service	i sent the parcel on 0st_july and the parcel was collected the next_day all smooth and clear , the parcel arrives at the national hub at 00 . 00 and that was the last transaction date .
Package_Service	i spend over an_hour on the phone to admin yesterday trying to track this lost parcel , how can a parcel get lost when it was packaged that no one would open it or see in it .
Package_Service	although i cannot see it it was taken to another depot the next_day at 0 . 00am , this doesn ' t show up on my transaction details and only came to light this morning after numerous checking !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i thankfully have a very patient ebay buyer which i am going to have to refund and be out of pocket because one of collect +' s light fingered staff on night shift .
Package_Service	sadly the packet was small and light weight enough to make it obvious that it was a mobile phone .
Package_Service	what a complete_joke , i can claim and if i win i will get £_00 back which means a refund to the ebayer of £_000 , ebay fees of £ 0 , collect_plus fee of £ 0 total out of pocket and having to find = £_000
Package_Service	thank_you very much no i am even more out of pocket !
Package_Service	i will never use your service again , i have sent 000 ' s of parcels through royal_mail standard non signed for and all arrived perfectly !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	avoid like the plague and recent feed_back seems that this is happening more_than it should !
Package_Service	very angry customer who is severely out of pocket now and struggling to find funds for vets !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	thank_you for your fabulous service and customer care , not !
Package_Service	i think you should be searching harder for this item !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	having dealt_with parcel0go for sometime i can_honestly say that they have helped open doors for my business .
Package_Service	p_& p premier plumbing is a local , independent company , the majority of our revenue is generated from footfall in the store .
Package_Service	having recently entered the world of ecommerce but not generating enough revenue quite yet to compete with the ' big guys ' parcel0go offer everything we need .
Package_Service	we started out sending 0 or 0 parcels on the odd_occasion , now we send out 0 or 0 a day and hopefully this will only grow and grow .
Package_Service	parcel0go are quick , easy and a pleasure to deal with .
Package_Service	martin , our regular delivery driver is a top guy and samantha in the office always goes the extra_mile to help us .
Package_Service	even today , one slight error on my part was quickly and effortlessly resolved and that ' s very rare to find these days .
Package_Service	samantha answered my query within minutes and i was back on track !
Package_Service	parcel0go come highly_recommended and are an_absolute delight to deal with , whether you are a one off or returning customer , choose parcel0go .
Package_Service	used them twice buying items from amazon , kindle get stuck at their delivery hub for 0 weeks ( replacement by amazon delivered by dpd no problem ) then next order couple days ago sent by amazon to their delivery hub at gatwick and disappeared .
Package_Service	customer_service talking bullshit like " yes , yes we will send delivery tomorrow next_day nothing , next phone call same_thing tomorrow " order cancelled and replaced by amazon ( delivered by dpd on time messages about delivery time , online tracking extra service )
Package_Service	please for your own good do not use collect_+ >>>> ever
Package_Service	just have a look on other reviews this service is total trash
Package_Service	was connected to [_name ] on the live_chat who was friendly and helpful and answered everything i needed and more .
Package_Service	she answered my question and told me everything i needed .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	a +++
Package_Service	i had a problem i placed more_than 0 order for 0 parcel and i wanted to cancel them .
Package_Service	i contaced katie and she was a great help she helped_me to cancel my order and put the money back in my account .
Package_Service	she was a great help .
Package_Service	thank_you katie
Package_Service	spoke to dianne via live help today .
Package_Service	to clear up some queries on a tracking_number that didnt work .
Package_Service	within 0mins i knew what was going on !
Package_Service	she was very polite and i cant_fault her !
Package_Service	promote this woman !
Package_Service	i ' ve just pg0 a few_times in the past and never had issues ( i ' ve even recommended them to friends and family , but it ' s often said that you don ' t know how good or bad a company is until you hit a problem .
Package_Service	here is a overview of a issue i have just had with p0g ( this is a extract from the live_chat on there site , although i ' ve lost their responses )
Package_Service	hi there ,
Package_Service	this is in regard to order number p0g - xxxxxxx , which i have had an issue with
Package_Service	i ' ll give you a full history of what has happened so that you can see where i ' m coming from .
Package_Service	i placed the order on the 00 / 00 /_0000 with a collection date of 00 / 00 /_0000 .
Package_Service	on the 00 / 00 /_0000 at around 00 : 00 the tnt driver refused to accept the package as it was not in a cardboard_box ( it was securely bagged and taped however ).
Package_Service	i contact you via your live help system within an_hour of the driver refusing the collection to see what my options were .
Package_Service	i was advised that unless the item was correctly boxed , then the package would not be accepted .
Package_Service	on this basis , i was told the best thing would be to cancel the collection , accept a refund ( i was even offered an extra £ 0 credit if i took an p0g account credit ) and re - arrange the collection with someone_else .
Package_Service	so , this is the course of action i took and i had an_email confirmation that the refund had been requested by 00 : 00 ( less_than an_hour after the refused collection ).
Package_Service	i then arranged for an_alternative collection via another courier ( actually a man with a van service )
Package_Service	it then seems that the following_day ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) that the same tnt driver came back to collect the item again and this time accepted it ( without any changes being made to the packaging from the previous day ),
Package_Service	this is despite the fact that i had cancelled the collection with yourselves the previous day .
Package_Service	the item was the delivered to my workplace on the 00 / 00 /_0000
Package_Service	today is my first day back in the office and the package was waiting for me as expected , however i ' ve now got another company wanting to charge me for wasting their time for attempting to collect a package that has already been collected .
Package_Service	so a situation has been caused by p0g not cancelling the collection as agreed .
Package_Service	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package_Service	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package_Service	the customer_services were just not interested , they seem to think that it ' s acceptable for their driver to pick_up an item 00hours after the order had been cancelled and don ' t care that i ' m now looking at charges from the alternative courier i booked .
Package_Service	i ' ll make_sure that i , or anyone that i know , never use this company again .
Package_Service	paul mccaffrey
Package_Service	never_experienced such bad service in my life !
Package_Service	my friend ordered a package on river_island for my birthday , i live in the us , they live in england .
Package_Service	this was scheduled to arrive the day of my birthday 00th_may .
Package_Service	no sign of it .
Package_Service	still no sign for the next 0 days , and then my friend rings up , they decide to then tell us we have to pay duty on the items ordered , apparently it ' s in the small_print ... why wasn ' t it made clear so that the package wouldn ' t be held up ?
Package_Service	no one informed us it was even held up .
Package_Service	when asked what would have happened had this not been paid we are informed that it would have just been sent back to the uk .
Package_Service	i think it is completely appauling that they didn ' t tell us this !
Package_Service	why would they not make this clear and let us pay when we pay for delivery ???
Package_Service	how were we supposed to pay it if we simply weren ' t told about the charge , and not told how to pay the charge .
Package_Service	this is a $_00 charge for tax too which i think it a bit much on top of delivery , especially since they are gifts .
Package_Service	i have not had this problem with any other packages i have recieved from england in the year i have been here .
Package_Service	they tell us on the phone if we supply an e_- mail address and telephone_number they will contact us shortly to tell us how to pay this charge ...
Package_Service	i get an e_- mail saying the request has been acknowledged at 00am yesterday telling_me i should get an e_- mail in the next 00_hours ... well its 0pm now and still no e_- mail , and still no package .
Package_Service	i am stunned at how badly this has been handled and i still_haven ' t got my birthday_present .
Package_Service	it ' s hard enough being away from home on your birthday without the added hassle of trying to contact a company to get my package released with barely anyway to contact !
Package_Service	i have never been more stressed out by a company in my life .
Package_Service	i think it ' s ridiculous that we have to pay a $_00 charge in the first place , but am willing to pay it , yet they should make this clear at the point of purchace and they should give a clear way to pay it ... how are you supposed to pay a fee to get a package released if you are not told how and when to pay it ?
Package_Service	i sent a parcel to australia , and my husband did put the wrong postcode .
Package_Service	could not find any num to call so i chatted with remi and she or he was a staaaar ( she , he ) sent an_email to fedex to change it for me .
Package_Service	really happy with your service .
Package_Service	thanks again "" remi """
Package_Service	i had no_problems sorting_out the necessary customs paperwork , the instructions on the website were perfect and easy to follow and getting my parcel sent off was easy as anything ...

Package_Service	today i needed some extra info and sarah_hayes was happy to help me via chat .
Package_Service	would definitely_recommend them .
Package_Service	was helped today by samantha who dealt_with my problem quickly and professionally .
Package_Service	she is an asset to the p0g team !
Package_Service	even_though the problem was completely my fault ( i booked a parcel in for collection on the wrong day , the deadline had passed and i needed same day collection ) - she sorted out for me in a matter of seconds !
Package_Service	i accidentally booked the collection from the wrong_address - i thought it would be a pain to cancel and re - book this , although i went on tot he live_chat and [_name ] helped straight_away - 0 minutes and she had changed the address and sent new documentation through - thanks a lot !

Package_Service	i found the signup process to send my first package with my parcel delivery was fast and simple .
Package_Service	the prices are excellent and we will_defiantly use their service in the future .
Package_Service	good work !
Package_Service	although , their customer_service number and live_chat functionality are difficult to find on the website i can confirm that having both called and used the live_chat feature for 0 different queries my questions were dealt_with quickly and efficiently !
Package_Service	sarah_hayes on live_chat deserves special mention for dealing_with my query in a friendly and quick manner !
Package_Service	excelletn service , fast and reliable .
Package_Service	don ' t hesitate in using it .
Package_Service	i have used interparcel on many occasions and i find their service to be very reliable .
Package_Service	i have seen some bad_reviews on this site and i cant_believe they are talking_about the same company .
Package_Service	on one_occasion i used interparcel to send a pallet to one of our very respected clients and i needed it there as soon as possible and interparcel arranged a next_day collection as requested and it was delivered the very next_day also as requested and our client commented on what a fast and reliable service it was .
Package_Service	i have always been happy with interparcel and will_continue to use their services .
Package_Service	emma was so helpful got me sorted in minutes , thanks x
Package_Service	great live_chat service by catherine_corless .
Package_Service	friendly and professional .
Package_Service	booking what i thaught wasn the best priced courier service with ups , filled allthe forms out payed by visa then it says please take your parcel to a ups pick_up point , ok from looe thats a 00 mile_round_trip , so look for customer_service , email has a link that sends you round in circles , one hour on and ime realy pissed , ill never come back here again , look online and find countless horror_stories , the main thing is how thay have no respect for the people paying their wages , just grab the money , and pull the shutters down , well ive now done alli can for tonight , no doubt this will occupy tomorrow , all it takes is one phone call or an online opperator , but no thay dont want anything like that , thay make more money doing it like this , and so much for the customers health and wellbeing . what a setup it stinks . never again thease people should not be allowed to trade . ombudsmen .
Package_Service	great humour understood my lingo great girl you have thersammiee make her manager
Package_Service	thats what makes the difference with any company , simply get one person who really cares and wants to give you the right information and the experience is one you want to come back to and can trust to not be let_down .
Package_Service	i wanted a package picked_up from a friend but input the wrong_address on the parcels0go website .
Package_Service	i thought this would be a big problem and i would lose my money as they had already tried to collect it twice from the wrong_address .
Package_Service	i was very wrong , i connected to the live_chat were a very friendly gemma fixed my problem in a couple of minutes !
Package_Service	couldn ' t be_happier !
Package_Service	thank_you gemma for all your help with my late order today ( parcelforce were late ) .
Package_Service	you were quick and helpful and answered all my questions quickly and clearly .
Package_Service	another great delivery from parcel 0 go !
Package_Service	great thankyou [_name ] very helpfull
Package_Service	i opperate a small business and have been running an ebay shop for a little while now .
Package_Service	when i started to sell some larger items it made sense to send via a courier .
Package_Service	i used another courier for a while and occassioanlly had a few issues with them and just recently it took 0 days longer_than it was meant to for my customers to receive their orders .
Package_Service	i have now sent several parcels via parcel0go and not had a single_issue with them , parcels are collected on time and delivered without any_issues , definitely found my new courier company .
Package_Service	many_thanks
Package_Service	peter chandler keep up the good work
Package_Service	c ' mon !
Package_Service	i ' m not that dumb enough to go with them lot again , no way !
Package_Service	so i turned to fedex .
Package_Service	fedex man came round and wasted both our times on the door_step by having to ring his boss when he should have known the answer himself whether or not my package could be accepted .
Package_Service	prick fedex man with a face on finally produced an answer ... " nooooooah " he said , because he droned " they only offer the domestic option to customers who ship parcels on a regular_basis ."
Package_Service	well it was mainly my fault anyway because of poor research into the whole shipping thing .
Package_Service	i had nowhere else to turn to .
Package_Service	collectplus was a definite no , no .
Package_Service	time was running out and goods needed to be shipped out immediately !
Package_Service	in comes parcel0go to save the day .
Package_Service	honestly it was not the option i wanted because of previous experiences and i wanted to deal with the carriers directly instead of having to deal with the middle_man .
Package_Service	i saw a sheer amount of positive 0 star_ratings here and skim read them all .
Package_Service	no time though , i then thought " let ’_s go with em and hope for the best ."
Package_Service	the site was easy enough to navigate my way through ; choose the carrier ( tnt ), make your payment and then print out the shipping label .
Package_Service	i went with amazon payments this time to see what it was like .
Package_Service	smoooth !
Package_Service	yeah , we ' re cooking on gas now i thought .
Package_Service	from noon to 0 :_00pm now and i was bricking it .
Package_Service	i heard something heavy and loud pull up , went outside to greet the tnt man and exchange papers and signatures and away we went .
Package_Service	my customers where pleased with what they purchased and received in a timely_manner .
Package_Service	i was more_than pleased with the service received from parcel0go .
Package_Service	i ' ll be more_than happy to deal with these_guys again in future .
Package_Service	thanks parcel0go for a brilliant service .
Package_Service	just to note ; don ' t go with myhermes or yodel , especially yodel .
Package_Service	just read through the reviews here .
Package_Service	they maybe cheap , but its like they say - you get what you paid for .
Package_Service	i always get my shipping next_day , although sometimes very early in the morning , i always get my items .
Package_Service	well ... there ' s that one time the fedex man came round and everyone in my house was either too neurotic and / or anally spiteful to open the door to the man , and the fedex guy left my parcel with the neighbour across the street .
Package_Service	a good thing it wasn ' t left with the hard face cow next door .
Package_Service	fortunately , the guy across the street is a good guy .
Package_Service	fedex are great as for as for uk deliveries ?
Package_Service	props fedex .
Package_Service	i was due to receive a parcel yesterday between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
Package_Service	on the lovely map they sent me , it was due to be delivered to my work .
Package_Service	however the emails said it was my home address .
Package_Service	i was at work all day , and i work on reception , and nothing was delivered .
Package_Service	i then return home after work to no calling_card there either .
Package_Service	there are no telephone_numbers like some other courier companies , to speak to someone about whats happened .
Package_Service	i then check the tracking and it says the parcel was refused !!
Package_Service	by who ??
Package_Service	i then log on this morning to see that it is being held at the romford depot .
Package_Service	i cannot call as there is no number , and i have no calling_card ?!
Package_Service	so what do i do ?
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	best service o ever had
Package_Service	great customer_service
Package_Service	fast reliable service
Package_Service	quick collection and delivery
Package_Service	whenever parcels have been sent to me from online_retailers via dpd , i ' ve always had a good experience .
Package_Service	my orders have arrived in timely_fashion and i really_appreciate the text update to let me know the hour time - frame they will deliver between .
Package_Service	this is such a great idea as , unlike with some other couriers , i do not have to wait in from 0am - 0pm with no more specific indication of what sort of time they might arrive .
Package_Service	no one enjoys wasting an entire day , eg .
Package_Service	if the delivery comes at 0pm and you realise you could have gone out and done plenty of other things in that time .
Package_Service	my most_recent delivery was today , sent from asos ; i was sent a text and an_email_saying it would arrive between 00 :_00am - 00 :_00pm .
Package_Service	the parcel arrived at 00 :_00am , very pleased with dpd ' s time - keeping .
Package_Service	i ' m so glad asos has chosen to either stop using myhermes or at_least does not use myhermes for next_day deliveries .
Package_Service	i ' ve not yet needed to use the redelivery via text , but i think it ' s fantastic that they give you the option to choose whether you ' d like to delivered to a neighbour or delay delivery for up to two days .
Package_Service	keep up the good job , guys .
Package_Service	update 00 / 00 / 00 : i have another parcel being delivered by dpd for today and during the tracking process , i ' ve just noticed the " follow my parcel " section and i love it !
Package_Service	i love knowing exactly where my delivery driver is , and which delivery he is currently making , and how long it will take him to get to me .
Package_Service	see you in about 0 hours , bill !
Package_Service	i liked her a lot
Package_Service	had some trouble booking as id meant to book a collection from home but hadnt , got it changed and my labels emailed as my computer wouldnt download them !
Package_Service	thanks so much catherine !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	from start to end the service was quick and easy very fast pick_up , parcels undamaged and arrived quickly .
Package_Service	the online booking system was easy to understand and quick to use , would be my method of choice now .
Package_Service	even the emails from peter at the reviews team were polite and seemed to genuinely want to check everything happened at the highest_standard possible .
Package_Service	had a few questions that i needed answering to do with my account and used the live_chat .
Package_Service	got put through to sarah_hayes and she was most helpful .
Package_Service	excellent service :)
Package_Service	emma , was wonderful .
Package_Service	i didnt know my way around the site and she sorted my quote for me and then went on to help me organise everything and i just had to click the link cornfirm and pay .
Package_Service	she did her job and hope the company can follow_up and get my parcel to its destination .
Package_Service	thanks emma !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	perfect helped_me out very much and will always use them
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	anthony hickman
Package_Service	thanks to brittany ( cust serv rep ) who helped_me track my parcel after me losing my p0g number .
Package_Service	great service , used it for many parcels big & small .
Package_Service	far cheaper_than royal_mail for most things , much_easier , far more reliable , and sensible hours at courier collection points ( if you choose to collect after a missed delivery ).
Package_Service	i hear there ' s a drop_off services at certain shops / garages ( some 00hr ), and the person at the other end can choose to have it delivered to a collection point near them .
Package_Service	my family have used this service and say it ' s also brilliant !
Package_Service	top_marks p0g !
Package_Service	i spoke with emma about my parcel she is very kind and helpful .
Package_Service	having previously got in touch with parcel0go about a proof of delivery and not heard_anything for a little while , i went to live_chat to see what the problem was .
Package_Service	emma was very helpful and got on the case straight_away , fixing my problem for me .
Package_Service	great service !
Package_Service	needed to make an adjustment to my collection address , sam from parcel0go was very accommodating and passed on the adjustment to hermes .
Package_Service	great service , great options and a first_class twitter reply service !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	this company shouldn ' t be allowed to even exist .
Package_Service	i had a parcel sent using ups service from the uk to new caledonia .
Package_Service	when i chatted with parcel0go , they said it was ok to send to a po_box , as they are mainly used on the island .
Package_Service	service was advertised to be between 0 - 0 days .
Package_Service	after 00 days , parcel is still not delivered .
Package_Service	ups contacted me saying they can ' t deliver the parcel because it is a po_box address !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	not only this , but now parcel0go sent me an_email today saying i will have to pay for the return of the parcel although it is entirely their fault .
Package_Service	customer_service is appalling , filled with people who don ' t have a clue and don ' t care at all about customers .
Package_Service	disgusting company !
Package_Service	i bougt some small things from asia , where the site had promised free shipping .
Package_Service	then , when i got the goods , i also got a bill fro ups , containing_cutoms + a fee .
Package_Service	the fee from ups is partially_customs , and the rest is a fee for taking care of the customs for you .
Package_Service	ups is obliged to give the consumer the chance to take care of the customes_themselves , by providing the consumer with the proper_information at_arraival .
Package_Service	this was not done in this instance , and not when other friends of mine had bought goods from the same site .
Package_Service	fyi_:
Package_Service	on the other hand , depending_on your countries_laws , ups is , in the context of being miniinthebox ' s delivery partner ; also_liable for the information posted on their partners ( miniinthebox )_homesite , reguarding_freight cost .
Package_Service	miniinthebox has little opportunity to know about every_rule in every country .
Package_Service	ups on the other hand , is a professional_freigth partner , with the whole world as their office .
Package_Service	keeping_track on fees is a no - brainer for them , but it would not be in ups ' s_intrest to inform any customer about this , because , clearly ; ups is making a lot of money on not giving_proper_information to consumers , and then taking a big fee for doing a 0 minute_task .
Package_Service	i ' ve complained_ups and their practice to the norwegian_consumer ombudsman , and is currently_concidering making a media - case on the subject .
Package_Service	ups has given me a cheap_exuse , that they are obliged by law to do the customs , and then is in title to give the end_user a fee .
Package_Service	- well , if the end_user would get the chance to make this decision in his own , i would actually agree .
Package_Service	in this case , information is held back , both by the store , and by the ups , and you don ' t need to be a rocket_scientist to understand the barely_hidden motive .
Package_Service	i would recommend ups to re - evaluate their ethics .
Package_Service	to rip_off consumers like this , is the sign of how bad the ethics can possibly get .
Package_Service	emma is awesome !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	emma was super today helped_me out as i had miss spelt my e_- mail gave her the details she needed and within two minutes all sorted thanks
Package_Service	will be using this website all the time now !
Package_Service	i had to place my order through chat as something was not working quite right online and the staff_member who assisted was very patient and helpful .
Package_Service	i was sending three packages from the uk to the us and was worried that one was too heavy and large .
Package_Service	this wasn ' t a problem at all for p0g .
Package_Service	when customs got involved and required more information p0g contacted me promptly and gave me a detailed list of what i would be needing to get my package from customs to my door .
Package_Service	all in all , it is a good service with excellent customer_service and safe .
Package_Service	you can also track your order online through them or the carrier .
Package_Service	absolutely_brilliant company had a problem with a buyer cancelling at the last_minute i spoke to katie who was very very helpful and sorted it out for me by cancelling my order and refunding into my prepay account would recommend using this company :-)
Package_Service	just as the title goes .
Package_Service	i ' ve used them every time i need to courier something .
Package_Service	great prices , collection and drop_off services , great customer_service and livechat ( looking at you emma !)
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	even my last parcel i booked the addresses the wrong way around , 0 minutes on livechat and emma had it all sorted for me :)
Package_Service	thanks everyone , keep up the good work !
Package_Service	just asked for simple advice and charlotte pretty_much done the job for me ... what a star and credit to the company !!
Package_Service	i will be using these very soon !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	great service and cheap !
Package_Service	richard helped_me out online by re - booking my parcel for me after the courier messed_up the collection on 0 seperate_occasions , he was able to give them special instructions and was able to sort the problem out very quickly and efficiently - highly_recommended .
Package_Service	this " service " is an_absolute_joke !
Package_Service	i ordered delivery of some parcel one week_ago and they failed three times to come over and collect my stuff .
Package_Service	every_single time i was speaking to the cust .
Package_Service	serv .
Package_Service	rep . and been assured that this time they will come and pick_up my parcel .
Package_Service	during yest .
Package_Service	conversation rep . just terminated it in the middle !
Package_Service	i ' ve never_experienced such a disrespectful , disgraceful and disgusting customer_service .
Package_Service	today , i did contact live_chat again and been assured ( third time !)
Package_Service	that they will contact the courier to make it urgent , so he will finally pick_up my parcel .
Package_Service	of course , the ' ve never showed up !
Package_Service	now , basically they stole my money and haven ' t done service which i ordered .
Package_Service	i ' ve been forced to order another company and pay for this again , now trying to get my money back from p0g , which , i ' m sure , is not gonna be easy .
Package_Service	the situation is complicated , as the stuff i wanted to send , was some items from my flat i moved recently from one city to another .
Package_Service	as they didn ' t pick it up first i ' ve been forced to pass it to one of my friend ' s flat , so she could handle it over to the courier .
Package_Service	i rebooked the collection twice and courier never showed up to take the parcel .
Package_Service	now , she ' s moving out ( unexpectedly ) from the flat and i stayed without my belongings .
Package_Service	it ' s stuck in another city , hundreds miles_away from me .
Package_Service	the only thing i can really do now is to inform about all the situation authorities from outside which will be able to deal with the problem .
Package_Service	it ' s been a contract between me and p0g on the service for which i paid and never been done .
Package_Service	it ' s unlawful .
Package_Service	they lost my laptop and only refunded £_00 .
Package_Service	how pure service !
Package_Service	i wish i never came to use this courier .
Package_Service	never again !
Package_Service	international services definitely requires improvement .
Package_Service	prices need to bejustified
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go numerous_times for business and personal use .
Package_Service	never had a problem and so much cheaper_than sending large items through the post_office .
Package_Service	just mixed up an address and emma at online support sorted out within minutes and sent a new label .
Package_Service	would recommend .
Package_Service	very good customer_service
Package_Service	i had a good experience today with ' emma ' who was very helpful , polite and fast .
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	pleasantly_surprised at the otustanding customer_service received by sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	really patient and helpful individual couldn ' t have asked for a more friendlier or accomodating assistance .
Package_Service	superb .
Package_Service	has perked up my expectation and reviews of parcels0go .
Package_Service	will recommend to others if they ' re all like him .
Package_Service	x
Package_Service	sammie_taylor made me write this .
Package_Service	i didn ' t want to do it .
Package_Service	but it said at the bottom of the screen when she typed that she was an agent so i thought i better write something nice in case she comes after my family .
Package_Service	maybe i ' m just being overly dramatic .
Package_Service	she did rebook my courier for me and was very polite and helpful .
Package_Service	a gold star to her and p0g .
Package_Service	paid a for premium for what i thought was next_day collection - turns_out the service is not guaranteed service thus the package maybe collected in the next few_days in the meantime if i can be in the house 00 : 00 until 00 : 00 each day that would be great ...... avoid !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	had to cancel my order .
Package_Service	quick and great cancellation , no_hesitation to use again .
Package_Service	great service as usual .
Package_Service	jessie ( jessj ) was extremely_helpful with solving issue i had with yodel .
Package_Service	can ' t recommend enough .
Package_Service	excellent service by sarah_hayes !
Package_Service	top site many_thanks to samantha for her help
Package_Service	sammie was very quick and helpful .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	spoke to samantha over the live_chat regarding a number of different queries as it was my first time and she was able to give me all the answers i needed to complete the online booking process with confidence .
Package_Service	many_thanks again to sam !
Package_Service	kind_regards ,
Package_Service	dean nash
Package_Service	will not rely_on this company and their services .
Package_Service	information given by one of the team was wrong , so my package has been delayed by 0 months .
Package_Service	i believe it ' s wrong and now they i needed to pay a fee to return the item back to me .
Package_Service	basically given information been wrong so all service gone down .
Package_Service	not happy & will not use this service ever & will guarantee that my family & friends will not use your service .
Package_Service	i originally booked a huge parcel to go to australia , but due to my brain being fried with emigrating i needed to cancel the parcel - and the customer_service ( livechat ) was top_notch .
Package_Service	i would definitely use these again :)
Package_Service	the courier was not only a day late , but also lied about my delivery !
Package_Service	he stated ' out of building ' when i was home at the time of the delivery !
Package_Service	my whole experience has been a disaster and their help line is a disgrace !
Package_Service	[_name ] from p0g was very swift and helpful for me whilst trying to sort out cancellations and refunds .
Package_Service	nice experience for shipping as the customer_service always there to help you with any_queries in quick fashionable manner , especially sammie_taylor the customer_service guy
Package_Service	great service
Package_Service	i have wrongly booked collection instead of drop - off service .
Package_Service	contacted customer_service via webchat to see if it can be changed .
Package_Service	i quickly got connected to the advisor [_name ].
Package_Service	she was very helpful and with no time changed my service into the one i wanted .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	i will be using this company for my deliveries .
Package_Service	i have send parcel across the uk and to canada and they have all got there safely and on time
Package_Service	i have used this often and found it to be an excellent service .
Package_Service	live_chat is efficient and i have spoken to richard who has sorted out some problems for me very easily .
Package_Service	i find that if a parcel is not collected , this is not parcelsgos fault ( or any other courier broker ) but an issue with the courier company themselves , and often can be down to an individual driver .
Package_Service	parcel0go site is easy to use and tracking works very well .
Package_Service	in particular i recommend the ups service .
Package_Service	used them about 00 times now , so i speak from experiance , ( not much but better_than just once )..
Package_Service	very helpful , always happy to ammend any mistakes you might make , and are very competitive ... will contiune to use ...
Package_Service	i booked a same day collection for next_day delivery as i needed an item to be returned before my 00 day return period was up .
Package_Service	i could have used the post_office otherwise and paid a little more for special delivery .
Package_Service	the driver didn ' t arrive .
Package_Service	i called the following_morning , they apologised , said it didn ' t lodge on the system properly and rebooked for that day .
Package_Service	still no collection .
Package_Service	i called again the following_day and was told that the first day the lorry was broken and the second the driver ran out of drive - time .
Package_Service	refused any form of compensation but booked again for the third time .
Package_Service	finally it was collected .
Package_Service	still no refund - not even a reduction in price to a 0 day service !
Package_Service	i only hope the company will accept the item return ...
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go for a while now , great prices and normally a good service .
Package_Service	i did use citylink before and they never turned_up half the time , i have been using their tnt next_day delivery service for a good while now and haven ' t had a problem upto_date :) thanks for a great service and fast delivery .
Package_Service	also great customer_service and support from sam at parcel0go :) cheers !
Package_Service	over the christmas_period , where delivery time take longer i was very pleased to see interparcel were advertising they were able to do a christmas_eve pick - up for next working day delivery .
Package_Service	unfortunately however this was not a product which they could deliver or even existed .
Package_Service	when i called the local ups depot ( who fulfil " interparcel ' s own " services ) they informed me they were not making any pick - ups that day and had not received the instruction from interparcel .
Package_Service	my pick - up was then delayed until 00th which was the next working , causing my shipment to be delayed , which has a knock - on effect on a subsequent delivery which had been scheduled with this in mind .
Package_Service	when i make a courier order , it is understandable things can be delayed , especially over the christmas_period .
Package_Service	what is completely_unacceptable is that interparcel sell a service which they have no_intention or method of fulfilling .
Package_Service	of course interparcel refused all blame for this .
Package_Service	appalling website accuracy and terrible customer_service .
Package_Service	normally don ' t do this sort of thing but after amazing service from andrea ( online_chat representative ) i felt i had to share my experience .
Package_Service	andrea fully understood my issues i had with city_link straight_away and rectified the problem painlessly and effectively .
Package_Service	thanks andrea !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	parcel0go service has been impeccable and will be using them again .
Package_Service	many_thanks to andrea and parcel0go
Package_Service	ian
Package_Service	never had any_problems with these_guys .
Package_Service	catherine was very helpful today :-)
Package_Service	i made a mistake on my email whilst ordering a collection , haveing just spoken to jessica , she was extremely_helpful and remade the order details correctly for me , and guided me through sorting the order out .
Package_Service	superb , thanks jessica !
Package_Service	i have used this company now 0 times and twice they have failed to collect my parcels .
Package_Service	the first time was for the delivery of christmas_presents which i had due for collection two_weeks before_christmas but after many phone_calls and e mails and promises were collected on the 00st december and delivered 0 days after christmas !
Package_Service	this week i used the service again and booked collection for yesterday 00th_february and after 00_minutes on the phone was told by daniel that i could travel to the next village 0 miles_away or he would arrange collect for friday .
Package_Service	this is truly a terrible company to deal with .
Package_Service	beware
Package_Service	my parcel was out for delivery and within hours of arriving and i needed to amend the address .
Package_Service	parcel0go stopped the delivery , changed the address and delivered the same day at no additional_cost a ++
Package_Service	sammie was really really really helpful with my parcels and also has very good taste in programs :)
Package_Service	i had a prob with the wrong collection address .. emma was quick to resolve this problem and i was pleased with the result , cheers emma :) - martin halliday
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel to go ireland to italy and uk to italy multiple_times over the last few_months and not had a problem .
Package_Service	pick_up has always been on time and delivered in good condition .
Package_Service	i made a booking error and contacted the team over twitter and it was sorted quick enough .
Package_Service	sam , steph and kate couldn ' t have been more helpful .
Package_Service	i ' ll continue to use them into the future
Package_Service	thanks catherine for helping me with the courier colletion and drop_off .
Package_Service	very friendly thank_you !
Package_Service	just had a query dealt_with by sammie_taylor and i must_say the service she provided was quick and efficient and she took care of my concerns straight_away .
Package_Service	she is a credit to your team and thank_you for sorting my problem out !
Package_Service	i am still sat here waiting for my delivery which i have been told twice today would be here by 0pm ( which seems very late - i have waited here like a numpty all day for the delivery ).
Package_Service	now it ' s past 0pm i see on their tracking notes that they delivered it to customer at 0 . 00pm which is an_absolute lie as i as still_waiting for it and was here at the time they say they delivered it - just disgraceful .
Package_Service	avoid these people at all costs would be my advice .
Package_Service	i guess i will phone them yet again in the morning and ask them who they think they delivered it to and hope against hope that it eventually arrives sometime tomorrow .
Package_Service	what a waste of a day ( again )
Package_Service	emma ' s ( five ) stellar performance made my parcel0go a gogo !
Package_Service	jenni dealt_with my problem today - she was extremely_helpful and left me a happier custome
Package_Service	muchas gracias jenni !!!
Package_Service	regards from züruch !
Package_Service	sammie_taylor stepped in as soon as i got stuck on your not - so - wonderful website and fixed it all for me !
Package_Service	interparcel are just a broker please remember this .
Package_Service	if you have any trouble they accept no responsibility .
Package_Service	after_reading the reports they all say the same , if the courier delivers all is good .
Package_Service	if the courier has any_problems interparcel are shocking at providing a level of service and customer_service one would expect after paying them your hard_earned cash .
Package_Service	i recently tried to send a parcel to south_africa .
Package_Service	i was sent documentation to attach to the parcel i was sending and followed all the correct directions .
Package_Service	on the 00th_may the parcel was due to be collected from my office , firstly it was declined due to having the collection address on the label and it might be delivered back to me .
Package_Service	i called the driver and question this who said he would call back and pick it up but later in the day after i had left work .
Package_Service	i spoke to interparcel to ask if this had been collected and they said no it hadn ’ t but would arrange for it to be collected on the 00st .
Package_Service	on the 00st i went to work and was informed the parcel had in fact been collected .
Package_Service	i spoke to interparcel who disputed this and told me it was still with me .
Package_Service	i asked for them to locate it and they said why if it was still with me .
Package_Service	after_speaking to the driver again he gave me the depot number of tnt who told me they had the package but the wrong documents were submitted from interparcel but i had to deal with them because i wasn ’ t a tnt customer i was an interparcel customer .
Package_Service	after convincing interparcel the package was at leeds depot ( only after i gave them the number to contact ) they then arranged for the package to be completed with the right documents , it the updated to say shipment in progress on the 00st at 0pm .
Package_Service	when i questioned this they made me aware on their online_chat that the process had recently changed regarding the paperwork and that they were unsure what they needed to do .
Package_Service	not off to a good start .
Package_Service	on the 0th_june still no update had been given and when i asked for the location of the parcel they said i had to wait another 00_hours for it to update and i had email confirmation from * interparcel_* a customer_services advisor :
Package_Service	“ dear ,
Package_Service	thank_you for your email .
Package_Service	at the moment it is being held in customs in south_africa .
Package_Service	should you require any further information then please do not hesitate to contact us .
Package_Service	kind_regards ,
Package_Service	* interparcel_*
Package_Service	customer_service advisor ”
Package_Service	to my shock horror on the evening of the 0th_june my parcel location was updated on their website stating the parcel was in leeds .... this again is the response ...
Package_Service	“ as it was stuck in customs i thought it would have been in cape_town , i also did advise you i wasn ' t sure that it was definitely in cape_town and that i would look_into it with tnt as the tracking does not explain where it is being held .”
Package_Service	sorry * interparcel_* where did you advise you were unsure ??
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	eventually though after_speaking with the depot again , i sent over some more documentation over the parcel was on the way .
Package_Service	i couldn ’ t help question why it had taken so long to arrive back in leeds .
Package_Service	“* interparcel_* says :
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 shipment received at origin depot .
Package_Service	leeds
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 shipment in transit .
Package_Service	leeds
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 shipment in transit .
Package_Service	leeds
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 shipment received at origin depot .
Package_Service	leeds
Package_Service	* interparcel_* says :
Package_Service	as you can see last scan was the 0th stating it is at leeds the previous scans are showing it was in transit to leeds
Package_Service	i said :
Package_Service	at 00 : 00 on the 00st it is received in leeds so how at 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 be on its way to leeds ?
Package_Service	* interparcel_* says :
Package_Service	i can not explain this any further than what i have done .
Package_Service	i am now close live help as i have already explained this to you .
Package_Service	it was in transit to leeds and the last scan is showing it has been received at leeds .
Package_Service	as you can als see the scans you are referring to are from a previous date that is how it can be in transit before it is received into leeds .
Package_Service	* interparcel_* says :
Package_Service	have a nice evening ”
Package_Service	he then closed the chat_session .
Package_Service	you would think this is where it ends .
Package_Service	eventually the package was received in cape_town ( honestly very quickly , but this is thank_you to tnts expediting skills ).
Package_Service	i then asked after 00_hours how come the package was not moving or being delivered .
Package_Service	they informed me that this was just customs and that i didn ’ t need to do anything .
Package_Service	this package was time sensitive so rather_than sitting back i located the package again in cape_town and spoke to a number of people there to my amazement this is the response ...
Package_Service	“ please do send a break down invoice as it is required by customs ”
Package_Service	“ should tnt not receive payment within 0 days , the uncleared goods will be transferred to the states warehouse for safekeeping and / or disposal , which would incur storage charges ”
Package_Service	kind_regards
Package_Service	* tnt *
Package_Service	clearance channel controller
Package_Service	the payment that was requested was a payment of a further £_00 .
Package_Service	this was broken down as additional taxes and administration fees do to incorrect documentation .
Package_Service	i questioned this and spoke to a manager in cape_town who did not charge the admin charges after i proved the amount of time i had corrected the invoices with interparcel and i had confirmation that it was right .
Package_Service	the final balance i had to pay was £_00 .
Package_Service	i have chat sessions where people have promised me actions that were not carried_out , lies about the parcel whereabouts and inadequate explanations of processes .
Package_Service	when i asked why i had not been informed about the delays when i asked was never answered but if i had not intervened then my parcel would now be destroyed .
Package_Service	when i said this was unacceptable and i had to solve the problems and discover them myself i received the comment “* interparcel_* says : its a self tracking service .”.
Package_Service	i have since complained sending 00 emails and 0 chat sessions .
Package_Service	they admitted there was a problem
Package_Service	“ i believe that the differing reports coming from tnt south_africa and tnt uk were regarding what was needed for export but what was also required for import .
Package_Service	in this way tnt uk may have received and processed everything they needed however further delays were due to tnt south_africa requiring additional information .”
Package_Service	they never mentioned the appalling and rude communications from their staff and have offered me £_00 off next order .
Package_Service	i have respectfully declined this and awaiting a further response .
Package_Service	the parcel was finally delivered on the 00th_june !
Package_Service	***** important *****
Package_Service	they seem to have swept the complaint under the rug , i have attempted to speak to someone_else and they have declined this .
Package_Service	however the person dealing_with the complaint will not make contact to discuss the matter_further .
Package_Service	after a chat_session with someone i thought it would be great so know some facts .
Package_Service	i said :
Package_Service	can i ask under what circumstances would compensation be given from interparcel or is it always the courier that is subcontracted by you ?
Package_Service	** interparcel ** says :
Package_Service	we do not offer compensation , we have transit cover in place for loss or damage and if a service is guaranteed then we will refund the shipment costs
Package_Service	i said :
Package_Service	so the service that is provided by your company is purely customer_service and technically you do not have anything to do with the parcel as you are a broker and the ' contract ' is held with the company that expedites the package ?
Package_Service	** interparcel ** says :
Package_Service	yes
Package_Service	** interparcel ** says :
Package_Service	your contract is with us when you place the booking ; our contracts are with the couriers
Package_Service	i said :
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	i wanted to cancel my order , and sammie_taylor cancelled my order in a second and i got my refund back .
Package_Service	very professional !
Package_Service	for various reasons , i ' ve missed my chance to get something couriered across the uk but the advice i received from katie over livechat was very clear and helpful and nicely delivered .
Package_Service	based on this , i shall use the company for my next delivery .
Package_Service	thankyou [_name ] for your help and speedy replies !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	on three occasions over the last few_years , interparcel have failed to collect ( and therefore deliver ) my parcels .
Package_Service	we ' ve used 0 different couriers through them at 0 different_addresses .
Package_Service	0 ) no collection , no response from customer_service .
Package_Service	had to write to get a response and a refund .
Package_Service	this was right when they started , so we thought maybe things were better .
Package_Service	0 ) using myhermes via interparcel - no collection even after phoning and emailing every day .
Package_Service	empty promises daily .
Package_Service	cancelled it after a few_days , and sent with another firm .
Package_Service	the myhermes driver then turned_up the next_day !!
Package_Service	he was grumpy and unpleasant to add_insult to injury .
Package_Service	0 ) using tnt via interparcel - no collection !
Package_Service	rang at 0 . 00pm on the collection day and was assured of a colleciton by 0 . 00pm .
Package_Service	nobody turned_up .
Package_Service	gave them a shout via_email - received a " canned " response that was totally unapologetic .
Package_Service	empty promises and poor customer care are my experiences of interparcel .
Package_Service	will not be using them ever again and suggest that anyone reading this do the same .
Package_Service	there are plenty of other_companies around and it really is worth an extra couple of quid to get the customer_service , and get the parcel collected and delivered !
Package_Service	great help from rose .
Package_Service	quik responce .
Package_Service	i felt_like she really cares_about my problem .
Package_Service	would recommend to anyone .
Package_Service	i needed shipping some belongings to mexico and parcelhero came in price comparison as by_far most cost_effective .
Package_Service	although i haven ' t heard about it before , i felt reassured by previous customers reviews .
Package_Service	on time collection , proof of shipping provided .
Package_Service	delivered to mexico in 0 days , as specified in the quote , despite of warning it may take longer if held at customs .
Package_Service	package arrived in undamaged condition , with all the content intact .
Package_Service	the only_downside was taxes charged by customs that i was asked to pay on collection , which were 00 %(!)
Package_Service	of the estimated value of the content ( which was under the real value ).
Package_Service	so i guess it ' s important to find balance between insuring the content in case it gets lost but within the reason , to avoid high charges at customs .
Package_Service	overall very happy with the service and will certainly use again .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor has always been the perfect customer_service rep , have spoken a few_times and the problem has always been resolved instantly and perfectly , makes me come back to p0g time and time again .
Package_Service	been using this service for around a year now and not once had a problem with it ( although i don ' t use the hermes or tnt services offered as i haven ' t had the best experiences with these in the past ).
Package_Service	the biggest advantage of interparcel is the prices .
Package_Service	it is so much cheaper_than going directly to the companies and i ' ve saved loads of money now i don ' t have to book directly with tnt or other couriers .
Package_Service	one job tnt quoted £_00 to do when i called them but it was just £ 0ish on interparcel .
Package_Service	i always go for the interparcel standard or premium ( i think this is operated by ups ) and it is a very good service .
Package_Service	always here promptly the day after i book it or even on the same day if booked early enough and always arrives the next_day .
Package_Service	also , if you put in the times you would like them to arrive to collect , they always seem to stick to it .
Package_Service	staff are friendly and helpful when i ' ve had to call and the drivers are all very efficient and friendly .
Package_Service	highly_recommended .
Package_Service	after having a nightmare experience with a similar company , i decided to give parcel0go a try .
Package_Service	due to issues caused by the other company ( booking the collection in , and then cancelling it saying they couldn ' t deliver , only to collect the parcel which then went missing for 00_hours and was delivered to the customer damaged when it should have been returned to us ) i unfortunately had to first reschedule the collection , which was incredibly easy and just took a couple clicks on the website , and then to cancel the collection .
Package_Service	i did find it a little_confusing working out how to cancel a parcel and how to contact someone directly but did work it out in the end .
Package_Service	i spoke to emma on the live web help who had the collection cancelled in minutes .
Package_Service	very friendly and helpful customer_service from emma and overall very satisfied with my experience of using parcel0go .
Package_Service	right now , i hate your service so much that if parcel_force and yodel said in order for me to receive my parcel they would require me to be kicked in the testicles each time , i would prefer their service to yours ...
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go for some time and recommended them to other businesses .
Package_Service	they are professional and sincere .
Package_Service	like all businesses , things don ' t always go to plan .
Package_Service	but when things go_wrong they deal with the issues and have a plan in action in minutes .
Package_Service	out of the many_times i ' ve used parcel0go i can_honestly say i have only had one problem , a parcel wasn ' t picked_up , but i contacted them online and spoke to a lady_called amber , she had the parcel re - booked and new labels emailed to me .
Package_Service	parcel0go did everything at their end but the courier just didnt turn_up .
Package_Service	needless to say this would never put me off using parcel0go .
Package_Service	their service is spot on .
Package_Service	parcels are picked_up on time and delivered safely .
Package_Service	ive even shipped to the usa without a glitch , problem or any damage to any box .
Package_Service	overall 00 / 00 for the service , the ease of use and they way problems ( if any ) are dealt_with
Package_Service	better opening_hours that royal_mail plus cheaper and bigger boxes too .
Package_Service	what else you can wish for ?
Package_Service	i spoke with stephane this evening to help me find where my local drop_off points are , she was quick and effective in answer all my questions .
Package_Service	also provided with the closest pick_up point for the person receiving gift too .
Package_Service	fantastic service .
Package_Service	thankyou
Package_Service	as i am always in a rush i have put the addresses for collection and delivery the wrong way round .
Package_Service	using parcels0go ' s webchat i chatted with dianne who came online instantly , and understood my error and rectified it straight_away .
Package_Service	a confirmation was sent for peace of mind and when the tracking was not working i web chatted to adam who confirmed the right addresses and gave me the right tracking_number .
Package_Service	polite , professional and quick .
Package_Service	thank_you dianne & adam
Package_Service	was unsure_about sending cake so i used the online_chat where rose helped_me with all my enquiries .
Package_Service	cheers !
Package_Service	sarah_hayes was quick .
Package_Service	clear .
Package_Service	and spelt properly .
Package_Service	sarah_hayes ....
Package_Service	i love you .
Package_Service	you know what they say , if parcel0go can ' t get something done .
Package_Service	give it to sarah_hayes , she ' ll get the job_done .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor - very helpful
Package_Service	my husband forgot some important items for a buisness trip and emma was not only friendly but also very helpful and helped_me to choose the right service for us .
Package_Service	i am very impressed with the service and will be using it again .
Package_Service	thank_you emma - crisis averted !
Package_Service	sarah_hayes is wonderful , super efficient and very helpful .
Package_Service	[_name ] was a very helpful advisor on live_chat and rectified my problem quickly and efficiently thank_you
Package_Service	my parcel was supposed to be delivered at 00th of december , i was not aware of this company trash services , so it was okay for me , i wake_up early so i could pick my parcel , happens that around 00 : 00 they updated to : " the customer was not available on the 0st attempt .
Package_Service	a 0nd attempt will be made ."
Package_Service	which is tottaly not true , because i was home the whole time , but well , i had to wait the whole weekend to get the 0nd attempt .
Package_Service	so as on the first day , i stood in my home the whole day .
Package_Service	surprisingly , at around 00 : 00 they updated the track status to : " the customer was not available on the 0nd attempt .
Package_Service	a 0rd attempt will be made .
Package_Service	", which again is a total lie , and i decided to call customer_service the moment i saw that message , which was around 00 : 00 , he told me he was going to mark my delivery as urgent , and the driver would call me in 0 hour or so , regarding my delivery , pure lie , i waited for like 0 hours so i could call customer_service again , the new guy that answered told he could see that i had called before regarding this ( like if it is of any help ), he then checked my phone , which was correct , and told me , that in the next_day , the collection centre ( or something like that ) would call me , and he told me that they would ensure that the driver would deliver it to me , as i told him repeated times that they were lying about the delivery details , cause i was there all the time .
Package_Service	well , so now , new years_eve , i lost virtually all my day , waiting for the package , which was ensured to be arriving today , because of those liars and unrespectful attendants .
Package_Service	it is not a time critical parcel , i wouldn ' t mind to receive it with some delays if christmas delivery are overloaded , but i can ' t understand_why they lie to us , it ' s unrespectful , so i ' d say that if you have a time critical product , don ' t go for ups , or better , i ' d say don ' t go with ups at all , pure trash company .
Package_Service	where do i start .
Package_Service	from the very beginning pacel0go made a complete arse of what is there main job !
Package_Service	rough drunken delivery driver from hermes stumbled & fell collecting the parcel from my work , i could smell the alcohol on his breath .
Package_Service	then they managed to lose 0 x huge boxes containing alloy_wheels .
Package_Service	the stupid driver also never gave me any proof of collection so there was no tractability !
Package_Service	no customer_service ( they do this on purpose so it ' s impossible to contact them when something_goes_wrong ) useless !!!!
Package_Service	avoid !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i have just been speaking to sarah_hayes on live_chat from parcel0go about an issue i had with a parcel , she has kindly rebooked with another courier for me and was very helpful .
Package_Service	thank_you and well_done for the customer_service .
Package_Service	i wanted to send some parcels with parcel0go but was unsure as to how to go about it .
Package_Service	i opened a customer chat box and received outstanding and friendly advice from catherine_corless .
Package_Service	i now know everything i need to do before sending my packages .
Package_Service	so , again thank_you .
Package_Service	after realising we have left it so late to send a birthday parcel i went online for quotes and wondered who could get it there in time .
Package_Service	i discovered p0go , the site is easy and gave lots of options .
Package_Service	the only problem i had was that i would be out of the house for 0hours on collection day and worried that the courier would arrive in that time so i decided to speak with an operator .
Package_Service	i was spoken to by catherine who was very quick , efficient and polite and helped_me very quickly .
Package_Service	she arranged for us to drop the parcel to a depot near my partners work which he passes on his route .
Package_Service	meaning it can be delivered in time and no - one needs to wait in the house .
Package_Service	excellent service and very good prices :) :)
Package_Service	all of my customer_service experiences with this company have been terrible .
Package_Service	the first issue i had once was when a parcel had arrive and had a hole in the box and the item that looks_like it could have only been caused by a cannon .
Package_Service	parcel0go refused to refund my shipping as the item had technically been delivered .
Package_Service	the second experience was with an item that was lost .
Package_Service	due to my previous experience i made it very clear that i wanted the shipping refunded as they failed to deliver the item .
Package_Service	upon_receiving my compensation cheque it didn ' t not include the shipping fee .
Package_Service	when contacting their customer_service i was batted between different_departments .
Package_Service	i have had dealings with [_name ] and he has been very efficient in escalating and resolving my claims ; however this should be done in the first place and not need to be a last resort .
Package_Service	try to avoid if you can .
Package_Service	you really do get what you pay for it seems .
Package_Service	the customer_service is excellent !
Package_Service	thank_you to my agent gemma , who delt with my issue !
Package_Service	sorted it out for me in seconds !
Package_Service	brilliant company !
Package_Service	i was asked to send a parcel for a friend but i needed to leave a message and was not sure how to do it but i went on live_chat and spoke to emily who very happily and quickly helped_me and sorted it out with a great attitude and enthusiasm for the job top work as usual parcels to go and most_importantly emily :)
Package_Service	i sent a parcel through this site , and the recipient had the wrong parcel delivered .
Package_Service	when i first called i was told someone would ring me back before the end of the evening .
Package_Service	when nobody did i contacted them through the live_chat .
Package_Service	it went on that a manager couldn ' t call me to discuss the problem , only to have 0 chat to me on line .
Package_Service	then she called me a liar and informed me i couldn ' t have an answer for up to 00_hours .
Package_Service	i used this service a lot before this but will not be using it again .
Package_Service	if anyone is thinking about sending a parcel i suggest doing it direct with the courier and not use parcel 0 go
Package_Service	just had my order delivered .
Package_Service	may be late , but the driver apologised and said he had been out all day trying to get it all delivered and doesn ' t have enough time in the day .
Package_Service	can ' t argue with that at all .
Package_Service	its a busy time of the year and although ive been in all day .
Package_Service	got my parcel with a reason of lateness .
Package_Service	fantastic quick and helpful service .
Package_Service	needed to re - book a parcel and was dealt_with immediately by a very helpful and lovely girl named sarah .
Package_Service	thank_you very much !
Package_Service	from , chloe :)
Package_Service	i had been trying in vain to navigate the sites of several companies like royal_mail till i came upon this site !
Package_Service	its been a great find , i was getting increasinly frustrated until catherine_corless appeared in the live_chat window on the parcel0go website .
Package_Service	she was fast , friendly , helpful , honest and real .
Package_Service	she answered my queries and navigated my confusions with calmness , understanding and was quick to offer a solution to my problem and answer all my questions , all with a virtual smile !
Package_Service	:) i would definitely_recommend parcel0go , especially with employees like catherine , they deliver on their promises .
Package_Service	keep up the good work !
Package_Service	if you posting something to the customer please do not use them .
Package_Service	they are unprofessional .
Package_Service	not collected on the day it was booked , and they told me my guarantee comes in only when the goods are collected .
Package_Service	i never left a bad review in my life before , but i just do not have a patience for this appoling company
Package_Service	emma was very helpful on chat today .
Package_Service	i use them about for 00 parcels a week , within 0 years i have only have about 0 minor hiccups and 0 parcels gone_missing , but again it ' s from about 000 parcels .
Package_Service	i definitely do not like the way how they scare you with insurance .
Package_Service	i understand it is where they make their money , but is not ethical to do it on our fear .
Package_Service	reasonable insurance / industry standard is more about 0 %, but they have it about 0 . 0 % from content value .
Package_Service	that insurance factor is the only reason they get 0 / 0 , otherwise it would be 0 . 0 / 0
Package_Service	oh_yeah .... it is somewhat hard to connect to customer_service chat .
Package_Service	i was given fullest support by the agent and very pleasant and helpful throughout the order process .
Package_Service	even explain every thing from start to end about the collection and delivery , cover options .
Package_Service	highly valued service .
Package_Service	recommended for everyone who want to use courier service reliable .
Package_Service	cheers
Package_Service	the worst experience regarding delivery services !
Package_Service	still i gave it 0_stars due to a good soul working at the depot who did everything he could to sort out my problem .
Package_Service	monday_morning got a text_saying " your parcel will be with you today " as i was on my way to work , called in sick and ran home .
Package_Service	and waited , waited and waited , at 0pm decided to check the website and track my order , when to my surprise it says " your parcel was sent back as it was a duplicate order " huh_?
Package_Service	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn ' t think too much about it .
Package_Service	0 :_00pm came by and i finally decided to call a customer_service number i found online .
Package_Service	she then tells_me that i wasn ' t at home when the driver stopped by ...
Package_Service	what ?????
Package_Service	that ' s a lie !
Package_Service	have been on the sofa watching stupid tv_shows all day long waiting for the driver , he never came !!!!
Package_Service	she then checked the gps and it was confirmed that the driver had been nowhere_near my place .
Package_Service	she then tried to contact the driver unsuccessfully + the depot also unsuccessfully .
Package_Service	its now 0 : 00 and she tells_me she finishes at 0 and as she cant get thru the driver nor the depot i ' ll have to call back in the morning !
Package_Service	hahahaha you gotta be joking , keep trying !!!
Package_Service	i didn ' t miss work for nothing !
Package_Service	at 0 . 00 , after being on hold she finally manage to get thru to the depot and came up with a ridiculous story saying the driver had gone to the wrong_address and the person at that address had said they ' d already got their item .
Package_Service	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
Package_Service	i now had to call currys to sort out this issue in order for them to re - deliver my parcel and as they refused to allocate me a time_slot i then arranged for thursday .
Package_Service	thursday 0pm , still no parcel , i called customer_services again and to my surprise there is no record on the system regarding my parcel .
Package_Service	i called the depot and its is confirmed that my parcel hasn ' t been dispatched and also that they don ' t know where it is .... is this for real ???
Package_Service	i lost my temper and had a go at the person talking to me .
Package_Service	mr kwame then after apologizing a million times said he will find it and sort it out .
Package_Service	0 hours_later he called me back , he had located my parcel and was gonna send it to my house .
Package_Service	it arrived at 0pm .
Package_Service	thanks to mr kwame i didn ' t have to waste another day waiting for nothing .
Package_Service	everybody else i spoke with were useless , specially customer_service , if they can be called that .
Package_Service	by choice i ' ll never use them again .
Package_Service	[_name ] is very polite and friendly .
Package_Service	she guided me through the whole refunding process and noticed everything that i should be aware .
Package_Service	i think she is the best example for typical advisors that customers would love to meet when they have questions .
Package_Service	i had a query about my account and emma couldn ' t have been more helpful .
Package_Service	she was pleasant and sorted it out straight_away .
Package_Service	parcel0go have saved me loads of money and i would recommend them to anyone :_d
Package_Service	thanks for yr help
Package_Service	rebooked my parcel for same day collection and emailed my label emma was very helpful and fast at sorting my problem out like the live help will use again
Package_Service	samantha was very quick when dealing_with my problem , booked a collection for me as i was unable to do so , done it in quick time , very helpful , much_appreciated !
Package_Service	love whoever ashley is :) she was so quick to answer my questions , and i had few .
Package_Service	and everything was just so easy .
Package_Service	i do not like complicated websites with too many buttons etc .
Package_Service	the chat was so easy to use and ever so quick .
Package_Service	once again , thank_you ashley
Package_Service	the online assistant catherine is very helpful .
Package_Service	she made my experience so much_easier and pleasant especially i ' m under the time pressure .
Package_Service	well_done !
Package_Service	will_definitely use again and recommended to friends and family .
Package_Service	a brilliant service , offering the cheapest and easiest service .
Package_Service	daniel was a great help on live_chat and sorted a small issue i had quickly and without_hesitation .
Package_Service	by_far the best parcel service online !
Package_Service	this is an awful courier company .
Package_Service	they have lost so many parcel ' s and not compensated for them as i didn ' t purchase the more_expensive delivery charge - obviously i assumed that they would do their jobs properly and deliver the parcel as it ' s not rocket_science .
Package_Service	they kept leaving parcels outside unattended - so they said .
Package_Service	completely and utterly incompetent .
Package_Service	customer_service agent : emma ,
Package_Service	00 / 00 perfect service .
Package_Service	i ordered some items late thursday_night .
Package_Service	did not expect them to arrive until wednesday .
Package_Service	i am so pleased that the items i purchased arrived monday_afternoon .
Package_Service	herpes are a friendly service and you can see what stage your parcel is at .
Package_Service	also the courier driver is friendly and has a big smile on their face .
Package_Service	absolutely_brilliant .
Package_Service	definitely will recommend and use again
Package_Service	i use parcel0go . com alot through 0 accounts and i must_say they are by_far the best out there for arranging parcels collections / deliverys !!!
Package_Service	i have used others ([ external reference ], [_external reference ],[ external reference ]) and they are all absolutely_useless with no customer care at all !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	but not parcel0go they really are the best there is .
Package_Service	easy to talk to and deal with , quick to respond to any issue including disputes / refunds .
Package_Service	just spoke to [_name ] and she was fantastic sorting all problems there and then .
Package_Service	praise where praise is due don ' t waste your time or money on any other_companies ...
Package_Service	absolutely perfect , emma was great
Package_Service	i had a few questions about postage and spoke to a live_chat advisor ( sammie_taylor ) who was very friendly and helpful .
Package_Service	i was very happy with the service i received and would highly_recommend to someone_else !
Package_Service	parceltogo excellent would highly_recommend lovely to chat to and very helpfull george helped_me alot
Package_Service	well what can i say , i had some trouble with a certain courier service that weren ' t to much help , surprise_surprise .. anyway got back onto parcel - to - go , and got on to the live helpline were i was talking to a very help full worker by the name of sammie_taylor ..
Package_Service	sammie helped rebook my parcel with in a few minutes , and was very help full in answering any_questions i had ...
Package_Service	thanks again
Package_Service	spoke to a parcel0go_agent ( emma ) who was extremely helpfull , patient ( god_knows you need to be with me lol ) and helped_me with any and everything i needed assistance with ... very happy with the prices , you just cant_beat them to be honest , thanks to your service / price / lovely agent emma you now have a permenant customer :) ... highly_recomended
Package_Service	i use parcel0go on a regular_basis and they are always very helpful when i need to speak to them .
Package_Service	will_continue to use with confidence .
Package_Service	spoke to catherine this morning and she rearranged my collection within about 00 seconds .
Package_Service	excellent customer_service !
Package_Service	i needed to ship a large package from the uk to australia and this company was by_far the cheapest i could find online , the additional insurance was also much_better value than other courier brokers too .
Package_Service	quick and easy booking process and also includes links for printing documents .
Package_Service	superb , would thoroughly_recommend .
Package_Service	[_name ] was a great help !
Package_Service	was really quick and efficient to my queries !
Package_Service	great help , all the info i needed .
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	spoke with agent emma , who sorted my issue straight_away , very impressed .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	i had problems with the order for some reason and it said to contact them on live_chat .
Package_Service	catherine answered and handled it very professionally and quickly .
Package_Service	thanks a lot !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	had an amazing service from these_guys .
Package_Service	really easy to arrange a pick_up of an item i wanted to return to an ebay merchant , and tracking was really useful as well .
Package_Service	the ebay merchant is also refunding my return post costs , but i did not have an invoice for the postage , so i contacted parcel0go customer_services through live_chat and spoke to rowan , who was really friendly , and helped_me with my query really efficiently .
Package_Service	fantastic service !
Package_Service	i had queries about the turnaround time for drop_off and collection service provided by hermes as well as finding the nearest drop_off point from my house . emily from parcel0go was very pleasant , efficient and quick in answering those . great asset to the company !
Package_Service	i was assisted by the live_chat_session helper " jenny " regarding whereabout my parcel .
Package_Service	she has provided enough information to let me know the status of my parcel .
Package_Service	this is certainly helpful , and save alot of money and time than waiting and calling the service centre and would recommend other customer to use this helpful live_chat service .
Package_Service	i would like to mention that i had a chat with a very competent advisor named richard .
Package_Service	he knew everything i needed to know , and was quick to help me out and advise me on the best possible service for my needs .
Package_Service	i wish there were more people like him , who are competent and straight the point when good advice is needed promptly .
Package_Service	richard is an asset to parcel0go , and i do wish his abilities , strengths and positive contributions to this company are recognised .
Package_Service	richard is the type of individual that i would gladly recruit to work in my own company .
Package_Service	perfect one stop_shop for comparative quotes on parcel services .
Package_Service	i experienced an issue with my delivery address postcode format which lead me on to a live_chat with the agent sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	sammie was keen to assist in any way , including processing my order for me !
Package_Service	very helpful indeed !
Package_Service	thanks for the help sammie :)
Package_Service	had to contact them as account locked out .
Package_Service	immediately got through to catherine on the live_chat and my account was unlocked within a minute and i was able to continue processing orders .
Package_Service	fastest and most polite customer_service i have received in a long time .
Package_Service	emily was fantastic , she really helped_me , out of all the operators at parcel0go she is the best
Package_Service	great service no_complaints apart_from the label .
Package_Service	the label generated uses far too much paper wish they would just give you the actual label ( what you ' re cutting out ) and not a label with a load of useless text , it could fit of an a0 piece of paper but am force to use a0 would be even better if they had support for label printing machine !
Package_Service	used on several_occasions and always been problem free , used mainly for the tnt service which you can book up until midday which helps as most you have to wait in the whole day .
Package_Service	loved my live_chat experienced with catherine yesterday , felt real , geunine and i could of have easily continued chatting with this lovely_lady all day long .
Package_Service	fantastic service with fantastic prices .
Package_Service	this operator help me and went above and beyond the call of duty .
Package_Service	once we got the nitty gritty out the way she relaxed and we chatted about her lovely little puppies .
Package_Service	so in conclusion use parcel0go . com and ask for catherine on live_chat !!!!!
Package_Service	thanks guys and look_forward to doing_business with yourselves soon :-)
Package_Service	iv used parcels0go for some time now find it easy and help from there is great i rate this as a 0 star as a brill and good way of sending parcels hasel free and live help kirsty was brill :) no_problems
Package_Service	parcel0go is a brilliant way to send parcels for a good price .
Package_Service	the costumer_service is great and jon was able to help me with all my questions in the chat_function !
Package_Service	0_stars !
Package_Service	in the rush of shipping out a clients work i noticed at last_minute on the day of collection i had entered the wrong destination address !
Package_Service	first thing in the morning a fantastic assistant sarah , helped and moved to a different courier with no extra charge or delays in the parcel .
Package_Service	how can you fault that ?
Package_Service	00 / 00 would use again .
Package_Service	just have a chat with the online service [ katie ] to rebook my parcel collection , really efficient and helpful .
Package_Service	i was having a nightmare with an order .
Package_Service	sarah dealt_with my issue in an extremely fast and efficient way - thank_you !
Package_Service	i had an issue with my account ( it was locked out )
Package_Service	i used the online_chat service and was connected to sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	she dealt_with my query quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	i can now log in to my account again .
Package_Service	0 starts for her !
Package_Service	sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	i made an error , put in billing_address instead of shipping address .
Package_Service	sarah assisted me quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	excellent service !
Package_Service	i had to send back a bathroom cabinet back to the retailer urgently in order to comply with the 0 day distance_selling regulations for unwanted items .
Package_Service	the booking process was nice and simple however after i got the confirmation and printed off all the paperwork ready for it to be collected , i got an_email the next_day stating that the collection had been cancelled as they had " problems delivering to the post code before ".
Package_Service	this was unexpected - i would expect a parcel company to be able to deliver to any postcode !
Package_Service	i was not impressed .
Package_Service	so i booked with [_external reference_] instead - 0_stars for them , 0_stars for you !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i ' ve been bitten before using cut - price courier companies , huge parcels " going missing " aka nicked by the driver ( parcel0go , i ' m looking at you ) so was somewhat wary of using another .
Package_Service	however , courierpoint collected a 00kg parcel and delivered it to france within 0 days for under £_00 .
Package_Service	recommended to all .
Package_Service	the company managed to " lose " a 00kg parcel , jokers .
Package_Service	i sent numerous_emails endeavouring to find out where my parcel was ( it was showing on their system as " out for delivery ").
Package_Service	they also doctor the feedback on their website so that only good reviews are published .
Package_Service	in conclusion , they offer , in my experience , an appalling service and should be avoided .
Package_Service	very helpful , professional and well_mannered customer_service representative by the name of [_name ].
Package_Service	make the process of cancelling an order very easy and stress_free .
Package_Service	i would defiantly recommend this company and their services to a friend
Package_Service	had to use live_chat to find an answer .
Package_Service	[_name ] helped_me find a solution that worked .
Package_Service	:-)
Package_Service	i ' ve used interparcel on many occasions and wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend .
Package_Service	their rates are as low as you can get , but the service is second to none .
Package_Service	i usually use ups for my uk deliveries as i ' ve never had a late parcel and the driver is super friendly !
Package_Service	if you are looking to send a parcel then you won ' t find a better company than interparcel !
Package_Service	super helpful customer_service will_definitely use again thanks for your help !
Package_Service	did exactly_what we wanted , a quick efficient and relatively inexpensive courier who came when they said , delivered on time and kept us up to date via_email .
Package_Service	excellent
Package_Service	my printer broke , and i thought i was in real trouble .
Package_Service	i attempted going on the online live_chat , thinking that it wouldn ' t work ( baring in mind it was on a sunday at 00 : 00 ish ).
Package_Service	immediately a reply came through .

Package_Service	i ' ve used this service a lot but decided to review after a big bout of stupid from my very own self .
Package_Service	i normally send a lot of parcels but on this occasion was arranging a parcel to be collected and sent to me .
Package_Service	but i put my address as the collection , not delivery address .
Package_Service	moron !
Package_Service	i only realised when i ' d paid and went straight to live_chat on facebook , spoke to richard the parcel0go representative and he just fixed it and sent new labels .
Package_Service	really good .
Package_Service	p0g is always my first choice when i need to send large parcels within the uk .
Package_Service	when i needed to cancel a collection today , the live_chat operator ( sammie_taylor ) made it very simple and straightforward - no hassle at all !
Package_Service	i spoke to katie via the parcel0go . com live help chat online to gather more information .
Package_Service	the service was quick to respond and was free instead of calling which cost 00p from a bt landline .
Package_Service	would use this service again .
Package_Service	love this service .
Package_Service	very easy to use site which gives me access to discount pricing normally only reserved for high_volume contract customers .
Package_Service	thanks to emily whom chatted with my partner today , and sorted out the massive confusion of where my 0 parsells where as nobody else could she found out where they were and explained why they where in the wrong place and sorted out that my parcel will be either re directed back to me or delivered to the right address asap .
Package_Service	i spent_ages trying to amend a collection date and just did not figure_out what to do at all .
Package_Service	i thought i ' d try the online_chat but when i ' ve used these sorts of chats before with different companies - it ' s always been a massive pain !
Package_Service	i ended_up speaking to jenny and within 0 minutes , my parcel had been amended and my problem solved .
Package_Service	fluster free !
Package_Service	could not commend her service anymore - cheers jenny !
Package_Service	spoke to sammy_taylor she made me feel very comfortable and was clear and concise with her advice
Package_Service	a colleague of mine used this service back in july and it was excellent .
Package_Service	however , on the accounts side i was getting frustrated that i couldn ' t optain an invoice .
Package_Service	but today after_speaking to daniel on the live help i found out that i was looking for the wrong information from the wrong company .
Package_Service	within minutes of giving my reference_number daniel had it all sorted for me .
Package_Service	what a speedy service !!!
Package_Service	i will_definately but using them again both for business and personal deliveries !
Package_Service	they picked the item up and delivered exactly when they said they would and a friendly guy delivered it straight to my door .
Package_Service	i have always found parcel0go services to be absolutely exemplary !
Package_Service	i tried to send a parcel to rwanda and it was an_absolute nightmare .. until jessica came to rescue me !

Package_Service	speaking to me almost during 0h00 minutes .

Package_Service	thanks !!
Package_Service	jody
Package_Service	i have used interparcel on several_occasions over the past few_years , they always save me time and money , their standard service in my opinion is the best , managed by ups and i have had no issues .
Package_Service	i steer_clear of yodel as i ' ve never had a smooth_transaction with them when being delivered too !
Package_Service	and city_link can be good or bad , but ups are a fab provider especially when used through interparcel .
Package_Service	i have had only one issue in a couple of dozen ( regarding duplicate payments ), which was resolved quickly and amicably .
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	fast and efficient service from sarah_h , very very helpful indeed !
Package_Service	thanks for your help today :)
Package_Service	[_name ] dealt_with my query with in a matter of minutes and allowed me to continue my evening uninterrupted .
Package_Service	[_name ] was very thorough and successfully dealt_with my issue at the first attempt .
Package_Service	i was very happy with my experience - if only all customer_service reps were this good !
Package_Service	thanks again .
Package_Service	after booking a parcel collection i accidentally chose the wrong collection day .
Package_Service	jenny was more_than helpful and managed to change the date for me within a couple of minutes and send me the new receipts and label .
Package_Service	excellent service , 0 / 0
Package_Service	lauren was extremely_helpful in changing a courier for me ... from collect by city_link to drop_off with ups ... all done via web chat whilst i was stuck on mexico .
Package_Service	amazing service
Package_Service	i have used collect_plus many_times some missing but money given back so fully covered but more good than bad .
Package_Service	great prices and now the option for more cover and signature i recommend 000_% to use .
Package_Service	brilliant and cheap i highly_recommended
Package_Service	actually i never knew there is a courier service like parcel0go , i order a collected which the seller told me she won ' t be at home until 0 days ahead , i was curious on how to go about re - booking the collection date .
Package_Service	i went to the chat and met mr adam who took his time and rebook my collection date to the date the seller will be at home all day .
Package_Service	wow i was so happy .
Package_Service	friends its all about p0g , lets go ...................
Package_Service	very friendly staff , and a fast response to problems i had .
Package_Service	would fully recommend them
Package_Service	i spoke to paul on live_chat and he was very helpful and dealt and helped_me with my enquiry very quickly x
Package_Service	after a very poor services delivered by tnt many_times by not collecting my items .
Package_Service	the last thing i expect was a good customer_services .
Package_Service	then here comes the guy call richard ( richard_mileham )
Package_Service	i first wanted to rearrange the delivery to a different address and richard did it straight_away .
Package_Service	then i changed my mind , and asked him that i might want to drop the parcel to a collection point .
Package_Service	then he send me all the information including my local_depot including the phone number and told me to drop the items .
Package_Service	still i was not sure using tnt .
Package_Service	so i changed my mind again .
Package_Service	then i asked him is it possible for me to change the services .
Package_Service	at this point i know that i have been bit difficult :) but surprisingly richard said of course he can change that for me .
Package_Service	then he send me the label i need for ups ( the services i wanted ) and then he offer a refund for the balance .
Package_Service	also he help me to sort out my account .
Package_Service	i didn ' t even know i had a parcel to go account :)
Package_Service	this is a type of a customer_services that we all not expect when we contact a company .
Package_Service	i wish i get this type of services every time i contact parcel to go .
Package_Service	richard_mileham gave me an excellent , personalized solution for my problem .
Package_Service	so when he ask for a feedback .
Package_Service	that is the least i could do .
Package_Service	a real credit to p0g customer_service should be like this .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	pat
Package_Service	been using this service for quite a while now and very rarely have any_problems .
Package_Service	we had a parcel returned because the customer refused due to the box being damaged by the courier .
Package_Service	katie was very helpful and friendly and sorted out a full_refund within a couple of minutes .
Package_Service	one small note , it can sometimes be a little difficult to find the live help , would be good if it was available from the home page !
Package_Service	easy to use website , lots of payment options , had a problem with citylink but the other couriers cannot be_faulted , and the service fro parcel0go is outstanding they sorted my problem out really quickly
Package_Service	one whole month i had to wait for compensation payment for a parcel that parcel0go had lost .
Package_Service	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
Package_Service	many_times with the livechat i was sent away and told to wait with no direct answer .
Package_Service	the people ( i ' m_guessing they were people on the other end ) were rude and not very helpful at all .
Package_Service	that was until today when ashley was able to sort out my refund giving me a number of payment options .
Package_Service	he gave me direct answer straight_away without making me wait .
Package_Service	although my experience with the company thus_far was awful i must_say ashley turned it around :) i would recomend the company as the prices are very good but i would suggest cover as parcels do get lost and you wont get the value of the products unless your covered .
Package_Service	all in all i see that there are some workers who literally carry the company .
Package_Service	hopefully all the hard work will be noticed and due praise and promotion given .
Package_Service	thank_you ashley :)
Package_Service	p0g number : p0g - 00000000
Package_Service	i truly wonder if the parcel0go service can get any worst ..
Package_Service	i paid them to deliver my laptop and it was subsequently lost , found and then returned to the me smashed , four weeks after sending it and despite filing claims and numerous_emails today they sent me this :
Package_Service	' please_accept my apologies for the damages caused to your goods and any inconvenience this matter may have caused you thus_far .
Package_Service	my apologies again mr ******, i have credited you pre_- pay account with £_00 . 00 should you ever wish to allow us to restore faith '
Package_Service	so having returned a smashed laptop ( worth £_000 . 00 ) they credited my account with £_00 . 00 ; notwithstanding the fact that i have already paid them £ 0 . 00 for a failed delivery , so they actually credited me £_00 . 00 to spend with them .
Package_Service	the policy of parceltogo appears to treat the customer with utter contempt and an attitude that it ’_s not our fault so we couldn ' t care less .
Package_Service	i have been insulted at every_stage by parcel0go and frankly the latest one of adding £_00 . 00 to a pre_- pay account is the final_straw , for the sake of good manners i won ’ t put into words what they can do with it !
Package_Service	original post 00 / 00 /_0000
Package_Service	almost four weeks_ago i used parcel0go to send a laptop that didn ' t arrive .
Package_Service	i was told by there staff to put in a claim after being told it was smashed in the warehouse and then being told it was lost .
Package_Service	so i filed a claim and after several weeks of going through a very difficult claims process it was finally accepted and i was offered a rather insulting £_00 . 00 despite proving the laptop was worth £_000 . 00 .
Package_Service	i wrote to parcel0go to say i was not happy with there £_00 . 00 offer which they ignored and then to my surprise the laptop was suddenly returned to me , smashed .
Package_Service	the box looked like it had been ran over and then someone wrapped lots of brown tape around it .
Package_Service	i contacted parcel0go and was told to write to them and attach photos of the cardboard_box and packaging along with photos of my smashed laptop .
Package_Service	the laptop had been well wrapped up in bubble_wrap and the cardboard_box was also well_packed with more bubble_wrap .
Package_Service	a week on and parcel0go have chosen to ignore my letter and emails , clearly in the hope i will just go away ..
Package_Service	so in short i used there service to send my laptop and four weeks_later its returned to me smashed .
Package_Service	this was not what i paid them for and i feel very let_down and will never use there service again , a very unhappy customer .
Package_Service	appalling - please do not use if you expect a collection .
Package_Service	drop_off may be reasonable but staying in for two 00hr windows is not acceptable .
