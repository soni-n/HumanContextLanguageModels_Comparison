Fashion_Accessories	i do regularly purchase items of clothing or music from chemical_records and i have yet to be disappointed by their service .
Fashion_Accessories	as ever , items are always dispatched promptly and their prices are always competitive .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	i could not fault julesb one bit , firstly on price , keeping me up to date on the location of my package and then the presentation of my goods .
Fashion_Accessories	already_recommended julesb to two friends .
Fashion_Accessories	will always use julesb over other stocklists all because of the ease of this transaction .
Fashion_Accessories	a refreshing_change with online shopping .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic friendly helpful service , not to mention the ' ahead of trend ' range of sunnies !
Fashion_Accessories	fast deliveies and a even better after care service ....
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m a returning customer time and time again ... wouldn ' t go anywhere_else !
Fashion_Accessories	red_hot are arguably the best dealership online !
Fashion_Accessories	ordered on saturday and got in on tuesday .
Fashion_Accessories	hadn ' t heard of the company before but received a 00_%_off discount_code from vodafone so decided to give it a go .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic range of products to choose from , extremely reasonable prices , fast and free next_day delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	just cannot find anything negative about the service .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely use the company again , as_opposed to the big high_street ones !
Fashion_Accessories	simply the best company i have used
Fashion_Accessories	yesstyle is a great company , everything always comes fast with no trouble !
Fashion_Accessories	ordering is great , and the clothes are super cute .
Fashion_Accessories	love yesstyle !
Fashion_Accessories	i always order from them !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	where most websites have just your bog_standard range of sunglasses , this site takes it up to a new level , with a massive_range of styles .
Fashion_Accessories	i used shop by style to find the perfect pair of persol clubmasters .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll be doing all my eyewear shopping here from now on .
Fashion_Accessories	lily dressed in her " where ' s wenda " outfit made us all giggle and she wants to wear it all the time now .
Fashion_Accessories	may have a professional comedian in training .
Fashion_Accessories	the quality was reasonable and delivery arrived the next_day after ordering .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic service , glasses are at great value and was very easy to order .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m usually skeptical_about buying clothes online since i ' ve have problems with many sites but yesstyle is one of the few i ' d say is pretty good .
Fashion_Accessories	the clothes are very attractive and there is a really big selection of styles .
Fashion_Accessories	the website itself is very easy to browse and its easy to find what you ' re looking for .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery is super_quick , especially if you choose clothes that ' ship within 0 - 0 days '.
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered on sunday_night and it arrived today -- rather quick for clothes that are imported !
Fashion_Accessories	all the shirts and jumper fitted_perfectly and i will_definitely use this service again .
Fashion_Accessories	my only gripes with the site is that the delivery is quite expensive , but understandably so since the clothes are imported from asia .
Fashion_Accessories	i think its best to order lots of clothes at once so that the delivery fee is worth it .
Fashion_Accessories	plus , you get can free delivery if you order enough .
Fashion_Accessories	another problem is that many of the clothes are one - size only , and mostly suit to a medium to petite frame .
Fashion_Accessories	they don ' t seem to really cater to anyone who is a uk size 00 and above , much to the disappointment of some my friends .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of long_distance new wayfare glasses which arrived 0 days of the dispatch date and in total 00 days from order date .
Fashion_Accessories	the online order progress keeps you informed every_step of the glasses pathway .
Fashion_Accessories	not a scratch on the lenses and no_problems with my perscription .
Fashion_Accessories	couldn ' t find a better price online .
Fashion_Accessories	my one regret , not selectspecs fault , is that i did not look in the shops at what i was buying online .
Fashion_Accessories	if i did i would have chosen the colour havanah instead of dark havanah .
Fashion_Accessories	my fault entirely so guess the motto is try before you buy .
Fashion_Accessories	i really rate these_guys - its very rare that i shop on line and get the feeling like 0 .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m dealing_with human beings and 0 . they care about the customer and are not after a quick buck .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely shop with these_guys again and i highly_recommend their services to anyone and on top of all this they have great stock which just shows me they know what they are doing .
Fashion_Accessories	what you see is what you get , just 00 times better with a great service .
Fashion_Accessories	i found the site very easy to use , especially the pay_pal option which made checkout very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	website and order process was easy to navigate .
Fashion_Accessories	i called the customer_service team to check on delivery dates , there was no waiting on hold and efficient service .
Fashion_Accessories	i have bought 0 products now from selectspecs . com and i have been very pleased with each product .
Fashion_Accessories	perscription glasses for £ 0 each !
Fashion_Accessories	and i think that included delievery .
Fashion_Accessories	very good product range and great prices .
Fashion_Accessories	gutted i didn ' t find the site sooner !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	very fast delivery and easy to navigate through the website !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	had problems with an interface i purchased from here a few_years_ago .
Fashion_Accessories	the company just did not want to assist me in the matter .
Fashion_Accessories	luckily i found out later i just needed a driver update .
Fashion_Accessories	recently i purchased an active subwoofer from them .
Fashion_Accessories	the item became_faulty on its fourth use but i did not diagnose the problem to the unit until a few weeks_later .
Fashion_Accessories	from my first contact with them regarding the issue it took them 0 weeks to replace the faulty unit , plus i had to contact the manufacturer to arrange the warranty cover myself !!
Fashion_Accessories	( this should be their job )
Fashion_Accessories	i did offer for them to credit note me as i wanted some more_expensive items as an_alternative but they refused !
Fashion_Accessories	terrible service , incredibily difficult to get hold of there person in charge of service department ( sam ) and all_round bad_experience !
Fashion_Accessories	i will not be using them ever again and will make_sure all the contacts i know who also buy dj & sound equipment know to avoid this company .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered my new headphones around lunchtime , and was using them less_than 00hours later .
Fashion_Accessories	good price , speedy service , and received updates via_email on progress of my order .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely_recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	title_says it all - i would recommend red_hot sunglasses to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	at first i wasn ' t totally convinced how good a service i would get given that this company operates 000_% online , but after seeing how cheap their prices were i decided to make an enquiry and after_speaking with one of the team ( luke , who called within 00_minutes of the online enquiry ), i was comfortable in placing my order .
Fashion_Accessories	they delivered the ring on the exact date they had estimated and it was perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	from your initial order up until delivery , these_guys keep you up to date with progress by sending an e_- mail every 0 - 0 days with a progress report .
Fashion_Accessories	i ended_up being one of the unlucky one ' s and had to return my ring for a refund , which was also dealt_with swiftly and incredibly well .
Fashion_Accessories	if you have any reservations in using this company please let me tell you that you will be looked after throughout the whole_process .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect service , perfect quality and perfect_timing !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a pair of stella mccartney sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	i saw them in a magazine and couldn ' t find them anywhere in the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	my pal reccommended red_hot and they had all the latest ranges .
Fashion_Accessories	i got my sunnys and another pair at a really great price .
Fashion_Accessories	it was really easy to order them and i got them earlier_than i expected .
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t wait for the sun to shine so i can get an excuse to buy more .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks red_hot .
Fashion_Accessories	great selection of glasses - i ordered 0 pairs of vivienne westwood glasses , they were excellent value .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service team were quick to reply to my questions .
Fashion_Accessories	sono rimasta molto colpita da sunglasses_shop .
Fashion_Accessories	il catalogo è vastissimo e comprende tutti gli occhiali più belli e alla moda .
Fashion_Accessories	i prezzi sono i migliori che si possano trovare sul web e la spedizione è velocissima , con un ' ottima cura nel packaging .
Fashion_Accessories	sicuramente acquisterò ancora su sunglasses_shop !
Fashion_Accessories	grazie , sono molto soddisfatta !
Fashion_Accessories	having bought a voucher for sunglasses_shop (£ 00 for £_00 to spend ), i first looked offline to find and try on a selection of sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	going back to the website , finding those sunglasses was super easy and they had everything i saw in the shop .
Fashion_Accessories	the order process was very straightforward and delivery extremely speedy , with safe packaging .
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend this shop for anybody who prefers to ' look offline , buy online '.
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m a regular customer at red_hot sunglasses and they have never once let me down .
Fashion_Accessories	in comparison to competitors their range is 0nd to none , the pricing is always the most competitive and most_importantly the service is spot on .
Fashion_Accessories	having had poor experiences with online_retailers in the past , these_guys really know their stuff and are on top of their game .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	overall an excelent company in all departments , fast processsing and delivery of all their goods , even to the channel_islands .
Fashion_Accessories	all products are competitively_priced and i ' ve never_experienced customer_services better from any other company !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought some shorts for a birthday_present for my dad and it didnt come in the waxx tin or with a keyring which i have recieved with all the other purchases that have been made by my family .
Fashion_Accessories	been ordering from chemuk for many years now , always been steller service .
Fashion_Accessories	always worth checking the sales out for a cheeky tshirt or some accessories for the missis .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve wanted some brushes from crownbrush for a while and when there was a 00_%_off code i thought it would be rude not to !
Fashion_Accessories	i am really pleased with the brushes i bought ( all eyes on you set ) as they are such good quality , especially for the price .
Fashion_Accessories	the best brushes i ' ve ever owned !
Fashion_Accessories	i also bought the blusher palette which was a lot bigger than i was expecting it to be which was a bonus .
Fashion_Accessories	the colours are lovely , very natural and pretty palette .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve recommended to many friends already and i will be buying christmas_presents for friends and family also .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you crownbrush *****
Fashion_Accessories	would highly_recommend them and would use again .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a dress but was too small so i sent it back and my refund was paid back very quickly and with no hassle .
Fashion_Accessories	i initially called up webtogs to get some advice and spoke to a really friendly woman with encylopedic knowledge of walking boots .
Fashion_Accessories	her enthusiasm and expertise really impressed me and her advice was spot on .
Fashion_Accessories	i literally cannot_fault webtogs , their website looks great , their service is second to none and their after sales process for requesting product and service reviews are slick and professional .
Fashion_Accessories	and the boots i bought were less_than half the price i would have had to pay at home in denmark .
Fashion_Accessories	if only all webshops were more like webtogs !
Fashion_Accessories	i was originally looking for a wedding_ring i searched the internet as i was could not find the ring i wanted in any of the high_street / shops .
Fashion_Accessories	i found the diamondgeezer . com website through google , which had just the ring i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	i was sceptical at first because of the website name but then found out the owner of the company has featured in an episode of dragon ’_s den , which gave me all the reassurance i needed .
Fashion_Accessories	the website has a very useful_tool to check the progress of your order .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately , i received the wrong ring at first but the customer_service was quick to fix their mistake .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring itself looks great just as i expected .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service is unbelievably good .
Fashion_Accessories	clive was the most helpful and polite person i have ever had the chance to speak .
Fashion_Accessories	mega_fancy_dress offered a wide_range of fancy_dress costumes of all sizes which was important for my needs as i required a larger costumer to dress at stag up for his stag_party .
Fashion_Accessories	the service , through ebay , was good , payment was very easy and delivery prompted .
Fashion_Accessories	my only small criticism , if i were to have one , was that the prices were a little higher_than other fancy_dress shops but the quality of the out fit was of a higher standard .
Fashion_Accessories	overall a great service .
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant website found it super easy to find the exact sunglasses both me and my hubby were after .
Fashion_Accessories	great service and speedy_delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	i came_across webtogs whilst searching for the best price on a the northface base_camp bag for the gym .
Fashion_Accessories	they were the cheapest price i could find at the time and even had a 00 %- off promotional period , so the price was cheaper_than i had seen .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve used the company twice since , getting some argyll boots and a the northface jacket .
Fashion_Accessories	all items were shipped fast .
Fashion_Accessories	everything from this company arrives very fast & their products are always of the highest_quality .
Fashion_Accessories	i had to return something once = even that was a pleasure as it was dealt_with fast & easy unlike a lot of web companies these days , webtogs take pride in their great service .
Fashion_Accessories	their prices are also very competitive & usually are the cheapest around also which always helps .
Fashion_Accessories	i have used them now a few_times & can highly_recommend them in all ways from ordering to delivery to returns if needs be .
Fashion_Accessories	top_marks all_round .
Fashion_Accessories	!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	great product , been looking for something like this for a while , and the designs are ace !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of raybans , came on time with great customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	would recommend this website to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a leather restorer spray to treat my holdall and it was exactly_what was needed .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was fast as always and i will_continue to buy from the store .
Fashion_Accessories	i can always trust that webtogs will not only have the gear i want at a competitive price , but will also provide a first_class customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	bought an engagement_ring from diamondgeezer . com amazing ring fantastic price .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve been shopping in divine_trash for years the staff are always friendly , helpfull , and full of advice their products are bang on trend and very good value for money never disappointed x
Fashion_Accessories	excellent website , easy to navigate .
Fashion_Accessories	very useful product info , videos and reviews .
Fashion_Accessories	goods arrived next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	all in all , brilliant service , thank_you webtogs !
Fashion_Accessories	a great website with all the info you need .
Fashion_Accessories	i found it cheaper_than anywhere_else and the service was so quick .
Fashion_Accessories	really happy and i will use again when i find something that i want .
Fashion_Accessories	i stupidly lost my first pair of ray - ban wayfarers on holiday in ibiza ( after only four days of owning them ).
Fashion_Accessories	needless to say i was absolutely gutted and annoyed at the fact i ' d have to shell out another £_000 to replace them .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided to search the net to see if i could buy them any cheaper_than the full price i had initially spent in - store .
Fashion_Accessories	after doing a quick google_search , i stumbled_across sunglassesshop . com .
Fashion_Accessories	i was amazed at how much lower the prices were here than in the shops .
Fashion_Accessories	i was a bit_dubious at first , but having read a few reviews and researching the site a little , i quickly realised i had nothing to worry_about !
Fashion_Accessories	i placed my order ( using a 00_%_off discount_code that i found on the google sponsored ad ) and bought a pair of black ray - ban wayfarers for £_00 , plus free next_day delivery !!
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely amazing service and amazing price , i have recommended to all of my friends and will_definitely be using this site again .
Fashion_Accessories	( hopefully i won ' t lose this pair after four days though ...)
Fashion_Accessories	on my first order i had some questions about the product i was interested in : the staff emailed me back within a few hours with all the info i needed and explained their return_policy in detail in case i wanted to change my mind after receiving my order .
Fashion_Accessories	i was so impressed that even_though what i wanted was available for a slightly lower_price elsewhere i didn ' t mind paying webtogs a few extra quid !
Fashion_Accessories	also , they were still_awaiting new stock at the moment i placed my order , so they gave me an expected delivery time of about three_weeks - as it turned_out , the parcel arrived only six days_later ... and there was no need to return it !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll definitely order from them again and will recommend to anyone look to buy outdoor_gear .
Fashion_Accessories	just received my hugo boss prescription_sunglasses and i think its like a dream_come true , suit perfect on my face and the best quality i ever had in my life .. thanks select_specs !!!
Fashion_Accessories	i will surely ship for more ...
Fashion_Accessories	i want to mention the excellent and prompt service , as well as james , alina and christina for their attention , care and professionalism !
Fashion_Accessories	i highly_recommend !
Fashion_Accessories	good luck to all of you , my friends !
Fashion_Accessories	good morning . i write to you from baku , azerbaijan .
Fashion_Accessories	i want to thank_you for the excellent service .
Fashion_Accessories	your customer_service ( sheila , mary ) is very prompt and very helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	shipping is very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you .
Fashion_Accessories	sincerely ,

Fashion_Accessories	bought a brush set for my girlfriend for her_birthday .
Fashion_Accessories	she was over the moon and said it was the best collection of makeup brushes she has owned .
Fashion_Accessories	would recommend !
Fashion_Accessories	my order arrived extremely quickly , far faster_than_expected !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i recieced email_updates_throughout the process and was kept up to date with when they were dispatched and delivered .
Fashion_Accessories	really pleased with my purchase as i ' ve been looking for some replacement running glasses for months !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks for a really efficient service , highly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definately_recommend these_guys !
Fashion_Accessories	they make beautiful quality rings , they were helpful and friendly from the begining and fast with their service and feedback !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought my girlfriends engagement_ring from these_guys and will be buying our_wedding_rings here too !
Fashion_Accessories	purely_because of such an excellent service !
Fashion_Accessories	got my items on time no problem .
Fashion_Accessories	however , disappointed on how it was packaged , i ordered a pair of hunter boots and two_pairs of hunter socks which were squashed into the box , few scuff marks on the boots which came off thankfully .
Fashion_Accessories	other than that service was very good .
Fashion_Accessories	______________________________________________________________
Fashion_Accessories	update_: few_days ago i received a phone call from country house outdoors to say they read my review , asked if my item are okay and i am able to send the boots back from a new pair if damaged , as stated the marks did come off with a little_bit of rubbing the other items were fine .
Fashion_Accessories	they did compensate with a £_00 off voucher , which was a pleasant_surprise as its very rare for a company to even offer anything .
Fashion_Accessories	again very pleased with the service , would recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	added two extra stars for the after care event .
Fashion_Accessories	i have a great fondness for crownbrush !
Fashion_Accessories	they provide good quality , cheap brushes that i can ' t really fault .
Fashion_Accessories	the only issue i ever find with crownbrush is the size of the brush is difficult to guess in photos , unfortunately a couple times brushes have been larger than i anticipated .
Fashion_Accessories	however the quality can not be_faulted and even_though i have purchased brushes like the ' bk00 white taklon square ' and the ' c000 angle contouring ' which i thought would be smaller , i still was able to use them in the way i wanted and get great results !
Fashion_Accessories	my favourite brush so far has to be the ' c000 pro dome blender ' as it does a great job of softening any harsh lines and bringing your make up together in a natural finish !
Fashion_Accessories	definitely worth up and above the cost !
Fashion_Accessories	these brushes are a great investment and everytime there is a sale i buy myself a whole set of great new brushes !
Fashion_Accessories	i brought a pair of ray_bans at 00 : 00 and they arrived by 00 : 00 the next_day , fast brilliant service , very helpful , will be shopping here again .
Fashion_Accessories	apart_from holidays bought from very well_known holiday companies this is easily the biggest single purchase i have ever made over the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	it was an_eternity_ring , bought as a surprise for my 00th wedding_anniversary .
Fashion_Accessories	i have to confess the last piece of jewellery i bought without any input from my wife was the engagement_ring , 00 years_ago .
Fashion_Accessories	i knew nothing about the 0 cs or purchasing diamonds .
Fashion_Accessories	my starting point was jewellery_shops , both high_street and independent , there were many fine looking rings but i just wasn ' t sure i was getting the biggest choice so i turned to the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	i spent months researching all online jewellery companies but i kept returning to purely_diamonds .
Fashion_Accessories	it certainly helps that the website has a very professional look , unlike some of their competitors , it was also extremely_helpful on education .
Fashion_Accessories	i was able to use their tools to work out my wife ' s ring size and the pictures and animations of the rings were really helpful for look .
Fashion_Accessories	i settled on a design and size and made my selection and order on the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	it was then the nerves set in , had i done the right thing , i decided to email the company .
Fashion_Accessories	i was emailed straight back by stephanie and from then on she was able to put my mind at ease .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring was delivered as promised .
Fashion_Accessories	it looked amazing to me but the true test was giving it to my wife .
Fashion_Accessories	she was delighted and despite the fact it has been on her finger for 0 days now she still can ' t stop looking at it .
Fashion_Accessories	i am more_than satisfied that i received great service and the ring is more_than value for money .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend purely_diamonds to anyone !
Fashion_Accessories	i have posted this through my wife ' s fb account as i don ' t have one .
Fashion_Accessories	is great do business with you people
Fashion_Accessories	after possibly the worst online shopping_experience ever - no thanks to miragerecords0000 , chemical_records restored my faith .
Fashion_Accessories	my purchase with m0000records was for a pack of ' rock on wall ' vinyl frames , which i paid extra delivery for also , after them not arriving and not 0 single reply to my numerous polite emails , i finally spoke to dave who told me in so many words to do0 , this all without my order arriving .
Fashion_Accessories	in the meantime , i thought all was lost but one more try to get them as the ones in john_lewis werent quite as nice , and tadaathere was chemical_records !
Fashion_Accessories	i called them ob the website listed number for assistance first to ensure they were real and if would take order over phone after what happened above , this wasnt possible but they were friendly and provided reassurance that this purchase would be as hassle_free as you ' d expect it to be , and that it was !
Fashion_Accessories	website clear about shipping and delivery dates , which were exact my order arrived on time and in great condition .
Fashion_Accessories	to be fair , im probably a lil over excited at chemical_records right now , as had such a poop time with miragerecords0000 , but either way top score for a top store !
Fashion_Accessories	thank youuuuu , x
Fashion_Accessories	purchased a teeshirt monday , got it tuesday .
Fashion_Accessories	what more can you ask !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve been using this website for a while now and i love it .
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t find anything wrong with my purchase here .
Fashion_Accessories	i had all the info i needed and emails covering every_stage of the process .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d definitely_recommend them !
Fashion_Accessories	my husband bought me an_eternity_ring for christmas and it ' s stunning .
Fashion_Accessories	i emailed purely_diamonds a couple of times in the hope of it being delivered before_christmas and they were very helpful and i did receive it the week before_christmas .
Fashion_Accessories	the packaging was lovely and made it feel very special .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely_recommend purely_diamonds to others .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you for a gorgeous ring !
Fashion_Accessories	bought a pair of limited_edition ray - bans from this site , was the only one i could find that stocked them in a full colour range
Fashion_Accessories	got them for my 0 month trek around the world and bought them last_minute but as promised they turned_up the next_day in a neat little package .
Fashion_Accessories	good service , easily contactable customer_service and a good price .
Fashion_Accessories	sweet as
Fashion_Accessories	great website with loads of choice .
Fashion_Accessories	bought some carreras which got delivered really quick .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent customer_service - their team managed to get my wife ' s engagement_ring in_advance of when i needed it and made sure i had everything i needed before whisking her away to propose .
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t praise them higher .
Fashion_Accessories	i contacted the company to see if they would pricematch with a price i had seen elsewhere and immediately they did .
Fashion_Accessories	they were prompt at responding to emails , and within a couple of days my order arrived .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service throughout
Fashion_Accessories	really awesome style .
Fashion_Accessories	even if you are not buying you can always look through their blogs on styling tips and learn simple yet effective everyday styles .
Fashion_Accessories	i can scroll on hours for fashion wear , they vary and range from low to high prices so , it really is for everyone from any background .
Fashion_Accessories	even if you are not buying you can get a good sense and styling knowledge .
Fashion_Accessories	order was dealt professionally , i had an issue with it , but they communicated effectively and was sorted out easily .
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t say anymore
Fashion_Accessories	just perfect
Fashion_Accessories	responded extremely quickly to emails and fantastic customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	great for a first time buyer needing some answers regarding which sunglasses would be best and they are reasonably_priced , highly_recommend to anyone !
Fashion_Accessories	i wrote about this on my blog , a full rave review sharing how incredible this was .
Fashion_Accessories	my opinions on this brand where so high numerous people have already ordered products by the brand .
Fashion_Accessories	psychedelic prints and outstandingly comfortable ...
Fashion_Accessories	they get me ready for the weekend ;)
Fashion_Accessories	xxxxxxxx liz xxxxxxxxxx
Fashion_Accessories	the live_chat help provided by diamond_geezer was invaluable when choosing a ring to propose with .
Fashion_Accessories	my wife was delighted with the results and they took all the comments i had got from her to come up with the correct design .
Fashion_Accessories	prices were very fair too .
Fashion_Accessories	even once the sale had been made and money paid service remained good when we had to get the ring resized .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy and recommended to other friends on the cusp of proposal ...
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service / price / delivery - minor problem with one pair immediately resolved by supplying full replacement pair
Fashion_Accessories	was a bit_sceptical at first due to gimmicky name but was no need , communication from placement of order was great .
Fashion_Accessories	good price .
Fashion_Accessories	very professional .
Fashion_Accessories	worked to meet tight deadline .
Fashion_Accessories	beautiful ring .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d recommend riverside garden_centre without a doubt ; they are very competitively_priced , delivery was punctual and well communicated and the bbq is great .
Fashion_Accessories	i have purchased from here before normally o . k , but the last pair were so shoddy it was like they were made by a child in primary school , they did not fit as the arms were at different angles and the actual frame work around the lens was twisted .
Fashion_Accessories	well i suppose it ' s workmanship for the money .
Fashion_Accessories	there is no ability to talk with customer_service over the phone so i will take my loss and go somewhere_else , 0 positive is that it was delivered quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	as a professional makeup artist i am always looking for quality products and regularly purchase from crown .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery is always fast too which is a bonus !
Fashion_Accessories	the 0pc hd set is amazing , each brush feels so luxurious on the skin and am considering purchasing another set for my kit .
Fashion_Accessories	another of my favourites is the b00 angle blush brush , it also feels soft and luxurious whilst still being dense enough to apply colour evenly and is great for contouring !
Fashion_Accessories	i always recommend crown to my friends as they have the same quality as high end brands without the hefty price_tag !
Fashion_Accessories	well_done crown , keep up the good work !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	order process was simple , price was good and delivery was fast & without any_issues .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d have no_hesitation recommending chemicaluk . com to anybody and i ' ll be using them again .
Fashion_Accessories	sgs service : 0 *

Fashion_Accessories	this is not a dig at sunglassesshop , as i ' m sure the product i bought was likely pre_- packaged and redistributed , however i had to carefully remove both lenses and remove multiple pieces of white packaging that was stuck between the frame and glass .
Fashion_Accessories	there is no way this got in there after the lenses had been fitted , as one piece was poking out on both_sides of the lense !
Fashion_Accessories	product : dirty dog dozer sunglasses ( gunmetal / green , polarised ).
Fashion_Accessories	i have added a 0 star_rating for sgs , as the faux pas was not with them , but with the product manufacturer .
Fashion_Accessories	a very easy and efficient website to use with good search and navigation .
Fashion_Accessories	lens and bridge sizes are featured which is very useful and quite_often missing on other_sites .
Fashion_Accessories	fairly detailed product descriptions and relatively low free delivery threshold .
Fashion_Accessories	so , overall i would re - visit and recommend sunglasses - shop . co . uk .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s one of my fav ........ site nt only me bt most of the people thats why definetly it have to get five_stars :) the clothes are so fashionable , cute n comfort and the price is decent lop it < 0 ..... yesstyle is doing awesome job
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely amazing products , super cool and super comfy .
Fashion_Accessories	service from waxx has been top_notch , quick to reply to any_questions or problems .
Fashion_Accessories	however , there is 0 tiny little thing you could do to improve to being absolutely perfect .. change your delivery company , i haven ' t had any_problems with them personally , but i think £ 0 is a bit_steep for the time it takes .
Fashion_Accessories	maybe royal_mail 0st_class ..
Fashion_Accessories	there ' s nothing like next_day delivery !
Fashion_Accessories	but that ' s just me being picky and impatient .
Fashion_Accessories	other than that , keep up the amazing work guys !!
Fashion_Accessories	:)
Fashion_Accessories	i can not fault the experience i had with diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	we were nervous_about buying an engagement_ring online but i needn ' t have worried .
Fashion_Accessories	we got a fabulous ring that was everything i could have dreamed of for a fraction of the cost .
Fashion_Accessories	we certainly got a value for money and a much bigger and better diamond than we would have got on the high_street for the budget we had .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend this company highly .
Fashion_Accessories	i am so glad that i found riverside garden_centre ' s website as they have great deals on weber products .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a 00 ' one - touch grill with accessories cheaper_than the standalone price of the same product on amazon and john_lewis .
Fashion_Accessories	definitely recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	good service and reasonable_price !
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant service !
Fashion_Accessories	perfect_condition and very quick delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	will_definitely use again .
Fashion_Accessories	i placed my order and the joules jumper arrived the next working day .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service , the best price around , great all_round , i ' m really pleased .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent value and super_fast delivery even during the xmas postage frenzy .
Fashion_Accessories	high_quality costume for the price .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent communication about delivery and shipping .
Fashion_Accessories	my product was delivered as_described and they delivered my product within the timeframe specified .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended and i would definitely order from them again .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a pair of matte black polarised ray - ban wayfarers and i had a slight_issue in terms of delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	i changed my day of delivery to the next_day and unfortunately , dpd , managed to send my sunglasses back to the main depot instead of the local_depot meaning i had to wait an extra day for my sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	red_hot sunglasses were brilliant and their customer_service was second to none and made sure i received my sunglasses and gave me an explanation as to what had happened .
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend this company as the delivery issue was no fault of their own but they still did as best as they could to offer their support and chase up the issue as quickly as possible .
Fashion_Accessories	great company , great customer_service and thoroughly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks my engagement_ring is perfect !!
Fashion_Accessories	would never have got what i wanted for this price on the high_street !
Fashion_Accessories	the order process was easy and i was kept_updated all the way !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	my dress is what i believed it should look like .
Fashion_Accessories	it made me feel great and sexy .
Fashion_Accessories	i have worn it to a wedding and a cocktail party and it worked well in both events .
Fashion_Accessories	i will be back to buy more and have shown your wed site to many others encluding brides and mother of the brides .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks shopindream for your quality , reliability .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s the only place to go for your fashion fix : with top end quality brands , competitive_pricing and a 0 star customer_service experience .
Fashion_Accessories	ever helpful , suggestive and excessively friendly , the staff make the trip to the beautifully stylish store an exciting place to visit in a majority online shopping world .
Fashion_Accessories	the variety gives everyone a selection and suits all shaped and sizes .
Fashion_Accessories	not only do they have crazy amazing sales but they promote them through all social_media .
Fashion_Accessories	i also love that they take the time to video catwalks of how they would style key items .
Fashion_Accessories	divine_trash is dominating a declining high_street and makes the town worth the visit .
Fashion_Accessories	the pair of sunglasses i wanted were out of stock so i emailed them and got a quick reply telling_me when they expected a delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	when the delivery came in there was only 0 sets but they emailed again to tell me so i could go and order them straight_away so i didnt miss out .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was quick and on time .
Fashion_Accessories	very good company !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !

Fashion_Accessories	goods were as_described .
Fashion_Accessories	you should see are baby in her outfit she looks amazing :)
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely awful !
Fashion_Accessories	ordered glasses seemingly successfully only to be told a couple of days_later that the frames were discontinued .
Fashion_Accessories	so i contact customer_services and select another frame .

Fashion_Accessories	those frames are also discontinued .
Fashion_Accessories	i then gave up , got my money back and went elsewhere .

Fashion_Accessories	0 * s in my opinion
Fashion_Accessories	not a single glitch when buying an engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	i was kept fully up to date with the progress .
Fashion_Accessories	they were happy to delay delivery so that the ring wouldn ' t arrive when the missus was at home .
Fashion_Accessories	the service and product are both first_class !
Fashion_Accessories	my wife loves her solitaire engagement_ring which would have been at_least twice the price from a national high_street jeweller .
Fashion_Accessories	there is no need to worry_about ordering online as everything is 000_% genuine and trustworthy - i did have some intrepidations beforehand .
Fashion_Accessories	i have had the ring independantly valued at beav ******* ks when we took it in to get cleaned prior to the wedding and they commented how nice the ring was and asked where i got it from .
Fashion_Accessories	comes with certification .
Fashion_Accessories	i have recommended it to friends already !

Fashion_Accessories	the quality is also perfect , my wedding_ring bought elsewhere as we were given some vouchers has alreadt had to be redipped after only a year , my engagement_ring however , from diamondgeezer is still perfect x
Fashion_Accessories	i could say a lot about webtogs , but i really want you to go and explore for yourselves .
Fashion_Accessories	you won ' t regret it for a second ...
Fashion_Accessories	great products and advice at every_stage of your online journey .
Fashion_Accessories	personal service delivered with care and attention .
Fashion_Accessories	swift delivery and great after - care .
Fashion_Accessories	the list_goes on ...
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs has provided one of my best online shopping experiences , and like many of the other_reviewers here , i will use them again and again .
Fashion_Accessories	customer_service is so important nowadays , but often forgotten by many .
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs has got it right on the money and is leading the way .
Fashion_Accessories	arrived within 00_hours with the cheapest of the shipping options .
Fashion_Accessories	product was really well_priced and i would definitely buy from here again .
Fashion_Accessories	got a custom wedding_ring for my partner half price of high_street . is a gorgeous ring made perfectly
Fashion_Accessories	i first used select_specs this year as recommended by a collegue .
Fashion_Accessories	i found that the high_street opticians were becoming increasingly expensive and i was assured that select_specs were a great online company .
Fashion_Accessories	i wanted a pair of glasses that were stylish and affordable and found a great pair on select_specs , which also included a speedy_delivery service .
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend select_specs to friends , family and anyone that has yet to try an online optician !
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of ray_ban wayfarer sunglasses in matt black .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived the next_day ... for free !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	bring on the summer !
Fashion_Accessories	not much more i can say !
Fashion_Accessories	i want to own everything on site !
Fashion_Accessories	i like the fact that they stock contemporary brands that you can ' t find anywhere_else , it makes the purchase that little_bit more special .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of wayfarers last summer and got them next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	even got a text to say they were on the way .
Fashion_Accessories	too bad i lost them in the sea !
Fashion_Accessories	i will be ordering again from red_hot sunglasses this year
Fashion_Accessories	great company , had no_problems easy to order massive_selection of glasses to choose from , sent the next_day via ups .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of chanel sunglasses , price seemed to good to be true and was ....
Fashion_Accessories	one thing this company are extremely good at is taking money out of your account promptly , when it comes to delivering the goods that you have ordered or refunding money they are abysmal .
Fashion_Accessories	basically i ordered a pair of chanel sunglasses at the beginning of the month , and began to get slightly worried that i had received no confirmation of my order 0 days_later .
Fashion_Accessories	so i rang and asked for confirmation of my order in writing they stumbled and mumbled around " their systems " before telling_me that unfortunately they had sent my confirmation_email to the wrong_address .... after telling them how unprofessional this was especially if any of my payment details were in the email they eventually agreed to resend the email , unfortunately the lady in customer_services slammed the phone down before i had a chance to thank her .
Fashion_Accessories	the next_day and the confirmation_email had still not arrived , so i had to ring again .....
Fashion_Accessories	this time i did get speaking to someone who handled my query extremely well who explained that the email had again been sent to the wrong email address ( by the way my email adrress is exactly the same as my name ) and promised that the email would be sent immediately .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service rep then went to check how long it owuld be before the glasses were delivered , and after faffing around for 0 minuted was unable to give me any more information that 0 - 00 working_days ....
Fashion_Accessories	after close to 00 working_days i began to get a bit_concerned as i had received no dispatch email so again rang the company to find out what was going on .
Fashion_Accessories	again when they eventually did find the order i was told that unfortunately the sunglasses were no_longer available as they had been_discontinued several years_ago .....
Fashion_Accessories	when i asked how they were able to take my money for items that did not even exist they were not too forthcoming as usual .
Fashion_Accessories	so after declining to choose another pair of glasses i asked for a refund which i was told would be in my account in 0 - 0 working_days .
Fashion_Accessories	guess_what ?
Fashion_Accessories	0 working_days_later and still no sign of any refund however when i asked why 0 days ago was told that the accounts_department had forgotten to refund the money but it would be processed the same day ... silly me ....
Fashion_Accessories	by the way after finding out that the glasses had been_discontinued i found them with another company ( pret a voire ) who price matched the sunglasses_shop fictional price and had them on my doorstep by lunch time the next_day , exceptional service especially by their rep called wu who actually stayed in work late to ensure my product was dispatched the same day .
Fashion_Accessories	chemical - records is a great music store with a cheap delivery over the world .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s simply a true .
Fashion_Accessories	just one of my fav online stores .
Fashion_Accessories	bargain , gd for business and recommended
Fashion_Accessories	the product arrived really quickly and was awesome , great value for money also !
Fashion_Accessories	:-)
Fashion_Accessories	great selection of clothes and fast delivery !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a full - zip fleece jacket from webtogs last_week , along with a pair of gloves and some base layers , having received some very helpful guidance from the ' human_being ' on the end of the phone .
Fashion_Accessories	without his help i would have been totally lost !
Fashion_Accessories	i was struggling to find a suitable christmas_present for my grandfather , who had specified only that he wanted ' a fleece '.
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service operative helped_me gage his size and the warmth of the various designs in their stock , going way above and beyond his responsibilities in order that i find just what i ( or rather my granddad ) was looking for .
Fashion_Accessories	he even ran to the warehouse to compare fleeces directly , and got his office colleagues to try them on .
Fashion_Accessories	i must have been on the line for about 00_minutes , which is not something i ' ve experienced elsewhere .
Fashion_Accessories	having received such top - quality service i will certainly be shopping with webtogs again , and have no doubt that my grandfather will be a very happy man when he opens his present on christmas day !
Fashion_Accessories	if he ' s not , i ' m assured i ' ve got 00 days to send the fleece back for a free exchange , which again is great .
Fashion_Accessories	nice one webtogs - they deserve every bit of the 0 . 0 out of 00 they ' ve got on here .
Fashion_Accessories	great range of products and excellent service to match .
Fashion_Accessories	took advantage of alfred sargent free shoe tree offer , ordered 0 pairs over a couple of weeks , all arrived within 0 working_days .
Fashion_Accessories	mike small and his team are a pleasure to deal with , and sure to purchase more pairs down the track .
Fashion_Accessories	i recently_purchased the knomo avignon extra slim brief 00 ″, black , from right bag .
Fashion_Accessories	i had been looking for this particular laptop case for a while and found that right bag had this not only in stock , but at a lower_price to all of the other stores i had looked at .
Fashion_Accessories	the site was really user_friendly and easy navigate around , with good images of the product too .
Fashion_Accessories	i wanted a slim case and felt i got a good perspective of this from the images on the product page .
Fashion_Accessories	i opted for the free delivery option ( which i was also pleased they offered ) and this arrived_promptly ( 0 days_later by royal_mail ) with good protective packaging .
Fashion_Accessories	i have been made up with the case and would definitely_recommend right bag to others .
Fashion_Accessories	i recently_bought a personalised item from aspinal and it arrived within four working_days which was quicker_than_expected .
Fashion_Accessories	i did receive two different amounts for the final price but after contacting customer_services they cleared everything up for me and very quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	the only thing i would like them to change is to give a rough estimate for delivery so if ordering gifts in future , customers will know when they will be arriving .
Fashion_Accessories	my parcel was very fast to be delivered ordered on tuesday and came on thursday no_complaints .
Fashion_Accessories	a huge_selection of glasses to choose from at really competitive_prices .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve worn glasses for a long time and find a lot of places sell fashion glasses out of my price range meaning i normally buy one pair and can ' t afford to keep a spare pair ( which is a shame as my little_boy tends to break them often ).
Fashion_Accessories	with selectspecs i feel i can purchase several pairs for the price of a pair in leading opticians .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased two_pairs to begin with as i wanted to check the quality , i must_admit i was sceptical and thought low_prices must equal low quality - i was wrong .
Fashion_Accessories	both pairs have arrived and both are brilliant quality , i ' ll now be looking to buy more as it ' s always nice to have a variety .
Fashion_Accessories	great shop with superb customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	responded to my every email within a few hours and the sunglasses were delivered within_00hrs with fedex .
Fashion_Accessories	check out their facebook_page for a discount and to see how active and approachable they are .
Fashion_Accessories	will shop again .
Fashion_Accessories	last_year ( june_0000 ) i bought a diamond platinum engagement_ring for my fiancée .
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer made sure everything was perfect from start to finish .
Fashion_Accessories	i hate buying anything online - tian smith ensured that he accommodated for me every way possible .
Fashion_Accessories	i must ' ve phoned him at_least 00 times before buying the ring - and by the time i placed the order - i was very short of time !
Fashion_Accessories	they made sure the ring was with me before my special occasion .
Fashion_Accessories	i promised diamond_geezer that i will be back to buy our_wedding_rings .
Fashion_Accessories	last month i bought 0 wedding_rings - clive & luke were sooo helpful is was unbelieveable - there was never any pressure to buy anything .
Fashion_Accessories	my finacee ' s engagement_ring was a difficult one to match with the wedding_ring - within no time diamond_geezer provided me with a cad image of how they could make the rings fit together !
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was also very fast !!
Fashion_Accessories	defo would recommend to anyone anytime !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	sam mistry - wolverhampton
Fashion_Accessories	i placed an order with sunglasses_shop for some fairly expensive custom oakley_sunglasses , something which this website informed me would take on average 0 days before being dispatched and would have a trackable delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	weeks_later i had received nothing and heard_nothing .
Fashion_Accessories	i asked and was grudgingly told that it was taking longer_than normal .
Fashion_Accessories	as such i did not have the glasses for the trip abroad i had bought them for .
Fashion_Accessories	on my return , they still had not been delivered and i was due to move away from my property for an extended period .
Fashion_Accessories	i asked the shop to give me an eta .
Fashion_Accessories	they said check the ups site but gave me no tracking_number , so i had to ask for this separately .
Fashion_Accessories	i realised that the order ( now unapologetically about a month late ) was not going to be delivered in time before i left so i requested a change of delivery address .
Fashion_Accessories	sunglasses_shop processed this so slowly that it was too_late .
Fashion_Accessories	i had moved away for two months .
Fashion_Accessories	when i returned i found no sunglasses waiting for me .
Fashion_Accessories	examination showed that they had been delivered , and allegdly signed for , by some complete stranger , not even someone who lives in my building .
Fashion_Accessories	obviously this defeats the point of a signed for delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	however , by the time i had confirmed that this was the case the window for complaints had closed .
Fashion_Accessories	i was shunted between equally incompetent members of customer_service , each one apparently too lazy to read the previous emails in the thread .
Fashion_Accessories	the upshot of this is that apparently it is considered ok by this shop to fail to deliver their products to the customer , regardless of circumstances ; that keeping the customer informed of what is happening to their order is distinctly optional ; and that requests by the customer will be dealt_with lazily .
Fashion_Accessories	i am now £_000 the poorer for having dealt_with this store and they are apparently guilt - free for never having fulfilled the most basic requirement of selling something .
Fashion_Accessories	this is my second time using this company .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent selection of products to choose from .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of sunglasses and there was no hassle at checkout , very smooth_transaction .
Fashion_Accessories	i got a confirmation_email within a matter of seconds .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses arrived very quickly and were exactly as_described .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely_recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	i did some research for some light weight sun glasses as my last pair finally gave up on me so i though i would splash out .
Fashion_Accessories	i went for a pair of the carbon fibre frame less ray_bans .
Fashion_Accessories	fashion eyewear had the cheapest i could find at the time + i got myself some cashback via topcashback . co . uk .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery time was a little longer_than_expected but i wasn ' t in a hurry ( we have snow and no signs of sun ).
Fashion_Accessories	got the wrong pair of sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	it world have veen appropriate with a small compensation for all the bother returning the glasses , and for the delay .
Fashion_Accessories	orherwise the service has bern quick and efficiant .
Fashion_Accessories	i tried ordering cravats for my wedding .
Fashion_Accessories	skc failed to let me know that they didnt have the stock / the line was discontinued ( i got several different stories ) after waiting nearly four weeks for the delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	they promised the items would delivered the following week , and they weren ' t .
Fashion_Accessories	they made no attempt to make up for the fact that they had left me with little time before my wedding to get things sorted ( and colour matched ).
Fashion_Accessories	i asked for a refund , got no reply , and then two days_later ( today ) i got an_email_saying my order had been dispatched , which i explicitly told them i did not want as i have decided to get cravats from elsewhere as i do not trust the reliability or credibility of their business .
Fashion_Accessories	i have updated my review to 0_stars rather_than 0 , as requested by the company and because in light of this review i have had some positive response and effort to sort this ( including the below response ).
Fashion_Accessories	i do hope that the company means what it says when it will review its customer_service , and this is not just for show .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered the handbag late friday_night , by monday_morning i had received a email to say my order was on it ' s way and by tuesday it had arrived .
Fashion_Accessories	very impressed with the speed of delivery considering it was free .
Fashion_Accessories	i would absolutely use again .
Fashion_Accessories	my experience with sunglasses_shop has been great .
Fashion_Accessories	they have a vast_range of sunglasses of different brands .
Fashion_Accessories	i love their oakley custom series .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a nice pair of ray_bans .. man they have every_single ray_ban model on their website .
Fashion_Accessories	their delivery option just adds to their list of positives .. guaranteed next_day delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely shop at sunglasses_shop again ( preferable oakley custom scalpel )
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	a wide_range of glasses and excellent service .
Fashion_Accessories	would recommend to everyone .
Fashion_Accessories	definitely use them again .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks
Fashion_Accessories	item slipped through quality check was offered discount for faulty item but not a great discount
Fashion_Accessories	i would reccommend this company to you .
Fashion_Accessories	once again i been left feeling extremely happy with the service i received .
Fashion_Accessories	i found exactly_what i was looking for with other alternatives available too .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was swift and fast .
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased with service and items received
Fashion_Accessories	placing order was easy , price was great , got fleece 0 days after ordering using the free service .
Fashion_Accessories	i had a list of products to order and founf them easily and processed an order .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was as stated on the site with the brushes well_packed .
Fashion_Accessories	i have been a regular user of chemical for almost a year and a half now .
Fashion_Accessories	i primarily buy my vinyl records here but also have done some clothes shopping .
Fashion_Accessories	service is great for both .
Fashion_Accessories	vinyl is always very well_packaged and ships fairly fast .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve never had a warped or broke vinyl yet !
Fashion_Accessories	the clothes are always well_packed too but they usually come with records anyways !
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t comment on their customer support as i ' ve never had to use it .
Fashion_Accessories	:) will_continue using chemical in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic service pick your shades go to checkout pay the next_day they arrive and got a right bargin to !
Fashion_Accessories	looks_like i had a brucey bonus !
Fashion_Accessories	quick and reasonable .
Fashion_Accessories	bought my daughter a barbour coat .
Fashion_Accessories	found at here cheaper_than john_lewis ' and also got to use quidco for a further discount .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was excellent as well .
Fashion_Accessories	just the way shopping online should be .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you .
Fashion_Accessories	i was very pleased with the speed and efficiency of the service i received when ordering a down jacket from webtogs ; their stated returns_policy , which i did not have to use , is reassuringly comprehensive , something that ’_s essential when ordering clothes online and not being certain about fit or quality .
Fashion_Accessories	the website was readily navigable and informative and i found the range of products and brands to be very comprehensive .
Fashion_Accessories	i have used a number of outdoor clothing websites but this site is one i will check out each time in future and would certainly recommend to friends .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d never shopped at chemical_records before and was really surprised at how great their customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered something just after xmas and the next_day i had 0 emails waiting for me saying my order had been processed and then shipped , and it arrived in the post the day after that .
Fashion_Accessories	it arrived well_packaged and even got a free poster / calendar !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d definitely shop there again and would reccomend
Fashion_Accessories	same as above .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s difficult to praise diamondgeezer . com enough - in my experience both luke and tian were great throughout the entire_process of buying my wife ' s engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	buying an engagement or wedding_ring should be a fun and happy experience , and the guys at diamondgeezer made sure it was .
Fashion_Accessories	so much so that we bought both our_wedding_rings from them as well ; and on recommendation to my friends , they too have bought their wedding_rings from them !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll be in touch in a few anniversaries ' time when i need to upgrade my wife ' s rock !
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t fault .
Fashion_Accessories	ordering online was simple .
Fashion_Accessories	i made a mistake with the postage so had to call up .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service was fantastic , the guy was extremely polite , very helpful and sorted everything out straight_away .
Fashion_Accessories	i received my jacket yesterday , perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	exactly_what i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you .
Fashion_Accessories	will_definitely use again and recommend to others .
Fashion_Accessories	i am happy with dealing_with you
Fashion_Accessories	it was good experience and i will purchasing again from you organization
Fashion_Accessories	thanks a lot
Fashion_Accessories	regards
Fashion_Accessories	fatima
Fashion_Accessories	amazing customer_services who went beyond the call of duty to ensure that my christmas_gifts arrived today .
Fashion_Accessories	really thrilled and they have save christmas
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks julesb
Fashion_Accessories	great website and super_fast delivery , will_definitely be ordering again with them and will be recommending to friends !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	arrived in time for a birthday_gift , items reasonably_priced and arrived well_packaged .
Fashion_Accessories	great seller
Fashion_Accessories	the best on - line record shop hands_down .
Fashion_Accessories	hats_off to webtogs -- i don ' t think i ' ve ever come_across such great customer_service , let_alone the fact that the item concerned was half price in the first place .
Fashion_Accessories	i had a small problem with an ( otherwise brilliant ) icebreaker top i bought last_year and rang webtogs ; they were super friendly and instantly emailed a returns_label with free postage .
Fashion_Accessories	in well under a week i had received a replacement they had obtained from icebreaker .
Fashion_Accessories	and this on top of low_prices , next_day free delivery , etc -- big_thumbs_up .
Fashion_Accessories	they ' ll be my first_port of call for outdoor_kit in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	great service , and great prices all_round .
Fashion_Accessories	i would love to recommend the fashioneyewear to everyone , just today i received my gorgeous dior sunglasses , they are perfect and really good quality i love them !!
Fashion_Accessories	! the customer_service is so ever helpful and kind , big thanks to all of them for help i really_appreciate all that . xx
Fashion_Accessories	end is the first place that i have found who embrace classic cult brands and new up and coming designers from all over the world , and combine this offering with superb service i only wish i could afford more of their stuff
Fashion_Accessories	good service .
Fashion_Accessories	delivered relatively quick .
Fashion_Accessories	did leave with neighbour even_though that wasn ' t requested , which was slightly worrying .
Fashion_Accessories	i was not protected in this case .
Fashion_Accessories	the garment was lovely however after one wear the quality seems to have diminished already , which isn ' t desirable considering the amount paid for the dress .
Fashion_Accessories	beautifully_packaged but i did expect the dress to come with a protector bag given the nature of its fabric .
Fashion_Accessories	i feel luxury sites such as yourself should not charge shipping when i pay £_000 for a dress .
Fashion_Accessories	overall okay experience .
Fashion_Accessories	have had my eyes set on a pair of ray_bans for a while now .
Fashion_Accessories	the price on sunglasses_shop was a lot lower_than the high_street , so it made sense to go online .
Fashion_Accessories	i placed the order at 00 : 00 on a monday and the ups man rang my bell at 00 : 00 on tuesday - this is what i call service !
Fashion_Accessories	i have ordered many outdoor items from many different stores online before and have to say webtog is one of the top stores .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a jetboil 0 . 0ltr pan and the price was very very competitive .
Fashion_Accessories	may i also say i ordered this on wednesday_night 00 / 00 / 00 and it was delivered new years_eve ( even with postal delays !!)
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was free so you tend to think a week would be fair but 0 days is very swift .
Fashion_Accessories	the product was well_packaged and protected as well .
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks to webtog
Fashion_Accessories	i bought the costumes for world book day for me and some colleagues .
Fashion_Accessories	the range and price of the costumes are all very good as well as the quality of the costumes .
Fashion_Accessories	would not hesitate to use mega_fancy_dress for future occasions , thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve not purchased an awful lot from yesstyle but when i have done , it ' s been pretty quick and i ' ve never had any_problems .
Fashion_Accessories	i think their member scheme is also really handy and is a good way to get people to purchase from them more .
Fashion_Accessories	i personally love the clothing they sell , even if i can only buy from certain brands ( due to sizing ), but the fact that they sell clothes from asian brands that are for plus size makes them even better .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s hard to find the cute asian - style clothing in a size that fits me so when i see there are actual brands out there that have stuff that ' ll fit me , at a reasonable_price too , makes me very happy to buy from them .
Fashion_Accessories	i thought they used an excellent courier service , because it specified which hour the boots were going to arrive .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	super_fast & well_packed .
Fashion_Accessories	this is one of a number if occasions i have used mega_fancy_dress .
Fashion_Accessories	their ebay shop is very easy to navigate and when i have requested info on costumes my query has been dealt_with very quickly and answered the required detail .
Fashion_Accessories	the despatch is always confirmed and the delivery speedy .
Fashion_Accessories	the products are very reasonably_priced and of high_quality and ebay purchases are covered by a very generous returns_policy .
Fashion_Accessories	very highly_recommended - thank_you very much !
Fashion_Accessories	yesstyle is absolutely one of my favourite websites to shop at .
Fashion_Accessories	the first thing i do when i ' m feeling bored of my old clothes is look on yesstyle .
Fashion_Accessories	i even have it at my bookmarks bar because i surf it so often even if it is to be on top of new asian fashion .
Fashion_Accessories	the reason_why i use yesstyle so much is because , i love shopping in hong_kong , every time i shop there i get my hands full of bags and i have to put down all of them at a hotel just to go out and shop more but with yesstyle , i don ' t have to do all of that because it is all just on one website and the shipping is so fast that you don ' t even expect it .
Fashion_Accessories	what i especially love is how yesstyle always have a sale on no matter the season .
Fashion_Accessories	so if you ' re looking for some asian style , yesstyle has everything you ' ll ever need on it !
Fashion_Accessories	great !

Fashion_Accessories	gave my friend pat a pair and he absolutely loved them !!
Fashion_Accessories	he went on the website to order some more he loved them so much !
Fashion_Accessories	quick delivery , great fit and all_round awesome prints !
Fashion_Accessories	having never_heard of the company before i was skeptical_about using them for such an important occasion as my wedding .
Fashion_Accessories	however i found them absolutely_brilliant in every way .
Fashion_Accessories	on their website you can follow the process of your order in minute detail .
Fashion_Accessories	they even tell you at what process in their factory your order is currently at .
Fashion_Accessories	when you place your order they give you a date your item will be ready for .
Fashion_Accessories	for me they beat the due date by 0 full weeks .
Fashion_Accessories	their customer_service is first_class .
Electrical_goods	really helpful advice given on products .
Electrical_goods	competitively_priced goods , free next_day delivery and excellent packaging .
Electrical_goods	i would highly_recommend them .
Electrical_goods	orders are easy and straightforward , loved being_able to get the bits and bobs i go through and the e_- liquid for a really good price and lightening speed .
Electrical_goods	no more shifty envelopes from china coming through the door .
Electrical_goods	my only issue is having to be around to sign for the package , but otherwise i can find no fault , will be using again , very soon .
Electrical_goods	it was a pleasant buy .
Electrical_goods	great communication , process time .
Electrical_goods	0 star !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	i bought a ibiza 0 . 0 pa sound system which was a real let_down as it was faulty - on new years_eve !!!!
Electrical_goods	( first use )
Electrical_goods	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .
Electrical_goods	i took it to a repairer & after hifi - tower initially refused to pay the repair quote of £_00 , they then changed their minds and helpfully dealt_with the matter via telephone and offered me all the assistance i needed in order to get the repair paid for .
Electrical_goods	the customer_service has been ok , just a shame the product was faulty upon purchase causing a lot of un - needed stress and dissapointment .
Electrical_goods	great company , great products , great care , fully recommended .
Electrical_goods	i have to admit , the reason i purchased from this company is that i had money in my paypal account ( from selling on ebay ) and it takes 0 days to transfer money into your bank_account , so i was looking around various speaker sites and found that audiovisual online accepted paypal ( surprisingly the only speaker company i found that does ).
Electrical_goods	so , i had little choice who to order from , however i am very happy that i stumbled_across this site !
Electrical_goods	as i mentioned earlier the prices they offer are competitive offering the same price as amazon for the speakers i wanted .
Electrical_goods	however , having ordered many thing from unknown sites before , i was expecting a large postage cost be be included with my purchase ( in total the speakers weighed 00kg ) but no , the postage was free !
Electrical_goods	being the skeptical person i am , i was expecting it to be sent by economy post and take a week or more to arrive with me .
Electrical_goods	however this was anything but the case , for free they used dpd ' s next_day premium service !
Electrical_goods	this is a great service , with dpd texting me straight_away telling_me the date when my package would arrive .
Electrical_goods	even better was than on the day of arrival ( i ordered this a 00 at night and it arrived two days_later !)
Electrical_goods	dpd texted me giving me a 0 hour delivery slot and sure enough the dpd van turned_up slap bang in the middle of the slot !
Electrical_goods	i couldn ' t believe i got this postage service for free , it must have cost audiovisual good money to use that particular service .
Electrical_goods	the condition of the item was perfect , with the box in perfect_condition ( just as it should have been ).
Electrical_goods	i am now enjoying listening to my new speakers !
Electrical_goods	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use this company again !
Electrical_goods	they would even be in preference to amazon and such like !
Electrical_goods	( yes they are that good !)
Electrical_goods	if only all companies were this good !
Electrical_goods	i ' m better at consuming reviews than writing reviews , but having found the reviews on trustpilot so positive that i bought an expensive camera from a company in hk , i wanted to backup everyone ' s comments that digitalrev are awesome .
Electrical_goods	why ?
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	cheap ( better value than anywhere i could find in the uk or us )
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	quick ( the camera arrived within a few_days of ordering )
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	safe ( the camera box was snuggly secured in lots of bubble_wrap )
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	no duty ( per other reviews , no issue with import_duty )
Electrical_goods	0 .
Electrical_goods	uk version ( the power lead had a uk plug , was not expecting that )
Electrical_goods	the only potential word of caution is that they get by with no import_duty by claiming the value to by £_00 or so .
Electrical_goods	it ' s worth checking in the t &_cs that digitalrev will cover costs if anything goes_wrong with the delivery .
Electrical_goods	enjoy your new camera kit from digitalrev !
Electrical_goods	i order all of my equipment from these_guys .
Electrical_goods	it always arrives earlier_than predicted , the products have always been perfect , and they give great impartial reviews on youtube .
Electrical_goods	saved_myself a bundle of money over the years .
Electrical_goods	keep up the good work guys !
Electrical_goods	i was a little_worried_about spending nearly £_000 with a company that i had never_heard of .
Electrical_goods	i read a few of the reviews and decided to go with them .
Electrical_goods	i ordered the item at 00pm on tuesday , they phoned me wednesday to confirm the postcode and it had been delivered by thursday , this is incredible given that it came from_hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	the item was cheaper_than all the other_companies we had looked into .
Electrical_goods	we got a bundle including cleaning kit , memory_card and a tripod for cheaper_than the price of amazon , comet etc .
Electrical_goods	the only thing i would say is that when we turned the camera on the language wasnt set to english , so we had to download the manual ( the hard copy wasnt english either ) to figure_out how to change it .
Electrical_goods	i would 000_% recommend this company , they are fantastic !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	combined with dhl this company managed to get a camera to me ( at a great price ) from_hong_kong to the uk in 00 . 0 hours from clicking submit to hitting the doorstep .
Electrical_goods	oh and delivery was free .
Electrical_goods	astonishing .
Electrical_goods	placed an order with tekshop000 on 00th_jan_0000 - for sony htsa 0 . 0 home cinema kit £_000 . 00 .
Electrical_goods	item then goes out of stock and awaiting new stock .
Electrical_goods	get an_email late last_night that they are cancelling my oder as sony has increased the price to over £_000 .
Electrical_goods	why the hell would they take an order in the first place when they dont have stock .
Electrical_goods	i could have got it from another supplier for £_00 more .
Electrical_goods	i receive my camera in 0 days without paying any aditional charges .
Electrical_goods	" enormously disappointing .
Electrical_goods	i placed a considerable order with digitalrev , paying through paypal .
Electrical_goods	the next_day i received an_email " confirming ' that my order had " successfully " been cancelled .
Electrical_goods	no explanation was given so i checked the website and saw again that it had simply been cancelled .
Electrical_goods	i thought i must have cancelled it in error by clicking the wrong link so placed the order again , again paying through paypal .
Electrical_goods	the order was confirmed but then half an_hour later i received a second email telling_me that my order had been cancelled .
Electrical_goods	again there was no explanation .
Electrical_goods	this time i found a contact number and called customer_services who told me it had been cancelled because they had been unable to link me to my address .
Electrical_goods	they needed me to send them various forms of id etc and then if i passed their checks i would be able to place another order .
Electrical_goods	now , i don ' t mind them conducting security_checks at all ; i think that ' s a good thing and in everybody ' s interest but i do mind very much their cavalier attitude_towards my custom as well as my time and energy .
Electrical_goods	if they need more information , is it too much to expect that they would contact me and ask for it instead of just cancelling my order with no explanation ?
Electrical_goods	i order a huge number of products online both from the uk and overseas and have never encountered this before .
Electrical_goods	i was paying through paypal and both billing and shipping addresses are paypal verified and have been used on numerous_occasions .
Electrical_goods	as i say , it is not the security_checks that bother me , it is their extraordinarily dismissive attitude_towards someone who is simply trying to buy their products ."
Electrical_goods	i was really impressed with the speed of dispatch , low_cost ( ie , free !)
Electrical_goods	delivery and the lovely saving off the rrp of the lens :)
Electrical_goods	loved the reviews on the digitalrev youtube page and this is what convinced me to make a purchase with dr , i obviously looked everywhere online and researched for many weeks for a new dslr and came to currys uk , amazon uk , and then digtalrev .
Electrical_goods	the price_match was very reasonable with dr so i chose them and i ' m very happy with product and will buy other products , such as lenses with dr , in the future .
Electrical_goods	delivery was very fast and had a online tracking_system with dhl .
Electrical_goods	very well_done dr !
Electrical_goods	i ordered a lens and lens filter from pixmania . ie and received them both in very good packaging 0 days_later even_though they had come all the way from belgium to ireland .
Electrical_goods	couldn ' t be any happier with the speed , efficiency & professionalism of delivery !
Electrical_goods	placing my order was very simple & straight_forward .
Electrical_goods	payment was just as easy and it ' s an added_bonus that i could pay with paypal unlike amazon .
Electrical_goods	the price for the lens i got was also the cheapest i could find so overall i couldn ' t have been any happier with how the whole_process went .
Electrical_goods	i will_definitely be using pixmania again !
Electrical_goods	i must_admit i was slightly skeptical ordering from digitalrev , especially because i had never_heard of this site but went_ahead with the purchase of my hs00exr fujifilm camera based on excellent reviews i had read about their services - i was not disappointed !
Electrical_goods	the product was so carefully_wrapped as to avoid any damage .
Electrical_goods	i thought there may be some hidden conditions attached due to the cheap pricing of the product , however this was not the case and they guarantee free shipping on their website with covered insurance ( not many sites do this ) and my mind was put at rest .
Electrical_goods	the camera is absolutely new and perfect and i would definitely be ordering from them again .
Electrical_goods	they keep you fully informed of delivery through the tracking_number and provide regular email_updates .
Electrical_goods	perfect site !
Electrical_goods	000_% would recommend .
Electrical_goods	fantastic service , very knowledgeable_staff and very friendly service .
Electrical_goods	i was given very good advice on what they recommended and got a good deal on what i ordered .

Electrical_goods	found the focus to be alot quicker !
Electrical_goods	alot better build_quality !
Electrical_goods	amazing clarity and crispness !
Electrical_goods	if you are between the 00 -_000mm and the 00 -_000mm non l series , its definitely worth paying the extra to have this !!

Electrical_goods	all in all one very happy customer !

Electrical_goods	i really like their videos on all_sorts of camera related subjects , and found that the particular camera i was looking to buy ( the canon_000d ) was cheapest on digitalrev out of all the retailers i was looking at .

Electrical_goods	found the site through a recommendation - now here ' s mine !
Electrical_goods	came with discount_voucher and a lolly - can ' t complain !
Electrical_goods	digitalrev is probably the best company i ' ve dealt_with in quite a while .
Electrical_goods	i ' m a musician by trade , so i ' m used to ordering through specialist stores , and they are awfully clinical .
Electrical_goods	digitalrev provides something unique , in that they not only provide fantastic prices for their equipment , they have video tutorials which are informative but also fun ( think top gear meets cameras instead of cars ) and a lot of articles on the site itself .
Electrical_goods	they run regular deals of various products , so it ' s always a good idea to check back regularly to see if there ' s a new bargain in stock , but their prices beat every other retailer on the web – including amazon .
Electrical_goods	with jessops kicking the bucket , digitalrev , in my opinion , has the potential to become the uk ' s new household name for camera gear .
Electrical_goods	great price , delivered next_day using a decent courier ( ups ), well_packaged , rang to confirm company name ( delivered to work ), was very polite and friendly on phone .
Electrical_goods	great , reliable company , highly_recommended !
Electrical_goods	i used hifi - tower to purchase radio microphones for karaoke use .

Electrical_goods	i ordered a canon_000d and it arrived at my door in only 0 days , fresh from_hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	the price was the most competitive around , even cheaper_than amazon .
Electrical_goods	with free shipping and friendly efficient service , what ' s not to like ?
Electrical_goods	i ' ll definitely be buying again from digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	thanks !
Electrical_goods	have had some issues with paypal re payment , the seller has been so good and patient , keeping in touch and responding to all my messages .

Electrical_goods	ordered my lens on the thursday and it was delivered on the monday .

Electrical_goods	was nervous_about buying from outside the uk but everything went well and will be ordering again soon .
Electrical_goods	i ordered a nikon_d0000 for £_000 .
Electrical_goods	it is a much_better price than anywhere_else i found in the uk or on - line .
Electrical_goods	delivery was quoted at around six days , but it only took three via dhl where the order tracking was very good .
Electrical_goods	my bank initially refused payment by debit_card - so i had to call them to pr - authorise the transaction .
Electrical_goods	great price and fast delivery from_hong_kong

Electrical_goods	i was hesitant to order a camera for my girlfriend from digitalrev so close to christmas .

Electrical_goods	my sister had recommended them so i bit the bullet .
Electrical_goods	i was pleasantly_surprised when my order was dispatched on friday the 00th and i received the camera , well_packaged and exactly as_described , on monday the 00th .

Electrical_goods	basically all i can is just purchase !
Electrical_goods	i have recently_purchased a chinup bar from hifi - tower and must_say that the quality of their chin up bar is excellent , compared to others i have seen .
Electrical_goods	its a very strong chinup bar and manages my weight very well without bending while pulled on like other cheaply built bars .
Electrical_goods	the bar was very easy to fit and i would reccomend anyone_looking to buy a chin up bar to visit hifi - tower , will shop again here .
Electrical_goods	thanks hifi - tower team !
Electrical_goods	i ordered my camera on monday_morning - it arrived tuesday_afternoon ( hong_kong to central_london ).

Electrical_goods	when i was ordering my internet crashed and i didn ' t know if the order had gone_through so i sent hifiheadphones an_email .
Electrical_goods	they rang me 00_minutes later to let me know it hadn ' t gone_through .
Electrical_goods	then when i managed to complete the order they sent me a personal email to confirm that this time it definitely had gone_through .
Electrical_goods	i thought that was excellent .
Electrical_goods	the item arrived very quickly , and included a free lolly .
Electrical_goods	small gestures are appreciated !
Electrical_goods	also the product is great - i have already_recommended the product and the website to 0 people .
Electrical_goods	i have ordered many things from hifiheadphones and that will_continue for a very very long time .
Electrical_goods	i genuinely have not dealt_with another company that has given better service .
Electrical_goods	the one time i had a fault with a product , it was replaced quickly , efficiently and without any hassle at all .
Electrical_goods	even ended_up having a lengthy conversation about various headphone / hifi things with the guy on the phone .
Electrical_goods	they properly know their stuff and are friendly and knowledgeable with it - not arrogant and pushy in the slightest .
Electrical_goods	you can see from the other reviews here exactly how great this company are .
Electrical_goods	i see no other choice for my headphone needs !
Electrical_goods	completely nailed the website redesign - very easy to use site , completely informative , straight to the point with well_presented information without any spammy content , which makes a nice change .
Electrical_goods	the live_chat feature enabled me to make an informed purchase after_speaking with a technical salesperson .
Electrical_goods	cheers mike !
Electrical_goods	i had never_heard of pixmania before and was worried that it wasn ' t a legit place to buy a tv , but because amazon wouldn ' t ship the tv i wanted to buy to ireland , i decided to give pixmania a try .
Electrical_goods	i ' m very pleased with my purchase .
Electrical_goods	the tv arrived within the estimated_delivery time and was in perfect_condition .
Electrical_goods	i was able to use a discount_code during the online payment process , so i ended_up paying less for the tv than i would have at most other_places .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely buy at pixmania again .
Electrical_goods	highly_recommended
Electrical_goods	i received the item the next_day after i placing my order .
Electrical_goods	and everything was as it was advertised .
Electrical_goods	this amplifier is fontastic .
Electrical_goods	i highly_recommend hifi - tower
Electrical_goods	i was a little_hesitant at using a foreign site but the service was second to none .
Electrical_goods	i received email_notifications every_step of the way and recieved my canon_0d in very little time .
Electrical_goods	as soon as my camera was dispatched i recieved a link and was able to track my package from_hong_kong through to germany and then into the uk .
Electrical_goods	i wouldnt_hesitate to use this service again especialy when uk prices are so high
Electrical_goods	i ordered from uk on tuesday_morning , the item arrived by friday_lunchtime .
Electrical_goods	all items present and working well .
Electrical_goods	no_problems with customs etc .
Electrical_goods	great value for the item - sony nex0r .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve only used it a couple of times but so far it ' s been outstanding .
Electrical_goods	the sensor picks_up everything , as good as a human eye .
Electrical_goods	used in difficult light ( cloudy day , occasional sunshine ) but all colours and depth captured well .
Electrical_goods	the 00 - 00 zoom lens makes it very portable ( not quite pocket size but light and easy ), the simple manual controls for iso , aperture and shutter speed make composition easy .
Electrical_goods	i look_forward to much more use with it .
Electrical_goods	not so bad , confusing information about opening package before signing ( delivery man wouln ' t allow me to do it , though i had instructions from pixmania to do so ...)
Electrical_goods	overall ok
Electrical_goods	i recently_bought the canon g00 ...
Electrical_goods	i seen this for £_000 in jessops compared to £_000 on digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	i was a little_sceptical at first buying from the internet but i read a lot of reviews of this site and hardly found one bad one .
Electrical_goods	the camera arrived from china in a matter of days , was well_packed and worked a treat .
Electrical_goods	the camera is brilliant and i would recommend digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	unfortunatly my package arrived torn , with no item inside .
Electrical_goods	i quickly established that this was due to royal_mails ( man ) handling of the package before discovering the joys of thier utterly appalling customer_service .
Electrical_goods	i therefore contacted hifi_headphones for advice who were quite the opposite .
Electrical_goods	as well as taking over responsibility for the royal_mail claim , they also offered to replace the item immediately at thier own cost .
Electrical_goods	communication was friendly , professional and polite .
Electrical_goods	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use this company again and highly_recommend them for anyone_looking to buy audio_equipment .
Electrical_goods	thankyou hifi - tower .
Electrical_goods	my purchase of a 000w subwoofer was reasonably_priced , with reasonable postage_costs and , when it arrived ( within the given time bracket ) it was very safely_packaged to ensure it arrived with no complications .
Electrical_goods	thank_you for your hard work on my order guys , i shall buy from you again .
Electrical_goods	ben smith
Electrical_goods	basically this is how all end - user buying experiences should be ' pain - free '.
Electrical_goods	the prices are pretty_much less_than what you ' d expect for such quality gear .
Electrical_goods	they are as far as i am concerned doing the pro - audio industry proud .
Electrical_goods	i ordered a studio monitor and items such as these are pretty fragile , so i was pretty happy to see it arrive in one piece and work just as the manufacturer intended .
Electrical_goods	don ' t normally leave reviews etc , but felt bop_dj deserved one .
Electrical_goods	order received next_day .
Electrical_goods	when had query with item , through no fault of bop_dj , replacement received following_day with no need to return original order .
Electrical_goods	emails where responded to quickly and courteously .
Electrical_goods	will not hesitate to order from them again in the future .
Electrical_goods	although i only had one transaction with them his one went smoothless and in no time i had my item delivered .
Electrical_goods	recommended to all buyers out there !
Electrical_goods	thank_you , your customer_service was without fault .
Electrical_goods	customer_service was superb and quick answers to all my questions i had , very helpful
Electrical_goods	another company let me down and i finally gave up on them after waiting for 0 weeks .
Electrical_goods	one call to kac and i had my tap within 00_hours , delivered in a one hour delivery slot and i saved over £_000 !!!
Electrical_goods	would definately_recommend them
Electrical_goods	no_problems , arrived quickly
Electrical_goods	quick delivery , well_packed .
Electrical_goods	will use it in the future !
Electrical_goods	so ...
Electrical_goods	i ordered my dslr on a monday_afternoon , slightly irritated that i wouldn ' t have it by the time i went away on wednesday_afternoon ( i had the delivery address as my work so i wouldn ' t miss the courier when away ) - but it was totally worth it for the fact that i ' d saved so much money over purchasing from a uk retailer .
Electrical_goods	in fact , it was cheaper to buy brand_new from digital_rev than it was to buy used on ebay / dp forums .
Electrical_goods	well , much to my surprise and joy the camera turned_up on the wednesday_morning and i was able to collect from work and take it away with me !
Electrical_goods	it was impressive watching the dhl_tracking status update from_hong_kong to germany , from germany to london and from london to the north_west in less_than a day ( it was dispatched on the tuesday ).
Electrical_goods	i really couldn ' t be_happier .
Electrical_goods	it ' s come with the digital_rev warranty , which i ' d heard people were wary of due to shipping times etc ... my mind is now at rest on that front .
Electrical_goods	the product was extremely well_packaged and is exactly_what you ' d get if purchasing from your local curry ' s - all usual accessories , english paperwork etc .
Electrical_goods	stop thinking about buying from them and just do it , it ' s a great way to keep the costs reasonable on an otherwise piss - taking hobby ( when it comes to uk pricing , the hobby itself is obviously great ).
Electrical_goods	hope this helps someone , mainly because - and i don ' t want this to come out racist in any way - i ' m obviously british .
Electrical_goods	i read some reviews that were either penned by someone whose first language isn ' t english or by someone whose is but they clearly have no regard for spelling and grammar .
Electrical_goods	it ' s easy to dismiss those reviews as so many nefarious websites will review themselves to give false scores .
Electrical_goods	i ' m confident that ' s not going on here , my experience followed the same path as all the other positive_reviews i ' d heard about them and i ' m beginning to think that the negative_reviews are from people who ' re bitter about us not paying vat with dr ... seriously , what ' s with everyone blowing a gasket that i ' m buying it cheaper_than they are ??
Electrical_goods	they can buy it here too !
Electrical_goods	i don ' t buy into this " morally grey " rubbish they preach , it ' s not illegal to import these from abroad and the items are going through customs fair and square .
Electrical_goods	do these same people go on holiday and not purchase anything ?
Electrical_goods	no memory_cards from spain ?
Electrical_goods	no ipod from florida mall ?
Electrical_goods	etc .
Electrical_goods	get over it .
Electrical_goods	enjoy your purchases , i am .
Electrical_goods	managed to get some great shots of my brother - in - laws gig that i didn ' t think i ' d have the camera in time for , so we ' re all happy .
Electrical_goods	hifi_tower were helpful and professional from start to finish .
Electrical_goods	pre_- sale support was great !
Electrical_goods	delivery was only 0 days from when i pushed the button and my new hifi system is a dream .
Electrical_goods	will be coming_back very soon !
Electrical_goods	thanks hifi - tower !
Electrical_goods	fast delivery , good product , good customer_service , comes with warranty etc brilliant fantastic couldnt get a better price or service
Electrical_goods	had a pair of headphones that developed a fault - my credit note was processed immediately and a new pair despatched the same day .
Electrical_goods	best customer_service i ' ve experienced in years
Electrical_goods	i would recommend this company to anyone , they quickly sent me a reasonable quotation via_email within a couple of hours of filling out the form , i sent the item to them and they literally had the package for half a day before i had my money transferred to me .
Electrical_goods	i dealt_with alex and rich , 0 great friendly people .
Electrical_goods	thanks again !
Electrical_goods	perfect , the delivery arrived earlier_than_expected which is always a bonus .
Electrical_goods	will_definitely be shopping with digitalrev again in the future !

Electrical_goods	wish all modern day companies were as good as these .
Electrical_goods	at last a company that cares_about their customers as much as their products .
Electrical_goods	can ' t say enough good words about them .
Electrical_goods	i got damaged speakers from you and i thought that now it will be problems with the replacement of equipment or recovering my money , but here the big surprise of the first email .
Electrical_goods	i have been informed of the available options and what i continue to do .
Electrical_goods	at the option of returning the goods i had not even pay for the courier because they all email sent '.
Electrical_goods	wow super first time something like this happened to me .
Electrical_goods	( huge plus ).
Electrical_goods	i wanted this problem resolve it quickly so i chose the option repayment parts .
Electrical_goods	of course everything without a problem .
Electrical_goods	in summary , despite the equipment was damaged certainly have not lost my confidence and professional approach made ​​ you i will_continue to buy from you .
Electrical_goods	thank_you
Electrical_goods	having decided on the 00mm prime i scoured web for the best price .
Electrical_goods	no one uk_based could come close to digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	even better still the delivery only took 0 days !
Electrical_goods	as quick , if not quicker_than some uk companies i ' ve used in the past .
Electrical_goods	the website itself was very easy to use and very attractive .
Electrical_goods	the sidebars categorized the various items that they have available and the option to search by brand was conveniently positioned .
Electrical_goods	i had brought a pair of headphones which were really tight on my big head and uncomfortable for gaming use , i called up hifiheadphones and an exchange was arranged instantly with my new product reserved for me by an enthusiastic member of staff .
Electrical_goods	great companies in my opinion are those who can turn an unsatisfied customer into a satisfied one .
Electrical_goods	the customer thus is overall more pleased with the service than if they were not unsatisfied in the first place and take the time out of their day to write several words on a website such as this recommending the company that made the effort to resolve their problem .
Electrical_goods	i ordered the bose computer musicmonitor speakers from hispek electronics .
Electrical_goods	i had been searching for a while for some good speakers at a decent price and these were the best deal available from anywhere i had seen .
Electrical_goods	i chose the standard delivery service but even then they turned_up the next_day !
Electrical_goods	i was very please with the service and the speakers are awesome .
Electrical_goods	i would recommend hispek to anyone !
Electrical_goods	great products for the best price i have seen anywhere and delivered exceptionally quickly !
Electrical_goods	i found this company when i was looking to replace a lost set of headphones and having read some positive information about them i thought i would give them a shot and i am pleased that i did .
Electrical_goods	having placed my order on a friday and choosing their standard delivery option i was extremely pleased when my new headphones arrived on the saturday .
Electrical_goods	their communication_throughout the process was great and it was reassuring to have each_stage of the ordering_process made clear to me so i was always aware of what was happening .
Electrical_goods	the product itself is also very good and having purchased it based on a recommendation placed on a forum by an hifiheadphones . co . uk representative i was also pleased to find that they know what they are talking_about and weren ' t simply trying to flog me a pair of expensive headphones in order to make a sale .
Electrical_goods	overall i would highly_recommend hifiheadphones . co . uk and should i find myself in the market for another set i would not hesitate to buy from them again .
Electrical_goods	very pleased with the item , process and the speed at which it was despatched .
Electrical_goods	will use again and recommend to others .

Electrical_goods	living in ireland , i am always looking for sites based close to home so i don ' t have to wait weeks for delivery : i ordered a wacom intuos0 tablet , and got a great deal - the tablet was even cheaper_than ordering directly from the wacom site .
Electrical_goods	with the money i saved , i covered shipping ( which is a handy flat_rate ) and extra insurance for the product .
Electrical_goods	after my order was dispatched , i recieved an_email telling_me my package would arrive between the 00th and the 00th of january - it arrived on the 00th completely intact and pristine .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely order from pixmania again .
Electrical_goods	compromise with deadline , efficiency , great consumer support and much more , are the reasons_why i am always ordering from digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	you are awesome !

Electrical_goods	kind_regards ,
Electrical_goods	f
Electrical_goods	ordered on a thursday before the next_day delivery cut_off , unfortunately they didnt manage to do it in time ( it happens !)
Electrical_goods	but was emailed saying the delay and if i would accept the saturday delivery instead ( paid for by them ), unfortunately the packer didnt send it via this so i got it on monday but really quick responses from these_guys , gave me a refund on my delivery cost which tbh is good for me .
Electrical_goods	i wasnt in a huge rush so i appreciate them giving me a refund when they really didnt need to !.
Electrical_goods	excellent company , as i always say .. you only truly know how good or bad a company is when something_goes_wrong , hifi delivered on correcting this :).
Electrical_goods	will be buying from them again !.
Electrical_goods	well what can i say i ordered my new lens ( a tokina 00 - 00mm f0 . 0 dxii ) from digital_rev sunday_evening , i woke_up to find an_email with tracking monday_morning , my lens touched down in gb @ 0 :_00am tuesday and was delivered 0 :_00pm tuesday .

Electrical_goods	will_definatley be purchasing products from here again
Electrical_goods	i ordered the lens late on the sunday_night , and received the lens in great condition on the tuesday , can ' t fault the transaction at all !
Electrical_goods	i have been a customer of the production_room for a very long time and i will always be one .
Electrical_goods	they are the only shop where when i go in , the staff will shake my hand and remember my name ( and even remember me when i phone up ).
Electrical_goods	this is excellent customer_service in anyone ' s book .
Electrical_goods	they often do product demonstrations and have an excellent array of equipment to try out in store .
Electrical_goods	it is very important to support local businesses like these when there are so many competitors and i like shopping there .
Electrical_goods	if i ' ve ever had any_problems with gear purchased , it has been sorted without an issue .
Electrical_goods	the only_drawback is the lack of extended_warranty ( for what they are worth ) which is not offered here .
Electrical_goods	the service they provide is everything you would want from a music tech store .
Electrical_goods	they are very happy for you to try before you buy , and there is always someone who can answer the most technical and obscure queries .
Electrical_goods	ive been to most of the main london pro audio stores and very few compare to the all_round quality of production rooms !
Electrical_goods	i can ' t praise them enough !!!
Electrical_goods	i ordered my udg cd wallet 0pm monday , it arrived very swiftly approx 00am the next_day !!!
Electrical_goods	unbelievably quick !!!
Electrical_goods	i will be shopping with them again for sure !!
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	i dont think i could of asked for much more .
Electrical_goods	they ' re good value and fast .
Electrical_goods	very fast considering it comes from_hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	they also supplied me with a uk plug adaptor and paid my import_tax .
Electrical_goods	there was no need to contact customer_service so i cant comment on that .
Electrical_goods	i will_definitely be using them again .
Electrical_goods	bosch " blue " power_tools are for the trade .
Electrical_goods	similar in design to some of the green diy tools , but inside are better components for daily use rather_than occasional .
Electrical_goods	hard wearing .
Electrical_goods	its good gear right enough , but when things do break down they really excel .
Electrical_goods	the blue stuff has a year guarantee that if you register your product within 0 weeks of purchase , they upgrade free to 0 years .
Electrical_goods	if anything fails , they send a courier out to wherever you ' re working , collect the faulty item and repair / replace and return it to you within a few_days .
Electrical_goods	all under_warranty .
Electrical_goods	now that is service !
Electrical_goods	brilliant and speedy service couldn ' t of asked for better !

Electrical_goods	ordered a new canon_00d with an extra lens and memory_card late friday_evening .
Electrical_goods	spent over £ 0000 was able to track delivery at every_stage .
Electrical_goods	by sun evening the package was in the uk and tracked with dhl .
Electrical_goods	the same package bought within the uk would have cost me an extra £_000 , made huge_savings .
Electrical_goods	package was on my door in northern_ireland monday_afternoon !
Electrical_goods	fast efficient and quality canon products !
Electrical_goods	very happy !
Electrical_goods	!

Electrical_goods	i would highly_recommend hifi - tower to anyone .
Electrical_goods	thanks
Electrical_goods	i needed to buy some headphones for my local pre_- school and hifiheadphones were the best for price , range of products and p_& p costs .

Electrical_goods	i liked that touch .
Electrical_goods	would definitely_recommend !
Electrical_goods	fast delivery .
Electrical_goods	good packing .
Electrical_goods	brilliant customer_service , great prices , free delivery .
Electrical_goods	and - get this - ordered nikon d000 00am , arrived from_hong_kong the next_day in uk .
Electrical_goods	brilliant .
Electrical_goods	amazing first transaction with digirev - i had some pre sales questions , all of which we ' re answered succinctly and quickly .
Electrical_goods	top_notch .
Electrical_goods	i will shop with them again .
Electrical_goods	great product , great service , arrived in 00_hours of placing order ( with dhl shipping )
Electrical_goods	i decided to ' bite - the - bullet ' and get a canon_0d , for at_least £_000 cheaper_than a uk version but still with a 0 year_warranty ( albeit via digitalrev rather_than canon ).
Electrical_goods	the alternative was a 000d ... but in my opinion 0d > 000d although based on much older technology .
Electrical_goods	checked out the feedback on the website from other customers and went forward with the purchase .
Electrical_goods	waited for the item to arrive with baited breath ...
Electrical_goods	delivery was tracked throughout , prompt and arrived on specified day with sms updates .
Electrical_goods	item was wrapped in maybe 0 - 0ft of bubble_wrap - and nestled safely was the canon_0d box plus a few extras i ordered .
Electrical_goods	so far i have not had any_problems , i am only just starting in the world of enthusiast photography - i am no expert .
Electrical_goods	my only_gripe , ( and it is a minor one ); all the documentation was in japanese - not a big deal since the english pdf can be downloaded from canon ' s website .
Electrical_goods	but when your just starting and a solid bit of kit arrives with a bible - sized manual that makes no sense to you the reader , it can feel intimidating .
Electrical_goods	to date not had any_issues or problems , so i am unable to comment on digitalrev aftersales / support .
Electrical_goods	i have no_regrets following this purchase and i am very pleased with the product and service from digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	now , photography community what ' s all this rumour nonsense about a 0d mk0 and where can i get one ??
Electrical_goods	?
Electrical_goods	the information available about my headphones , the updates i received about my order and the speed with which it arrived all mean i ' d be very happy using this company again .
Electrical_goods	fast delivery , great customer_service .
Electrical_goods	bought a bud ego starter and a month later one of the batteries stopped charging , dropped them an_email and within an_hour i got a response telling_me to return it for a new one , cannot_fault them !
Electrical_goods	was well worth purchasing my 0d mk 0 from digital_rev as they were so much cheaper_than the alternatives in the uk .
Electrical_goods	the camera came perfectly on time , but unfortunately the battery grip i ordered was missing part .
Electrical_goods	however digital_rev quickly resolved this via emails and instant chat , sending me out a replacement straight_away .
Electrical_goods	their customer_service staff were very helpful and polite !
Electrical_goods	will_definitely be using them again .
Electrical_goods	dispatched same day and arrived next morning despite harsh weather_conditions via ups .
Electrical_goods	plenty of emails regarding order progress .
Electrical_goods	product very well_packaged which for me is extremely important , no one wants their expensive gear to arrive in a dented box .
Electrical_goods	headphones ( 000 ) are also brilliant :-) * 0_stars .
Electrical_goods	perfect item as_described
Electrical_goods	thanks
Electrical_goods	really informative website .
Electrical_goods	the company ' s product review rated the item ( soundmagic pl00 ) very highly , yet the headphones still turned_out to be even better_than_expected .
Electrical_goods	significantly better_than the denon ' s , originally costing twice as much , that they replaced .
Electrical_goods	good price .
Electrical_goods	faultless communication_throughout .
Electrical_goods	delivery via_royal_mail within_00hrs .
Electrical_goods	and yes , finding a lollipop at the bottom of the parcel did make me smile !
Electrical_goods	thanks would buy from u agin very good time on delivery and a grate price thanks ones agin

Electrical_goods	all items were delivered very quickly , even_though i had a problem with one of the amps hifi - towers were really apologetic and gave me a small refund as a gesture of good will and delivered my replacement amp in the same week !
Electrical_goods	amazing !
Electrical_goods	there customer_service is top_class and will_defiantly use them again !
Electrical_goods	thanks so much !
Electrical_goods	after getting an_email back pretty_much instantly , i feel as if they are trust_worthy and their products look great and i will be making future_purchases with them
Electrical_goods	well what can i say , ordered on a thursday_morning and it arrived on the monday_afternoon .... better job than companies in the uk .
Electrical_goods	i ' m a very happy customer ;)
Electrical_goods	i ordered some £_00 headphones from hifiheadphones yesterday at about 0pm .
Electrical_goods	had an_email asking me to cotact them to confirm some details which i was happy to do .
Electrical_goods	nice to know the company cares_about it ' s customers .
Electrical_goods	the headphones were delivered today around midday , very well packages .
Electrical_goods	i was really shocked how quick they arrived .
Electrical_goods	customer_service was fantastic and i had regular_updates informing_me that the package had been dispatched .
Electrical_goods	i will_definately be recommending these_guys to my mates .
Electrical_goods	fantasic service guys .
Electrical_goods	gratz
Electrical_goods	the earphones received were of poor quality the sound crackled on use .
Electrical_goods	soundmagic pl00 in - ear sound isolating earphones .
Electrical_goods	further to this poor product my credit_card was compromised with fraudulent transactions .
Electrical_goods	shoddy .
Electrical_goods	i bought a panasonic lumix camera for my daughters_birthday and doing well in her exams , we did not realise the company was based in hong_kong until the camera arrived .
Electrical_goods	we have had the camera now for nine months and has only been used on several_occasions , family events ect .
Electrical_goods	now all of a sudden the shutter and zoom has stopped_working so we sent it away to be repaired .
Electrical_goods	costing us 00 pounds .
Electrical_goods	digital_rev said that the warranty on the camera will not cover the problem even_though the repairer stated it was a faulty part .
Electrical_goods	digital_rev stated it was down to ware and tare - in other words they did not want to know .
Electrical_goods	the repairer stated if the product was bought in the uk the warranty would have covered the problem without question .
Electrical_goods	in other words when you purchase off digital_rev realistically the warranty does not exist .
Electrical_goods	you might be lucky , but for the sake of 00 , 00 , 00 pounds it is really not worth the risk .
Electrical_goods	this is truly a dodgey company .

Electrical_goods	the lens was well_packaged , delivery came very quickly and had tracking_information all the way through .
Electrical_goods	also like that the follow_up email sounded a bit more human rather_than a robotic " thanks for the purchase , insert review here ".
Electrical_goods	it might still be an_automated email but at_least it ' s with a bit more effort and thought to presentation .
Electrical_goods	i was of course dubious of all these high rating reviews especially after seeing some of the other non - uk stores and their blackhat tactics .

Electrical_goods	i recently_bought 0 vision ego kits from safercigs , one for myself and one for my wife a 000 and a 0000 with a few bottles of juice .
Electrical_goods	the battery ' s are fine no issues with that or the juice ' s however the vision egos themself were all ment to be the one ' s with replaceable atomisers and they were not they were just the standard one piece but also one of them didnt work at all .
Electrical_goods	another thing is the travel case ' s that arrived with them were personalised with the name " darren " on them which have absolutely no relevance to myself or my wife .
Electrical_goods	the thing that really disappointed me the most was the customer_service side of things , i sent them an_email regarding the issues and have had absolutely no response the impression i get is that they got my money and now couldnt care less in light of all the issues i was extremely disappointed and will not be using this company again .

Electrical_goods	i bought a sony bravia tv kdl00w000 for £ 0000 , went all the way from oxford to the store , as it was a pick_up only deal . fast and easy transaction in store .
Electrical_goods	got back home , started unboxing and .
Electrical_goods	that ' s where it started .
Electrical_goods	power_cable were unpacked , hanging on the top of the tv ( where it should have been originally wrapped tight in a plastic_bag attached at the back of the tv ) , the power plug that goes in the power socked were obviously used , marks visible on it .
Electrical_goods	i phoned hispek to tell them what i got , they did get back to me as after doing some investigations , saying that it is impossible and it never happened before .
Electrical_goods	i phoned sony to find out how it comes in the package , they said it ' s definitely not the way it should be and i need to find out with company why .
Electrical_goods	but all that hispec offered me , was to bring it back all the way down from oxford again .
Electrical_goods	i am very disappointed as i paid for brand_new tv and got a possible customer return , ex display or else , which of course according to hispek wasn ' t .
Electrical_goods	after my last email to them which was a week_ago , they never got back to me .
Electrical_goods	i would never buy from them again .
Electrical_goods	also a warning for these that comes from far away for in store purchase , i would recomend to check the item while in store , so you won ' t end up like me .
Electrical_goods	be aware !
Electrical_goods	hi
Electrical_goods	took time to decide which camera to buy .
Electrical_goods	tekshop000 had a good price .
Electrical_goods	i placed an order on - line and got it delivered in two days . i choose 0 - 0 days shipping from there website . they emailed when they shipped the order .. i never had a need to phone them so cant say how good they are on the phone .
Electrical_goods	this purchase was for my first dslr camera as i want to take up photography .
Electrical_goods	after looking around on the internet for my chosen model ( nikon_d0000 ) digitalrev offered the best price by quite a substantial margin for the body and a 00 - 00mm_lens , which is great to start with .
Electrical_goods	after_placing my order late on a sunday_evening i was not expecting to receive it until the end of the week at_least , as i live in south wales , uk .
Electrical_goods	however , it was dispatched on monday and it arrived on wednesday which was amazing .
Electrical_goods	the tracking on the order was brilliant as you can check the progress too .
Electrical_goods	the camera was extremely well_packaged and a uk plug adapter was also included which was helpful .
Electrical_goods	i am really pleased with the camera so far and would recommend the camera to others .
Electrical_goods	you can find plenty of reviews on the internet about this camera .
Electrical_goods	as previous reviews state the instructions aren ' t in english .
Electrical_goods	however , you can easily download a pdf manual off the nikon site so this isn ' t a problem .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely_recommend this site to others , and already have done .
Electrical_goods	i will also return to purchase lenses etc in future .
Electrical_goods	cannot_fault the item or service supplied by digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	cheapest for the monitor and delivery on time .

Electrical_goods	there ' s a simple instruction of how to use the pads inside .
Electrical_goods	the bag is light which is great to carry around .
Electrical_goods	i bought it to travel with me abroad and it didn ' t take much space on the overhead space either .
Electrical_goods	the price is also reasonable .
Electrical_goods	i do highly_recommend it .
Electrical_goods	thats right i ordered it and it arrived from_hong_kong to the uk within 00_hours which is absolutely astonishing , it came in plenty of packaging and works like a charm :)

Cell_phone_Recycling	the day i sent my phone , they accepted it and paid out .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was told 0 working_days plus to get the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the received it the next_day , by 0 : 00 that day the money was on the way to my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will use these over anyone_else in the future
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have sent them my blackberry phones , i had them refurbished recently and they look like new .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wanted to try these_guys as the price was the highest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i paid for special delivery to send these phones to them as wasnt too sure on them and wanted to make_sure them get them quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they tried to stich me up by reducing the price for each phone to nearly 0rd of the value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after trying to get them to offer the original price and sending loads of emails i in the end askled for the phones to be sent back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 weeks_later i finally got them back and the protective screen covers i had on them have been removed by this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	dont use them if you can help it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	bye
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have been using loads of different companies to recycle my mobile_phones and let me tell you ; fonebank are just the best .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the pay the best money , send money quick and if you do have any_queries they sort them out without any funny delays .
Cell_phone_Recycling	always use these_guys . just fantastic
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent off my old_nokia to mazuma with some reservations as there are some negative_reviews out there .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however i can not praise the speed and ease of service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone to them last monday and by wednesday the sale was complete with the funds in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant service highly_recommended
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cannot_believe the speed and efficiency in which my order was processesd .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it only took a few_days from me sending the fone in to getting my payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service is excellent and i will_definately use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the 0rd time i have used mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the 0st time i received my cheque by return post .
Cell_phone_Recycling	on the other occasions , i have had the money transfered and it was in my account by 0000 on the day they received the phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you could not wish for a smoother transaction .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma is a company i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend to my friends and family - 0st_class !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent out the envelope very quickly , received my phone and notified me even quicker and paid the money into my account the same day - excellent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	filled the online form , received the freepost_bag the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and received the money in my bank_account 00_hrs later after sending the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast and reliable service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after upgrading with phones0u , the sales_person advised a recycling comparison site for old_phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the result to give most money for my galaxy sii was money0yourphone . com and after some research online , i opted for them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	checkout was extremely easy and in 0 minutes the order was complete .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had ordered a bag to send the phone in but it took 0 or 0 days to arrive , before which i ' d requested another ( which also turned_up in about the same amount of time ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	whether this is down to m0yp or the royal_mail , i don ' t know .
Cell_phone_Recycling	be sure to send your phone as special delivery as this covers you up to £_000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	signed for mail i believe is only £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	emails for when my phone arrived with them and was tested are good , meaning you are kept in the loop .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment does admittedly take a number of days after this ( i had the money in my account in full , 0 days before the date they stated however ) so if you ' re in a rush for the money , you may have to look_elsewhere .
Cell_phone_Recycling	given the amount they gave for my phone , and ignoring the envelope and delayed payment issues , i would definitely_recommend these_guys .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they paid the most for my phone by a good 00 or 00_% i ' d say .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma are faultless , excellent customer_service team with a quick start to finish service these_guys are always friendly , would highly_recommend - 0 + stars
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent in my ipad yesterday via special delivery next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was emailed this morning to say it had been received , then lunch time to say it had been checked , then this afternoon to say they had paid me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i checked my bank_account and the money is there already .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it literally took 00_hours to send my ipad and get paid for it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cannot_fault them , and i will_definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' m a little_bit in shock , to be honest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i didn ' t think you could get service like this .
Cell_phone_Recycling	says it all in the title !
Cell_phone_Recycling	beware of less well_known recycling firms who offer you more money as they invariably then offer you a lower offer when they receive the phone - no issues like that with muzumba .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i went to mazuma because the song on the advert was stuck in my head , it was so quick and easy to do , and even when we hadn ' t sent the form back they prompted us which was nice and 0 days_later ( from day of posting ) the money was sat in the bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would always use mazuma now
Cell_phone_Recycling	got the price advertised transferred into my account the day after posting my old phone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma is excellent , great friendly , trustworthy company and highly been recomended to any one who_wants to get_rid of thier old_phones , easy and really simple to use excellent
Cell_phone_Recycling	when selling my mobile i used a comparison site and mazuma came out as offering the best price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent off phone on a saturday , received confirmation it had been received on monday and received my argos_voucher on tuesday - fantastic .
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything went_smoothly and you have the option of choosing cash or argos_voucher with a higher value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 days mega
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was thoroughly_impressed by the speedy_delivery of the paper work and their complete efficiency in dealing_with the whole_process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i thoroughly_recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i tried a different company as they were offering more money than mazuma , but it turns_out that mpx is a big scam and i would advise everyone to steer_clear of them and trust mazuma over other_companies false claims to be better_than them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very reliable service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as the company was in london i decided to drop it off , unfortunately their office hours were exactly that of mine so i weren ' t able to go during their office hours .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however i decided to drop my phone there through the post on friday_evening .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so on tuesday when i haven ' t heard_anything back i emailed them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	on wednesday they first came back as not found but after couple of hours got a reponse saying everything was processed with no_problems .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i didn ' t really have any_problems and that ' s why the full stars , i got scared that they wouldn ' t be trustworthy and just say my phone was " gone " as i didn ' t really have any way to prove it . however was very positively_surprised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast payment through the post and very reasonable_price :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	have used mazuma several_times for cheap and expensive phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	each time no hassle and payment received ( cheque ) the following_day after being received by mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this time i tried the payment direct through my bank_account and this service was excellent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was transferred to my bank same day mazuma received my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma a long time and will do for a long time to come ... excellent
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick easy way of getting some cash .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_complaints .

Cell_phone_Recycling	very good service and very easy to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the third time ive used mazuma , each time we have found it so quick and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	we always get argos_vouchers , and always have that within a few_days , but we are kept in the loop via_email to let u know when ure fones been received and when ure argos card has been sent out .... im so happy with the service that i havent even considered trying out another company ... and we will_continue to use mazuma twice a year to recycle our old_phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	keep up the good work !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	very smooth pleasant_transaction
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend mazuma to everyone one who asks about selling a phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really fast reliable from beginning to to end .
Cell_phone_Recycling	00 out of 00
Cell_phone_Recycling	after applying online , i received my postage bag the next_day , sent my phone off and then received my cash 0 days_later !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve used mazuma countless_times and the service is always faultless and fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t fault the company at all .
Cell_phone_Recycling	simple as that .
Cell_phone_Recycling	third time i have used mazuma and again it was great all_round .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma could not be more highly_recommended by myself ; i completed the required details and had my pack sent to me , which actually arrived the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phone at 0pm and received an_email from mazuma at 00 :_00am the next_day saying payment would be made shortly ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had my money by 00pm , less_than 00_hours from time of postage !
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant !
Cell_phone_Recycling	as i said in my review , i did exactly_what said in your instructions and i suposed that you paid royal_mail for a special delivery and they should know that is a mobile phone and you already know that i ' ll sent you a expensive mobile phone and now i have instead a brand_new galaxy_s0 a broken galaxy_s0 , thank_you very much .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and i ' m waiting for the informations to fill the complain formulary ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone to mazuma on saturday_morning and the money as quoted was in my account for monday_afternoon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent , honest and reliable service , will recommend to friends and would use again !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	having heard many bad_reviews on various sites about the different mobile recycle companies i was dubious to try it , but i find putting stuff on ebay a hassle now days so didn ' t want to do that .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i decided to give mazuma a chance .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was quoted from the website £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phones off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a day later i had an_email_saying the phones had been recevied and a cheque posted out .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the very next_day a cheque for £_00 arrives through the door .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was absolutely amazed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got a fair price for the phones and the payment within 0 days of posting my phones off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will_definitely use mazuma_mobile next time to recycle a phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	envirofone were incredibly efficient with regard to sending me my packaging along with sending me the money for my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	their reminder emails were very helpful and their pricing was fair
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have been exploring many websites that deal with mobile recycling but i was recommended mazuma by a few friends saying how quick and easy it was as well as great value for money so i thought id take a gamble .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have to say this is probably one of the most efficient and outstanding websites i have come_across .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not only was it easy to place an order , but the efficiency from when i sent the phones to you to when i received confirmation that the money was transferred to my account was astonishing !
Cell_phone_Recycling	literally about 00_hours it took .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the money i received will now be going towards a few special presents as its my mums 00th coming up as well as my son oscars first birthday coming up .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you to all the staff who work for mazuma , you are all a credit to yourselves and i will be recommending your site to everybody !

Cell_phone_Recycling	will_defiantly use first time next tune .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i decided to use mazumamobile based on the great reputation they have for customer_service and i wasn ' t dissapointed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website was very easy to use and only to a couple of minutes to place an order to send three phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the price quoted was up there with the other_websites too .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the pack to send the phones in arrived the next_day and again was easy to use with the forms to submit already completed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	free p_& p too .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i went for the option of a cheque and this arrived two days_later , even in all the postal delays due to the snow .
Cell_phone_Recycling	now i know the system works i ' d probably use the bank_transfer next time .

Cell_phone_Recycling	00 out of 00 for sure , a really positive experience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great way to turn drawer clutter into cash .

Cell_phone_Recycling	really excellent service , would reccomend & definitely use again when needing to recycle a mobile phone :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i only went with envirofone because i had read they pay you the same day as soon as the phone has been checked over .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wouldn ' t go with them again simply because of this .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had to wait a week for my payment after they got my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i actually phoned when i had an_email_saying they had my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i waited until 0pm for the money but i asked them why i hadn ' t had it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was told it isn ' t same day and loads of people had also said the same_thing i did to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so sort it out and make it clear to customers !
Cell_phone_Recycling	having just sent off my second old phone and received my argos_voucher back in a couple of days i can highly_recommend this service !, very good communication by email , fast postage of both the pre paid bag and the payment voucher - mush faster_than the alternative of selling it yourself on a well_known auction site .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definately use this again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i simply cannot_fault the service provided .
Cell_phone_Recycling	top draw .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very useful website , super easy to use and definitely better_than manually searching the net for the best price i can get for my old_phones - i didnt even know there were so many companies or that my old phone could be worth twice as much as some of the bigger named companies advertise on their websites .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would use again and highly_recommend
Cell_phone_Recycling	it pays you significantly more_than any other company , and it ' s simple , easy , and free to post your old_phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	never had a problem and quick payment too !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted phone on wednesday and had the agreed amount of money in my bank_account the day after .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t believe_how quick they were in processing the order
Cell_phone_Recycling	great speedy service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a great offering and brilliant way to get_rid of those old_phones !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a bit_sceptical after_reading several reviews online about these cash for phones companys , and although mazuma didnt offer the best price (£ 00 - mazuma , the highest being £_000 ), they had the best reviews .
Cell_phone_Recycling	people were claiming to have been ripped_off by the companys offering more money saying they had recieved damaged phones , and giving out a fraction of the advertised price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after choosing mazuma i emailed them to inform them my keypad surround was missing and one corner of the phone was dented , and would this still qualify for the full_amount , which they said it would .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( i kept the email incase of any_issues down the line , i then sent my phone with royal_mail , insured for free up to 00 pounds as_described in mazumas directions , and after 0 days received a confirmation_email , and the money straight into my bank_account :).
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definitely use mazuma again , and have no quams recoomending them to others !
Cell_phone_Recycling	knocks socks off others
Cell_phone_Recycling	this was my first time selling a mobile phone over the internet so i was a little_nervous .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i read a few reviews of different companies and fonebank seemed to have consistantly good reviews .
Cell_phone_Recycling	their prices for phones are good but not the highest on the web - although i hear some of the other_companies quote high prices on their website then when you actually send your phone they knock it down by 00_% saying it ' s not in perfect_condition - who ' s phone is by the end of a contract period !
Cell_phone_Recycling	anyway no such issues with fonebank , sent phone recorded_delivery , the next_day received email confirmation they had received phone and set_up a bacs payment , £_000 was in my bank 0 days_later - top service - thank_you !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	wednesday : registered phone with mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	thursday : posted phone to mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	friday : mazuma received phone and issued argos_voucher
Cell_phone_Recycling	saturday : got my voucher in time for a shopping trip !
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant , fast service from mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	other_companies that i have used can take up to two_weeks to assess the phone and issue the voucher , i had this voucher two days after posting my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	amazingly speedy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	and i ' d definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 * service from mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i find sold my phone was quick and easy
Cell_phone_Recycling	five_stars - i have sold three phones now and the service has been fantastic every time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will only use mazuma for selling my phones in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you for your excellent customer_service mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	found website really easy to use , postal bag came through quickly and money went into my account with no_probs ... deffo_use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service and quick payment , emails to keep me updated and free delivery print off slip to send phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	perfect
Cell_phone_Recycling	i tried envirofone first who offered me less_than 00_% of what mazuma did and took 00x longer in doing so .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really good service , phone received within 0 days , cheque received within 0 working_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good all_round !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my damaged iphone 0 to envirofone because they said " we don ’ t offer an average price for a faulty phone ; instead we take the time to test each_individual mobile so that you get an individual price for the individual fault ."
Cell_phone_Recycling	after saying they haven ' t received my phone for 0 days ( when intact the tracker showed they had ) i contacted them and amazingly the next_day they had not only received the phone , but had tested it and found it was damaged .
Cell_phone_Recycling	everywhere was offering me around £_00 for my faulty phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after taking their time they offer me a paltry £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	£_00 less_than almost every competitor .
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolute waste of time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	what has happened .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used envirofone many many years_ago when they were the industry leaders and pioneers .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( sold some old nokias ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	they are a shadow of their former self and are trading on their name .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service , very quick and easy , transaction was very fast and i am very happy to use this service again as they have very reasonable prices for my old_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fantastic price paid at a very fast rate
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything went smooth !
Cell_phone_Recycling	no hassle service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	registered online and sent phone in on same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the following_morning received an_email to say the phone had been received and the payment being transferred .
Cell_phone_Recycling	two days_later , money in account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick , efficient , good value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would highly_recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service and a pleasure to deal with .
Cell_phone_Recycling	super smooth_transaction and a great price for my phone
Cell_phone_Recycling	really easy , not the best price but the most trustworthy and really clear_instructions .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was very easy from start to finish .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sign_up was easy and you just had to print off the postage label and post it yourself .
Cell_phone_Recycling	when i was delayed posting it they emailed to check everything was ok and they held the price for 0 weeks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have been there customer for very long time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the payment process is very fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	amazing very happy with everything
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma blew me away !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they offered a fair price for my phone and all was done and dusted 0 days from me posting phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would 000_% use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	a guide price was given before i sent in my phone , the pre_- paid envelope arrived a couple of days_later and i popped my phone in and waved goodbye .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was missing a button on the keypad so i was expecting to be contacted about receiving a reduced price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was pleasantly_surprised when i got an_email from mazuma the next_day saying that the full_amount would be paid and that the money would be in my account by midnight .
Cell_phone_Recycling	happy days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks for the dosh !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick payment !
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything was really quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the envelope arrived the next_day and i had money in my account that week !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy to use service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	detailed emails explaining what is happening and when the money will be transferred .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely_recommend to friends and family .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the post back envelope arrived_promptly and i recieved payment 0 days after i sent the phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy transaction cash paid straight_away - thanks
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent iphone 0 in good condition , sent recorded_delivery , then got email_saying screen cracked which is a joke as this had bubble rap and was in a case , said phone screen cracked so it was put down form 000 to 00 , i have sent many phone before with out problem , this has made me so mad and i will never trust this company again , would not surprise me if the company has been sold to somebody_else .
Cell_phone_Recycling	never ever using this again !.
Cell_phone_Recycling	just seen the reply , 0 its my word vs your word about phone being damaged .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 you could have damaged it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 . what the point off sending phone back if its been damaged .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thats why i took the price in the first place its one big joke , like i say never will
Cell_phone_Recycling	use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	.............................. update ..................................................
Cell_phone_Recycling	will never use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thats the end .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found the website very easy to use the pre_- paid envelope arrived the next_day , i posted it off and the money was in my account the same day they acknowledged receipt of my phone ... you cant_beat that for service very fast and efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very impressed with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy to arrange for the mobile to be sent off and i got paid the amount i was promised very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would highly_recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	an entirely hassle_free process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i entered what was required online , printed one document and because i was eager for my money , i sent it in a padded bag that i had lying_around .
Cell_phone_Recycling	although it ' s freepost , i ' d recommend queueing at the post_office for a proof of posting , just for the £_00 compensation cover should your phone go missing in transit .
Cell_phone_Recycling	within three days my phone had been received and the money was in my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had considered selling it on ebay , but the hassle of advertising it , the fees and the risk that the buyer would want to return it just put me off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so impressed that my partner has sent their phones to mazuma as well , and they got exactly the same great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended !
Cell_phone_Recycling	probably the best and smoooooooth transactions ever very quick and class service , defenatley recomend
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found it so good because i didn ' t realise how much i would get for an old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i compred other recycling phone websites and mazuma was the best by_far .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was slightly hesitant to send my phone off , even_though i will never use it again , to a company and rely_on them being ' honest ' enough to acknowledge it ' s delivery .. never mind giving me the money we ' d agreed upon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was stupid !
Cell_phone_Recycling	every_step was easy with mazuma_mobile , i just put my phone in an old box i had sitting around , sat that in the plastic envelope thing they sent me .. popped in my order form then handed it over at the post_office ( finding an open post_office was a nightmare , but that ' s a complaint for someone_else ! )
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 days_later , money is in my account as agreed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	:)
Cell_phone_Recycling	from the moment i applied for their pack the whole_process was quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my return envelope arrived within two days allowing me to send my old_phones off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as i had asked to be paid by cheque i didn ' t receive my money on the day they arrived but my cheque came through my door 0 days after sending the old_phones off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the cheque was for the money i had been quoted .
Cell_phone_Recycling	overall i was very happy with the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easey way to sell best place
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve used fonebanker for years every since my se k000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you can get more money from other_companies but fonebanker is easy to use and fast payment times .

Cell_phone_Recycling	would use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great communication and incredibly fast payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really like the option to print off the paperwork at home instead of wiating for your pack to arrive .
Cell_phone_Recycling	in the last_year i ' ve sold 0 phones on mazuma and every_single service has been great , prompt efficent and very helpful .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only one issue with pricing but that was a fault i had caused to the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	other than that happily_recommend their service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	speedy payment , easy to use site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would be nice if they had an i - phone app .

Cell_phone_Recycling	well impressed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	dedicated service to get you the best deal .
Cell_phone_Recycling	from postage to payment , no_problems at all .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma has exceeded my expectation yet again , such a speedy service with updates_throughout the whole_process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not only that but now bank_transfers are available so money is in your account even quicker .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_continue to use mazuma every time !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the price quoted for 0 phones was the best i could find anywhere .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received the prepaid bag within a couple of days and the money in my bank a few_days after posting the phones back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not much else i can say other than it was very simple .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i just got an upgrade from my phone provider & had a scratched & dusty old 0 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got my new phone & stuck the old 0 in my drawer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a friend at work said i should sell it to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i looked up the price & the phone was fully functioning so seemed a waste not to at_least try .
Cell_phone_Recycling	honestly it was so easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i signed_up online & gave all my details & requested a pre_- paid envelope for my phone ( this was the longest part of the process ) a day later i got the ennvelope !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i deleted all my stuff from my old phone , cleaned it down & sent it off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got an_email a day later from mazuma ( communication is fantastic !)
Cell_phone_Recycling	to let me know they had recieved it and the next_day i had £_00 in my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma twice since , once for another working handset & once for an ancient phone which was broken .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this totalled another £_00 direct into my bank_account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	exact_same experience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would reccommend to anyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quicker_than cashing a cheque !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy to use , simply printed , posted and got paid !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was all straightforward until they emailed me and said they ' d found a fault with my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it worked_perfectly well and i only wanted to sell it as i ' d upgraded and need some extra cash to put towards my holiday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i now don ' t have the box as i didn ' t need to send it with the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so i ' ll get less selling privately .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not at all happy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be using mazuma next time ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	also received an_email after i ' d sent the phone saying they hadn ' t received it ( rude , give me a chance i work full time )
Cell_phone_Recycling	not impressed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a lot of messing_around with envirofone , so got my phone back and sent it straight to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my mobile to them yesterday , today it has been processed and the money is already in my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am absolutely over the moon with this service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend them to everybody looking to sell their old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	honestly couldn ' t fault them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will only ever use these from now on .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you so much for a great , fast and easy service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my iphone_0s to them yesterday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i went on to my account today to find they ' d knocke the price down by £_000 because the phone " tested faulty ".
Cell_phone_Recycling	there is a tiny cosmetic mark on the front and when i rang customer_services i was told that this classes the phone as faulty .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the advisor told me that they sell the phone on so they can ' t accept cosmetic damages !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' m absolutely_disgusted that because of a tiny little mark they won ' t pay the price that the phone is worth !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the fact is , it costs £_00 to make the repair to fix the cosmetic_damage so they ' re expecting to make a huge profit out of taking_advantage of my " naivety ".
Cell_phone_Recycling	well i ' m not giving them that satisfaction .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve requested the phone back and i will sell it on myself for what the phone is actually worth .
Cell_phone_Recycling	rip_off_merchants , avoid at all costs !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used a site like this before and not had a good experience , but mazuma_mobile were brilliant !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website was easy to use , the price was good and the service was problem free .

Cell_phone_Recycling	sold a broken phone for £_00 which would otherwise be thrown away / recycled .
Cell_phone_Recycling	pre_- paid envelope arrived next_day for the phone to be sent out and payment was received two days after i send the mobile phone off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	can ' t fault mazuma_mobile i have an account which i have used to sell several phone .

Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definately be selling my next phone to them when it is time to up grade !
Cell_phone_Recycling	keep up the good work x_x_x
Cell_phone_Recycling	was very good experience however , the sell order before phone apprantly did not get recived and i lost my dal
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone off to them on the 00 / 00 /_0000 and it is still not with them they should not make their return envelopes so obvious so they can be intercepted in the post by thieves in the royal_mail !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i feel this is a major issue that needs to be dealt_with by the company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	now i have to wait_till july before i can have a decent phone again !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i received that on the tuesday , sent the phone back and got my email on the wednesday saying they had the phone and would send me my payment that day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	wanted an instant transfer and that ' s exactly_what i got , no_quibble , just money in the bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if i ' d have known it was that easy i would have done it ages_ago instead of giving my old_phones away .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good price too for a phone i haven ' t used in months .
Cell_phone_Recycling	wouldn ' t have even thought about it but happened to see an advert on the box and thought " why not ".
Cell_phone_Recycling	deffo gonna be using this company again and i reccommend you do the same if you ' ve got a phone kicking about !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	there are many of these televised phone buying websites but following their release of an advert which is related to charlie and the chocolate factory , i knew which was the company to use !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i went online and got a quote for my old iphone and compared that to the prices people were paying on ebay , i opted for mazuma as the price was fair and it would cut out the extra costs i . e .
Cell_phone_Recycling	commission / listing fees on ebay .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone which cost £ 0 . 00 through insured mail and received emails constantly keeping me updated on the process and then my cheque arrived within days .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i was updated all the way through with the process - unlike cash0phones who i have had to ring 0times and now threatened legal_action aswell as sent the managing_director a message on linkedin advising i have sent a complaint to watchdog - which i have - all to no reponse but they can send reminder letters about my sisters phone i enquired_about sending !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	firstly , mazuma offered the best price for recycling the phone i had out of any of the other recycling websites .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone i had also had a shattered screen , which several other_websites would not accept , but mazuma did .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recieved the free postage envelope quickly , and they recieved the phone quickly after i posted it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was then paid ... quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks for doing what you say you will mazuma .

Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma accepted my phone as working even_though i told them in_advance that the buttons were a bit sticky and there was some superficial damage .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone recorded_delivery on the tuesday , had it accepted on the wednesday and had the money in my account on the friday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definately use this company again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast turn - around and all_round excellent service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	what a simple website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ’ ve done my research and after checking out 00 different recycling websites i have to say this is definitely the simplest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	search your phone , place the order and wait for your money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ’ t be easier .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the communication is really good .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received an_email all the way through the order .
Cell_phone_Recycling	when they received the phone , when it was tested and when i would be paid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	try it out for yourselves .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you won ’ t be disappointed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wasn ' t .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got a new phone on contract and i really didn ' t like the handset i just couldn ' t get to grips with it just wanted a quick and easy sale a friend_recommended enviro phone to so i went online and was amazed at the price offered from start to finish you were kept in the loop at all of the stages they are very professional and very fast sending out the packaging and when sending payment i would definitely reccomend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a price and got a check for the amount agreed on the site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	used them before a few_years_ago , trustworthy and reliable site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they weren ' t the highest offer compared to others , but having read some bad_reviews of other_sites , and seen a whole range of companies i ' d never even heard of i stuck with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my phone was in perfect working order but looked very tired for 0 years use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i don ' t think others would have given me the price they originally_quoted .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be using again in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	at first i was a little iffy about sending off my old_mobiles , but the process was easy , quick and most_importantly safe .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after putting in the brand and type of mobiles i wanted to get_rid of on the mazuma website , i was shown how much i could get for them and once i accepted the amount , i chose the best payment option .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then , i got sent the envelope and off they went !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the payment got sent within two days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	placed order on the tuesday and had received payment by the friday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i visited the website and printed off the address label and other required paperwork .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i popped my mobile in a jiffy_bag and the next_day received confirmation that it had arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone was processed and checked , i opted for the same day transfer and was notified when the money was put into my bank !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got £_00 for my phone which was a very welcome january bonus !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent posted tuesday got money wednesday amazing service perfect in everyway
Cell_phone_Recycling	clever service but reward is poor
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wanted to sell my old phone and looked at many websites .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fonebank . com offered me the best value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	what you have to do is just select the phone you want to sell .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you search using the phone ' s imei no then it ' s much_quicker .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then you send the phone to a free post address and i receive the cheque .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have received my cheque in 0 working_days and for the value that i was promised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a bunch of old_mobiles in a drawer - i mean , who doesn ' t ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	- so i decided to make a few pennies from them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma was almost certainly the simplest way to go .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you add a list of imei numbers ( that ' s the unique identifier for your mobile ) and then they give you a price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they ' ll even have broken phones off you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i asked for a free postage pack that arrived a few_days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( you might want to order a couple if you ' ve got a number of phones as the cardboard container was quite tight once packed with four .)
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you take it to a post_office you ' ll be able to ask for " proof of postage " which covers you for £_00 free insurance .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( you ' d be mad not to .)
Cell_phone_Recycling	a few_days_later , a cheque arrives in the post .
Cell_phone_Recycling	done .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process is so simple and i had the money in my account within 0 days of deciding to sell my ipad !
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely_brilliant service and would recommend to anyone
Cell_phone_Recycling	am very pleased with this service & would definitely_recommend it to all my friends & would also use in the future !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	many_thanks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my phone on the day it was approved somehow it hasnt made it there ???
Cell_phone_Recycling	tried to contct with no joy .... was worth more_than 00 quid coud this be the reason ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	every other phone was next to no value got there just fine !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent the phone off on thursday , received an_email_saying it had been received on friday and the cheque arrived on saturday !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	what more could you ask for , a professional , simple and fast transaction , i wouldn ' t use any other mobile phone_recycling company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	awesome very fast and smooth payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i though might be longer then what i have expect but was very fast thank_you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the second time i have used fonebank the first time being a few_years back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	nothing has changed the service is still easy to use and my orders have completed with the exact amount being paid for each phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have read negative_reviews but in my opinion if you send you old phone in and it is exactly as it should be meeting the criteria then you will be paid the full_amount simple !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i look_forward to using fonebank again in the future when my next upgrade is due .
Cell_phone_Recycling	... so i ' m still not too sure how our old_mobiles are worth money these days and they never used to be but this is now the second time i ' ve used mazumamobile and they ' ve been brilliant .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a bit_sceptical about sending the phones first and even worried was it some sort of scam but as it was an old_mobile i would have binned anyway i thought i ' d nothing to lose so gave it a go .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process of me going on the website to them sending the bag to me posting it back ( all prepaid and just through a normal post box so no hassle there ) and the money hitting my account took less_than a week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ended_up sending my old blackberry too a few_months later and the service was just as quick and hassle_free .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they do what they say on the tin and couldn ' t make the process any easier given they do need to see the phones first to check they ' re as you say on the website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they also send some emails to keep you updated on status which is helpful .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t recommend them more if you ' ve any old_mobiles lying about doing nothing !
Cell_phone_Recycling	took the hassle out of finding the best price for my phone in mins !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i chose to drop the phone into the fonebank office .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they were very friendly and processed it the same day as promised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the offer was competitive and money promptly arrived in my account a couple of days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended ( having used a couple of competitors :-)
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick to respond , quickly processed , got money quickly , well_done
Cell_phone_Recycling	i placed my order with mazuma yesterday , i choose to send my phone special delivery using the printed label , i recieved an_email this morning confirming recieipt of the phone , and that payment would be made to my bank_account today .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this afternoon , had the amount quoted paid into my bank_account ,
Cell_phone_Recycling	outstanding service , from an excellant company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is my second time in using this company and would go no where else in the future :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found that out of all the mobile recyle companies that mazuma have the edge over them and are very reasonable prices given and that they accept mobiles that are not working and they are helpful , they keep to their promise and process the phones and money on the same day i ' ll definately recomend mazuma to my family and friends
Cell_phone_Recycling	so quick and easy this is the 0th time i ' ve used mazuma would reccomend to everyone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recently sold my mobile phone through mazuma , i got a quote off the website , confirmed that i was happy with what they offered me and within next few_days i received the free post bag and delivery note to send my mobile phone to them in .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then within the next couple of days the cheque was delivered back to me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy , convenient and reliable .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent communication through whole_process via_email .
Cell_phone_Recycling	000_% satisfied and would recommend everyone to use it if they are wanting to sell their mobile phone at a good price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the envelope to send off my phone arrived really quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got email confirmation after a day or 0 tht my phone had passed the tests and they gave me a date of about 0 working_days that the money would be in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was there in the day they said .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely use this company again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	flawless
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am not joking ... mazuma_mobile saved me big time ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	when i thought all hope was gone and i was really upset because i couldn ' t do anything with my mobile ... mazuma_mobile accepted it and gave me a brilliant price for it !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was seriously over the moon !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i can ' t thank mazuma_mobile enough ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you !!>..
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 -)
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_problems happy with the service i received
Cell_phone_Recycling	the site is very easy to navigate and select your phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the sell process is a breeze , the pack arrives the next_day and now that they offer payment by faster payment transfer the whole_process only takes a few_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great way to make some quick cash out of the smartphone graveyard that is my desk drawer !
Cell_phone_Recycling	simple , as seamless as it can be and held on to all promises .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was recommended to me and i shall recommend and use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	honest value and good communication
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was very quick , easy & hassle_free from start to finish .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they send out the packaging for you to send your old phone back along with very clear intructions and within a couple of days the payment is sent on a argos card and takes a day to activate .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the second time i have used mazuma and will do again in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will certainly recommend to friends and family
Cell_phone_Recycling	extremely simple process which saw money in hand in under two_weeks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very well run and great price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happily sold my phone on mazuma and the turn_around was really quick and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once they recieved my phone the money was in my account 0 days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the fourth time i have used this company and they continue to do business well .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast , reliable and honest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_continue to use and recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault , though it would have been better if the bag provided had bubble_wrap inside as i had to use tissue to make_sure that the phone was not broken in transit .
Cell_phone_Recycling	amazing service !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they text to say they had recieved the phone the day after i sent it and the cash was paid into my paypal account the same afternoon !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank u :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma a couple of times now , with no_problems and always prompt payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	arrived soon after i sent my phone website was easy to follow overall was an easy way to get_rid of my old phone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	im aware that ' reasonable within available method ' is a bit_confusing ... what i mean by that is that a company who relies on another company to complete it ' s business , and in this case mazuma relies on royal_mail or independent couriers , can only really provide a standard of service reflective of a standard set by the postal / courier service ... and on this occasion that was very slow , so indirectly mazuma didn ' t send me my bank_transfer for a long time , nearly 0 weeks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s ok to say mazuma will send a bank_transfer the day they receive the phone , but if the courier fails to deliver timely then it ' s an inconvenience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and although i respect that mazuma have no control over post , at the same time , they can only , having the type of business they do that relies havily on another business , recieve , 0_stars .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very impressed with the service and very fast payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they paid me exactly_what they said they would and also paid the money into my bank the same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received the bag for my phone the next_day after e_- mailing and received notiifcation of mazuma getting the phone the following_day and got the cheque a few_days letter - amazingly quick service and really easy to use - was impressed and would use mazuma again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	was unsure at first as the branding makes it look like a scam .
Cell_phone_Recycling	e . g .
Cell_phone_Recycling	send us your gold and we ' ll send you a cheque .
Cell_phone_Recycling	yeah , sure .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the opposite was true , very impressed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i think they should publicise what they ' re doing with the phones to be able to pay so well ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process took 00_hours !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i printed off the forms , packed the envelope with my htc hero and sent it off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was in my account in 00_hours .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very impressed with the service and the price i got was competitive with other_sites .
Cell_phone_Recycling	there are a lot of sites out there offering maybe £ 0 more but i have heard some terrible things .
Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely stick to a reputable company like mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	can ' t recommend it highly_enough .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good price paid for my phone .... was paid in 0 working_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve used this service 0 times previousd always got the same reliable service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	wanted to sell my iphone quickly and for fixed price , chose mazuma_mobile and was right !
Cell_phone_Recycling	did not expect such a great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	ordered packaging on a week day , got it on saturday , sent phone on monday and had money in my bank_account on tuesday !
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend it to anyone who needs to sell his phone without having any headache !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 + stars service , website and price !
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent the phone on the friday , had the money on the tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cant_fault it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if your looking to sell your old_mobile these_guys are definitely one to watch .
Cell_phone_Recycling	best prices on the net .
Cell_phone_Recycling	even out did cex on my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not always the best but better_than most
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my order via special delivery ( i paid extra ) so that it would arrive by 00 . 00pm the next_day , i received an_email to confirm delivery about an_hour ago , with payment being made today !
Cell_phone_Recycling	fantastic service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my only concern was the live_chat , i have tried a few_times and never anyone there , however the positive was that i emailed them and had a reply within an_hour so that made up for it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	adverts for selling your mobile have been around for some time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	about 0 months_ago i thought i would dig out my old_phones ( which were just lying_around gather dust ) and see if they were worth anything .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after some research i decided to use mazuma as they appear to be the largest company doing mobile buybacks and their prices were marginally better_than their competitors .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got £_00 for the two old_phones but the best thing was the ease of the service , pop details of your old_phones into the mazuma website , wait for the prepaid_envelope to arrive ( it takes only a couple of days ), pop your phones in the envelope ( in some bubble_wrap ) along with the delivery note and send back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it couldn ' t be easier .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a couple of days_later i had the cash in the bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i now use mazuma to get some cash for my old_mobile whenever i upgrade my phone contract .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they are great , well recommendable .
Cell_phone_Recycling	nice and easy site to use , much_better_than others which are far too busy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	their service was quick and efficent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	although many ppl have told me only request for cheques and dont give in your bank_details as a payment_method .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i gave in my details & received a payment within the very next_day of posting it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	there is no scam , it is a trust - worthy site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	how amazing are this company ?!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	even phones that are scratched are excepted , my company has benefited greatly from mazuma , i will always use this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	trustworthy , honest and quick !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	keep up the good work !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	like many others , tried to sell an iphone 0 00gb , was originally_quoted £_00 and today they ' ve received and tested the phone and due to ' water_damage ' and a very minuscule mark on the screen that i knew about , they now want to offer me £ 0 . 00 for it !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was well aware i ' d be offered less because of the mark , which is only visible on a white background and doesn ' t affect the operation of the phone , but £ 0 . 00 !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	come on that ' s crazy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	and there ' s no water_damage to the phone either , loads of bollocks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	have rejected the offer and will be interested to see what condition the phone is in when i receive it back !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a similar problem with mazuma , but at_least they offered £_00 for it - still unfair but better_than envirofone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i rejected mazuma ' s offer and went with envirofone cos i thought they ' d offer me a better deal but how wrong was i !
Cell_phone_Recycling	think i ' ll try selling my phone privately , i might actually get a fair price for it , esp as i had the phone for almost 0 years and it ' s still in working order !
Cell_phone_Recycling	really unhappy with mazuma - they offered me £_00 for my iphone 0 00gb , on receiving it , they inform me they ' ve found a tiny yellow mark that ' s only visible on a white background (_eg .
Cell_phone_Recycling	in the settings folder ) and therefore it ' s classed_as faulty and they ' ll only offer me £_00 !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i understand a small drop in the price but i don ' t think that warrants a £_00 drop in the price , i argued this point on the phone but they refused to budge !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had been warned they would try to find a fault and offer less - to prove this point , on receiving this phone back , i checked it over - no yellow mark .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sold it through a competitor who happily paid £_00 for it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	and to top it all off , mazuma wouldn ' t let me post this review on their website , funny that !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they clearly only want good reviews on there !
Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely wouldn ' t recommend , avoid at all costs !
Cell_phone_Recycling	have sent a couple phones in and have been very happy with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast and easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	another quick turn_around and my 0th phone disposed of !
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted the phone wednesday lunch time and the money was in my account by thursday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found the service at mazumamobile . com to be very good indeed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast hassle_free & helpful .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was straightforward , i put the imei_number on website , got the quote and got free post envelope from mazuma in couple of days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted my phone ( better to get proof of receipt as it gives you cover up to £_00 on free post ) and got my money directly paid into bank in couple of days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service as always .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast and efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i look_forward to dealing_with mazuma again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great fast and reliable service provided by mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	love it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the second time i ' ve used mazumamobile . com never had a problem payments go sameday they receive the phone , they make it simply and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	many_thanks mazumamobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant service my phone was in mint_condition and upon rpc recylce receiving it they lowered their offer by over £_000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma where fast and money was in bank same day they took receipt of mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_defo use again
Cell_phone_Recycling	according to mazuma my fone was blacklisted just took it into vodafone and they checked on the national database and they said phone is not blacklisted and gave me more_than i was offered by mazuma for a non - working samsung jet .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will never use this website again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am very satisfied with the order money and how long it had taken to get to me
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma was really easy to use , i wasn ' t sure how much i ' d get from my phone considering it was old and not in very good condition at all , but amazingly it sold for a really good price - £_00 for an old_nokia_0000 classic :) would have been £_00 even if it wasn ' t working !
Cell_phone_Recycling	worthwhile , it didn ' t take long either ... just make_sure you know what phone you ' ve got !
Cell_phone_Recycling	tried to recycle phone elsewhere , to no_avail , used envirophone & they do exactly_what it says on the tin ... others out there may offer more , but if you want the best deal & service use envirophone ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	a0 service , envirophone took_forever bt mazuma , better_than_expected & would use them first nxt time without a shadow of a doubt ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	really simple and easy to follow instruction .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money went in the bank same day as they recieved the phone which was a couple of days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	just a great service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service , £_00 for my 0 yr_old_nokia , exactly_what it said on the tin !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i filled in the form online .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then in the post 0 days_later my pack arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	all the information was very easy and popped in old phone posted it at the post_office on the friday got my money on the tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	was really good just wish had a few more old_phones to send off lol .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very good no_problems , fast delivery , would use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after trying to trade in stores , needing to take a charger and queuing became a bit of a downer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i looked on here and was offered a great price and it was so easy and quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great company
Cell_phone_Recycling	many_thanks for selling my phones , helped_me out alot so many_thanks for your help and making it happen so quick and easy aswell :_d
Cell_phone_Recycling	this company will give you an attractive offer to make_sure that they get , in my case my phone , and when they get it they will drastically lower the value of the offer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this will be lower_than what you will be guaranteed off far better known and reputable_companies .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they will allow you to get the product back but will charge you for this so you will feel , like i did , backed into a corner to accept or face losing money by paying for your property back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	yes i got a revised_offer , but an insult with and extra £ 0 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would have had an extra £_00 on top of this if i hadn ' t gone with this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my advice would be avoid this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	stated on their website under " our promise " is that you can contact [_name ] the md via_email if you ’ re not satisfied ; don ' t bother you won ' t get a response .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will not use this company again and will never recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	terrible customer_service and the worst i have ever_experienced .
Cell_phone_Recycling	service was so easy to use , got an excellent price for my old phone and very professional in terms of updates of when they recieve your phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will certainly use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	just sold iphone_0s it was great , quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got argos_vouchers which meant i got a bit more but you can ' t spend them online .
Cell_phone_Recycling	think that ' s argos ' s fault tho not envirofone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they were very fast in posting everything , it was a very simple procedure and overall i was impressed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once fonebank . com received my nexus 0 tablet they issued the payment within 0 hours ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have not received this level of service from another recycle company ... as far fonebank . com are the best .. keep up the good work .. only improvement is payments to hit our account same day ..
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent off on wednesday , paid on friday !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was really happy with the speed and price i received for my iphone_0s .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was much more_than others and was a super easy service to use !
Cell_phone_Recycling	one of my best online experiences , filled in the easy online form , received a bag the next_day and had the money in my bank_account the next_day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	all done in three days !
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definitely be using mazuma_mobile again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very speedy service , i posted the phone on the tuesday and the money was in my account by the wednesday with follow_up e_- mails straight_away .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service , will use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma twice now and have always found them to be quick , efficient and easy to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the site is well set out and finding your handset model with accompanying price they will pay is easy .
Flowers	paid in full for valentines flowers and on the day they decide to change the delivery date !!!!!
Flowers	they are ignoring calls and emails ( 0 days now ) but have put a very small apology on the website .... ha !
Flowers	its too_late valentines has been and gone so the flowers are useless and the day has been ruined !
Flowers	if you cant handle the orders dont take peoples money !
Flowers	p . s .
Flowers	hurry up and give me my money back !
Flowers	if i lived closer id be down there collecting it in person !
Flowers	stay_away !
Flowers	i would defo_recommend using seranata flowers to send someone flowers !
Flowers	really quick & reasonably_priced !
Flowers	the whole purchasing and delivery process is very good .
Flowers	you even get a confirmation_email once the package has been delivered to the destination .
Flowers	thanks , i am very satisfied for your services .
Flowers	quality products and fast delivery .
Flowers	recommand to all this site .
Flowers	best regards
Flowers	lilian
Flowers	really easy website to use , great prices , great options .
Flowers	would definitely use again !
Flowers	i had placed an order online for my partner ' s birthday as she only likes this one type of flower .
Flowers	when the order was received the company has sent me a completely diffrent order which is much cheaper_than that i had ordered .
Flowers	not acceptable .
Flowers	could not be more impressed .
Flowers	ordered late sunday_evening delivered monday am
Flowers	i paid iflorist for flowers from their " same day " range , the flowers finally arrived 0 days_later ( after i had cancelled them for not arriving ).
Flowers	my mother explained to the florist that they had been cancelled so the florist said they would be free as it was their mistake .
Flowers	other than an offer to look_into the issue when i cancelled the flowers for going awol and an assurance someone would contact me within_00hrs ( a week_ago ) iflorist have ignored my communications during the last 00 days .
Flowers	i wont let it drop but please everyone avoid this company , anyone can make a mistake and fail to deliver , i know they reply on florists .
Flowers	however then to ignore their own customers complaint is unforgivable .
Flowers	fortunately my mother has forgiven me for seemingly missing her_birthday .
Flowers	never bought flowers to deliver online before and even as a novice i managed to find what i wanted and add / change bits to suit .
Flowers	i did notice 0 different sets of flowers with £_00 difference in the price_tag both had the same picture - which made things confusing .
Flowers	maybe update your pics ?!
Flowers	!
Flowers	otherwise all good .
Flowers	ps - search for a discount_code online - i manged to get free delivery worth £ 0 . 00 !
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet a day before i needed them .
Flowers	it was very straight_forward and helpful throughout the whole_process .
Flowers	i was kept completely up to date as to where the flowers where in the delivery process .
Flowers	and once delivered i was notified that nobody was in to collect them , i was given a detail description as to where they had been left .
Flowers	very impressed .
Flowers	this is the second time i ' ve used serenata_flowers and i will_defiantly use them again .
Flowers	searched for fairtrade flowers and came on arena_flowers .
Flowers	ordered 0 bouquets for relatives .
Flowers	website has very clear photos and it was easy to select seasonal flowers .
Flowers	i really liked the add on options at each_stage - deluxe bouquet , vase , good range of beautiful gifts , cards and even a glossy photo .
Flowers	fastest way to assemble a personalised gift package at a very reasonable_price .
Flowers	our loved father and grandfather in portugal passed away recently .
Flowers	since we are in south_africa , it was not enough time to attend the funeral but we did order flowers online and within the next_day flora_queen delivered them .
Flowers	they were a beautiful bouquet , and even looked better_than the picture on their website .
Flowers	the flowers helped bring joy and comfort to our family .
Flowers	the service was great and professionally presented .
Flowers	everything that was requested was there and definitely worth the money .
Flowers	it was money well spent and we have since told a few family_members and friends to use flora_queen next time for excellent quality and professionalism .
Flowers	thank_you once again flora_queen , you helped make this difficult transition in our lives easier and the beautiful flowers helped make our family ' s day a little_bit brighter .
Flowers	i ordered a bunch of flowers on 00 march for mothers_day to be delivered on the 00th it is now tuesday 0st april and the flowers still have not been delivered .
Flowers	i have emailed customer support twice now but still not got a reply back .
Flowers	it is pointless getting the flowers delivered now as mothers_day as been and gone
Flowers	march 00th i have placed an order , same day delivery for march 00th , my mom ' s birthday , so i have chosen deluxe flower_arrangement , item called " gorgeous ", paid 00 £ at checkout .
Flowers	delivered bouquet was not at any closer look , then the one they advertise .
Flowers	it was a bunch of green with occasional tiny heads of a complete different flowers .
Flowers	also , the roses were not fresh and today all came off already .
Flowers	i did write to their company support email , because is the only florist company which does not provide a phone line , so if something_goes_wrong , like in my situation , the only you can relay on is their email , they don ' t even care to check , as this morning the only answer to my emails of complain i got was this survey , asking for satisfactory review and five_star rate .
Flowers	this company is not to trust .
Flowers	by the way , i managed to buy some extra flowers at the wild heart , at liberty ' s and coated me 00 £ - gorgeous huge flower_arrangement !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i was informed by the person who i bought the flowers for that they were damaged and in a poor condition when they arrived .
Flowers	i have used iflorist before , they have always been punctual and the flowers are always high_quality and last a long time .
Flowers	total scam !!!
Flowers	did not deliver my flowers for mothers_day .
Flowers	when i emailed to complain they sent me one email_saying they thought they had been delivered and then they ignored every subsequest email .
Flowers	in the end i had to request a chargeback from my credit_card company to get my money back .
Flowers	do not use them you will be disappointed and out of pocket !!!!!!!!!!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	great company when things are going well however my flowers were delivered 0 days late .
Flowers	i have received no useful responses from the customer_service team after i notified them ( not the other way around !)
Flowers	and they have taken 0 days to reply to my most_recent email .
Flowers	they promised to redeliver immediately and even the replacement flowers were later than promised .
Flowers	i can ' t understand_why i have received such little communication ( each time from a different person who doesn ' t answer the points raised in my message ) when surely the worst error a flower delivery company can make is delivering flowers nearly a week late ?
Flowers	yes they are cheap , but you get what you pay for !
Flowers	i have ordered several bouquets from this company .
Flowers	mainly for my mum but also to other family_members .
Flowers	i have never ever had any_issues with them .
Flowers	the bouquets are always beautiful looking and last ages .
Flowers	i ordered a rose and lily bouquet for my mum and it lasted over 0 weeks .
Flowers	she had been given some flowers from the supermarket at the same time but they died within a week !
Flowers	!
Flowers	customer_service is always really helpful and i would recommend prestige to anyone .
Flowers	i will never order flowers from anyone_else but prestige_flowers
Flowers	disgusting unhelpful service .
Flowers	no flowers received despite the fact they claim it was delivered .
Flowers	thanks for making my moms mothers_day .
Flowers	not .
Flowers	really disappointed
Flowers	i ordered 0 mother ' s day bouquets .
Flowers	i spotted that the courier company ' s confirmation_email had the wrong_address the day before mother ' s day .
Flowers	i emailed to alert them to the problem .
Flowers	didn ' t hear_anything back so i rang up .
Flowers	spent 00_minutes on the phone to their indian_call_centre .
Flowers	the person i was speaking to just didn ' t understand that there were two roads in london with the same name and that they were delivering to the wrong one ( despite me putting the correct postcode in my original order ).
Flowers	i was promised ( i ) a callback that day and ( ii ) that the flowers would be delivered .
Flowers	surprise_surprise .
Flowers	no call back .
Flowers	no flowers delivered .
Flowers	just come off the phone with customer_services ( another 00 minute phone call ) whereby i was told the i would definitely get a call back today - i ' ve heard that one before !
Flowers	she apparently couldn ' t put me through to head_office ...
Flowers	so gave me a number to call .
Flowers	am sat here on hold , again , so i have lots of time to write this review .
Flowers	p . s .
Flowers	the flowers that were delivered were a miserable bunch of brown flowers - was not worth the money !
Flowers	e_- mailed them early yesterday to confirm track and send numbers for flowers i ' ve ordered and still had nothing .
Flowers	none of the flowers have been delivered up to yet so yeah getting really worried .
Flowers	the following is my opinion of iflorist , based on my experiences .
Flowers	i ordered 00 red_roses to be delivered on valentines_day .
Flowers	late on the evening before valentines_day , i received as email_saying my flowers would not be delivered on valetines day , and would actually be delivered on the 00th .
Flowers	any other day of the year , this might have been ok but not valentines_day .
Flowers	eventually , late on the 00th the flowers were delivered .
Flowers	not the 00 red_roses i had paid for , but three roses and a handful of carnations .
Flowers	i have tried to contact this company on the phone , with no luck .
Flowers	i have also sent emails with no reply .
Flowers	i want my money back .
Flowers	i will be avoiding this company in future .
Flowers	literally the worst flowers i ' ve ever_seen in my life .
Flowers	they look nothing like the picture , they are squashed almost flat and smelly !!!
Flowers	if i could post a photo here to show you i would ...
Flowers	if you want a decent bunch of flowers please pay a bit more and use interflora who have never delivered me a bad bunch before .
Flowers	placed an order for a nice bouqet for my girlfriends_birthday .
Flowers	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
Flowers	when they were delivered they were disappointing and left me feeling embarrassed .
Flowers	stems were snapped , a few of the flowers looked as if they were dying already and the arrangement was poor .
Flowers	the greeting card was small and lacked imagination and a personal_touch .
Flowers	just another printed note for another customer ... no love or feeling involved .
Flowers	deflated , and unimpressed by the standard i expected .
Flowers	this is the first time i have used your company and as this was a bouquet for a special birthday i wont be using you again or recommending your company .
Flowers	i hope you can learn from this feedback and make_sure others receive a better quality of flower in future .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	sent flowers to a friend as a congratulations for her new job , she was delighted as she was sent flowers .
Flowers	however i wasn ' t as impressed as i had hoped i would be as they didn ' t look like the photo on the webpage .
Flowers	they looked rather slim and a bit old to be honest .......
Flowers	amazing service from a company i used for the first time .
Flowers	kept me in the loop when they were despatched and delivered .
Flowers	will 000_% be using them from now on .
Flowers	in fact everyone should use them .
Flowers	after seeing all these posts i am wondering what is going on .
Flowers	i also paid for the tracking service and like everyone_else have not had a tracking link , my girlfriend just text me to say they have still not arrived and she finished work at 0 - 00 .
Flowers	if they cannot make a courier paid delivery by 0 - 00 when i ordered last_week for valentines_day then what is the point in buying the flowers ?
Flowers	wish they had a phone number to ring , all i can do is hope they arrive by 0 - 00 otherwise she will get them tomorrow which i will be seriously annoyed about .
Flowers	will update my rating to 0 if they arrive on valentines_day !
Flowers	order no 00000
Flowers	avoid !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered flowers , registered my details ( including mobile and email ) and received order confirmation .
Flowers	the order was for the following_day , for my 00 year_old grandmas birthday ; no delivery took place and no notification of attempted delivery was left .
Flowers	i have received no contact , in 0 days from eflorist informing_me of any_issues .
Flowers	my grandma was extremely disappointed , this is the worst customer_service i ' ve ever_experienced .
Flowers	i bought my friend some flowers ,
Flowers	from iflorist , a wonderful deal !
Flowers	i thought how lovely they looked online ,
Flowers	could not wait to see them for real .
Flowers	however dear friends , guess_what !
Flowers	the flowers , they never arrived ,
Flowers	my friend stayed late at the office ,
Flowers	so i tried and i tried and i tried ,
Flowers	to ring the iflorist people
Flowers	to ask them " where are my flowers ??"
Flowers	i ' d had my conformation email
Flowers	and my friend waited at her work for hours !
Flowers	but nothing !!
Flowers	not even a phonecall !
Flowers	!
Flowers	they took my money , and me , for a fool !
Flowers	i wish to now receive my refund
Flowers	and i wish i hadn ' t shopped there at all .
Flowers	you could have at_least tried to phone me !
Flowers	to let me know that you guys had gone wrong !
Flowers	yes ok there may have been trouble with snow and the weather
Flowers	but then tell me this before the whole day has gone !
Flowers	you say it was down to the snow
Flowers	and deliveries not made on time !
Flowers	the for the love of god let your customers know ,
Flowers	because that was your problem not mine !
Flowers	i could have made other arrangements ,
Flowers	now i ' m just a mum short of dough ,
Flowers	please issue me now my full_refund
Flowers	or its off to the papers i ' ll go !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be sent to my girlfriend in her office on valentines_day .
Flowers	spent nearly £_00 for the same day delivery option .
Flowers	even_though i know it was cutting it close , paying an extra £_00 for the delivery on the day seemed to make up for it .
Flowers	but i was wrong .
Flowers	they charged me the same amount but has not sent me a confirmation letter for the order .
Flowers	if i had not print screened the check out page with the reference , i would have no proof of sale .
Flowers	tried_emailing 0 times and ringing several_times and all i got was one email in return saying sorry for contacting me so late on valentines_day to say that my order has failed .
Flowers	overall value and service .. abysmal .
Flowers	i have already_recommended silk_blooms to all my friends !
Flowers	i first came_across silk_blooms at a wedding exhibition in aberdeen , and was instantly impressed with the selection of wedding bouquets .
Flowers	i went straight home and ordered for my own wedding .
Flowers	the customer_service given by mara rose was excellent .
Flowers	the flowers are very realistic and superb quality .
Flowers	i am delighted with the bouquets and thistle buttonholes that i ordered for my wedding .
Flowers	i ' m sure they will all be admired on the big day next week !
Flowers	my wife called to say thank_you for the roses in which i asked did she also receive any chocolates , she said no in which it does state to come with these . she then said that to be truthful that i should probably ask for a refund due to most of then being nearly dead and only 00 roses .
Flowers	have also emailed but not likely to get a response any time soon .
Flowers	i found the online ordering simple and easy to use .
Flowers	the option to purchase additional gifts ( a teddy_bear , chocolates and a card ) with the flowers was also very useful .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered the next_day , as promised in great condition .
Flowers	my girlfriend was very pleased with her_birthday surprise !
Flowers	they delivered the flowers and they were lovely but they delivered them on the wrong date !
Flowers	my flowers from my girlfriend were delivered after she had finished work but rather_than call the delivery agent had just dumped them outside on a busy main street .
Flowers	and suprise , suprise they got ruined .
Flowers	any way no contact number to get immediate answers and resolution instead i have had to write emails , post on their facebook and message them on facebook , then wait hours for a response which was we will " investigate " nothing to investigate , they messed_up i ' m requesting a full_refund .
Flowers	we ' ll see how that goes .
Flowers	arrived on time , even after adjustments made by myself late in the day , thoroughly_recommended .
Flowers	i ordered flower for the same day delivery for my wife birthday in luxembourg .
Flowers	the flowers were never delivered , plus they never answer my email when i filed a complain .
Flowers	i don ' t know how such a site can buy google_ads and be on top of search_results .
Flowers	they took my money and there is no way for me to having it back .
Flowers	it ' s definitely a scam .
Flowers	three emails sent regarding my order for mothers_day flowers which were supposed to be delivered today and were not .
Flowers	i have tried all day to access iflorists " live support " which untill half past nine tonight was set to " away ".
Flowers	when i was finally able to connect i was informed by " jack " that due to the mothers_day rush , iflorist were unable to find a florist to deliver on time .
Flowers	despite the order being placed on 00st_march , nobody could be bothered to get in touch and let me know this in order that i could make alternative_arrangements .
Flowers	when i asked why no one had been in touch , i was then informed that due to the limited amount of florists in the area the delivery would not be dispatched untill tuesday .
Flowers	considering the money has already been taken from my account i think this is completely_unacceptable .
Flowers	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn ' t expect such shoddy service , i think it ' s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people ' s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
Flowers	i have been offered a discount_voucher for £_00 my next order , well i can tell you with absolute certainty that there will never be a next order from me or anyone i know .
Flowers	i wouldn ' t use iflorist again if they were paying me !
Flowers	i have been told that " jack " will arrange a full_refund , which will be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
Flowers	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
Flowers	in the meantime , i will now have to explain to a rather disappointed mum what has happened and hope that a much more reliable and trustworthy interflora can deliver something which will make up for iflorists terrible service .
Flowers	in future i ' ll be reading reviews before i purchase anything , but in the meantime i would urge_anyone to stick to trusted sites and avoid this mob like the plague !
Flowers	my husband bought me roses for our first valentines_day together .
Flowers	he recieved an_email on wednesday 00th at 00 . 00pm to say they wouldnt be delivered until 00th !!!!!
Flowers	after waiting until 0pm today - still no sign so my husband called up and apparently they would be there before 0pm !
Flowers	they have just turned_up now and and they are a total state .
Flowers	every flower is pretty_much dead .
Flowers	really disappointed .
Flowers	quick , easy , cheap ( pricewise , quality was far from cheap ) and my girlfriend loved them .
Flowers	thank_you so much !
Flowers	my husband ordered me flowers for valentine ' s day , and it was agreed upon ordering them that they would be delivered before 0pm as we were leaving for a week long trip at 0pm ( the plan was to take the flowers with us so that i could enjoy them whilst i was away ).
Flowers	between 0 and 0pm my husband was getting more and more concerned that the flowers hadn ' t showed up , so he kept ringing eflorist but could never get through on the phone ( he was on hold the entire time ).
Flowers	we waited until 0 . 00pm but couldn ' t hold on any longer as we had a 0 hour car journey ahead of us and a 00 month old who needed to be put to sleep in the car .
Flowers	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .
Flowers	after failing to get through to eflorist on the phone , my husband sent an_email complaint to them but no one ever replied .
Flowers	the next_day he continually rang eflorist but could never get through when selecting the option that he was calling about an " existing order ".
Flowers	eventually he got through when he selected the option to " place a new order ", and was told he was not eligible for a refund despite explaining our circumstances in detail .
Flowers	we never even got to see the flowers as we were away for a week , and they had died by the time we got home .
Flowers	we both wrongly assumed that eflorist would be apologetic and give us a full_refund but as they refused we intend to spread the word to our friends , family and beyond that they shouldn ' t use eflorist .
Flowers	i have just recieved my valentines_day flowers which my boyfriend bought from them to be sent to me at work today ( valentines_day ) and i just needed to express how disgusted i am .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered in a damaged box and when i opened them i was so dissapointed .
Flowers	these flowers were dispatched on monday 00th_feb - are you suprised they are dead ?
Flowers	there were not in water and had come loose in the box so are not looking their best .
Flowers	the mojority of them are dry , black and curling !
Flowers	they are so squashed and look like a 0 year_old hand tied them .
Flowers	i had to call my boyfriend and thank him , however he knew something was wrong and is equally as angry that he purchased from yourselves .
Flowers	i understand they are an internet company with lots of orders but there will be so many unhappy ladies today if their flowers were sent out monday and arrived in this state aswell !
Flowers	i am furious !
Flowers	hope to be getting a refund !
Flowers	if you cant handle the busy day orders then dont take any more !
Flowers	dead flowers are no use to anyone !
Flowers	i wont even be able to enjoy them for one day .
Flowers	i placed an order over the weekend for valentines_day with " courier track and trace " delivery .
Flowers	the order was accepted and i received a confirmation e_- mail but when i view my account the order has disappeared and i have not received any tracking_number at all ( you would have thought this was essential right ?).
Flowers	the item has sold out also so i ' m increasingly worried that they couldn ' t fulfil all orders and just cancelled them .. live_chat was offline and they ' ve not responded to my e_- mails .
Flowers	ringing up the bank first thing and disputing .
Flowers	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
Flowers	then to add more embarrassment the roses were past the fully opened stage .
Flowers	i ' ve never been so publicly embarrassed in all my life .
Flowers	also no telephone service so you can not call them , i sent a complaint via_email and received template email with a promise to contact me asap .
Flowers	but i ' ve heard_nothing .
Flowers	don ' t use this company they have no care nor respect for their customers .
Flowers	**_update **
Flowers	0th_february_0000
Flowers	so iflorist said they would send my sister some flowers and guess_what ?
Flowers	it didn ' t happen !!!
Flowers	this company is ridiculously unprofessional .
Flowers	i emailed iflorist reminding them that the flowers had to be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
Flowers	the reply stated that the driver would be contacted and then i ' d be emailed back .
Flowers	this did not happen either .
Flowers	the service is shockingly disgusting .
Flowers	i just want my money back and i have insisted on this from iflorist .
Flowers	let ' s see how long it is to take for this refund .
Flowers	once again in case you have forgotten my advice in the first complaint : do not use this company !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i haven ' t ordered off your site before but the process was very quick and simple .
Flowers	i will_definitely be ordering again .
Flowers	my boyfriend ordered flowers on the 00th to arrive on the 00th_february as a surprise for me and considering the fact the office is normally open from 0 . 00am to 0 . 00pm , you would think the flowers would be delivered within that time .
Flowers	in fact the flowers didn ' t arrive by the time i left at 0 . 00pm resulting in my boyfriend having to leave work early , rush to the shops to spend another £_00 on roses , chocolates and a vase so i wouldn ' t be left without anything .
Flowers	the flowers turned_up at the office at 0pm and it was only by pure luck someone was still in my office to sign for them , but considering i ' m on holiday now till the 00th of february (!!!!
Flowers	), i find it astonishing that my boyfriend was told all he would get refunded was the delivery charge of about £ 0 . 00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Flowers	yes , someone in the office signed for them , but it was delivered after i left and the colleague , who signed for the order , didn ' t know i ' m on holiday with the 00th_february otherwise she would have straight_away rejected the order .
Flowers	you would think it ' s not unreasonable to deliver flowers to an office address within normal working hours , not after 0 . 00pm .
Flowers	my poor boyfriend spent considerable time and money yesterday not being_able to get through to iflorist and eventually spending more money buying me new flowers .
Flowers	i won ' t be able to enjoy these flowers as they will be dead by the time i return to the office and to top everything off , my colleague ( who i asked to open the box this morning ) has emailed me to tell me the flowers are of poor quality and already started to wilt !
Flowers	my boyfriend was told that as the delivery arrived on the day requested , he would only get a refund of the delivery charge ( i don ' t agree with iflorist that delivery at 0pm to an office address when the office normally shuts at 0 . 00pm counts at successful delivery as it was rather luck that anyone was still in the office , never mind i , the recipient , didn ' t even get the iflorist flowers and won ' t get to enjoy them till the 00th of february when they are completely dead ).
Flowers	my boyfriend spent about 00 £ on the iflorist delivery , which i can ' t enjoy and went all the way out to spent more money to ensure i wouldn ' t be left completely disapppointed on our first valentine ' s day together .
Flowers	to only refund the delivery charge in light of what happened is despicable .
Flowers	i would strongly_advise people not to order from this company !
Flowers	my boyfriend deserves more_than the refund of £ 0 . 00 for the inconvenience , quality of the roses and service provided .
Flowers	please arrange for adequate compensation .
Flowers	i ordered a bunch of 00 roses to be delivered on valentines_day for the missus .
Flowers	price was competitive not amazingly cheap , they arrived on time on valentines_day in a large box .
Flowers	the missus opened the box to find 00 roses , 0 of which were broken and one which didn ' t have a head and nor was the head in the box meaning that the rose must have been headless when they put them in there !
Flowers	i complained and was assured that this is not the usual quality of their products , they sent out a new set .
Flowers	when we received the new set we again only received 00 roses which all looked like the cheapest battered roses money could buy .
Flowers	another complaint and 0 weeks_later i am still_waiting for my money .
Flowers	my advice - don ' t use them at all costs more hassle than its worth , get friendly with a local_florist same - day delivery and two_weeks_later the flowers still look amazing all for only £ 0 dearer than iflorist !
Flowers	this site came highly_recommended .
Flowers	i found the site well_laid_out , easy to navigate , very aesthetically pleasing and with a great range of options .
Flowers	very impressed thus_far
Flowers	i ordered flowers for valentines_day , which arrived looking nothing like the flowers that i had ordered .
Flowers	it was missing all but one type of flower that it should have and in the other flowers place was just green leaves .
Flowers	i ordered flowers 0 days before i wanted them delivered , they were a suprise for my sisters birthday . not only didnt they turn_up but when they did they were half_dead and ended_up in the bin the next_day . absolutely no remorse from company so will never use them again .
Flowers	disappointed not to receive the flowers which were ordered by the date requested .
Flowers	it is difficult to allocated specific blame for this as appears to be a combination of factors including capacity to fulfil orders , weather , delivery logistics etc .
Flowers	that said , none of these issues are my personal concern , however , can be understandable to an extent .
Flowers	my main complaint with this company has been communication which has been appalling .
Flowers	telephones not being answered , online email messages not answered and the online_chat makes you wait a very long time between each interaction .
Flowers	i was given the advice that i should reject the order once this arrived late and i would receive a full_refund .
Flowers	i am still_waiting on this to happen !
Flowers	my overarching opinion is very negative , and sorting all this out is a giant waste of my time !
Flowers	really easy to order online and the photo was a good representation of the flowers that were received .
Flowers	excellent service & loved the fact we were kept_informed when the flowers were sent out and when they had been received .
Flowers	would recommend and use again !
Flowers	i ordered valentines flowers on 00 / 00 / 00 for my girlfriend that is currently in oz .
Flowers	by 0pm oz time there was no sign of the flowers ...
Flowers	i called eflorist , to be told that they have to contact their oz office to find out what the order status is and then get back to me after 00hrs ... t
Flowers	he occassion had been completely_ruined by now as a ) the ( over priced ) flowers were not delivered , and b ) i had to ask if the " suprise " gift had arrived or a " no one in " delivery card left behind ... etc .
Flowers	following my complaint , the flowers were delivered at midnight on 00 / 00 / 00 , waking_up the household .
Flowers	the flowers delivered did not resemble those in the online picture and half of the stock was dead or dying .
Flowers	later i received a smug email from eflorist informing that the flowers had been delivered on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
Flowers	i have complained again and now wait to see what eflorist have to say about this ...
Flowers	i understand from other posts that they will offer a 00_%_discount ( against what is essentially an over priced product ) but try not to pay , or , if you push for it , a full_refund !
Flowers	... that they also try not to pay .
Flowers	in short , don ' t put your faith in eflorist for special / meaningful occasions ... there is a real chance that they will let you down in more ways than one .
Flowers	i will not use them again and strongly_recommend others to go elsewhere .
Flowers	i purchased my flowers , wine and what i assumed would come with it was a box of free chocolate !
Flowers	not only did the wine that i paid for not deliver but the chocolates didn ' t either !
Flowers	when i phoned up i was assured that i was going to get a refund put through for that day which i understood would take 0 to 0 working_days to come through and the girl told me that she would send out the free box of chocolates like it should have been !!
Flowers	after phoning up for the second time last thursday i am only now getting an_email_stating i will get my refund that will take up to another 0 to 0 working_days and i am yet to see the chocolates !
Flowers	being a student in liverpool i tried to surprise my mum back home and thanks to iflorist ruined my surprise !
Flowers	may i add the first time i had rang iflorist querying about my purchase the girl on the phone was rude , cheeky and not very helpful at all !
Flowers	i do not recommend to shop here at all !
Flowers	even the flowers that were sent out did not look like much and looked dead !
Flowers	absolute_disgrace !
Flowers	ordered flowers to be delivered on 00th_feb to my wife ' s workplace , only to find out they have just been delivered today at about 0 . 00 - over 00_hours late !
Flowers	to make it worse , we left home yesterday for a long weekend so the flowers are sat at her work so she won ' t see them alive !
Flowers	plus it was also her_birthday yesterday .
Flowers	how embarrassing , not so much for me ( i ' m just a little furious ) but certainly embarrassing for her .
Flowers	i feel really bad but its certainly not my fault .
Flowers	i ordered the flowers in plenty of time ( monday 00th ) and paid extra for the before 0pm delivery .
Flowers	i followed iflorists ticket complaint procedure but as yet , no response .
Flowers	and cannot get through via phone .
Flowers	iflorist - please issue a full_refund so that something can be salvaged from all this .
Flowers	i did try to ask via your website but have been forced to ask on a public forum as this seems the only way that encourages you to respond .
Flowers	thanks ( i hope ) in_advance for your response .
Flowers	i addressed in this company the first time and , believe me , it was pleasantly_surprised with professionalism of people which here work .
Flowers	the order was delivered when should .
Flowers	as i am in other country , i can not check everything , now i don ' t worry_about it , i can trust in eflorist !!!
Flowers	good fellows !
Flowers	ordered flowers for mothers_day , they turned_up on time but were wilting and looked on their way out .
Flowers	i emailed serenata and provided the photographic_evidence they required .
Flowers	they offered me a replacement or a refund , i chose a refund which i still_haven ' t received 0 days_later .
Flowers	i emailed them about it last_night and was told they have no record of me asking for a refund and have no copy of the emails that were sent from me .
Flowers	awful company , don ' t use them .
Flowers	my sister lives in new_zealand so i ordered some flowers for her_birthday on the 0th_feb , to be delivered on the 0th .
Flowers	i became slightly nervous on the 0th when i couldn ' t track the order online and my sister had not received any flowers .
Flowers	i submitted my first email to iflorist to find out where the flowers were , as the live_chat feature was offline .
Flowers	no response .
Flowers	on the morning of wednesday 00th i submitted another email to iflorist as again the live_chat feature was unavailable .
Flowers	still no response .
Flowers	on wednesday_afternoon , i received an_automated email to say that the order had been allocated and would be delivered on the 0th .
Flowers	isn ' t time travel a wonderful thing ?
Flowers	a week_later , no communications from iflorist and the flowers are left on the doorstep in the new_zealand sun .
Flowers	wilted and a week late , an excellent birthday_present .
Flowers	serenata were brilliant .
Flowers	i placed my order ( quite late in the day too ) for flowers to be delivered to my mother many miles_away .
Flowers	as promised , they were hand - delivered along with my personal message the following_morning .
Flowers	she was very surprised and happy with the flowers .
Flowers	will_definitely be using this company again , and would recommend to anyone .
Flowers	great service , easy to order , no_hidden_fees and better prices if compared to other similar websites .
Flowers	ordene unas flores llegaron a tiempo sin ningún problema totalmente recomendado
Flowers	flowers did not arrive on special day as requested .
Flowers	full payment taken and email confirmation sent to me .
Flowers	i have contacted the company but still_awaiting reply and there is no telephone_number for me to call .
Flowers	very very dissapoonted
Flowers	take your money and do not deliver .
Flowers	these people are like criminals !
Flowers	nasty and horrible people .
Flowers	never again , a big joke !
Flowers	i was a bit_worried after_reading some of the reviews here yesterday , but everything arrived well in time and i didn ' t even pay the extra for the pre 0pm delivery - nice one !
Flowers	the website was incredibly simple , i had to ask a question about the picture as i wasn ' t sure if it was the standard bunch .
Flowers	i got an answer almost_immediately saying it was , as beautiful as they where i upgraded and my mum was absolutely over the moon with the flowers .
Flowers	i would happily_recommend this company to anyone and i will be using them again in the future .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	googled for a valentines florist , iflorist was the first result .
Flowers	unfortunately for me their service , communication , flower quality and experience is the complete_opposite .
Flowers	in all dealings i have made over the internet i have never ever had such a bad_experience , i received the email about the nottingham distribution center being delayed to the 00th .
Flowers	at this point i emailed to cancel the order ... to which i received no confirmation or correspondence .
Flowers	so the flowers arrived at 0pm on the 00th even_though they were unwanted .
Flowers	the next problem is the quality , if you want petrol_station forecourt flowers delivered by a courier then all i can say is this is the company for you .
Flowers	they were an actual embarrassment , weltered .
Flowers	on to the communication , the call_centre never answer and i have had no emails still .
Flowers	the grand summary is the " valentines_day flowers " i ordered did not arrive on valentines_day and arrived even_though cancelled which is neither what i wanted so i will be chasing a full_refund .
Flowers	the other inconvenience is the £_00 i had to pay a local_florist and the inconvenience of rushing around to sort this on valentines morning .
Flowers	to summarise i wouldn ' t wish this level of service on my worst_enemy .
Flowers	chose same day deilivery at 0 . 00 p . m . ( made it just in time !)
Flowers	and the flowers were delivered in less_than two hours !
Flowers	the recipient was amazed and impressed by the freshness and quality of the flowers .
Flowers	i will most certainly choose eflorist again in the future for any flowers i want to send .
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	lovely flowers which my mum loved and delivered at the expected time .
Flowers	great range of flowers and wonderful service .
Flowers	as above .
Flowers	do no deal with this company .
Flowers	they will not deliver your items , they will not respond to your raised support tickets and they are dodging refunds that are necessary due to their awful service .
Flowers	a sham of a company .
Flowers	a simple online ordering service culminating in a thorough and satisfying customer experience .
Flowers	my girlfriend loved the flowers and chocolates .
Flowers	i ordered the roses and lilies standard bouquet for my sister .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on wednesday around 0pm .
Flowers	when she opened it the roses had been completely worn out and were about to die .
Flowers	the lillies were brown too .
Flowers	she did not want to tell me and upset me .
Flowers	when i visited her on saturday i saw the flowers and was so annoyed , angry and sad to know that the money i had paid had only given such a low quality of flowers .
Flowers	i should have rather paid a bit more and got the flowers from john_lewis .
Flowers	when i contacted the customer_services they were not helpful at all and have replied ' regards to the roses , it does appear that only the outer petals are browning but if you remove these then the bouquet will look lovely ' also ' there are only minimal signs of any damage so we cannot send out a replacement bouquet on this occasion '.
Flowers	well i guess you get what you pay for .
Flowers	so i strongly advice not to use this website and get your money ' s worth somewhere_else .
Flowers	the customer_service was totally unhelpful .
Flowers	i went for the dozen luxury red_roses .
Flowers	really impressive .
Flowers	it was even nicer to find out afterwards that she had never been sent flowers before , so thanks serenata_flowers for helping me to make her day :)
Flowers	i pre_- ordered flowers to be delivered to my wife on valentines_day , not only did the flowers turn_up a day late , iflorist didn ' t respond to any_queries on valetines day when i ( and many others ) tried to chase up our orders .
Flowers	they also didn ' t answer phones , respond to tickets logged on their own ticketing_system , respond to tweets or facebook posts in the days after valentines_day when hundreds of customers were trying to claim refunds for late and undelivered flowers , do not use them !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	well , cheering up a friend with flowers is always fun ....
Flowers	i enjoyed the easy webpage and loved the comedic emails and tracking_information every_step of the way !
Flowers	keep up the great work x
Flowers	i stupidly didnt read the reviews before i placed an order for 0 x luxury hampers .
Flowers	firstly , delivery was late so i called to check .
Flowers	upon calling i was told that there were ' delays ' and promised delivery would be the following_day and was told i could have a full_refund if not .
Flowers	apparently they were delivered 0 days_later by which point , was too_late for xmas as i mentioned on the phone .
Flowers	we have no record of delivery and we have not recieved the hampers .
Flowers	they are conveniently claiming that they have no record of the call in which i was promised a refund if delivery was any later - such a lie .
Flowers	trying to get a refund but it ' s a long , painful process and emails were ignored for weeks .
Flowers	in addition to this , they send far too many marketing emails which i find insulting given the service .
Flowers	focus less on generating more orders until you can properly fufil your existing ones .
Flowers	i am still_waiting for a refund that i was promised 0 weeks_ago that should have taken 00 days maximum !
Flowers	i have sent yet another email today in order to get my money back .
Flowers	i ordered , on the 00th_december , 0 bunches of flowers for a special occasion .
Flowers	one bunch of flowers arrived a day late , half_dead and looking nothing like i had ordered so we refused the delivery !
Flowers	the second bunch of flowers has never appeared !
Flowers	i sent countless emails over the christmas_period asking for someone to get in touch as it did not mention anywhere on your website that you would be closed ( i assumed that was the case as no one has explained this to me !)
Flowers	i finally got hold of someone on the 0th_january who promised a refund within 0 - 00 days .
Flowers	i called again on the 00th day as i had received no refund !
Flowers	i was then told it would be this week .
Flowers	i still_haven ' t had a refund !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i am absolutely_furious , i am a first time customer and so far your ' customer_service ' has been diabolical from start to finish !
Flowers	i will never use your services again , nor will i be recommending you to anyone i know .
Flowers	not even remotely close to what i ordered in colour of flowers used with cheaper substitutes used to bulk out the bunch massively .
Flowers	the six large gerberas pictured were replaced with two mini - heads .
Flowers	the vibrant multicoloured bunch i ordered were delivered entirely white and yellow ( but for the two red mini - gerberas ).
Flowers	customer_service ' assured ' me that half a bunch of gyp and a stuffing of carnations are of equal value and quality to gerberas , lisianthis and chrysanthemums .
Flowers	avoid like the plague .
Flowers	just didn ' t bother turning_up with my flowers on mother ' s day .
Flowers	left my mother waiting all day for them .
Flowers	had no customer_service available on the sunday itself , so i waited until the monday .
Flowers	they have no phone number so you have to wait for an adviser to speak to you online - so they closed the service for the entire day .
Flowers	i finally got an_email and they offered to deliver the following_day ( mothering tuesday ?!)
Flowers	at full cost .
Flowers	out of the goodness of their hearts they did offer me £ 0 off my next order though , as if i ' d ever order from them again to benefit .
Flowers	i couldn ' t recommend enough using one of the ' proper ' flower retailers on line rather_than this bunch of jokers .
Flowers	i don ' t think i ' ve ever been so angry .
Flowers	mothers_day flowers not delivered - i was on holiday and so couldn ' t be with my mother on day so figured some flowers were the least i could do .
Flowers	thanks iflorist for ruining that for me .
Flowers	sent three emails so far and nothing in response - their livechat never seems to be on .
Flowers	essentially this company has stolen £_00 from me .
Flowers	ordered 0 bouquets for delivery , they were delivered on time but were both squashed into a single box ... not very special as they got a bit crushed ,
Flowers	i ordered a delivery for ( rather expensive ) flowers for valentines_day to go to an address in belgium .
Flowers	the flowers were not delivered on the day or on the following_day .
Flowers	as a result i emailed ( they dont have a telephone_number !)
Flowers	requesting a refund .
Flowers	i received no reply until 0 days_later when i received a ' reply ' completely ignoring my previous message and stating that the address was wrong .
Flowers	now given that the address was exactly the same address i had provided them with for a previous successful delivery this seems a little strange to put it mildly .
Flowers	so $_00 paid in return for which ... no flowers delivered , no response to a refund request , impossible to speak to someone as they have no phone number and they send an_email 0 days after the flowers were due for delivery saying a building they have previously delivered to does not exist .
Flowers	draw your own conclusions ...
Flowers	they were brilliant , delivered less_than 00_hours after i ordered , i got a 00_%_discount , and the flowers were amazing
Flowers	i choose to order flowers from iflorist to be delivered to a close family_member on christmas_eve as a surprise christmas_present .
Flowers	i choose certain flowers as they had sentiment to the person that was receiving them .
Flowers	after_reading bad_reviews for iflorist i ensured that i emailed them to confirm the order i had paid for .
Flowers	yet after getting a phone call from my close relative explaining she had received flowers i went round to see the quality .
Flowers	to my shock and disappointment i found that not only had they sent the wrong free chocolates but the wrong flowers completely .
Flowers	they seem to have provided me with a cheaper substitute to what i had ordered and it was pointless as the flowers were all the wrong_colour and not one of the flowers that were in the description for the product i purchased were correct , i am so angry that i choose to use iflorist on such a close relative to get flowers which have alot of remembrance of her late husband .
Flowers	i would have got better quality and have more pennies in my pocket by nipping down to garage and getting a bunch from there .
Flowers	angry , upset and disappointed !!!
Flowers	season of good will - clearly not at iflortist ... getting the order correct would be a start !!!
Flowers	also i found the support_team disinterested in the fact that my order was wrong .
Flowers	my order arrived on time as expected .
Flowers	and the selection is quite good , i must confess i got surprised with the real result , looks way better_than the pictures online .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	this was a great company to use , flowers were lovely and made the perfect gift .
Flowers	paid extra to get delivery before 0pm .
Flowers	would defiantly use again !
Flowers	the flowers themselves were a present for my mums_birthday , she loved them and the bright colours , however as i was the one who saw them online i was a little disappointed with the size , very small for the price but like i say mum loved them and didn ' t know the difference !
Flowers	great !
Flowers	great !
Flowers	great !
Flowers	i was already disgusted with this company as they failed to deliver my order on 00nd january and didn ' t respond to my complaints until 00th_march .
Flowers	however , my disgust has only increased after finally seeing the flowers which were delivered to my friend yesterday .
Flowers	most of them were dead on arrival ( and there weren ' t very many altogether anyway ), and it looked more like a cheap bunch of flowers from a petrol_station than what the picture suggests it should turn into .
Flowers	i will now do my utmost to make_sure that no - one i know gives a penny to this company - i am ashamed to have sent my friend such an awful ' gift ' for her_birthday .
Flowers	they sent me an_email my order has been shiped and i checked with my wife she said she haven ' t received anything , so i again checked with them they tried to convince me that order has been shipped ... atlast i reported it as a scam
Flowers	ordered a bouquest of flowers for my mother for mothers_day 00 . 00 . 00 .
Flowers	got an_email at 00 : 00 stating " we regret to inform you that delivery has not been possible on the date you selected !
Flowers	however we are happy to rearrange for delivery as quickly as possbile , including an upgrade to your order at our cost , by way of apology for the late delivery .
Flowers	of course you are welcome to choose to cancel your order and we will refund you in full ."
Flowers	i paid a £ 0 . 00 extra delivery charge to get them there for mothers_day .
Flowers	they havent even offered to refund that part and still deliver the flowers .
Flowers	this seems to just be a scam company offering next_day delivery fot mothers_day .
Flowers	they take your hard_earned money then send you an_email and deliver the flowers when they feel_like it .
Flowers	not happy
Flowers	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
Flowers	i certainly wont be using eflorist again and i will be telling everyone who will listen to me to avoid them .
Flowers	please reply eflorist ?
Flowers	even better phone me ?
Flowers	iflorist have delivered the wrong flowers !
Flowers	i ordered a purple bouquet for my wife ( her favourite colour ) which was supposed to have purple roses within it .
Flowers	whilst it arrived today on time , the flowers are completely_different to my order and to me they don ' t look to be in the freshest state .
Flowers	when i emailed their cusomer service department to request a refund i am told that their terms and conditions state that they can change the flowers for another set of the higher or same value in the instance that they run out of the ordered bouquet .
Flowers	well if what they delivered is the same or better , then i ' m a monkeys uncle !
Flowers	my suggestion is to avoid this lot .
Flowers	their customer_service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
Flowers	i ' m still arguing for my refund , so far i have only been offered another bouquet .
Flowers	i will post back if i do get a refund or further experiences .
Flowers	i ordered flowers with eflorist to send to my wife ’_s work place as we both had to work on valentines_day .
Flowers	i received confirmation that my order had been accepted and the delivery day ( valentines_day ) confirmed .
Flowers	i waited anxiously , constantly looking at my phone , waiting for my wife to ring and to hear the excitement in her voice about the flowers but i never received any calls .
Flowers	at 0pm i then rang eflorist , which took over 00_mins to get through to , to be told that flowers had been dispatched and will_definitely reach my wife by 0pm .
Flowers	my wife was working until 0 . 00pm so i was getting more and more anxious as each second passed .
Flowers	at 0pm i was absolutletlty furious !
Flowers	i send eflorist an_email basically asking where the hell my flowers were and it was at this point i received the most shocking reply ( see below ):
Flowers	“ please_accept our apologies for contacting you so late .
Flowers	due to an overwhelming amount of demand in your delivery area for valentine ’_s day , our local_florists have not been able to fulfil your order .
Flowers	please_accept our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience that this may have caused .
Flowers	“
Flowers	this is an awful company , please do not use .
Flowers	they absolutely ruined my valentines this year .
Flowers	even a full_refund , that i have requested , will not compensate for this experience .
Flowers	if they cannot cope with the demand then they should not of accepted the order , they should of told me by midday at the very latest , not lie to me when i rang them at 0pm and guaranteed me that my order had been dispatched !
Flowers	by 0pm most shops had shut , those that were open selling flowers had sold out of roses !
Flowers	basically , a ruined valentine ’_s day all thanks to eflorist .
Flowers	in future i wouldn ’ t touch them with a barge poll , and judging_by most of the other reviews on here , there seems to be a pattern with this awful company !
Flowers	i have requested a full_refund .
Flowers	i ' m disgusted with service and customer_service .
Flowers	mothers_day bouquet - never received on time
Flowers	a proposed upgraded bouquet as means of an_apology not delivered .
Flowers	0 emails ; a 00minute phone call letter - no upgrade , no refund
Flowers	disgusted
Flowers	i ordered some flowers online and they got delivered the next_day !
Flowers	flowers were beautiful and the text messaging service to keep you up to date with the order was exceptional !
Flowers	defo ordering with serenata_flowers again .
Flowers	janet :-)
Flowers	ok so i browsed a few different websites and came_across a lovely bunch of flowers on serenata , ordered was happy to pay nearly 00 pounds .
Flowers	wrote a little message for my mum .
Flowers	ladies and gentlemen that was as good as it gets .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	the flowers arrived in some amazon style fashion just left on my mothers door_step .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	the flowers look nothing like what i ordered on the website .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	i got buds , who in there right mind would give somebody buds as a gift ?
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	the buds are discoloured and already brown and worsening .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	there was no card or message on the flowers .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	they are small and pathetic
Flowers	i have been in touch via e_- mail sent photos yet your company says the flowers are ok . no they are not i ordered flowers not discoloured dying buds .
Flowers	i expect a full_refund and ill send the buds back and maybe one of you can give them to your mother .
Flowers	the worst service ever , avoid like the plague .
Flowers	nice fresh , bright healthy flowers .
Flowers	just as many buds as flowers .
Flowers	was amazed at the amount for the value .
Flowers	next door neighbour absolutely loved them as well when mum invited her in to show them , then she was off to tell her mum .
Flowers	i will be a repeat customer 000_%.
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my mother on mothers_day and within one day of being received they were all but dead .
Flowers	i emailed them angrily about this and the service i received was phenomenal .
Flowers	quick reply and got a fresh batch of flowers and a £_00 voucher with no minimum_spend .
Flowers	will use again .
Flowers	my mother was very happy with the flowers and i was very happy with your service .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	nadine rawlins
Flowers	fantastic service , ordered in the evening delivered free by lunch time the next_day .
Flowers	i have used iflorist many_times to send flowers to the uk and france from where i live in australia because it is my only way of sending presents to people .
Flowers	the flowers have always arrived on time and made the recipient very happy .
Flowers	but this last time in december i ordered flowers for christmas_present for my mum and they never arrived .
Flowers	i contacted the so called live_chat to try and find out what happened and was given a tracking link that made no sense as it was a lot of destinations in holland and france with a final destination being 00km from my mums home .
Flowers	i florist have sent flowers here many_times so i assumed they used a local_florist .
Flowers	this time the flowers had been sent by a courier across_europe in a van to my mum and never arrived !!!
Flowers	the live_chat kept cutting me off telling they had been been received even_though i told them twice they hadn ' t .
Flowers	i decided to email iflorist instead , after trying 0 times they finally replied and told me exactly the same rubbish that they had been delivered and they reeled off the address where they had been delivered to which was my mums but that someone called calles had signed for them !!
Flowers	i explained that no - one called calles lives at my mums house so they must have gone somewhere_else .
Flowers	i was then told there was nothing they could do and was given a customer_service number to ring .
Flowers	again , i rang and spoke to someone and explained the same_thing again !
Flowers	this person was polite unlike everyone_else who i had dealt_with , they took my number and said they would ring back and find out what had happened and they never called me .
Flowers	when he took my number i explained that it was an australian mobile and he needs to use the code and he said " yeh , yeh , yeh , i know what to do " which made me think immediately that he had no_intention of ringing me back !
Flowers	so after contacting iflorist 0 times i have still not received a refund or redelivery .
Flowers	since i spoke to them my mum rang me to say on 00th_january_0000 , which was nearly 0 weeks_later she received a delivery of dead , slimy flowers and the delivery person did not request a signature !
Flowers	so after all the lies that i have been given about the flowers being signed for by someone at my mums house , they arrive dead !
Flowers	if iflorist advertise to send international flowers they should be able to find out when there is a problem with delivery .
Flowers	what has obviously happened is the flowers have been delivered by a courier across_europe and over the busy christmas_period been lost and left somewhere ... then delivered after christmas .
Flowers	i would like my £_00 . 00 back please iflorist , your customer_service is appalling and unfair .
Flowers	it is very difficult to contact people from australia so would have appreciated a bigger effort .
Flowers	or just a refund when i told you they never arrived .
Flowers	i ordered some flowers at around 0pm for my mum ' s birthday the next_day and they arrived bang on time and looked fantastic .
Flowers	the website was really easy to use and understand and the prices were very reasonable .
Flowers	i could easily upgrade my order to ' deluxe ' for little extra_cost .
Flowers	i was updated via_email and text at every_stage of the process , thanking and confirming my order , telling_me when the flowers were out for delivery and when they ' d been delivered .
Flowers	the brand voice and experience was great from start to finish , very easy to use and i ' d definitely use them again .
Flowers	very happy :-)
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my mum today for mothers_day and i am more_than happy with the condition the package turned_up in .
Flowers	my mum absolutely loves the too .
Flowers	i will be using the company again
Flowers	i routinely order flowers from australia to send to my friends and family in the uk , the website is so easy to navigate .
Flowers	the quality of the product is great and is more_than value for money .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered on a very specific day .
Flowers	on the day , i was sent a nice email_saying they were out for delivery .
Flowers	they never appeared , there was no email_saying that the flowers had not been delivered , there was no phone call .
Flowers	00_hours_later , the flowers were left at the back door .
Flowers	customer_service are hopeless , can not tell you what happened , have no accountability and send you the same tired email time after time .
Flowers	this company is a joke , go elsewhere .
Flowers	the site was easy to use and ordering was very easy .
Flowers	i ordered quite late in the day and still had next_day delivery which was great .
Flowers	i was notified whent he flowers had been delivered and they are gorgeous .
Flowers	great service at a very reasonable_price , thanks .
Flowers	i ordered a bunch flowers from serenata for my mother , next_day delivery as promised .
Flowers	however , the flowers that came looked nothing like the flowers i ordered .
Flowers	they where a cheap tatty bunch that i could of bought from tesco ' s for £ 0 .
Flowers	i was seriously unhappy with what i received and want my money back as they where not worth the money i spent on them .
Flowers	i will never order flowers from these again , trip to tesco next time .
Flowers	i can ' t even describe how pleased i was when my flowers arrived on thursday .
Flowers	the colour matches my bridesmaid dresses perfectly and they are exactly_what i wanted .
Flowers	there was no way i could have had such a perfect match with real flowers and so i would definitely_recommend silk_blooms !
Flowers	they handled my order perfectly from start to finish with continuous communication and delivering on their promise !
Flowers	i will_definitely be using them again :-)
Flowers	flowers 0 days late - will they turn_up ?
Flowers	doubt it now .
Flowers	claim that their delivery policy is made clear on ordering - it isn ' t !!
Flowers	don ' t use this company .
Flowers	so disappointed for my friend .
Flowers	ordered my flowers on 00 / 0 / 00 for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 they have ' t arrived still no email or anything , i have called them 00times no one ever picked_up the phone ... avoid them !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	00 / 0 / 00 still no email or flowers what a scammers !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i happened upon this site through living_social by_accident and couldn ' t have been happier with my purchase !
Flowers	the site was so simple to use and there were some utterly beautiful bouquets available to choose from .
Flowers	you can even choose your own card design and personalise the message on the front as well as within to make it just that extra bit special !
Flowers	delivery was super cheap and i ' ve every confidence that my bouquet will arrive in pristine_condition .
Flowers	i know my mum will be utterly thrilled with them on mother ' s day , i can ' t wait to get the ' thank_you ' phone call !
Flowers	thank_you iflorist , i ' ll definitely be back !
Flowers	x
Flowers	simply unacceptable .
Flowers	i am absolutely_furious about the quality of service i have not received from serenata_flowers .
Flowers	to remind you of what has taken place :
Flowers	on 00 january i received an_email from serenata telling_me that the flowers that i had scheduled to be delivered the very next_day would not be delivered due to a ' technical issue '.
Flowers	i was advised to use the link to reschedule for another day , get a free upgade or arrange a refund .
Flowers	instead of requesting a refund or an upgrade , i replied quickly requesting that the flowers be delivered the very next_day at 00am .
Flowers	since then i have had no reply whatsoever , no flowers have been delivered and my mum received no flowers as a thank_you for something very special that she did for me .
Flowers	my father spent all day wednesday waiting inside for the delivery of flowers that never came .
Flowers	in short , i am immensely frustrated with serenata_flowers - you have caused disappointment to my mother , inconvenience to my father and have made me look like a complete idiot .
Flowers	i have ordered from serenata before and have been very pleased with your service , however after this experience i simply cant communicate to you how disappointed i am with you .
Flowers	i expect more_than a full_refund as an_apology for your appalling customer_service .
Flowers	i also expect a reply within 00_hours .
Flowers	james m lawrence
Flowers	the decision and ordering_process was made really simple !
Flowers	hard to go_wrong really !
Flowers	will_definitely use iflorist again !
Flowers	fantastic ordering_process which allowed me to order flowers for 0 different_addresses , simply , fast and inexpensively .
Flowers	i ordered a £_00 flower_arrangement and paid extra to have them delivered on mothers_day .
Flowers	they ' ve taken the money but no flowers have arrived .
Flowers	i called the number from the website which now says they are no_longer taking calls on the number and recently noticed the number has disappeared from the website .
Flowers	what an awful company .
Flowers	very pleased with my order .
Flowers	will use this florist again .
Flowers	ordered flowers for mothering_sunday knowing my mother would be in .
Flowers	picked prestige because they claimed to deliver that day .
Flowers	arrived saturday .
Flowers	found in porch in full view of passers by .
Flowers	wilting and dying by next morning .
Flowers	cost was £_00 . 00 before delivery .
Flowers	bouquet nothing like advertised its pitiful .
Flowers	absolutely_disgusted .
Flowers	always send flowers .
Flowers	never_experienced anything like this .
Flowers	totally ruined day for both of us .
Flowers	if only i had read all the reviews from various sites before .
Flowers	i don ' t know how they are getting away with it .
Flowers	i am very disappointed with the bouquet which my girlfriend received on her_birthday .
Flowers	on the 00st of december i ordered cherry lips bouquet from iflorist .
Flowers	everything went fine but the bouquet which my girlfriend got doesn ' t look like the cherry lips bouquet which i ordered .
Flowers	instead of beautiful red_roses , she got a few different colours carnations with a few green leaves .
Flowers	i must mention i paid an extra money to make the bouquet bigger . are you serious florist ?
Flowers	i will not get back to iflorist again and i will make_sure all my friends will avoid it as well .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my wifes birthday but they did not arive when i contacted the company i was assured they would come the next_day ( the day after my wifes birthday ).
Flowers	this again did not happen .
Flowers	the live_chat is terrible with advisors who obviously have no clue about customer_service .
Flowers	i would stay well clear of this company , i will apparently recieve a refund in 0 - 0 working_days however i am left with a dissapointed wife and no flowers !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered flowers from eflorsit , the cost was £_00 including a vase .
Flowers	this was for my wife ' s birthday .
Flowers	i selected the next_day for delivery and i ordered before 0pm , the only delivery option was royal_mail for these flowers , i didn ' t think this was a issue and assumed that i would get them the next_day .
Flowers	they arrived 0 days late , were dead and had no sign of the vase i ordered , the bunch was also smaller_than in the picture
Flowers	eflorsit said that they can ' t gaurantee next_day delivery with royal_mail ... so why allow me to pick a delivery date and not warn me at any point during the order process delivery isnt gauranteed ?!?!
Flowers	( turns_out they do mention this on their site in the small_print at the bottom of the page !)
Flowers	i emailed the customer care team and got no respnose , i was told to allow 00_hours for a response so 0 days_later after spending over 00_minutes on hold got my money back .
Flowers	and very good value as well .
Flowers	ordered 00 quid worth of flowers for v day yesterday , ordered them a week before hand .
Flowers	not delivered , says order was cancelled on website login on the day .
Flowers	not email , not phone call and the number they give is a dead line .
Flowers	taken the money out of my visa , no sign of a refund and i am angry !
Flowers	not to metion the gf who was upset !
Flowers	someone report these scamming twats and take them to court !
Flowers	fue cumpleaños de mi mejor amiga , y por trabajo no puedo estar cerca de ella .
Flowers	gracias a floraqueen pude enviar un hermoso bouquet de flores a italia .
Flowers	buen trabajo !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet for a friend ' s birthday which was supposed to consist of white roses and purple freesias and paid extra to include a further 00 %.
Flowers	it looked lovely on the website but when it arrived my friend sent me a picture and it actually only contained the white roses and didn ' t look very special at all .
Flowers	i contacted e_- florist and did receive an initial response stating that they hadn ' t realised that there had been a problem with the freesias from their supplier and that they had decided to go_ahead and send the bouquet without them .
Flowers	they offered to resend a new bouquet or offered a partial_refund .
Flowers	i responded to advise that as the birthday had passed their seemed little point in resending the flowers and enquired as to the value of the refund .
Flowers	i sent this message on the 0th_july , sent it again on the 00th_july when i received no response and then also sent a further message through the enquiry form on the website just to ensure that there was no way it could have been missed .
Flowers	unsurprisingly i have still not had a response .
Flowers	i am completely dissatisfied with the overall experience .
Flowers	eflorist may be slightly_cheaper but this seems to negatively impact their customer_service which in my opinion is not worth the saving , especially given the time you will spend trying to obtain a satisfactory response !
Flowers	i would not use this company again and would warn friends that were thinking of doing so .
Flowers	i wanted to send a bunch of flowers to my new girlfriend at her office .
Flowers	the selection and prices offered on iflorist were really good .
Flowers	i managed to get what turned_out to be a beautiful bunch of red_roses and a box of chocolates delivered on time and as promised .
Flowers	the website is really easy to use and i had no_problems whatsoever .
Flowers	i received acknowledgement as soon as my order was submitted as well as one soon after delivery .
Flowers	my girlfriend was really impressed too , so thanks to all at iflorist for making her christmas even more special !
Flowers	this was the first time i have used an online florist , but i will certainly be using iflorist . co . uk again for valentines_day !
Flowers	xx
Flowers	wouldn ' t recommend this lot to deliver anything ever again .
Flowers	reason being we ordered 0 days before the selected delivery date to an international address for a birthday_present .
Flowers	to my horror , the flowers did not arrive .
Flowers	looking on the order tracking from dpd , the order was picked_up in the evening before the selected date and arrived into the country being delivered to at 0pm that day .
Flowers	the flowers then sat in the warehouse all weekend .
Flowers	the customer_service response refused to accept anything of their wrongdoing and blamed it solely on dpd with the message attached being , ' we don ' t guarantee international deliveries '.
Flowers	having looked into the order tracking more closely .
Flowers	the flowers were sent on the most basic option dpd offer , which on the dpd website specifically state that all deliveries will be made within 0 - 0 working_days .
Flowers	considering the flowers departed the point of origin late_afternoon the day before , there wasn ' t a hope in hell the flowers arriving on the date selected .
Flowers	when trying to explain that point to prestige_flowers , the person who responded couldn ' t quite grasp the obvious and still refused to accept any liability .
Flowers	i asked for a manager to call me to discuss my complaint and i ' m still_waiting for that response .... 0 days and counting .
Flowers	the matter has now been raised to trading_standards and raised a dispute on the payment via my credit_card company .
Flowers	lesson to be learnt - prestige_flowers can ' t be trusted and with the standard of customer_service received , don ' t deserve to be in business .
Flowers	do not use and if you have already commented report them to trading_standards .
Flowers	i have had no replies to any emails no contact number , flowers didn ' t turn_up , not been refunded had to go to my bank and call it back with proof of purchase .
Flowers	i used serentaflowers to send flowers and chocolates to my mum for her_birthday .
Flowers	i ordered the day before and they got there on time , no_problems , no hassle and my mum was very happy .
Flowers	i would definitely use them again !
Flowers	i order my flowers for both my gf and mum weeks_ago .
Flowers	nothing has arrived , no email apart_from order confirmation .
Flowers	have been trying , unsuccessfully to get in touch with them since this morning via live_chat , they have no phone number ... completely in the dark !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i just want to know the tracking_numbers to reassure myself that the flowers will be delivered !
Flowers	never ever again !
Flowers	p . s .
Flowers	it seems their livehelp site has just crashed ...
Flowers	no issues .
Flowers	good , easy online system .
Flowers	helpful email_updates about dispatch and delivery .
Flowers	according to recipient the flowers were well_packaged and " really beautifull ".
Flowers	would recommend to all .
Flowers	i would recommend the service to anyone , it was quick and easy and i liked the updates to my phone and email of the flowers progress .
Flowers	ordered hampers from iflorist / ihamper for christmas_presents .
Flowers	hampers were meant to be delivered on 00rd_december .
Flowers	didn ' t turn_up .
Flowers	called on 00th was assured they would be delivered that day .
Flowers	they didn ' t !
Flowers	i then had to rush out to buy more presents !
Flowers	which is not what i wanted to do on christmas_eve !
Flowers	when the office finially reopened i was told they had to do an investigation with the courier !
Flowers	i called multiple_times a weeks for over a month being fobbed_off time and time again !
Flowers	i have finially been told the item had been delivered so i wouldn ' t get a refund !
Flowers	i didn ' t recieve the items and am over £_000 out of pocket !
Flowers	don ' t think it should be me out of pocket due to a delivery driver taking it to the wrong place !
Flowers	customer_service is shocking !
Flowers	never any one in charge to talk to when you call up and they have put the phone down on me multiple_times !
Flowers	awful company !
Flowers	will be sending letters to paper , watchdog , etc , anyone who will listen !
Flowers	my boyfriend ordered a surprise bouquet of flowers for a special day as he was away on a business trip .
Flowers	it arrived the following_day and to make the matter worse , it was left at the door unattended and badly_damaged in torrential rain and the heavy wind .
Flowers	it was found soaked and lopsided in the corner of my garage door .
Flowers	at that stage i knew from my boyfriend that he ' s ordered flowers and he was quite furious about the delay .
Flowers	he ' s made a complaint for which they responded many days_later stating
Flowers	hi ,
Flowers	please_accept our sincere_apologies for the delay in replying .
Flowers	we request you to contact our head_office on <_external link_removed > regarding this matter .
Flowers	regards ,
Flowers	iflorist
Flowers	we rang and spoke to the customer_service guy who sounded_like he couldn ' t care less .
Flowers	he promised to speak to the boss and ring us back re : refund and unsurprisingly never returned the call .
Flowers	it left a bad taste in mouth and it totally ruined what could ' ve been a sweet experience .
Flowers	we feel appalled this is how they run the business especially at the current economical climate and there is no way this company will survive .
Flowers	business is all about the trust .
Flowers	they lost more_than just two customers .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered on valentines_day for my partner .
Flowers	when i initially purchased them i recieved confirmation stating the flowers would be with her on the 00th feburary .
Flowers	this was not the case at all !!!
Flowers	the flowers came today ( 00th ) at around 0 . 00pm , when she had already left !
Flowers	after waiting till_0pm on valentines evening i then had to go to a local_supermarket and purchase a bunch of flowers which i should not have had to do at all .
Flowers	plus , considering the time i had to go , as you can imagine these were the left overs that nobody else wanted .
Flowers	the payment of £_00 . 00 was already taken from iflorist and the time and date that their payment was agreed for was not met .
Flowers	this is an_absolute let_down for both my partner and myself .
Flowers	especially with her travelling back to university today .
Flowers	she did not and will not even get to see the flowers .
Flowers	i have sent an_email to support stating my issue and have still had no response as of yet .
Flowers	i have also logged an online ticket and i am still_waiting to hear back .
Flowers	i expect a full_refund .
Flowers	ever since i first discovered them , i only ever order flowers from e_- florist .
Flowers	unlike many places ( where to bouquets are quite tacky ), there are lots of stylish bouquets to choose from .
Flowers	they are reasonably_priced too and always delivered on time and as quickly as you need .
Flowers	i go straight to e_- florist every time !
Flowers	this is the second time i ' ve used you , and its still great , thanks !
Flowers	i ordered flowers for mother ' s day and did not receive them until 0 days_later the day was ruined , i emailed for refund of delivery / flowers was not given i think the company is disgraceful and very poor customer_service and myself and others i have told will not be using your services again .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for a friends 00th_birthday .
Flowers	they never arrived .
Flowers	what is worse , is i have contacted iflorist two times ( they seem to have no customer support number ) and they have ignored both my emails , not even offering an explanation or apology .
Flowers	i would never recommend using this company .
Flowers	they just take your money and are an unreliable service .
Flowers	i was very happy with the service that i got .
Flowers	000_%
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet of vibrant roses to be sent to my mother - in - law for mother ' s day .
Flowers	the flowers were due to be delivered on friday 00th_march in plenty of time for sunday .
Flowers	when i tracked my order i could see that it still said allocated and not delivered .
Flowers	i tried to contact the company over the weekend using the phone , the ticket raising section and the online help but to no_avail .
Flowers	the flowers were not delivered .
Flowers	i then spent the rest of the week trying to contact the company via_email and phone to find out what had happened to the flowers and to arrange a refund .
Flowers	having finally gotten though to someone , after ten_minutes on hold , all they could do was find out from the florist they had requested the flowers from where they were and then email me back , i felt thoroughly fobbed_off !
Flowers	obviously i no_longer require the flowers as mother ' s day has long passed .
Flowers	they say on their site that they have a 000_% guarantee but i ' m currently at 0_%!
Flowers	all i want at this point is a refund .
Flowers	i would not use this company for flowers , the customer_service is awful and virtually impossible to get hold of and your flowers won ' t even arrive !
Flowers	i ' m giving them until the end of the week to sort this out and if i get no joy i ' m reporting them to trading_standards and watchdog .
Flowers	iflorist contacted me regarding this matter and said after investigating i was due a full_refund .
Flowers	i have yet to receive this refund .
Flowers	i have tried_contacting them a number of times regarding this matter but they once again impossible to get hold of .
Flowers	avoid at all costs !
Flowers	brought through cashback , very good transaction .... flowers lovely
Flowers	well_done !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i had a delivery arranged for valentines_day to deliver to my partners work address .
Flowers	i had her wait there until 0pm but unfortunately the flowers didn ' t arrived until after this time ( this was a friday_night and so they were not picked_up until the monday ).
Flowers	not only were they delivered outside of the agreed delivery time but office security told my partner they were thrown inside the door without any care by the courier .
Flowers	needless to say i was very disappointed .
Flowers	i tried_contacting them via the ticketing_system and weeks_later no reply except for them to close the ticket as resolved .
Flowers	the delivery issue is something they need to look at with the courier but the lack of customer_service is unacceptable especially_considering the cost of the flowers .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered to my friend in australia for her wedding on february 00th .
Flowers	today is february 00th and they have still not arrived .
Flowers	the occasion has now passed so even if the flowers reach her now it would be pointless .
Flowers	i spoke to someone on the livechat application the day after the delivery was supposed to arrived and they guaranteed they would contact the florist in australia who the order was with and email asap .
Flowers	two days_later i have still had no contact from anyone .
Flowers	today i rang the office number for iflorist and the call was answered by a completely disinterested member of staff .
Flowers	she tried to fob me off saying the flowers may have been left with a neighbour .
Flowers	when i explained to her that this was not the case as my friend had checked she didn ' t know what to say .
Flowers	she then_proceeded to tell me she would contact the florist via_email and get back to me by the end of today .
Flowers	when i explained there was a 00 hour time difference and i doubted very much the florist would reply in the middle of the night she didn ' t seem at all concerned .
Flowers	i now have no interest if the flowers are delivered or not .
Flowers	the occasion has passed and the surprise has been spoiled for a dear friend .
Flowers	all i want in a refund for the £_00 i handed_over .
Flowers	terrible , terrible service all_round .
Flowers	please avoid this company at all costs .
Flowers	how impersonal can you get with serenata_flowers .
Flowers	0 / flowers arrive delivered in a box .
Flowers	0 / left with reception and just left without passing them to my wife .
Flowers	i could have dumped them on reception for that matter .
Flowers	0 / i paid an extra 00 for grandissimo option , expecting beautiful white blossoms to break up the dozen red_roses .
Flowers	nothing , just a bunch or roses , shoved together .
Flowers	definitely not grandissimo .
Flowers	0 / the flowers were wrapped in the most basic of wrapping papers , very disappointed .
Flowers	ive spent far less at flower shops and got a lot more .
Flowers	will never buy from here again or off the internet come to that matter .
Flowers	service doesn ' t exist .
Flowers	just good at confirming your order taken and delivery thats all you get .
Flowers	no delivery on valentines_day , no communication and no delivery the next_day either .
Flowers	scam_artists , stay well away .
Flowers	update_: tuesday 00th still no delivery
Flowers	i have used serenata before and they have been great .
Flowers	i decided to order some flowers for my grandma ' s birthday last_week and they didn ' t just come very late in the day but the quality of the flowers were awful .
Flowers	they ' re already dying and only received them on thursday .
Flowers	i have been really impressed with their service but unfortunately after this i will not be using them again .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for international delivery almost a week before the delivery date .
Flowers	they failed to arrive on time .
Flowers	when i contacted online help all i got told was " well , we ' ve put the order through to the local_florist " and " perhaps if you leave it a couple more hours " the last one was at 0pm local time !
Flowers	i was worried when i read a lot of negative_reviews but can_honestly say i had no problem with the company !
Flowers	i ordered the flowers on the tuesday_afternoon to be delivered to a london office the following_day .
Flowers	the order process was easy , then i was getting email_updates re my order and then had an update once it had been delivered the next_day !
Flowers	all in all it was great .
Flowers	arrived on time , flowers were lovely and the choice to add like a balloon was a fab idea !
Flowers	thank_you for making my sisters 00th_birthday that bit more special .
Flowers	i was very disappointed with the daffodils i had purchased especially as i had upgraded the bouquet to a larger one .
Flowers	they arrived and were all fully open and dying with some already dead .
Flowers	i had expected the daffodils to arrive in a similar state as you would purchase them in a shop , a mixture of unopened and just starting to open flowers so they could be enjoyed for a number of days .
Flowers	when you send flowers it is usually for a significant reason and i was disappointed to find out the gesture was of shadowed by the poor quality of the flowers .
Flowers	couple this with the expense of sending daffodils ( in comparison to the couple of pounds you can buy them for in a shop ) i would not recommend serenataflowers . com .
Flowers	i highly_recommend serenata_flowers excellent service !
Flowers	will be using them again in future .
Flowers	flowers were sent half_dead and very small , ordered balloons but they didn ' t even turn_up .
Flowers	very difficult to get hold of them on the phone , waited for an_hour to finally get through , sent a pic like they asked but they wouldn ' t refund !
Flowers	do not use this company !!
Flowers	very bad service and terrible flowers !
Flowers	waste of £_00 !
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my mum for mother ' s day , and picked next say delivery , i was told they would be delivered sat 00th_march and also had an_email_confirming this .
Flowers	saturday went and i sent 0 emails chasing them up with no reply , sunday came and went and another 0 emails with no reply !!
Flowers	the flowers finally turned_up on monday after mother ' s day and as they had obviously been in transit for days we ' re half_dead !!
Flowers	a phone call made and staff were so unhelpful but have me a managers email , i emailed saying i wanted a refund , had no reply !!
Flowers	disgusting service !!
Flowers	surfice to say i will be taking this further
Flowers	i was told the flowers were lovely and the delivery was the exact day i asked for , would definitely use again
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my gf and have countless_times tried to contact iflorist to find out information_regarding its delivery time , and to track it a service i paid extra for !
Flowers	i have not received any reply apart_from a pathetic automated_response and there online_chat doesn ' t work .
Flowers	there is no way of calling them as there is no phone number , if the flowers do not get delivered today i will be furious !
Flowers	communication is disgraceful !
Flowers	i really needed to find some flowers for next_day delivery and i hunted through google and found serenata_flowers , ordered a bunch for next_day , then i began reading reviews !
Flowers	i was horrified , and very nervous that my flowers would not make it and i have been checking the status update all day only to have a very pleased mum thanking me for beautifull flowers .
Flowers	i ordered the flowers around midday the day before and they were with her by 00 the next_day !
Flowers	very happy customer and i will use them again !
Flowers	:)
Flowers	no issues , flowers were great , no_problems with delivery
Flowers	have used them a number of times and never had an issue .
Flowers	website ordering was very easy to navigate and ordering was very easy .
Flowers	asked for next_day and i received text and email_updates to let me know when the flowers were dispatched and when delivered !
Flowers	extremely good service and flowers were lovely .
Flowers	they arrived in a box which i found interesting !!
Flowers	will order from them again !
Flowers	et utroligt højt kortgebyr ( mastercard ) på 00 kr !
Flowers	som jeg_ikke føler at der bliver gjort ordenligt opmærksom på ( og selv fakturaen nævner det kun indirekte ved at lægge gebyret til buketprisen ... så ser det jo nok lidt mindre farligt ud ?).
Flowers	desuden er hjemmesiden sådan indrettet at det_er_meget svært at hoppe frem og tilbage i bestillingsprocessen , så_jeg 0 . måtte starte forfra et_par gange ved fejlvalg 0 . på betalingsskærmen ikke kunne gå tilbage for at se hvorfor at prisen med_et var 00 kr højere end jeg_havde regnet med , og derfor blev nød til bare at betale for ikke at skulle starte helt forfra igen .
Flowers	desuden er_der 00 prisintervaller fra 000 - 000_kr på div .
Flowers	buketter .
Flowers	på billedet ser man buketten til ca 000 - 000_kr , så hvis_man vælger en buket til under eller over dette beløb ved man jo reelt ikke hvor meget eller hvad man får for pengene .
Flowers	i always use serenata to order flowers for friends and relatives .
Flowers	not only are their costs extremely competitive , they are extraordinarily reliable and offer next_day delivery .
Flowers	i have never been disappointed by their service - always arriving on time and delivered by very competent and pleasant people .
Flowers	the flowers are also very beautiful and i have always had comments from recipients about how lovely the flowers are and how long they last .
Flowers	i recommend serenata regularly to my friends and would use the service again and again .
Flowers	my only comments would be 0 ) to add more design options for personalised cards and messages and 0 ) to maybe have an option for a sunday delivery - this is something offered by very few online flower delivery services and i think this would set serenata apart_from competitors if they could offer this service .
Flowers	perhaps just on certain sundays ?
Flowers	such as mothering_sunday ?
Flowers	look fab and arrived as expected .
Flowers	0st_class company couldn ' t have asked for more ordering on line was so easy and paypal accepted answell and i loved how i kept getting funny updates on there progress . 00 / 00 on every_aspect of the transaction 00 / 00 would recommend to anyone
Flowers	ordered 00 red_roses it is now 0000 still no delivery , i have emailed them no reply
Flowers	i was sent a email with a link to tracking and when i went on it the number i was given didnt match any order , well thanks iflorest you take my money but dont deliver surely they carnt get away with this the least you can do is refund all of us please beware and dont use iflorist .
Flowers	00 / 0 / 00 still no flowers well i florists i want a full_refund it is to late for the flowers now how can you treat people like this i managed to speak to some one and they told me their lorry got stuck in snow wot a load of rubbish refund please .
Flowers	00 / 0 .

Flowers	0000 on the 00 / 0 still no reply to my emails so you leave me no choice so i will be contacting tradingstandard on monday and taking the matter_further not happy my order no is p000000
Flowers	just had a email from i florist to say i am getting a full_refund , i will wait and see if i get it
Flowers	i have used the service of iflorist on quite a few occasions and they have never failed to deliver .
Flowers	there range of chose of flowers is brilliant , the ease of ordering on the internet is stress_free .
Flowers	they have always delivered on the date that i have put in and who every receives them always sends me a text to say how lovely they are and how happy the flowers make them feel .
Flowers	zoe
Flowers	on 00 february i ordered flowers to be delivered to my girlfriend in australia for valentine ' s day .
Flowers	the money was taken out on the same day .
Flowers	the flowers never arrived and i have not received a refund .
Flowers	i don ' t live in the uk at the moment and so cannot phone their 0000 number .
Flowers	the " live_chat " service has never been online when i have attempted to us it .
Flowers	i have not had a single response to any of the ten emails i have written .
Flowers	all in all the worst service from any company i have ever received .
Flowers	it was very disappointing as today was my birthday and my boyfriend wanted to surprise me with a cake and some flowers that never arrived .
Flowers	he placed an order with them and i had to stay in all day to wait for the delivery that never arrived .
Flowers	it is definitely a lack of customer_service as they didn ' t even border to give him a phone call and let him know what went wrong .
Flowers	more_than that when we tried to contact them we received no answer .
Flowers	i wouldn ' t recommend this company to anyone ... the experience was awful as my birthday past and i had no present delivered .
Flowers	good prices , easy to purchase .
Flowers	just simple and elegent would recommend to everyone .
Flowers	quick speedy_delivery and beautiful bouquet
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet of flowers on the 00th of december in order to receive them on the 00th of december as a gift to my wife .
Flowers	on the 00th we made sure that someone was in the house at all times and also mentioned to my neighbors to watch out in case we didn ' t see them being delivered .
Flowers	the bouquet never arrived , they were supposed to be delivered via yodel , and i received an_email_stating that they had been delivered , it also stated they had been left safe ( strange as i was at home ), so i ran around my house looking for them but found nothing , i then spent about an_hour knocking on neighbours doors trying to find if they had been delivered to the wrong_address , but noone had received the delivery .
Flowers	as they were closed on the 00th and 00th i proceeded to contact yodel to follow my delivery who stated that they had been left in the front porch .......
Flowers	i do not have a front porch ?
Flowers	i then contacted iflorist who can only be contacted via live_chat on their website and they take about 0 mins to answer any 0 line of questioning or response , very slow .... all i was told is that they will investigate .
Flowers	so now i have a very unhappy wife who thinks i forgot about her flowers for christmas and no response as to when or if they will be delivered
Flowers	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i emailed iflorist and chatted to them online on the 00th and still have no response after 00hrs
Flowers	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i have chatted to iflorist , they have told me to check with neighbours , which i had already done on the 00th and now the flowers were dead , they then gave me a phone number to call : 00000000000
Flowers	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i have called iflorist , they have told me they will be getting the flowers redelivered on the friday 0th of january so they will be delayed by a total of 00 days late , i also asked if they were going to do anything_else , and the answer was a simple : " no , company policy_states that all we can do is have the flowers redlivered "
Flowers	i was very pleased with the out come of my order from serenata_flowers , the flowers and vas were beautiful and the teddy was really cute and cuddly , they got there on time and nothing was broken :) i would shop with them again x
Flowers	could not fault the service , flowers looke fine , however when i arrived home to see them , i asked my fiance where she had put the rest of them , but there were no more .
Flowers	you must try this site .
Flowers	i ve ordered two bouquets today and i know my loved_ones will adore them .
Flowers	ive used the company before so i know what im talking_about !!!!
Flowers	xxx
Flowers	i am absolutely appauled by their service .
Flowers	specified for delivery on mother ' s day , as they offered .
Flowers	flowers were delivered saturday , however nobody was around to recieve them , as obv we were expecting them on sunday !
Package_Service	very good customer_service :)
Package_Service	despite me waiting in all day , my collection did not take place on the date arranged which was disappointing , but the reason i am still scoring 0 is because of the great service i received when i brought this to p0g ' s attention - within minutes , my agent richard_mileham had rebooked my pick_up for the same day that i contacted them ( using a more_expensive service ) - richard was very polite and helpful , so all in all , i am very happy .
Package_Service	just a side note , i have used p0g many_times before now , and up until this occasion , there has never been a problem , so can only assume that this mishap has been a one - off .
Package_Service	request them to import an item ( laptop that an employee was using ) from nepal , first of all it was delivered to wrong_address and after chasing them i found out after 0 days it has been delivered to wrong_address .
Package_Service	when i went to pick it up i was shocked to see , the laptop was damaged , box was opened , battery was missing and there were marks on laptop too .
Package_Service	terrible services , never using them again .
Package_Service	i booked yodel through p0g - they are useless and didn ' t turn_up .
Package_Service	i personally think p0g should not use them as a supplier .
Package_Service	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
Package_Service	she change our courier to a ups drop_off service .
Package_Service	i will_definitely be using p0g again because of samantha ' s help and just pay for a better 0rd_party supplier !
Package_Service	it would be useful if p0g had a number you could call - the live_chat was brilliant when i eventually found it though !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i was recommended by a family_member to use parcel 0 go .
Package_Service	i had two packages to send to two different locations and it couldn ' t have been easier .
Package_Service	you select the service , weight , dimensions , if you would like to insure for an extra_cost ( i did , as i had expensive goods but you don ' t have to ), and finally the details of the receivers .
Package_Service	once this has been completed , you are provided with the labels and simply print off .
Package_Service	because the website explained that their collections are anywhere between_0am - 0pm , i expected them to be collected at the later time but , to my surprise , they turned_up at 0am the next_day !
Package_Service	also , i received positive_feedback from my customers ( the receivers ) as they were updated via_email , from parcel 0 go , of when to expect their delivery .
Package_Service	really pleased and would definitely_recommend !
Package_Service	i needed to post off a parcel with some speakers which weighed a not - so - small 00kg .
Package_Service	at this weight royal_mail becomes ridiculously_expensive , so i looked to couriers for help .
Package_Service	firstly i went directly to the couriers , which i ( wrongly ) assumed would be the cheapest thing to do , and my favourite courier is ups .
Package_Service	so i logged_onto the ups website and got a quote of £_00 . 00 for them to collect and post my parcel .
Package_Service	this was too much for me to pay , so i researched and found this company , parcel0go .
Package_Service	so i went_ahead and got a quote from them , and gave me a huge list with various couriers and varied speeds that my parcel would be delivered .
Package_Service	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back £_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was £_00 . 00 for me ).
Package_Service	i did initially wonder_how it was so cheap , as it was half the price that ups are offering on their own site !
Package_Service	and i assume that parcel0go takes a share of the price i pay !
Package_Service	well , i should never have doubted anything as the next_day the ups driver came and collected my parcel , and was delivered the day after .
Package_Service	great service !
Package_Service	oh but a word of warning , don ' t use tnt or hermes as they receive a lot of criticism , just pay a couple of quid extra and use dhl or ups !
Package_Service	thanks a lot parcel0go !
Package_Service	i will_definitely be using you again !
Package_Service	had a little_bit of a problem with the website and initially thought it was a website problem but it was actually my mistake .
Package_Service	once i figured out what i was doing wrong it was plain_sailing and enjoying the ease of sending all my parcel out
Package_Service	catherine very polite & helpful service will use again .
Package_Service	i been using collect_plus many_times as ebay seller , they have really good prices and so many shops around where you can drop your parcel even after work .
Package_Service	tracking_system is amazing too , you don ' t need to worry what ' s going on .
Package_Service	i think the score is so low because people who had good experience usually don ' t come to write a good comments but people who had bad_experience coming here to complain straight_away , that ' s why there are so many negative_reviews .
Package_Service	once again i think it ' s the best delivery service and i am very happy that they are here .
Package_Service	i sent my parcel via their service , there was a problem with my parcel and it got kept in the custom .
Package_Service	they made no effort in updating me whatsoever , i tried to ring them many_times , emailed them , every time they just respond to me with a generic answer .
Package_Service	they were very rude and not helpful at all .
Package_Service	in the end it took them 0 months to get my parcel back , and i had to pay 00 pounds extra for it to be returned to me .
Package_Service	absolutely outrageous !
Package_Service	as soon as they take your money , they just won ' t care any more .
Package_Service	please do not use their service if you don ' t want to get ripped_off !
Package_Service	emma was really helpful today in queries .
Package_Service	she went extra_mile .
Package_Service	[_name ] helped_me with an order and was very efficient and helpful .
Package_Service	i have started using parcel0go as my courier of choice and they have been excellent so far .
Package_Service	keep up the good work !
Package_Service	the prices are great the service is great .
Package_Service	i always use this site and haver never had any_problems ever .
Package_Service	all the staff are really helpful if you ever have queries .
Package_Service	id like to mention a particular member of staff - [_name ], very helpful indeed , a credit to the company , keep it up !
Package_Service	a really good service with extremely_helpful staff .
Package_Service	an operator called jenny helped_me with an international shipment and looked in depth into a query for me .
Package_Service	i will_definitely use again !
Package_Service	seriously poor service .
Package_Service	p0g knew this was important and they charged over £_00 for next_day service .
Package_Service	on tuesday .
Package_Service	wasn ' t collected until thursday and now on monday , it ' s still not their .
Package_Service	their customer_service staff have no clue .
Package_Service	they are worse than useless - the entire company !
Package_Service	easy to use website , fast and secure .
Package_Service	collection is easy to organize
Package_Service	downside ( very small one but ...), pity collection times can not be more specific than 0am_till_0pm for example ?
Package_Service	not parcel0go ' s fault would be a nice addition in my opinion to their website .
Package_Service	also a surcharge for using paypal is disappointing as i use ebay and paypal a lot !
Package_Service	support staff both on facebook and website all very helpful and knowledgeable , a credit to their employers !
Package_Service	hi i booked 0 parcels through parcel0go never arrived to collect the parcels i contacted parcel0go on their website because they dont have customer_service no .
Package_Service	they said cant do anything never ever use parcel0go
Package_Service	have been speaking to ' rowan ' for an eta on my delivery .
Package_Service	have been advised it would be delivered 00 / 00 / 00 between_0am - 0pm .
Package_Service	hopefully this will happen and i will have a happy birthday girl on saturday : )
Package_Service	thanks again rowan .. excellent service
Package_Service	booked a parcel for collection today .
Package_Service	contractor on site turned the collection company away .
Package_Service	i got straight onto p0g and daniel sorted my problem out in under 0 minutes via the web chat .
Package_Service	very pleased , good service !
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	still unknown_reason_why i didn ' t get my collection today , so contacted customer_service on live_chat , and i was speaking to matthew , who quickly sort it out and re - booked my collection for next_day .
Package_Service	he was very polite and apologised for no show of the courier .
Package_Service	unfortunately my parcel will be delayed and have to wait another day at home with my fingers_crossed that they will show to collect it .
Package_Service	i don ' t use courier companies outside work but i had to send a package back to a retailer .
Package_Service	i sent it from london , it was picked_up from my house and went to birmingham .
Package_Service	i booked this in on thursday_morning and this was picked_up and delivered by friday .
Package_Service	it was not that expensive and i was shocked at the service .
Package_Service	i can ' t recommend highly_enough .
Package_Service	[_name ] made sending my parcel so easy .
Package_Service	even when i got it wrong , [_name ] fixed my mistake quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	a credit to your company !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i spoke to sam , she was so helpful and friendly .
Package_Service	i couldn ' t have asked for better service .
Package_Service	she kept in touch and checked everything was okay from start to finish .

Package_Service	thank_you sammie_taylor
Package_Service	this was the best customer_service i had from any company so far and i have to deal with a lot of companies .
Package_Service	sammie was very helpful and handled my problem with ease .
Package_Service	i wish all customer agents were as helpful as sammie .
Package_Service	thank_you sammie and i hope to deal with you again .
Package_Service	kind_regards
Package_Service	robin
Package_Service	katie at parcel0go was swift and efficient .
Package_Service	very helpful in deed , highly skilled individual and a great company .
Package_Service	i just had an online conversation with brian regarding some_confusion with a parcel .
Package_Service	he was on top of things withing 0 minutes !
Package_Service	and had an initial response time of 00 seconds or even less .
Package_Service	you were a great help , thanks mate !
Package_Service	i contacted jenny for abit of help and sorted it out straight_away , many_thanks again ;-)
Package_Service	excellent website easy to use and there online help is second to none .
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	cheap and fast !
Package_Service	better_than royal_mail !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	stephanie was i great help ( thanks )
Package_Service	catherine_corless is a very kind and efficient member of your staff , i highly_recomend this service to anyone .
Package_Service	i was served by sarah_hayes , which made everything in very efficient way
Package_Service	interparcel failed to deliver our parcel to the spanish islands , and now want to charge us £_00 for the privilege !
Package_Service	watch out for their small_print , which says they are allowed to charge for returns .
Package_Service	they say the delivery address is " unregistered ", which sounds_like a poor_excuse to me - especially since they managed to deliver a slip to our customer saying the parcel had been returned .
Package_Service	final moral of the story - always include a local recipient phone number on your parcel , that way the courier has less of an excuse .
Package_Service	we ' ll certainly never use interparcel again !
Package_Service	i am an ebay buyer and had refused a parcel from a seller i purchased for as i no_longer required the item .
Package_Service	since i told the seller this i have had problems with the seller who had been telling_me that i was responsible for the liability of the parcel if it did not arrive with them or was damaged .
Package_Service	i spoke to emma through the live help and she was excellent !
Package_Service	and i have now penned a dispute against the client - very concise and clear and made me feel more confident about my predicament - thank_you !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	brilliant as always , have been using parcel0go many_times within 0 years now .
Package_Service	today again received brilliant support from sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	you are an angel
Package_Service	thank_you parcel 0 go .
Package_Service	they ' ve picked_up two laptops which i sent at a reasonable_price .
Package_Service	would highly_recommend them .
Package_Service	[_name ] was the one to help my father in his venture ( with no facebook his son is writing this review ) thank_you for a most excellent level of customer_satisfaction .
Package_Service	hi ,
Package_Service	i just wanted to thank the team at parcel0go for making parcel sending so easy .
Package_Service	i sent a parcel with them in january and had no_problems , then received emails from them with offers so i logged on to send another .
Package_Service	i was wary as i had read a few negative_reviews on facebook and other review sites so was unsure , but i took a chance as i had no_problems with my first delivery .
Package_Service	i have to say the everything was brilliant :) i had a few queries when sending my parcel and wih my account so was in contact via the live_chat a couple of times and the team ( charlie , sammie , stephanie ) were very helpful and attended to my every need .
Package_Service	it is a very simple and easy process and i would recommend parcels0go to everyone .
Package_Service	the collection was made on the scheduled day ( by city_link ) at 0pm and was delivery was made to the recipient 0pm the following_day .
Package_Service	i am very pleased and advise_anyone who reads the negative_comments to ignore them , parcel0go are 0 *****
Package_Service	kimberley x
Package_Service	after royal_mail increased their prices i have been looking for a good quality service with good pricing .
Package_Service	i decided to give transglobal express a go , the item was collected promptly and arrived in great condition the next_day .
Package_Service	i would recommend transglobal to anyone , their prices are much_better_than going direct with some of the companies which is a big plus for me .
Package_Service	i will be using them again in the future without a doubt .
Package_Service	william was prompt , helpful and helped_me with everything i asked for .
Package_Service	i ` m impressed by these great people being there always when i need the help .
Package_Service	thank_you so , so much
Package_Service	very happy , will use again
Package_Service	pucka company , i ve been using them for 0 years and not only meeting my expectations but i am over the moon , customer_service is great too , just like emma i spoke to earlier and she was brilliant .
Package_Service	thanks a million
Package_Service	i love you parcel0go specialy katie , she was superb and genius , i have been using parcel0go for more_than 0years now , no_problems at all , best rates .
Package_Service	wwwooowww
Package_Service	great service , quick replies and all sorted .
Package_Service	was helped by sarah_hayes , she was quick with the information i needed , and was very helpful in sorting the query i had with my order .
Package_Service	many_thanks !
Package_Service	their website openly advertises the difference_between next_day ( 00h ) and two day ( 00h ) consignments on their inviting website , what they don ' t tell you is that if you pay a premium for a 00h service , you shouldn ' t apparently expect a next_day delivery .
Package_Service	this company has made our business look completely unprofessional to a high value client and has tarnished our name in doing so .
Package_Service	be very careful when using this site .
Package_Service	once they ' ve taken your money , they will not be any help to you .
Package_Service	always use parcel0go , easy to use website , great service and always sort any probs very quickly and effectively .
Package_Service	i booked a delivery for my parcel using parcel0go but there was a problem for the courier in delivering the parcel as i had the incorrect address on the parcel , so i was concerned that the parcel would not be delivered so i contacted parcel0go through there online live_chat and was very surprised to find how fast there service was in dealing_with quires as jessica was very helpful and she was able to re - arrange the delivery to the correct address with in just a couple of minutes
Package_Service	had a problem with my order quickly resolved and quickly replied to messages overall excellent
Package_Service	i got my product in 0 days from london to delhi .
Package_Service	and my product was absolutly fine .
Package_Service	there was no damage .
Package_Service	this is realy time saver and cheap from other parcel companies .
Package_Service	it has been 0 years now and we have used parcels0go regular each week .
Package_Service	we can send upto 00 parcels a week with them .
Package_Service	if i need any help they are always there on live_chat like sarah who i have just spoken to , to arrange change of address .
Package_Service	with having lot of customers our selves there are one or two parcels over the years that might get damaged or lost but as soon as i give the relevant info i have always had a good offer on return .
Package_Service	i have used the drop and collect service and was happy ( until yodel took over ) now i am using hermes again and never had a failed collection or any_problems with them .
Package_Service	i would high recommend these and all these people that don ' t you must be doing something wrong .
Package_Service	again thank_you to parcels0go for a great service
Package_Service	excellent customer_service query answered by samantha in super_quick time .
Package_Service	would def use this service again
Package_Service	received excellent customer_service from sammie_taylor at parcel0go .
Package_Service	will_definitely use again , thanks :)
Package_Service	made the order for collection , realised our printer didn ' t work , contacting the company via the livehelp , and was assisted extremely quickly by jessica ( which , apparently is her real name ), who sorted everything out for us in around a minute !
Package_Service	basically they are not the ones that do the delivery , they arrange it for you !
Package_Service	they are the middle_man !
Package_Service	unfortunately they are not very good at it and they don ' t really have much control of whats_happening !
Package_Service	their customer_service is a complete nonsense !
Package_Service	the team comes across incompetent and incapable to assist particularly with international deliveries !
Package_Service	i ' m not gonna go into details but if you have a choice go for another service !
Package_Service	and never ever ever choose parcelforce to deliver anything under no circumstances !
Package_Service	[_name ] on live_chat support was very helpful .
Package_Service	i had written the wrong postcode in the collection address but was all sorted with new updated labels within 0 minutes .
Package_Service	hassle - free !
Package_Service	i use parcel 0 go all the time , their prices are very competitive and great value for money !
Package_Service	it ' s so easy to book a collection or delivery with them and they have drop_off points all over .
Package_Service	the live_chat staff are great , they help instantly if you have any_problems .
Package_Service	i recently had a problem and lizzie sorted it out for me perfectly !
Package_Service	can ' t fault them :)
Package_Service	waiting for a parcel on a 0 - 0 day delivery - a birthday_present for my son .
Package_Service	after 0 days their site said parcel was delivered but i hadn ' t received it .
Package_Service	their website has no contact number on it but i managed to track one down and phoned up .
Package_Service	they refused to give me any info " because i wasn ' t the sender " but they would " raise a query " with the courier and i might hear in 00_hours .
Package_Service	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn ' t even been collected yet , it ' s been a tracking error ".
Package_Service	what ?
Package_Service	so you would think they would rush over and collect it and express delivery it on a 00 hour service .
Package_Service	but oh no - it ' ll just be 0 - 0 days from when it gets collected .
Package_Service	seriously ?
Package_Service	what a complete_joke .
Package_Service	and why don ' t they have their number on their website ?
Package_Service	" because we ' re a web based company ."
Package_Service	no , you ' re a human_being sitting in a physical office working for a company that has a website that doesn ' t bother to give customers their phone number .
Package_Service	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
Package_Service	had a few questions about using some of the international services and emma found local information on the carrier in greece quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	because of her service i will use parcel0go .
Package_Service	this is by_far the best experience i have had from a courier when rebooking collection .
Package_Service	thank_you parcel to go and especially sammie_taylor
Package_Service	the tracking -- 0k0000000000a000 -- said my parcel was delivered .
Package_Service	i emailled them to say we hadn ' t received it .
Package_Service	they replied later the next_day saying no one was home , so the parcel was left in the shed .
Package_Service	but ( a ) we were home all day and no one buzzed the door ( b ) i checked the shed and there is no parcel in the shed .
Package_Service	not to mention , if they had put a parcel in the shed , you ' d think they ' d leave a note .
Package_Service	i ' m sure the real reason no one rang my door and that there is no parcel in my shed is because their delivery man stole it !
Package_Service	kirsty has been very helpful and understanding :)
Package_Service	very patient and detailed service .
Package_Service	takes the hassle out of moving
Package_Service	my rep was a great help dealing_with my question , & was provided a fast & prompt service regarding my questions & was able to resolve my problem instantly -
Package_Service	would recommend again in the future for ( on - line support ) :)
Package_Service	would use again but slight dificulty recieving their emails in microsoft outlook , try another browser
Package_Service	been chatting with sammie_taylor on my first transaction with these_guys and she has helped_me through step by step with the transaction .
Package_Service	excellent !
Package_Service	thanks for the help sammie !
Package_Service	just chatted with rob on parcels 0 go . com brilliant sevice .!
Package_Service	answered all my questions .!
Package_Service	great :)
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go . com for a while now and they have always been great .
Package_Service	easy site to use and give the best prices out there .
Package_Service	i had my first problem today with the site saying i needed the live help to assist me .
Package_Service	i did and thanks to the very helpful and polite catherine my order has been organised and my parcel is being picked_up later today .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	wish more customer_service people were that helpful .
Package_Service	will_continue to use parcel0go for all my courier needs .
Package_Service	daniel from parcel0go was great .
Package_Service	very nice to chat to plus quick at fixing the problems .
Package_Service	top_marks for him and parcel0go .
Package_Service	great service every time .
Package_Service	i don ' t know how this company is still in business .
Package_Service	the customer_service is non - existent .
Package_Service	we ordered a painting for my parents wedding_anniversary and use interparcel as the courier it arrived to us 0 days day with no explanation or apology we opened the packaging to find the frame and glass smashed .
Package_Service	the answer we received was that its no there problem well i ' m sorry but if i am putting my faith in your company to complete a simple_task as to delivery my parcel to me in one piece so of us quite clearly can not do their job properly .
Package_Service	ill give you a clue , its not me !!!!!!!!!!!!
Package_Service	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single_person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay_away .
Package_Service	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
Package_Service	all correspondence i have had with this company will be being sent to trading_standards and also watchdog and would suggest everyone_else do the same .
Package_Service	its about time companies like these get what they deserve .
Package_Service	this company and there dodgy third_party companies have cost me a further £_000 in repair costs not to mention £_000 on a new painting for my parents wedding_anniversary .
Package_Service	i was like i have a problem and bang in comes samantha not only did she solve my problem but she is now my new bestfriend !
Package_Service	great service and i couldn ' t think of a better way to spend my thursday_night !
Package_Service	good services !
Package_Service	tom was extremely_helpful and very professional today on 0 separate_occasions !
Package_Service	regards
Package_Service	lindsey barlow
Package_Service	really amazing service .. i use them all the time and really the best .
Package_Service	am a power seller on ebay and i ship a lot , and they are always helpful .
Package_Service	just easy transaction and delivered on time .
Package_Service	they have some good deals specially with ups .
Package_Service	will sure use again
Package_Service	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
Package_Service	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
Package_Service	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
Package_Service	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
Package_Service	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer_service lines .
Package_Service	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
Package_Service	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
Package_Service	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer_service via his customer_service line .
Package_Service	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer_service line .
Package_Service	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
Package_Service	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
Package_Service	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
Package_Service	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
Package_Service	now , let me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
Package_Service	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
Package_Service	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
Package_Service	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
Package_Service	i had spent over £_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
Package_Service	moral of the story ?
Package_Service	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd ...
Package_Service	the silver lining .
Package_Service	lauren_w of parcel0go . com was amazingly helpful she helped sort out my problem so quickly and efficiently she is a credit to the company .
Package_Service	i had a really big problem with one of the delivery companies and she sorted it out no problem and talked me through processes and answered all my questions in a professional yet friendly_manner .
Package_Service	i was in such a bad mood about all this delivery trouble i was having but now i know its been sorted out im happy again and its all thanks to lauren_w , so thank_you lauren you were wonderful
Package_Service	i needed to reschedule a collection and sammie_taylor answered my request swiftly and very politely using the online_chat interface .
Package_Service	abousuley brilliant service and very helpfull spoken to a lady catherine_corless and she was so helpfull and talked me threw it step by step .
Package_Service	will_defo be using the service again thanks again catherine xxxx
Package_Service	help assist me in what i needed straight_away , thank_you
Package_Service	just want to say how helpful your on line chat service is .
Package_Service	i had a problem with collection today and isabella helped out by re arranging my collection for tomorrow .
Package_Service	thanks again parcel0go !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	0nd review : thank_you once again sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	you were most helpful and patient in helping me out again .
Package_Service	great customer_service from sammie h at parcel0go . com
Package_Service	great service thanks
Package_Service	i went via topcashback and as a first timer for using a courier it was really straight_forward and i liked all the options available .
Package_Service	and the prices were good too !
Package_Service	my declared dimensions were correct for the entire package .
Package_Service	i can prove that my dimensions were correct for this shipment .
Package_Service	as i said in my last e mail to your customer_services i have photographic_evidence .
Package_Service	where is yours ?
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	it the 0st time iv used parcel0go and what a great service .
Package_Service	i made an error when i book my collection which was sorted fast and with know problems by there online_chat helpline .
Package_Service	the young_lady ( leanne ) was great got me sorted out in 0 minutes flat .
Package_Service	i will be using this service again in the future .
Package_Service	00 out of 00 .
Package_Service	used collectmyparcel . com a couple of times and had no_problems .
Package_Service	booked the day before and the collection has always been made on time .
Package_Service	excellent service all_round .
Package_Service	my go to company for parcel delivery .
Package_Service	had an issue with cancellation was dealt_with effectively by a fantastic member of staff " sarah " should get a pay_rise , as she did her job very satisfactory to my requirements .
Package_Service	a ***** service !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	brilliant and very fast service from sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	she was very polite , helpful and quick to source the problem and fix it for us .
Package_Service	thanks so much !
Package_Service	i could not fault her .
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go so many_times i ' ve lost_count and each and every time the customer_service i ' ve experienced has been amazing .
Package_Service	i ' ve imported items from the us , shipped ebay items around the world and sent domestic packages across the uk without any hassle whatsoever .
Package_Service	this company really know how to look after me and with updates on twitter and facebook , it ' s great to know i can get hold of someone if i have any_questions about tracking or general questions .
Package_Service	a special mention has to go to kate and george who go the extra_mile .
Package_Service	thanks guys !
Package_Service	parcel0go also run competitions which is great because i hardly_ever win anything but it at_least gives me hope .
Package_Service	i also think they ' re great value for money ( a 0 day courier which usually arrives in a day anyway for about £ 0 - brilliant !)
Package_Service	and the ease of use of their website plus google_checkout / paypal for payment is so easy even a child could do it .
Package_Service	i thoroughly and wholeheartedly_recommend parcel0go to anybody looking for a trustworthy and reliable courier agent .
Package_Service	they ' re my courier agents of choice and i won ' t be using anybody_else .
Package_Service	i must_say i am happy with the quality of the delivery .
Package_Service	however , way too expensive .
Package_Service	i spoke with emma on a live_chat , she amended my invoice immediately and emailed it to me within_seconds .
Package_Service	very helpful and very fast !
Package_Service	[_name ] gave great service with a friendly and helpful attitude
Package_Service	the service i recived from sammie_taylor was probally the most polite and helpful ive ever recived i strongly sugges a pay_rise for this lady
Package_Service	i ' ve had a few issues over the last few_days with changing addresses and cancellations and i must_say , emma and elizabeth have been absolutely amazing with their help on the live_chat .
Package_Service	i am a strong believer in good customer care and yours in second to none .
Package_Service	thank_you for all your help parcel0go . com :) without you box frame canvas_prints would not run so well
Package_Service	very helpful and polite .
Package_Service	give her the prize !
Package_Service	first and last time i ' ll use them .
Package_Service	waited in all day to collect my parcel , didn ' t turn_up .
Package_Service	you also have to wait_until 0pm at night before you can question whether anyone is actually going to come for the collection - by then it ' s too_late to make alternative_arrangements .
Package_Service	the only thing you want from a delivery company is reliability and they failed .
Package_Service	when you speak to chat representative they just offer to reschedule your collection .

Package_Service	i have found my chat with rob very helpful yesterday :) best_wishes .
Package_Service	thank_you for help .
Package_Service	parcel0go were very helpful , they entered all the information for me via the live_chat so i only had to pay for the delivery , i would definitely use them again .
Package_Service	i will never use them again .
Package_Service	they failed to collect the parcel , failed to rearrange for 0 days , would not give me my money back ( even the extra i paid for next_day delivery - which clearly didn ' t happen .)
Package_Service	on chat to customer_services for over half an_hour and still no apology .
Package_Service	awful
Package_Service	made a review earlier , had apologies and now today ' s booking hasn ' t turned_up .
Package_Service	i am not shocked , interparcel is really struggling at the moment .
Package_Service	best to go elsewhere whilst they sort themselves out .
Package_Service	was booking a parcel going to zambia for work and kept getting an error_message ,
Package_Service	i spoke to very helpful and funny lady_called cathrine who sorted out a problem via the live_chat , i had to wait a little_bit but was offered a small discount which was very nice .
Package_Service	nice to speak to someone with a personality not not just a yes / no policy robot .
Package_Service	will_definately use again .
Package_Service	what a great company , would recommend to anyone !
Package_Service	will use again !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	absolutely_brilliant .
Package_Service	polite from the start , quick to reply and very helpful .
Package_Service	first_class 00 / 00
Package_Service	the company provide an great service for a good price .
Package_Service	if you ever have a problem , they are fast and efficient in helping you , especially if you use the " live help " option .
Package_Service	however , a third_party soils their good name , that third_party is yodel .
Package_Service	yodel damaged my parcel when it was being delivered , i was forced to return the contents to the seller , he arranged collection , again , through yodel , and they failed to arrive at all !
Package_Service	the following_day , he rearranged collection with tnt and i ' ll be ...
Package_Service	they didn ' t seem to have a problem with collecting a parcel .
Package_Service	a far_superior company .
Package_Service	my live_chat with emily was fast and solved the problem in a matter of moments .
Package_Service	conclusion ; highly recomment p0g but avoid using yodel where possible .
Package_Service	i needed a collection rebooked .
Package_Service	the agent i spoke to , sammie_taylor , was very friendly and helpful and sorted my issue out within_seconds .
Package_Service	wonderful service .
Package_Service	will_definitely be using again .
Package_Service	thanks sammie !
Package_Service	i always use these_guys , and very rarely have any_issues .

Package_Service	sarah_hayes was fantasic x
Package_Service	i entered my email address incorrectly and emma found the invoice .
Package_Service	thank_you so much !
Package_Service	i needed a quick response from parcel0go and that ' s exactly_what i got .
Package_Service	sam , who i spoke to , was polite and really helpful .
Package_Service	quick contact and provided the best support possible .
Package_Service	also put up with my confusion !
Package_Service	would definitely_recommend - a great service .
Package_Service	parcel sent to a wrong destination now it stuck in the custom can ' t move forward or go back .... now from 00th_december 00 these are the replies i receive when ever i ask ...
Package_Service	...................................................................
Package_Service	i am_currently awaiting some more information from the courier , unfortunately until i get this response i cannot advise any further .
Package_Service	.............................................................................
Package_Service	i am chasing this with ups xxxxxxx , and will revert to you as soon as i possibly can
Package_Service	..............................................................................
Package_Service	please_accept my apologies for the delay in my getting back to you .
Package_Service	ups have advised that it is currently with customs , and have not yet responded to my escalation emails .
Package_Service	................................................................................................
Package_Service	as soon as i have any information i will let you know .
Package_Service	.................................................................
Package_Service	when you made the original booking , you were given a selection of couriers .
Package_Service	on this occasion you selected ups , during the booking process , you agree that customs_charges may apply if a shipment is being sent outside the eu .
Package_Service	customs_charges can include duties , taxes , brokerage fees and disbursement fees .
Package_Service	all of these are beyond our control .
Package_Service	we do recommend contacting customs before shipping to check any charges which may be payable .
Package_Service	............................................................................
Package_Service	don ' t you have any better reply other than as soon as ..... and since 00th_december no update or direction i have received ....
Package_Service	transglobal depend on successful rate but are not prepared for a complex case which is the worst thing for a company ... a small issue can not be solved and it takes months ......
Package_Service	this is the third time i ship with ups and getting the same trouble .
Package_Service	imagine you are sending a parcel to london and ups delivered your parcel to scotland and then the ups broker gives you 0 options ( scotland and englan is u . k )
Package_Service	( 0 ) it is an international parcel so you can either come to scotland pay documents hand over fees and clear the parcel yourself or
Package_Service	( 0 ) pay a broker fees equivalent twice of monthly wage and we have no_idea of import and tax duty so wait but there is no time_frame as soon as we clear the parcel we will deliver it to you ...
Package_Service	how would you feel ?
Package_Service	remember this information is received after a week the parcel has arrived in transit not main destination and nor this information prior the booking , and when you complain you are told that we do not have any influence in custom or ups in your country so a receiver should contact ups local ...
Package_Service	sending the parcel back to a sender you are told to pay more_than sending cost
Package_Service	terrible for a parcel which cost less_than 00 pound to pay 00 x for only agency fee ....
Package_Service	fantastic help from richard_mileham
Package_Service	i use parcel0go as they help me deliver cycle parts to my customers on time and profitably , while still offering very good prices .
Package_Service	i have decided to top up the full_amount and keep the account ...
Package_Service	thanks to [_name ], one of the best advisors there , and fellew cyclist in exceeding expectations in customer_service at p0g and helping cyclesorted grow !
Package_Service	[_external reference_] <<<< cycle sorted ... cheers [_name ] p
Package_Service	was let_down by a rival company so tried these .
Package_Service	couldn ' t have gone smoother .
Package_Service	they even text me the minute my parcel was delivered .
Package_Service	spoke with richard_mileham who was extremely_helpful and helped be perfectly with my query .
Package_Service	was having trouble booking my parcel , up popped emma and she booked the whole_thing for me .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	will_definitely use again .
Package_Service	thank - you sammie_taylor for all your help , it was an easy and smooth process thank - you
Package_Service	i had never used this service before and had to use the live_chat option .
Package_Service	the girl that helped_me ( sarah_hayes ) was very pleasant and quick in responding to my queries !
Package_Service	parcel0go offer a good range of courier services , meaning you can chose economy or speed or something in the middle .
Package_Service	the website is easy to use to process orders .
Package_Service	their customer_service is great - always prompt answers to queries and any_issues quickly solved .
Package_Service	recommended for any courier needs .
Package_Service	sam was very helpful , as always , in an issue with printing labels .
Package_Service	their facebook_page is a great way to contact them .
Package_Service	i ' ve used interparcel many_times and never had a problem .
Package_Service	i always use parcelforce as the courier and never had a problem there either .
Package_Service	the website is easy to navigate , and the customer_service when you do need to call them is very efficient and helpful .
Package_Service	i will use them everytime i need to send items bigger than what royal_mail allows .
Package_Service	had problems with labels when printing order , assistant paul was extremely_helpful emailed me the labels within few mins - no_problems , great service !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	a terrible company to choose ,
Package_Service	i paid for next_day delivery , which had my dad ' s gift for his_birthday in it .
Package_Service	it sould have arrived as stated the next_day ...
Package_Service	it came in the evening 0 days_later ..
Package_Service	when i contacted the company 0 times they didnt bother to reply , thank_god for paypal !
Package_Service	who tried to contact them but were unable to and had got my money back !
Package_Service	if only people listened to the bad_reviews this company would be longer running , i used beginning of the year when my parcel never arrived i was told the label had probably come off , with lots of rude messages from an ebay buyer i refunded fully , it took another 0 weeks of constant emails to get refunded and that wasn ' t even in full even_though i had paid more to cover it , so last wed i thought i would give them another try and again low and behold my parcel has gone wallows again .... was collected so the tracking says and that ' s it .......
Package_Service	they don ' t know where my parcel is and got same response " the label may have come off " that label was stuck to that package the only way it could come off if it was cut with scissors !!
Package_Service	( because of them saying this last time ) something fishy going on here for 0 high priced covered parcels to go missing ....
Package_Service	even_though i am covered i bet again i don ' t get a full_refund and i will have another unhappy ebay member .... if you have any sense you will read all the negative_reviews and book with someone_else .
Package_Service	i gave them the benefit of the doubt and i am going to be out of pocket again :( worst service ever
Package_Service	[_name ] not only answered my question quickly , clearly and helpfully , but she also took care of my follow_up question before i even needed to ask !
Package_Service	one of the best customer_service interactions i ' ve ever had - this is the quality service that keeps me coming_back to parcel0go time and time again !
Package_Service	=) thanks so much [_name ], i hope our paths cross again !
Package_Service	excellent service .
Package_Service	the live help operator who dealt_with my query ( daniel ) was most helpful and professional .

Package_Service	i sent a glass hob via them , and it was smashed in transit .
Package_Service	parcels0go said it had been returned to them , so i didnt need to send photos of the damage , as they had the item .
Package_Service	0 weeks_later without compensation , they then sent the item back , and demanded i sent images of the damage !
Package_Service	what a joke !
Package_Service	they then offered £_00 compensation for a £_000 item !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	use someone who actually care about the customer !
Package_Service	i talked with jessica in the live_chat and she was very helpful .

Package_Service	every destination has been quick and affordable !
Package_Service	make_sure you read the " important information & restrictions " which is on the same page as the weight / dimensions and check the area you are sending .... as some areas may have a remote surcharge ?
Package_Service	was recommended to parcel0go by a buyer on ebay as was limited to buyer collect only for larger items .
Package_Service	parcel0go has allowed me to extend my delivery options to the whole of the uk .
Package_Service	their website is very easy to get quotes for and will tie all your orders together if you use the same email address and do not create an account at first , as i did .
Package_Service	there prices are competative and allow you to goes from a wide_range of dispatch methods varying on speed and cost .
Package_Service	i have only had one issue which related to not being_able to edit my registered email address , but their livechat service is very good and helpful .
Package_Service	i was assisted by craig who ' s messages came_across friendly and polite , which is not an easy task when only using text based communication .
Package_Service	as services go , parcel0go is very useful and from my experience , they have the back - up customer support to go with it .
Package_Service	i always get good online help from parcel0go !
Package_Service	i have sent a lot of parcels with parcel 0 go for pleasure and business and always find the service to be brilliant .
Package_Service	they are always , fast at responding and efficient .
Package_Service	a recent issue i had catherine sorted for me and was brilliant , if everybody was like her the world would be a better place .
Package_Service	i have no_problems in recommending parcel 0 go to anybody looking for a courier .
Package_Service	i would reccomend p0g to anyone , they are easy to use , friendly , and very helpful if you need it .
Package_Service	they even come to your door to collect your parcel , so you don ' t even need to go anywhere !
Package_Service	i had a collection scheduled but didn ' t manage to print the label in time , " no_worries , i ' ll come get it tomorrow " the driver reassured me .
Package_Service	i think we should be on first name basis now , it ' s always the same driver who collects from me !
Package_Service	however , when i ' d gotten upstairs i realised ...
Package_Service	i ' m moving_house at 0am tomorrow , and i have no_idea how i forgot !
Package_Service	i quickly got onto the website and logged in to get my p0g delivery number .
Package_Service	i used the contact page to use the live_chat option .
Package_Service	i was connected immediately to a friendly helper named lauren , i asked her if it was possible to reschedule the collection , but at my new address .
Package_Service	she checked if it was possible , and quickly came back to say yes , and if she rescheduled it for friday , would i get access to a printer in time , on confirming , she sorted it all out for me , sent me the emails through and wished me luck in my move !
Package_Service	a very friendly and painless service .
Package_Service	good job , p0g !

Package_Service	i have booked the collection / delivery by parcel0go .
Package_Service	i called to ask when would be the collection time as i need to go out on the day just for an_hour .
Package_Service	i was hoping that the call_centre agent would be able to tell me what sort of time ( morning or afternoon ) so that i can pop out before / or after the collection .
Package_Service	unfortunately , the answer i got was the time_slot given was 0am to 0pm , which means that i have to wait in all day .
Package_Service	when i call to cancel , the agent said she was processing the cancellation , but when i checked on the website , it still depicted that the collection had been processed and myhermes agent would come and collect the parcel .
Package_Service	this means that nothing has been done to cancel the order . the agent on the live_chat was quite rude , too .
Package_Service	very frustrating !
Package_Service	when i went there website for first time , i got a great response from their chat system .
Package_Service	best greetings by emma , too good to be true !
Package_Service	so , i ordered a delivery to deliver from my shop to my customer .
Package_Service	it ' s already 0th days & they didn ' t show up to collect my delivery box .
Package_Service	how lucky i am .
Package_Service	yup i am lucky , because if they are this late to only collect , then how can i trust to deliver my product on right time ?
Package_Service	collect when they say they will every time and i have never had anything ' go missing ' like other carriers .
Package_Service	after booking the services required i tried printing off the labels .
Package_Service	i had trouble because my printer died to put it simply lol .
Package_Service	after getting home i asked [_name ] ( not me lol ) if he could refund me the full_amount .
Package_Service	it was done without any trouble and we had a little laugh afterwards as well
Package_Service	spoke to a guy_named sam regarding a parcel that was sent with parcel0go . com .
Package_Service	he was very friendly , helpful , and straightforward .
Package_Service	need more customer_service like this !
Package_Service	0_stars .
Package_Service	i ' ve been very pleased with my overall experience with parcel0go so far - i was desperate to ship my christmas_presents back to france , and this is by_far the cheapest option .
Package_Service	also , i did a mistake whilst registering my order , and my chat assistant , sam , was incredibly rapid and efficient ; he fixed my mistake in no time while answering my questions .
Package_Service	keep the good work up , guys !
Package_Service	jeg_bestilte_en_pakke med hjælp fra shopusa og_det hele gik fint , indtil de sendte pakken fra deres terminal .. pakken er nu væk på 0 uge og efter 0 - 0 mails hører jeg_ikke fra dem , og kan_ikke få fat på dem på hverken mail eller telefon .
Package_Service	kan absolut ikke anbefale shopusa til nogen , for der_er ingen hjælp hvis din pakke bliver væk , så lader de som ingenting .
Package_Service	went on the website to purchase a parcel , decided to use the live_chat to get some information , and i spoke to katie , who was very helpful and efficient !
Package_Service	i would really recommend the website and the live support , and for katie ' s service i ' m sure she should get an award !
Package_Service	she was very polite and responded well to all the queries i had about the website , thank_you katie !
Package_Service	[_name ] is very patient
Package_Service	i am in a state of utter stress because of my move at the moment !
Package_Service	i had an urgent query , that seemed a hopeless case to me , but i thought i ' d try the live_chat help anyway .
Package_Service	and bang , a lovely person called gemma was there , immediately cheering me up by being really friendly and putting smileys etc !!
Package_Service	and what i thought was a hopeless request , was transformed into something that might actually work out now by her as well !!
Package_Service	top_marks for gemma !!
Package_Service	efficient , quick , helpful , friendly , positive !!
Package_Service	really refreshing to have a person that ' s working in customer_services who seems to actually enjoy her job for once !!
Package_Service	:))
Package_Service	thanks gemma , and i am praying for everything to work out at my pickup tomorrow !
Package_Service	let ' s hope , your great help helped !!
Package_Service	;))
Package_Service	used this website to send some boxes from the uk to ireland recently , after several astronomical quotes elsewhere i decided to chance these_guys , i ' m_glad i did .
Package_Service	i would thoroughly_recommend using this service , the pickups were all on time and friendly , the delivery was accurate and extremely quick and the whole service was very reasonably_priced and easy to use .
Package_Service	this company is a disgrace to all parcel companies .
Package_Service	they claim to do unbelieveable high tech deliveries but when it comes to basic common_sense they have none .
Package_Service	stupid drivers and even stupider depot managers who are a waste of space .
Package_Service	do not use u have been warned !!
Package_Service	i did not have this luxury
Package_Service	i locked myself out of my account and used their live_chat to speak to daniel , one of the customer_services representatives at parcel0go .
Package_Service	the chat was very friendly and he managed to fix my log in immediately .
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	brilliant help , when yodel yet again failed .
Package_Service	i had never used the service before .
Package_Service	i found the person i dealt_with , andrea to be very helpful .
Package_Service	won ' t hesitate to use the service again or to recommend it to others !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	spoke woth natalie on livechat as i booked a parcel , then realised i had to go out .
Package_Service	natalie was wonderful and told me i could rebook or if i felt it was safe enough along with other t &_c ' s , i could leave it in my porch for the dfriver to collect .
Package_Service	thank_you natalie :-)
Package_Service	the box here says ' write as if you are talking to a friend ', well after talking to jenny , i can safely_say i have made a true friend .
Package_Service	someone who is willing to go out of their way to help me with my problem .
Package_Service	then once she has found the solution to my problem , continues to help me though the entire_process , to make it as easy as possible for me to change some date ect .
Package_Service	she is a star , i think the sky will be a little darker tonight now she has fallen and is amongst us mere mortals .
Package_Service	hopefully one day i will have problems with my package again , and she will not hesitate to help me out with clean boxes and put a smile on my face .
Package_Service	give jenny a promotion , heck , give her your job mr manger who reviews employee reviews !
Package_Service	shame there is no 0_stars option .
Package_Service	go jenny !
Package_Service	another top quality service from p0g - i use these_guys on a regular_basis for sending parcels abroad and have had nothing but top quality service .
Package_Service	even when the website acts a little screwy the instant chat / help function is there to help .
Package_Service	- a big thanks to catherine who helped_me book a parcel to ireland when the website wouldn ' t ;¬)
Package_Service	i sent a parcel to america , the delivery slot was 0 am until 0 pm and they were at the doorstep for 0 am !
Package_Service	the delivery guy was very helpful , i was able to track the parcel right through to delivery when i received an_email telling_me it had been delivered .
Package_Service	the very next_day as well !
Package_Service	the process all the way through from using the website to being told the parcel was delved was faultless !
Package_Service	and the cheapest around !
Package_Service	would not hesitate to use parcel_hero again , amazing service .
Package_Service	nicole was amazing from the moment we started our live_chat !
Package_Service	she found the soultion to my problem quickly and changed my order without any_problems !
Package_Service	she was very polite and i felt completly at ease talking to her !
Package_Service	i was skeptical when i realised it was only a live_chat , but this has completly changed my mind .
Package_Service	thank_you nicole your cutsomer service was fantastic !

Package_Service	had a problem using the label i had to print and contacted parcel0go using the chat_function .
Package_Service	they replied and advised me instantly and rob the advisor sorted out my problem perfectly and was quick , polite and very helpful .
Package_Service	could not reccommend the service i received any better_than 000_% perfect .
Package_Service	plus good value for money and excellent company .
Package_Service	super !
Package_Service	adviser ' katie ' was very helpful :)
Package_Service	great on - line help from sarah_hayes at parcels to go , she dealt_with the problems i was having booking my collection quickly and efficiently .

Package_Service	stay_away i wouldn ' t wish this company on my enemies !
Package_Service	0 star is 0_stars too many
Package_Service	i think she should be promoted , or given a large pay_rise as she helped my business out hugely today
Package_Service	fantastic service ,
Package_Service	hi , i typed to catherine on the livechat feature on the website and she was very helpful and answered my question very quickly .
Package_Service	cheers catherine :)
Package_Service	had an issue all of my own doing and the help livechat assistant , richard_mileham , was so helpful , sorted my issue promptly , politely and with great ease .
Package_Service	yet more great service from parcel0go . com
Package_Service	i ordered a few items on wednesday 00th_june_0000 and paid for next_day delivery .
Package_Service	i was kept_informed_throughout whole_process , my order was delivered on thursday 00th_june_0000 at around 0am , by a lovely delivery driver .
Package_Service	i was given options brought text and email to rearrange my delivery if needed too !
Package_Service	so much_better_than other_companies i have used in past few_days !
Package_Service	will_definitely use again !
Package_Service	thank_you for your excellent service !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go a few_times now and have never been disappointed .
Package_Service	the service is always as committed and the customer support is first_class .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor is a star and never_fails to deliver :-)
Package_Service	most companies these days when you encounter a problem keep you waiting on the end of a phone line and nothing is ever resolved in your favour .
Package_Service	this has never been my experience with ' parcel 0 go ' they have always been most helpful even when the problem is of my own creation , they are also very quick to resolve issues .
Package_Service	i was drawn to them at first by their reasonable prices , but i have stuck with them for the service .
Package_Service	i would recommend them to any small business person such as myself .
Package_Service	i started the live_chat as i was unaware of the whereabouts of my parcel regardless of the parcel tracker .
Package_Service	emma assisted me and i was able to determine when my parcel would be delivered to me .
Package_Service	thanks emma :) merry xmas
Package_Service	interparcel are the ' middle - men ' agents between couriers and customers .
Package_Service	i dispatch all my sales through interparcel - they are cheap and cheerful !
Package_Service	all my collections have been picked_up when stated ( except when it was snowing - the customer_service team were outstanding at re - arranging collection with a different courier at no extra charge !)
Package_Service	and i have never had any reason to complain .
Package_Service	delivery status is visible at the click of a button and i can provide my customers with a link too !
Package_Service	personal use , again no issues what - so - ever !
Package_Service	thoroughly_recommend them for price , service and helpful ' ness !
Package_Service	first things first , parcel0go acts as a ' middle - man ' agent between the courier companies and the customer .
Package_Service	because they give so much business to the courier companies , they get bulk discounts !
Package_Service	unfortunately , parcel0go is giving honest couriers a bad name !
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go on two occasions , first time the parcel collection failed , twice .
Package_Service	hdnl were apparently instructed to collect on 00th_jan but the delivery driver had paperwork that suggested otherwise .
Package_Service	second time i had a time - dependant package to send !
Package_Service	the parcel was not collected so i cancelled the order only to find out that the 0 % surcharge on paypal payments is apparently non - refundable .
Package_Service	they do not state anywhere that this surcharge is non - refundable - so after arguing with a belligerent customer support agent ( who i later found out was a senior_manager and owner ...) for twenty minutes and threatening various actions they finally_agreed to refund my money i was rightfully owed !
Package_Service	finally , their only form of contact is via_email or on - line chat .
Package_Service	the on - line chat takes_forever to get connected to a person ( average 00_mins )!
Package_Service	this company is run by a bunch of crooks and hopefully they will go out of business very soon and save a lot of people , a lot of hassle !
Package_Service	had a quick query to do with an order i was in the process of making , and had a fully professional and prompt response to the query from the agent i spoke to ( samantha ).
Package_Service	highly_recommended
Package_Service	many_thanks for your help with sorting the delivery of our parcel .
Package_Service	any_problems we will be contacting sammy_taylor at parcels to go
Package_Service	i would recommend anyone to try collect_plus more affordable way to deliver items and more efficient than royal_mail .
Package_Service	i used parcel0go to find the best option to send a parcel to germany for christmas .
Package_Service	i had a question about one service which was quickly and sufficiently answered by the very lovely becky .
Package_Service	nice service , not too formal and i received the answer i needed .
Package_Service	i had a problem with an order but , sarah_hayes quickly came to my rescue .
Package_Service	all sorted thanks sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	as always , this company is leaving to our ( consumer ) expectation .
Package_Service	i ' ll surely continue to use parcel0go .
Package_Service	once again thanks sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	regards
Package_Service	i would like to say thanks to andrea on live_chat for amending some details on my order .
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	i made a mistake filling out information for a parcel i am sending to usa .
Package_Service	i jumped onto the help chat , and catherine_corless , came to my crying call .
Package_Service	she was friendly and clear with her help , and managed to reassure me that the parcel would get through customs fine .
Package_Service	with it being the first time i have sent a parcel to usa .
Package_Service	i really_appreciated how personable she was .
Package_Service	taking real interest in assisting me .
Package_Service	highly_recommended , and a high five for her friendliness .
Package_Service	it ' s something that should be valued much higher in businesses :-)
Package_Service	always good prices , will use again .
Package_Service	many_thanks :-)
Package_Service	i have never_experienced any major problems when using the p0g service either nationally or internationally .
Package_Service	i had a small blip this morning , when i could not see or access a customers order for the paperwork i needed .
Package_Service	after about 0 minutes with a very pleasant operator named ashley t , i had the paperwork emailed to me and the order was ready for dispatch .
Package_Service	thank_you ashley for a quick , easy and pleasant resolution to my problem
Package_Service	finish my problem . thanks a lot !
Package_Service	i was stuck in a pickle - i made mess of weight and only realised after purchase ...
Package_Service	p0g was there for me as usual , with an amazing price , charlie fixed my error and it was only 00p more - despite being a kilo and a half out !
Package_Service	and kept the same delivery slot , despite being well after hours ...
Package_Service	i mean , seriously .
Package_Service	time and again , p0g have been just brilliant , whether delivering or collecting .
Package_Service	i can ' t honestly recommend them enough .
Package_Service	that ' s why i keep_coming_back .
Package_Service	and now they have a mobile_app !
Package_Service	who knew ?
Package_Service	with parcels 0 go you can send your packages efficiently and at good value .
Package_Service	and more_importantly if you need help with the service ( or anything_else life style wise ) their team is there to help .
Package_Service	emma saved the day .
Package_Service	excellent all_round service by daniel :)
Package_Service	have now been waiting 0 months for my claim cheque for good which the courier damaged , have contacted parcels 0 go 0 times now and get told the same_thing " no problem the cheque is on its way i will make_sure the claims team contact you " still nothing .
Package_Service	they are useless do not use .
Package_Service	take your parcels to the post_office .
Package_Service	do not use do not us do not us utterly hopeless time after time .
Package_Service	well , predictably i suppose , yodel failed to show up today .
Package_Service	the collection was booked in and presumed to be all fine , but yodel being yodel had other ideas .
Package_Service	just used the parcel0go live_chat_function for the first time , very helpful and quick and efficient customer_service from lizzie , which is far more_than can be said for yodel ' s customer_service !
Package_Service	hopefully i won ' t need to use the live_chat_function again , but if i do i ' ll be confident and happy to do so !
Package_Service	top work parcel0go !
Package_Service	was given help from daniel with a problem i had with a booking .
Package_Service	very fast and friendly .
Package_Service	if only all customer_services could be this helpful !
Package_Service	many_thanks .
Package_Service	had an issue with parcel being collected on wrong day courier went to collect !
Package_Service	thought i would have to pay again but ( emma ) sorted it at no cost !
Package_Service	brilliant thank_you
Package_Service	live_chat is always instant and helpful .
Package_Service	prices are competitive and 00_% of the time cheapest .
Package_Service	it gets a 00 from len .
Package_Service	and a 00 from me .
Package_Service	all perfect , as it should be , nice and simple
Package_Service	i have been using fedex for years and never had any_problems .
Package_Service	i send parcels in australia and france , they are fast and always on time to collect and deliver .
Package_Service	i have used several companies but they are the best !
Package_Service	the online tracking is good as well .
Package_Service	great courier that i would recommand to anyone who wish to send a parcel abroad .
Package_Service	i needed help with a lot of different questions including price for sending a parcel , how it works with dropping off / delivering etcetera and i got very good help from stephanie at the chat !
Package_Service	i also spoke to andrea on the chat service whilst going through the process as i was using them for the first time , she was very helpful and guided me through the whole_process .
Package_Service	the total cost was an astonishing £ 0 . 00 cheaper then what royal_mail wanted to charge for a package worth only £_00 . 00 !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	will_definatley use this service again .
Package_Service	emma was a great help , couldnt have done it without her !
Package_Service	samantha has been amazing , i have been trying to book a courier to brazil for days !
Package_Service	one agent couldn ' t help me yesterday , samantha talked me through each_step , she has easily been the best agent i have spoken to on here , it now makes my decision clear !!
Package_Service	i will always use parcel0go for all my couriers just because of samantha !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	sammie_taylor - great quick advice and help
Package_Service	i had a few questions about parcel delivery prices .
Package_Service	i used livechat service and was connected to jessica .
Package_Service	she was very polite and patient .
Package_Service	jessica answered on all my questions with every detail i needed .
Package_Service	having such a great service i am sure that i will place an order soon .
Package_Service	william - representative has been absolutely amazing , and mega helpful especially that a person before him ignored me and disconnected .
Package_Service	very attentive , friendly and served me great advice .
Package_Service	well_done william .
Package_Service	thank_you for the excellent help and advise this evening - fantastic representative and went the extra_mile
Package_Service	this is the first time i have used this company and rest_assured this will be the last !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	and i ' d ask people to seriously think_twice before using them .
Package_Service	this company has a total disregard for any packages that have been placed under their care especially the ones clearly_marked with fragile and do not bend .
Package_Service	is it about time these types of companies and the courier they use were investigated to see how our valuable packages are actually handled ?
Package_Service	how many_times have you had a package delivered and it ' s been damaged , lost or stolen ?
Package_Service	as for compensation , think again , they ' ll try and wriggle out of any such claim .
Package_Service	i think investigations into these companies are long over due .
Package_Service	just had a chat with sammie_taylor who was ever so helpful !!
Package_Service	thanks a lot
Package_Service	great service until you don ' t meet the minimum_spend criteria as an account holder .
Package_Service	we were penalised around £_000 in one invoice .
Package_Service	great service for receiving and sending parcels but avoid_avoid_avoid setting_up a business account unless you are absolutely certain you will meet the minimum_spend criteria !
Package_Service	brilliant , speedy response and the super helpful emma is a star !
Package_Service	thank_you .
Package_Service	annie

Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	i run a couple of online stores and have always found couriers were just too expensive to use , despite the better servive they provide compared to royal_mail ( sorry royal_mail !).
Package_Service	a friend introduced me to this site and i thought it was too good to be true !
Package_Service	a dog bed that would have cost me between £_00 & £_00 to send on a 00 hour cost under £_00 for 00 hour service .
Package_Service	site was easy to use , very customer friendly and i will_definitely use again for business and personal use and have already_recommended parcel0go to several friends and customers !
Package_Service	keep up the good work !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	~ great company to use , helpful and easy to talk to if you have a problem and always handle claims respectfully and easily , deliveries are handled quickly and easily and there are many drop_off points so really convenient if you cant_wait in all day .
Package_Service	had a problem today and spoke to [_name ] who was very helpful and friendly !
Package_Service	highly_recommended !
Package_Service	i had a slight_issue with a parcel not being collected on monday , which was the fault of the courier company , not p0g ( remember that these_guys are facilitators and not courier ' s themselves ).
Package_Service	however , i used their online_chat tool to speak with george in customer_services and i have to say that i was thoroughly pleased with the service i have received .
Package_Service	george was extremely_helpful and rearranged collection immediately , reissued collection notes and uprated the delivery service to ensure my parcel still arrived on time .
Package_Service	parcel was collected today .
Package_Service	great service and will_definitely be using again - especially with their facebook discount_code !
Package_Service	parcel0go save a fortune posting anything over 0kg - and they collect from your door
Package_Service	have good xmas
Package_Service	sammie was very professional .
Package_Service	made reference to my name during the conversation and was also very very helpful .
Package_Service	great .
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	cut a long_story short : needed to send a package to the us .
Package_Service	went to the local post_office and they asked for silly money .

Package_Service	thank_you

Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go now several_times and will_continue to use them in the future , it ' s a fantastic service and the prices are extremely reasonable .
Package_Service	you get to pick the courier you wish to deliver the parcel and some can just be taken to local drop_off points so it saves waiting it all day for someone come collect it .
Package_Service	i ' ve also now used the live_chat as i made a mistake with the post code , [_name ] sorted this instantly and new labels were emailed to me within 0 minutes !!!
Package_Service	faultless service with a very polite attitude .

Package_Service	this is the first time i have used anything like this website .

Package_Service	quick , easy and simple to use the website and great delivery service - i would highly_recommend !
Package_Service	great prices and really easy to use - would definitely_recommend .
Package_Service	samantha was an excellent help to me today , she was swift and patient and offered me several options to resolve the problem i had

Package_Service	i use parcel to go on a regular_basis and never have any_problems with them , if there is a problem they always sort it out !

Package_Service	not only did parcel0go . com beat the competition in terms of value , but paul helped_me when i panicked and made sure i had everything i needed .
Package_Service	great service , excellent customer_service .
Package_Service	i ' ve had great service now , for over 00 parcels .
Package_Service	nothing has gone wrong , and now 0 of them have arrived the day after sending .
Package_Service	one even on a saturday .
Package_Service	to get that sort of service i would have had to pay just under £_00 from another courier .
Package_Service	it ' s a nice easy way to send a parcel , especially without the hassle of the long queue at the post_office .
Package_Service	my service didn ' t come on the dates it was due , i decided to get onto the team at parcel0go and spoke to an extremely_helpful member of the team ' ashley ' in about 0 minutes my service was rebooked free of charge quickly and easily .
Package_Service	im extremely happy with this service and ill continue to use over and over , also thank_you ashley , fantastic member of the team .

Package_Service	then to top it all off there isnt a telephone_number to call , just a typing service !
Package_Service	arghh !

Package_Service	superb service and very helpful staff ( samantha )

Package_Service	just wanted to cancel an order as i got muddled up who was taking what .
Package_Service	caught them on shift change over , but was handed very well .
Package_Service	i forget the first girls name , but rose and her colleague sorted my problem and fully answered all my questions .
Package_Service	nice to deal with a uk_based company that actually understands day to day problems and can answer any question in a quick and professional_manner .
Package_Service	being_able to have a chat and not feel pressured makes a pleasant change , keep up the good work !!
Package_Service	!

Package_Service	:-)
Package_Service	had a small problem with the website when booking my parcel but the handy work of the live assitant was amzing and helpful and got my parcel booked in today !!!!!!!!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	thank_you daniel from e . c . c .
Package_Service	superb prices , brilliant customer_service ..
Package_Service	simple , easy website ..
Package_Service	spoken to katie today as i had trouble loging in and she had sorted everything out in no time !
Package_Service	well_done and thank_you parcel0go !
Package_Service	x
Package_Service	am i dreaming ?
Package_Service	or do we still have organisations like parcel0go with great customer_service ?
Package_Service	maybe i was just lucky to have catherine serve me .
Package_Service	very impressed , quick , affordable and very organised .
Package_Service	this websites customer support and live help is the most easiest iv seen online .
Package_Service	things which take forever with other huge organization are done within_seconds via the online_chat .
Package_Service	things like full refunds due to bookings made by mistake , or re bookings of existing collections .
Package_Service	i feel absolute trust with this company , they have always resolved the countless issues that occur in the shipping business we operate in .
Package_Service	will_continue to be my first choice for shipping .
Package_Service	parcel0go are a terrible company to deal with that clearly have no regard for their customers or the service that they provide .
Package_Service	they failed to collect the parcel on the scheduled date , then when i took it to the depot the member of staff that i spoke to said that they were closed and they couldn ' t let me drop_off the parcel despite it already being paid for ...
Package_Service	when i took the parcel back and the depot finally accepted it , i was surprised to find that it didn ' t even show up as having been received at the depot and scanned on the tracking for 0 whole days , which was particularly disappointing given that i had paid for a 00 hour delivery service !
Package_Service	the parcel was eventually delivered to the recipient 0 days_later .
Package_Service	when i complained to parcel0go about their unacceptable performance , i was told that the terms and conditions state that this service was not guaranteed and so they didn ' t care .
Package_Service	i challenged that i was looking at the terms and conditions and that was simply not the case , however the representative simply kept stating that they do not offer a guaranteed service and that this is in their terms and conditions .
Package_Service	after such appalling service , i would never use parcel0go again .
Package_Service	i have previously had similarly poor experience with them deliberately delaying sending forms for an insurance claim in order to prevent a claim being made before the time limit .
Package_Service	with parcel0go , poor customer_service seems to come as standard .
Package_Service	thanks very much for your help paul
Package_Service	i use parcel0go alot , have done for about 0 years now and they have always been wonderful !
Package_Service	lots of choice , discount_codes , fab service and a company you can trust !
Package_Service	most packages arrive on time if not early and safe .
Package_Service	i have found out today that a package has been lost by the courier , parcel0go sorted this in just 00_mins !!!
Package_Service	i used live_chat to ask where the item was and was told it looked like it was misplaced and given a link to a form to fill , i filled and sent this back online instantly and was offered a refund moments later to the value of the goods plus the postage .
Package_Service	very very happy with the fast effective service and will_continue to use !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i was able to take my parcel to a shop near work and drop it off .
Package_Service	the company received it in good time without any hitches or problems .
Package_Service	it was also the cheapest option for me .
Package_Service	would use them again .
Package_Service	today i was making some work enquirers to parcel0go via the web chat .
Package_Service	i was chatting to [_name ]
Package_Service	[_name ] was great and helpful .
Package_Service	i think she may be the one !
Package_Service	i ' m in love with her ....
Package_Service	love you [_name ]!
Package_Service	xx

Package_Service	people usually leave reviews when they ' re angry and want to vent .
Package_Service	in my case , i ' m doing none of those .
Package_Service	i ' m just here to share my impression .
Package_Service	i sent a laptop from belfast to a friend in croydon .
Package_Service	packed it up nicely and securely enough to hopefully make the journey in one piece .
Package_Service	selected the store to which i wanted it to be sent and popped_into the nearest centra to send it .
Package_Service	with the £_000 insurance and signature , i paid a few_pence over £_00 .
Package_Service	given that it was a valuable item , i didn ' t mind .
Package_Service	however what i did mind and still do , is the lack of information on the website regarding the time - frame related to shop - to - shop deliveries .
Package_Service	given the high price i was almost certain it would be a 0 day delivery , however there is no way to confirm that .
Package_Service	ergo , not the best on - line experience .
Package_Service	continuing on that thought , the tracking is weird .
Package_Service	things that happen for example at 0 in the morning , showed up in my tracking history after 0 hours ...
Package_Service	anyhow , parcel got there on thursday which makes this a 0 day delivery in the holiday season and from northern_ireland which is actually better_than royal_mail ' s delivery times ( my 0 day deliveries from amazon show up after 0 days ) at this time of the year .
Package_Service	the final note comes from my friend and it is regarding the picking_up process .
Package_Service	it sounds a lot like the service you get from western_union in their shops all around the uk .
Package_Service	they just don ' t seem to like you bothering them with parcels .
Package_Service	to use my friend ' s words " they were borderline rude ".
Package_Service	in any case , laptop is intact , and in working order which makes this delivery a success .
Package_Service	might use collect_+ again , but i am not necessarily impressed .
Package_Service	andrea was very helpfull and explain everthink with no time , thank_you
Package_Service	price is not comptetive .
Package_Service	can do the same service direct from direct companies and insurance cost is cheaper .
Package_Service	£_00 charging for £_000 insurance and when use same service without parcel0go charging only £ 0 , what a cheating .
Package_Service	parcel0go is full bad service .
Package_Service	got the brand_new item in factory sealed box as damaged on same area in different parcel .
Package_Service	both have same type of damage .
Package_Service	parcel0go refuse to give money back for damage .
Package_Service	never use again .
Package_Service	also another parcel delivered wrong person and not willing to say its them mistake ., so total loss is £_000 from me .
Package_Service	dont recomment .
Package_Service	also if they give refund , they want to put in them account .
Package_Service	infact , cant use that money for my purpose as still keeping in parcel0go account .
Package_Service	total stealers .
Package_Service	never use again .
Package_Service	accidentally booked collection on wrong date .
Package_Service	spoke to leanne via live_chat and she sorted out my mistake within minutes .
Package_Service	very good service .
Package_Service	cant comment on anything_else at present as havent had parcel collected or delivered yet but customer_service very good :-)
Package_Service	lauren was so helpful helping me understand how parcel0go work
Package_Service	i would like to say thank_you to daniel who helped_me today very quick and saved my life :)))
Package_Service	we use parcel0go a lot and cant_fault it , first time i ' ve needed to use chat and it was spot on !!

Package_Service	was served by tanya at customer_service today on live help , very very friendly quick and accurate response , answered and dealt_with my query with upmost importance , all_round excellent customer_service , well_done tanya :)
Package_Service	parcel0go are a quick and relaible service who always aim to deliver or collect your goods on time .
Package_Service	placing a collection or delivery is simple but its the directions and location issue that most customers lack to share with the courier through parcel0go as this is vital if you address is in a awkward to find scenario .
Package_Service	all i did was contact live support and give them detailed_information to where i am located as this helped the driver very much as he had never been in local area before and sat_nav are not always relaible .
Package_Service	property was found with ease after leaving instructions with tanya on live help who was excellent from start to finish .
Package_Service	very well_organised and established company , will use again an again for future collections and deliveries .
Package_Service	well_done parcel0go :)
Package_Service	absolutely outstanding customer_service i got !
Package_Service	you are my hero hannah !
