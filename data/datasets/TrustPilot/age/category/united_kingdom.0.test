Fashion_Accessories	a couple of days after_placing my order i realised that i ' d measured my finger wrong .
Fashion_Accessories	i used the live_chat_function on their website to give them the correct_size .
Fashion_Accessories	no_fuss whatsoever , the same guy from the live_chat even rang me to confirm he ' d got the details right .
Fashion_Accessories	the quality of the ring is a0 , and the price i thought was very reasonable .
Fashion_Accessories	i really can ' t recommend this company strongly enough and i fully intend to use them again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	from the first phone call i new that we had chosen the right place to buy my engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	nothing was too much_trouble , from changing the ring size at the last_minute to the phone_calls from the team ensuring me that my ring would be with me by our specified date .
Fashion_Accessories	the service and quality of your products is 0nd to none and we will_definately be back !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses i wanted to purchase were extremely cheap and the exact pair / design i was looking for .
Fashion_Accessories	the postage fees were also fair so an overall bargain !
Fashion_Accessories	i expected to receive the items late , as they were making their way all the way from_hong_kong !
Fashion_Accessories	however , i was delightfully surprised when i came home just 0 and a half weeks after i placed the order , to find my new pair of glasses waiting for me .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses were of an exceptional quality and i literally cannot_fault them .
Fashion_Accessories	i cannot_fault the company , their customer_service and general services and i cannot_fault the products they have for sale .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely be making another purchase from them in the near_future .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely satisfied with the communication , the product quality and value for this price .
Fashion_Accessories	the shipment took a bit longer and was not initially indicated when the order was made but received notification from customer support in time .
Fashion_Accessories	in overall i recommend for everyone .
Fashion_Accessories	always has good service .
Fashion_Accessories	use chemical and juno for my 00 ' s
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely excellent website .
Fashion_Accessories	receive most orders next_day and they have great sales as well .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent returns service also the quibble , replacement item sent out straight_away .
Fashion_Accessories	not only is the website excellent , but the pricing of items is very very competitive across the web .
Fashion_Accessories	normally i would not go for the cheapest place i can find an item online , but purekit ( webtogs ) are such a strong brand i do not think i could shop elsewhere in the future without checking their site first .
Fashion_Accessories	in the event , the rab jacket i ordered was too small , but the returns process was very efficient and very simple .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately , due to the christmas_rush , they were sold out of the next size up and instead of a refund or alternative item , they went straight to rab and sourced a single jacket for me - tremendous service !
Fashion_Accessories	bought the latest ipad & iphone cases for my wife , got them on " free economy delivery " which said they ' d be there in 0 days - was expecting them on friday but they arrived tuesday
Fashion_Accessories	happy happy happy
Fashion_Accessories	very good shop .
Fashion_Accessories	don ' t be left in the dark .
Fashion_Accessories	check out red_hot sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	from now , the only place i ' ll shop for shades is with these chaps .
Fashion_Accessories	i only wear ray_bans .
Fashion_Accessories	red_hot have absolutely hods of them to choose from .
Fashion_Accessories	proper prices too .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery and all_round service was tip - top .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m walking on sunshine .
Fashion_Accessories	this is a prime example of a business for the customers .
Fashion_Accessories	theres a zero hassel returns_policy and customer_service is great !
Fashion_Accessories	prices are also much_better_than other_sites .
Fashion_Accessories	web togs serves their customers more_than any other company i know - i hope more companies can be like this .
Fashion_Accessories	:)
Fashion_Accessories	my fiancee and i went to diamond_heaven to purchase her engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	having chosen our design in the store , we waited three_weeks for the ring to be ready for collection .
Fashion_Accessories	upon collecting the ring , we discovered that the ring was without_doubt the wrong_size when my fiancee tried it on once i had taken it home .
Fashion_Accessories	it was clear that a mistake had occurred , given that the ring was far too large for my fiancee ' s finger , which had been sized at a j just three_weeks earlier .
Fashion_Accessories	the following_day i contacted diamond_heaven by phone to politely explain the mistake and see what could be done .
Fashion_Accessories	the member of staff that spoke to me immediately took on a dismissive and patronising tone , insisting that there was no possible way that the ring might be the wrong_size , and that it was impossible that there may have been a mistake .
Fashion_Accessories	instead , in a condescending manner , she explained that the ring may be loose because may fiancee may have lost weight since it was ordered just three_weeks before .
Fashion_Accessories	given that we are both medical doctors , we can categorically state that such a degree of weight_loss to one ' s finger thickness over such a short_period of time is an impossibility .
Fashion_Accessories	no apology was offered , and everything seemed too much_trouble .
Fashion_Accessories	no offer was made to help rectify this clear mistake , despite the fact that we had recently spent the best part of £ 0 , 000 on an item which was the wrong_size .
Fashion_Accessories	instead , i was told that we could ferry the ring back once again , where we could then pay for the privilege of having it resized .
Fashion_Accessories	i was truly appalled at this service .
Fashion_Accessories	rightfully annoyed and frustrated , my fiancee called back a few hours_later .
Fashion_Accessories	she spoke to [_name ], and explained what had happened .
Fashion_Accessories	[_name ] apologised on behalf of his colleague , and advised that she could bring the ring in on any weekday morning to have the ring altered free of charge .
Fashion_Accessories	the following week , she took the ring back .
Fashion_Accessories	it was sized as an m , rather_than the j that we were expecting , proving that the mistake had occurred , which i had been told was not possible .
Fashion_Accessories	even now , no apology was offered for the mistake , or for the poor attitude of the employee with whom i had initially spoken to about this .
Fashion_Accessories	after the resizing procedure , my fiancee brought the ring home , only to discover that the stone had come loose .
Fashion_Accessories	yet another problem .
Fashion_Accessories	we then had to arrange , at great inconvenience and worry , for the ring to be sent back yet again by special delivery to be fixed once more .
Fashion_Accessories	overall , this saga had taken over five weeks from when we first ordered the ring in store .
Fashion_Accessories	it had been unpleasant , and ruined what would have been one of the most special parts of our engagement .
Fashion_Accessories	one would expect a much higher level of customer_service when purchasing such an expensive and special item .
Fashion_Accessories	mistakes can happen , but the attitude and aversion to apology with which we were met was appalling .
Fashion_Accessories	we had initially planned to purchase our_wedding_rings from diamond_heaven too , but following this experience , we shall certainly be taking our custom elsewhere .
Fashion_Accessories	i would strongly_recommend that everybody else do the same .
Fashion_Accessories	great company to deal with , been buying shades of them for years .
Fashion_Accessories	picked a pair up in person once and they were great guys ... big phil is an_absolute angel behind those rugged good looks .
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend this company .
Fashion_Accessories	they are very informative and polite .
Fashion_Accessories	i will be using these_guys again when i need to renew my specs !
Fashion_Accessories	great customer_service , shoes arrived in a excellent conditions , good packaging , and thanks alot for a free silk tie !!!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	divine_trash is a lush shop that sells fantastic clothes at very reasonable prices .
Fashion_Accessories	you can buy outfits for every occasion .
Fashion_Accessories	they also have fab jewellry , shoes and make up too .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery service is quick and reliable .
Fashion_Accessories	the staff are wonderful and help you and give you great advice .
Fashion_Accessories	if you come to buxton make_sure you visit this lovely shop :-)
Fashion_Accessories	service was spot on , fast , effective , easy to use and just what i wanted after a hard day at work .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer is great and such good value for money , the quality os second to none also i love the way that when you buy a ring they sort of adopt you and clean your jewelery free ( even if it wasn ' t purchased from them !)
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recomended !
Fashion_Accessories	!

Fashion_Accessories	i had a custom engagement_ring made and it was brilliant .
Fashion_Accessories	they talked me through the entire_process , helped_me navigate the different qualities of diamonds while never being pushy or trying to up my limit .
Fashion_Accessories	and they paid close attention to my design brief and interpreted my less_than brilliant drawings superbly .
Fashion_Accessories	my wife adores the ring and knows there is no other one like it .
Fashion_Accessories	i have recommended this company to friends and family and would urge_anyone_else to give them a try .
Fashion_Accessories	i love this site , it offers cool clothes for such unbelievably low_prices .
Fashion_Accessories	definitely not a scam , lots of payment opinions including american_express and paypal so nothing to worry_about .
Fashion_Accessories	their elite club system is amazing , offering huge discounts to loyal_customers and a chance to feel special with your gold elite club membership .
Fashion_Accessories	one of the best cheap , high_quality and fashionable clothes sites i have ever come_across , super dry is just sh_* t in comparison .
Fashion_Accessories	had a problem with my glasses and when i contacted customer_services they were less_than helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	i wouldnt recommend them to anyone i know .
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs is such an easy site to use with so many different good quality products and the info to back the product up especially if your looking for particular qualities , would definitely_recommend it !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent and speedy_delivery , even faster with communication .
Fashion_Accessories	i needed a refund for an item and got it within days !
Fashion_Accessories	awesome products too !
Fashion_Accessories	top_class .
Fashion_Accessories	would use again .
Fashion_Accessories	my first experience buying specs online and at first i was unsure as the high_street opticians painted a negative view ( though to be expected i suppose ).
Fashion_Accessories	i bought some prescription ray_ban sunglasses and i ' m delighted with them .
Fashion_Accessories	i think i ' ve saved about £_000 from the high_street and they fit_perfectly .
Fashion_Accessories	i just sent my old sunglasses in to get an accurate pd reading and the ordering_process was very easy and straightforward .
Fashion_Accessories	i had to wait a couple of weeks for them to arrive but i could keep an aeye on their progress through the website .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived the day after i was advised of despatch .
Fashion_Accessories	recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	received product sooner_than_expected , exactly as i expected it and with good customer_service !
Fashion_Accessories	company seem to cancel orders on a whim .
Fashion_Accessories	i have only ever done 0 other review of a website because on the whole you dont generally receive a service from most websites that warrants any merit .
Fashion_Accessories	however i cannot_fault the service i have received from country_attire .
Fashion_Accessories	i have made 0 orders with them in the last_week , one of which i needed to change the postage for .
Fashion_Accessories	customer_service were more_than helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	they email you back instantly and nothing is too much_trouble .
Fashion_Accessories	the products are excellent , very reasonably_priced and fast delivery !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent !!!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i couldnt be_happier with the glasses i received .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect fit perfect perscription and speedy_delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	definatly going to use again and referred all my friends
Fashion_Accessories	my niece was over the moon , fantastic good value purchase with speedy_delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely buy again .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought my engagement_ring from diamondgeezer after being recommended from a work colleague .
Fashion_Accessories	i was totally happy with the complete service and especially the price .
Fashion_Accessories	my good lady loved the ring and said ' yes ' so all is good .
Fashion_Accessories	i have since recommended the site to my future best man and he has bought an engagement_ring from the site and is asking his girl this week in st lucia if she ' ll marry him - so fingers_crossed .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a ring for my anniversary while i was deployed to iraq , they helped_me everystep of the way and had a more personable and helpful staff than any place i ' ve ever_dealt_with before .
Fashion_Accessories	i highly_recommend them to anyone who is buying anything diamond related !
Fashion_Accessories	i have ordered from here several_times now and yes have had a few bumps along the way , mainly in accordance with delivery timing issues but that is to be expected of a company that offers such a large region of service .
Fashion_Accessories	the items i have received are exactly as_described , fitting and incredibly beautiful , the prices are pretty reasonable to .
Fashion_Accessories	will shop here til the day i die :)
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve had at_least 0 pairs of specs from selectspecs , every pair has been perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	the budget range is brilliant , and most pairs i ' ve had i ' ve worn everyday for a year plus .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered an epiphone electric acoustic_guitar package off the website and i was ( and still am ) thoroughly_impressed with the quality of the package , the speed of delivery service and the ease of transaction .
Fashion_Accessories	the guitar arrived in tune with no faults as well as the rest of the package ( amp , spare strings , tuner etc ...) and arrived next working day .
Fashion_Accessories	i would happily use giggear again and recommend to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	(",)
Fashion_Accessories	comfiest pants ive ever worn and i love that they come in so many designs !
Fashion_Accessories	cant_wait to see what designs are next .
Fashion_Accessories	for the past few_months i ' ve been hunting for the perfect engagement_ring for my girlfriend .
Fashion_Accessories	( not asked yet !!)
Fashion_Accessories	i had a budget of 0k and spent countless hours wandering the high_street jewellers trying to decide the best spec .
Fashion_Accessories	finding a balance between size , quality , colour , cut , polish and symmetry was a nightmare .
Fashion_Accessories	i found whilst the high_street guys were helpful they seemed to push the sale of rings i didn ’ t feel had the right balance .
Fashion_Accessories	it seemed to me that the high_street jewellers had very limited diamond selection and it was a hassle trying to pull together quotes for various different specs .
Fashion_Accessories	frustrated i decided to look online .
Fashion_Accessories	being a guy who_likes to research every purchase to death i checked out all of the online jewellers i could find .
Fashion_Accessories	i like how on most sites i could enter different diamond specs and generate a price .
Fashion_Accessories	by doing this eventually settled on a diamond spec and knew the look of the ring i was after .
Fashion_Accessories	i entered the diamond values into the top online providers and dg came out cheapest .
Fashion_Accessories	even if they hadn ’ t been the cheapest i would have gone with them anyway as they had a ring type that i thought suited my girlfriend perfectly .
Fashion_Accessories	without a word of exaggeration i saved over £ 0000 buying from dg compared to buying the same spec on the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	i took a deep breath and decided to purchase ... but before i did i wanted to email them and ask a few questions .
Fashion_Accessories	not because i had any but as a test .
Fashion_Accessories	they answered straight_away and demonstrated a great knowledge of their products .
Fashion_Accessories	impressed and after 00 emails in 0 days i ended_up changing my diamond spec slightly which ended_up cheaper .
Fashion_Accessories	rather_than up sell to something that wasn ’ t right for me they gave constructive information and helped_me reach my decision .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring arrived two_weeks_later on the exact day they said it would .
Fashion_Accessories	it is fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	i received an update email nearly every day of the two week wait .
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant service and price - can ’ t recommend them enough .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a pair of merrel winter boots for my wife in the sale in june thinking they would make a good christmas_present .
Fashion_Accessories	however , when she tried them on she didn ' t like them .
Fashion_Accessories	it was only then that i looked at the receipt and realised they had a 000 day return_policy .
Fashion_Accessories	we sent them back ( at minimal cost as they take care of most of the postage_costs as well ) then i got a phone call from webtogs to say they had received my boots and asked whether i wanted an exchange or refund .
Fashion_Accessories	the refund was then processed the next_day - amazing !
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t fault !
Fashion_Accessories	one of the few places i found with the sunglasses i wanted , good prices and even found a promo_code for extra discount .
Fashion_Accessories	very fast free delivery :)
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve been using chemical for years and according to my old orders i ' ve spent over £_0k at their store !
Fashion_Accessories	you always get your order on time and i ' ve found that if you spend enough , they bump your delivery up to the next level ( ie : i ' ve purchased first_class and they ' ve sent it via next_day courier ).
Fashion_Accessories	the few_times i ' ve spoken to them on the phone ( sometimes i ' ll add a ' friday shipping monday delivery ' item to my order then realise that i want the rest of the order this week ) they ' ve always been polite and helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	my only_gripe is that the site can be difficult to navigate , however , chemical have obviously noticed this as they have recently made changes , although it ' s still not perfect , i do believe they will_continue to work on this .
Fashion_Accessories	every communication was clear and made the purchase special .
Fashion_Accessories	questions were answered_quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	call_backs were very timely without delay .
Fashion_Accessories	i felt involved in the whole_process of ring manufacture .
Fashion_Accessories	ring delivery was fast secure and discreet as requested .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely no_complaints and would recommend the company very highly .
Fashion_Accessories	they delivered my order faster_than_expected , and i had no issues with them , not to mention they were the cheapest online by £_00 .. ill happily buy all my future sunglasses with them ..
Fashion_Accessories	i cannot recommend crown_brush highly_enough , the item arrived the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	the brushes are of a very high_quality , and the all eyes on you set is amazing ,
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s the only eye brushes i need to use on a day to day basis , they wash well , and are lovely to use , i wear make up on a daily_basis and my brushes get a lot of use , and these stand up really well to heavy use !!!
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t wait to place my next order
Fashion_Accessories	i was a bit_nervous_about buying from this website , after_reading all the negative_reviews .
Fashion_Accessories	however , i received my order this morning , and i have no_complaints .
Fashion_Accessories	everything is pretty_much how i expected , and the delivery was amazingly fast - it came sooner_than my order from h_& m , which i placed two days earlier !
Fashion_Accessories	they also shipped a couple of days earlier_than they said they would , which was a nice surprise .
Fashion_Accessories	however , i think you have to be_careful shopping on this site .
Fashion_Accessories	here are a few essential tips :
Fashion_Accessories	- use the ' ready to ship ' tab ( available on the left - hand side of the page ).
Fashion_Accessories	this means that you won ' t be looking at clothes that would take weeks to deliver , and it saves you so much time .
Fashion_Accessories	- when you find an item , carefully check whether the colour you want is in stock , and ready to ship .
Fashion_Accessories	i only selected items that were ready to ship within 0 - 0 days .
Fashion_Accessories	' out of print ' means that you won ' t be getting that item , so don ' t select it .
Fashion_Accessories	- look carefully at the pictures .
Fashion_Accessories	a lot of people seem to have thought they were buying another piece of clothing , from the way the models were dressed .
Fashion_Accessories	at the bottom of the page they sometimes have a photo of the garment on its own , which can be helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	it also shows you the thickness / weight / length of the item more clearly .
Fashion_Accessories	- don ' t expect amazing quality .
Fashion_Accessories	i only bought items under £_00 , so i wasn ' t expecting them to be very well - made .
Fashion_Accessories	however , i was pleasantly_surprised by almost all the items .
Fashion_Accessories	i didn ' t buy any handbags / shoes / jewellery because i thought there was a higher chance of these things being broken / poorly made .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d rather try on a pair of shoes in my local shop and pay a bit more for them than order a pair i was unsure_about the fit / quality of .
Fashion_Accessories	- double - check the measurement .
Fashion_Accessories	everything i bought was ' one size '.
Fashion_Accessories	luckily , i seem to be that size - and everything i bought was fairly elasticated anyway - but the site doesn ' t seem to cater well for sizes abover 00 .
Fashion_Accessories	- be prepared for a worrying ' you order is on hold ' email while they authenticate your credit / debit_card .
Fashion_Accessories	i got really nervous when they sent this to me , but they soon sorted it out and my order shipped the day after .
Fashion_Accessories	i hope that ' s been helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	in all , i loved shopping with this company - the website is gorgeous and the range is amazing .
Fashion_Accessories	i had no_problems with delivery or quality .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll definitely be back !
Fashion_Accessories	great service and communication , super_fast postage & products are gorgeous !
Fashion_Accessories	ordered some sunglasses after finding a great deal on groupon ( props to that guys ) on a sunday_night .
Fashion_Accessories	the order processing took a little longer_than_expected which is fair as the deal must be very popular .
Fashion_Accessories	my main problem with my order was that in ups .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	they delivered my order to an entirely random address where i don ' t live .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	they promised to collect the mis_- routed parcel and delivery to the correct address on the same day ... and didn ' t .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	they finally delivered my parcel , but to a neighbour without leaving a card at my address !
Fashion_Accessories	and this was all in the middle of the queen ' s jubilee weekend so my sunglasses will have been floating around some ups van / picking centre for almost a week .
Fashion_Accessories	not good ... but hey , that ' s not sunglasses_shop ' s fault .
Fashion_Accessories	also , the instant message chat help service isn ' t working too well .
Fashion_Accessories	i was passed around 0 separate operators and ended_up giving up and calling to get help when tracking incorrectly delivered order .
Fashion_Accessories	wish the delivery was free , would make me not think_twice about buying things , also annoying hasving 0 different prices , just show it with vat , we all have to pay it , so dont really care what price is without
Fashion_Accessories	easily the best underwear i ' ve ever had , love the designs and love how comfy they are .
Fashion_Accessories	love that they come in a cool little tin as well i bought some to give as presents at xmas were great gifts
Fashion_Accessories	simply the best .
Fashion_Accessories	i love chemical uk .
Fashion_Accessories	placed an order on tuesday , 00th_july_0000 .
Fashion_Accessories	i have contacted many_times , be told the glasses ship from_hong_kong , and they gave me the reason is " there is very good a chance that they have been delayed in the postal system and you should receive the presently ."
Fashion_Accessories	asked me wait 0 weeks for the respond .....
Fashion_Accessories	thanks for the brilliant costume , i will be using this website again :-)
Fashion_Accessories	from the customer_service to the design and to the ring quality the overall sevice from diamondgezzer was fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	everyone i spoke with were really helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	the design was exactly how i wanted it to be .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recomend them to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you to every who works at diamondgezzer
Fashion_Accessories	product was well described and dispatched quickly - very pleased with my purchase and will buy again from end clothing .
Fashion_Accessories	fed_ex deliver but this was the third time they have got my address wrong .
Fashion_Accessories	however , after me having to call fed_ex to explain the guy had yet again gone to the wrong flat he did come back in the afternoon , this time to the correct address !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks end clothing .
Fashion_Accessories	the funky designs attracted me to waxx .
Fashion_Accessories	but when they arrived the quality and feel was better_than what i expected .
Fashion_Accessories	i can say hands_down they are my favourites over calvins etc that i also own .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended
Fashion_Accessories	product as_described delivery quickly and efficiently
Fashion_Accessories	i have bought from red_hot twice and both_times my orders were delivered super speedily and correctly .
Fashion_Accessories	they are good value and have tonnes of choice !
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with my miu miu s and ray_bans !
Fashion_Accessories	first_class service and love the glasses
Fashion_Accessories	over the years i have bought a number of items from webtogs .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately a couple of times i have had faulty items ( no fault of webtogs ).
Fashion_Accessories	each time , the customer_service had been exceptional .
Fashion_Accessories	i could not wish for better customers care .
Fashion_Accessories	they were friendly , very helpful and prompt with their responses .
Fashion_Accessories	top company , and i would go out of my way to use them again .
Fashion_Accessories	the only_downside is their range of products can sometimes be a little limited .
Fashion_Accessories	but if they have the item you are after in stock , then don ' t hesitate to use them !
Fashion_Accessories	if i had the money , i would buy stuff everyday from crownbrush !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	excellent prices on supras , speedy_delivery , happy with the service !
Fashion_Accessories	these_guys made me feel_like one of the family !
Fashion_Accessories	i , ( like a vast number of blokes i imagine ) had little interest in jewelry , but began the laborious task of trying to find the perfect engagement_ring , trawling round anonymous high_street jewelers staffed with the identikit orange faced commission hungry girls .
Fashion_Accessories	bored and disheartened i turned to the internet , found there to be an equally bewildering number of options littered with terminology i didn ' t really understand .
Fashion_Accessories	clive at diamondgeezer was patient enough to explain everything to me , communication was great , the final piece arrived a day early and looked better_than i could have imagined .
Fashion_Accessories	i simply cant recommend the team at diamondgeezer highly_enough .
Fashion_Accessories	don ' t be put off by the grizzly name , the service and product are 0nd to none .
Fashion_Accessories	i received my glasses and couldn ' t see through them !
Fashion_Accessories	i ended_up going to another company and paying over £_000 for a decent pair !
Fashion_Accessories	after purchasing a dress from this site , the dress arrived the very next_day , and i ' m from the u . s !
Fashion_Accessories	also , the packaging is beyond stunning , you ' re going to want to keep everything from the bow to the box , they ' re that beautiful .
Fashion_Accessories	the dress arrived carefully_packaged and i was immediately contacted by a customer_services rep to be sure i was happy with my purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	lovely place to do business with !
Fashion_Accessories	this is the first time i ' ve ever purchased designer sunglasses online so it was a bit of a big deal and i needed a trusted website .
Fashion_Accessories	after googling ' designer sunglasses ' i came_across this site .
Fashion_Accessories	the reviews seemed good and they had the ray - bans i was looking for .
Fashion_Accessories	the price of the glasses themselves wasn ' t the cheapest i came_across but postage was less_than what other_sites were charging .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m_glad i chose this site a my gorgeous new sunglasses arrived within a couple of days in perfect_condition - thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	cant_fault these_guys at all - where else can you get a pair of prescription_glasses for £ 0 ?!?
Fashion_Accessories	they are a great backup pair , i then went and bought a pair of bench glasses for about half the price of what it was in the opticians !
Fashion_Accessories	they even answered my questions via_twitter , which was awesome .
Fashion_Accessories	the only annoying this was having to get hold of my pupilary distance - my optician refused to give it to me so i had to get the mrs to measure it with a ruler .. a bit worrying but it turned_out ok , as i can see through my new specs !
Fashion_Accessories	nice product , very quick delivery , reasonable_price .
Fashion_Accessories	you have to love jules_b and their service is second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	har inget att klaga på , allt är skött exemplariskt !
Fashion_Accessories	snabb frakt , bra paketerat och riktigt bra priser !
Fashion_Accessories	kommer handla här flera gånger igen :) tack !
Fashion_Accessories	placed an order for a north_face backpack earlier today - opted for the free delivery so was initially informed order would arrive before 00th_june , but i ' ve already had confirmation of its dispatch - so it should now arrive in time for my boyfriend ' s birthday - with no delivery charges !
Fashion_Accessories	and it was the cheapest price online i could find for the same bag .
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks , webtogs .
Fashion_Accessories	after writing a negative_review .
Fashion_Accessories	i received a phone call from a very helpful man .
Fashion_Accessories	offered full_refund or better quality kilt .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with the service i have received
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you very much
Fashion_Accessories	received my kilt this morning it ' s fantastic brilliant quality and super_fast delivery thanks again for all your help xx
Fashion_Accessories	have bought records from chemical countless_times .
Fashion_Accessories	have always been very happy with the service .
Fashion_Accessories	since i bought my first record they have always good taken good care of me and on the very very few occasions there were mistakes they were dealt_with swiftly and professionaly - my number 0 stop for drum n bass vinyl !
Fashion_Accessories	big ups chemical crew
Fashion_Accessories	cheap prices and a quick delivery time would make me buy here again !
Fashion_Accessories	i needed a new pair of sunglasses for when i go mountain biking , so i searched on google and straight_away sunglassesshop . com stood out as they were offering 00_%_off , the website itself is laid_out very efficiently and organised which just makes the job of finding yourself a new pair o shades that bit easier , once i came_across the pair i liked i confirmed my purchase with the use of their style guide , im sure everyone has had problems with finding the right sunglasses in the past that suit them , well the style guide serves that purpose , too bypass all the unnecessary trying on glasses and give you an honest opinion on what will suit your shape of head .
Fashion_Accessories	once i received my glasses they were packed very carefully with thought in a nice sturdy box , inside were my glasses in a protective case and my receipt carefully laid in the bottom , i could not ask for more and my sunglasses are the best thing ive bought this year .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you sunglassesshop . com for a great 0st time experience as your customer i will be sure to buy my next pair of shades in exactly the same way .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with my recent_purchase from waxx .
Fashion_Accessories	great quality and would definitely purchase from you again .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks very much .
Fashion_Accessories	very good service .
Fashion_Accessories	even_tho i had order the wrong_size you was happy to change it .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you
Fashion_Accessories	the service i received from diamond_geezer was superb .
Fashion_Accessories	they helped_me choose the right product without being at all pushy .
Fashion_Accessories	the price was fantastic and they kept me up to date with the progress of my order every_step of the way .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely be using them again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	i spoke to luke from diamond_geezer on the phone and he was the only person who understood exactly_what i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	the next_day he sent me an image of the ring i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	i then made a few tweaks to my personal choice and placed an order - much cheaper then the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	luke kept me updated_throughout the whole_process .
Fashion_Accessories	when the ring arrived and was presented to my finacee , she was blown_away .
Fashion_Accessories	we had to send the ring back for resizing which took less_than 0 days and we also had a slight problem with one of the stones and sent it back for inspection .
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer were great and gave it a full inspection and clean within 0 days again .
Fashion_Accessories	everytime i ring them i am impressed with their customer_service - its not often these days .
Fashion_Accessories	the valuation came to almost_double what i paid .
Fashion_Accessories	i am definatley buying my wedding_rings from here and any future stones .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks
Fashion_Accessories	having been recommended diamond_geezer by a friend i could not have been more pleased .
Fashion_Accessories	i was able to discuss the style of ring and diamonds , and select the perfect stone for me and my budget .
Fashion_Accessories	in comparison with a well_known high_street jeweller my d flawless diamond would have been over five thousand_pounds more if purchased through them .
Fashion_Accessories	my fiance absolutely loves it and we will_definately be going back for our_wedding_bands .
Fashion_Accessories	really impressed with the service from pure luxuries .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a messenger bag for my brother and it was perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	the delivery super_quick even at christmas and the system they use for delivery is really neat ; you get a text telling you the likely arrival time and can track the driver through their web app .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely_recommend pure luxuries !
Fashion_Accessories	hi , i received the outfit reasonably quickly but when it arrived i noticed the dress had a hole on the seam .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided to not send the outfit back for an exchange as i was unsure if i would receive the replacement in time for when i needed it .
Fashion_Accessories	i do not fault the service and delivery but disappointing that the outfit was faulty when it arrived .

Fashion_Accessories	the service and delivery from this company perfectly reflects the high_quality product they are selling .
Fashion_Accessories	in a panic i bought a last_minute travel wallet for my partners xmas_present .... 00_hours_later it was sat on my desk !
Fashion_Accessories	you get an_email when it is packed and then again when it is with the courier so you have every idea exactly where your item is at all stages of its journey which is great .
Fashion_Accessories	i wouldn ' t hesitate to buy from them again and again and again .
Fashion_Accessories	:)
Fashion_Accessories	well this shop is fab got a good mix of the old tunes that you wont and the new tunes and a great service top price ' s as to boot a one stop_shop fo all your dj need ' s
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t fault the service and quality of products !!
Fashion_Accessories	get all my shades from here !
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s nice to have nothing to worry_about when you are buying your sunglasses , especially given how stressful sorting your holidays out are !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	divine_trash is my all time favourite clothes shop !
Fashion_Accessories	everytime i visit the staff are always very welcoming and friendly .
Fashion_Accessories	i always find something to buy that i like , and the staff are always there to give you choices about what to wear it with if your unsure .
Fashion_Accessories	this is the shop i always reccomend to my friends !
Fashion_Accessories	great company !
Fashion_Accessories	buying from diamond_heaven was a great .
Fashion_Accessories	found the customer_service friendly and helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	all my questions were answered swiftly and i now have the perfect ring .
Fashion_Accessories	look_forward to buying again !
Fashion_Accessories	good quality service , fast postage and item exactly as_described .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks :)
Fashion_Accessories	i used diamondgeezer to purchase my first ( and hopefully only ) engagement_ring , the whole experience was brilliant and i was made to feel very valued and special throughout the process .
Fashion_Accessories	the order tracking which shows you how far your order has progressed was very useful .
Fashion_Accessories	sadly the first ring they had cast had bubbles in it and had to be recast so my proposal date went back another week , disappointing i know but these things_happen .
Fashion_Accessories	i was very pleased when the ring arrived and even more so when i had the valuation .
Fashion_Accessories	i am very much of the mindset that the items of jewellery i have purchased from diamongeezer will stay within our new family and the valuation has proved that investing in a good quality diamond and platinum setting will show its true value for years to come .
Fashion_Accessories	the engagement_ring and wedding_bands i have purchased all cost approximately 00 - 00_% less_than what i priced from the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	i was contacted shortly_after my emailed enquiry by clive who talked me through the several options available at my budget and was delighted with the whole service from enquiry to delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring i had pictured in my mind was close to the designs on the website but not exact .
Fashion_Accessories	diamondgeezer were happy to design an_alternative and send me pictures of what it would look like - a very useful service .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring is amazing and naturally she was delighted with it .... and said yes !
Fashion_Accessories	i also used diamondgeezer to purchase an_eternity some 0yrs later and was very pleased that the level of service hadn ' t slipped .
Fashion_Accessories	thoroughly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	trendsales er fabulous !
Fashion_Accessories	kææææmpe udvalg , søde brugere - fantastisk support fra ts side , nemt , hurtigt og sikkert handelssystem .
Fashion_Accessories	i have recently_purchased a few eye shadow and blending brushes from crownbrush . co . uk and they are great , ive_seen mixed_reviews on theses brushes but for me they are great , really soft and for the price i really cant_complain and i will_defiantly be purchasing a few more .
Fashion_Accessories	also the service is great delivery came within 0 days .
Fashion_Accessories	the only con i would say is they need to update the delivery section on there site , so it is more accurate !
Fashion_Accessories	great service , item as_described , item arrived ingood time for my daughter to stand out from the crowd on her school space themed day , a very happy child , thanx guys x
Fashion_Accessories	the ring was made to the timeline given at the very start and the ring itself is a true work of art !
Fashion_Accessories	i saw that someone commented on the valuation ( from a third - party ) not arriving - the valuation on the ring i bought took two months to come in but the independent assessor valued it as higher_than the price i paid !
Fashion_Accessories	:)
Fashion_Accessories	bought engagement_ring for my girlfriend from here after doing a little research into stones ( clarity , colour , etc ..), realising that the prices on the high_street were outrageous .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d be able to get a diamond half the size , riddled with marks or inclusions and near the yellow end of the colour scale for what i paid on here .
Fashion_Accessories	service was great , you get an_email at each_stage of the ring ' s & diamond ' s progress .
Fashion_Accessories	would highly_recommend , just need to get it valued now to see how much more ( hopefully ) it ' s worth over the price i paid .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks .
Fashion_Accessories	i visit chemicaluk every so often to look at the latest clothing as it ' s one of few places in the uk which fully promote street / skate wear brands .
Fashion_Accessories	i used to buy from the store quite regularly however i feel the emphasis has gone more towards typical high_street brands and styles rather_than sticking to it ' s original roots of streetwear and the pricing of new products when you include tax is at top end of the rrp .
Fashion_Accessories	the website has also now started to sell designer fashion wear which are at the top end price bracket rather_than promote the smaller low key streetwear brands which offer good value and something unique , i guess the unique element has gone_missing somewhere and it feels no different to any other menswear site online , which is not exactly a bad thing but is the reason_why i don ' t really shop at this store anymore .
Fashion_Accessories	the delivery is usually fast and efficient , easy check out service , great range of the latest music software etc , overall 0 out of 0 for the reasons stated above .
Fashion_Accessories	i was sceptical about ordering glasses online , but i found the site easy to navigate , input my description and choose the frame , glass , protection , persciption very quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	the worse part of ordering online is communication and customer_service , but fashioneyewear emailed with any delays , where abouts my order was coming from and emailed when it had been dispatched with a tracking_number .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend the site to friends .
Fashion_Accessories	i also found the quote inline with internet prices .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve purchased a few things from pediwear lately including loake 0000s , an ashwood leather briefcase , leather wallet and a luxury valet box .
Fashion_Accessories	each item has been sent out straight_away and with good communication .
Fashion_Accessories	the site is easy to use and there are some great brands on there including crockett and jones which i was pleasantly_surprised about .
Fashion_Accessories	i will likely buy all my shoes from them now .
Fashion_Accessories	only one piece of constructive criticism would be to update the product pictures .
Fashion_Accessories	gteat products .
Fashion_Accessories	great price ( especially in the sale ).
Fashion_Accessories	free delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	no_complaints .
Fashion_Accessories	well_chuffed .
Fashion_Accessories	amazing selection to choose from , been trying to find undies for ladies with big funky waistbands like this for ages , fast delivery , really comfy , epic website .
Fashion_Accessories	once all my xmas shopping is done i will_deffo be placing a large order with these_guys for myself !
Fashion_Accessories	oh , and i rather enjoy chatting to them on twitter ;) @ carlicirca0000
Fashion_Accessories	keep up the amazing work guys !
Fashion_Accessories	really pleased with my order and delivery was very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	best price i could find and i knew i was ordering from a reputable company .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered late on the 0th and it has yet to ship , of course payment was taken straight_away .
Fashion_Accessories	i was wary before ordering so i ordered £_00 ( 0 items / phone stuff ) so i ain ' t overly upset if it doesn ' t come .
Fashion_Accessories	i emailed them 0 days ago , took them today to answer .
Fashion_Accessories	they sounded polite , apparently it ' s because of the holiday so there ' s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there ' s no mention on the site ).
Fashion_Accessories	i shall see what happens from here .
Fashion_Accessories	update
Fashion_Accessories	i received my order a few_days ago and everything is as it was described on the site and came well_packaged .
Fashion_Accessories	however i ' m still annoyed from before .
Fashion_Accessories	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
Fashion_Accessories	whether they have delayed site updates or what i don ' t know why but whoever i emailed should have known my order was already shipped and never confirmed to me when it was shipped after i asked them to .
Fashion_Accessories	the site itself is not bad , they need better customer_service and to stop lying to customers about 00hour shipping that doesn ' t exist .
Fashion_Accessories	i had no_idea what i was doing with the engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	the advice i received was spot on , my fiance loves the ring and i could not have been happier with the service .
Fashion_Accessories	i went for a palladium ring , i have since had the valuation and it seems i got an excellent deal !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	save_yourself the hassle and hard sell at the shops and buy from these_guys .
Fashion_Accessories	i went into sunglass hut in town and tried on some sunglasses , turns_out the ones i loved were a pair of chanel avaitors costing £_000 .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided to go home and search the internet for a better price .
Fashion_Accessories	i found a trusted company who sold them for £_000 and decided to order them , however they were out of stock and would take 0 weeks for delivery , so i contiuned my search , i came_across sunglasses_shop who were selling them for £_000 but i noticed the did a price_match service .
Fashion_Accessories	i called them and spoke to chloe in customer_services who asked me to send details and they would confirm if they were able to match the price .
Fashion_Accessories	i called them back and they confirmed they could do them at the same price as the other company at £_000 with free delievery .
Fashion_Accessories	chloe checked the stock for me and said there was only one pair left ... determined to get this pair i asked her to put the order through asap after a few emails the order was in and payment was made .
Fashion_Accessories	this was on monday_afternoon and i was advised i would receive them on wednesday .
Fashion_Accessories	to my supprise tuesday_morning ups turned_up with my glasses !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	everything was perfect !
Fashion_Accessories	i dont normally_write_reviews but the level of customer_service i recieved was outstanding and chloe was really helpfull making_sure i got these glasses !
Fashion_Accessories	the delievery was extreamly quick !
Fashion_Accessories	i cant rate this company high enough .
Fashion_Accessories	if your reading this and deciding if you should buy from them , then i hope ive helped you make your desicion !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks again chloe , i will_definitely buy from sunglassesshop . co . uk again !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	as ever i forgot my girlfriend ' s bday , until a couple of days before the date .
Fashion_Accessories	in a panic i recalled she mentioned a pair of sunglasses she was after .
Fashion_Accessories	i went online and found this company .
Fashion_Accessories	luckily they had the pair she wanted , they came in mint_condition and more_importantly before her bday .
Fashion_Accessories	saved me a load of trouble
Fashion_Accessories	cheers
Fashion_Accessories	joe
Fashion_Accessories	i order 0 pair of glasses , its now 00 days and no glasses to be seen .
Fashion_Accessories	one pair shipped and the other held because its discounted .
Fashion_Accessories	they tell me its discounted after 00 days .
Fashion_Accessories	ask me to choose a different pair .
Fashion_Accessories	i do that but it costs more .
Fashion_Accessories	they confirm the order but fail to ask me to pay the difference .
Fashion_Accessories	00 days_later i found out i needed to pay .
Fashion_Accessories	i still_waiting for the first pair .
Fashion_Accessories	first : if items are out of stock and they still charge for it , then its there responsibility to tell us asap .
Fashion_Accessories	second : since its there responsibility why ask for more money there and then ?
Fashion_Accessories	thirdly : as customer_service , there role is make_sure if they fell short because of there responsibility the need to offer hugh apologies and compensation for the lost time , stress caused .
Fashion_Accessories	that ' s why i will never buy , recommend to any one to use selectspec .
Fashion_Accessories	stay well away .
Fashion_Accessories	that ' s my ticket # 0000
Fashion_Accessories	hal
Fashion_Accessories	i will send a letter to registered address at company house so the director has an opportunity to put things right .

Fashion_Accessories	i have never dealt_with a company who provides next_day delivery for free !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m so impressed with them i never knew people like this existed !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m 000_% satisfied with their service and couldn ' t have asked for more !
Fashion_Accessories	plus even better the jacket looks absolutely fab !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d advise_anyone and everyone to get their country gear from this place and i will most definitely be using them again .
Fashion_Accessories	they ' re so good i ' m actually shocked !
Fashion_Accessories	v . happy customer !
Fashion_Accessories	i was looking for some time for a series of límited edition vinyls that were sold out everywhere , but there they were at chemical online catalogue .
Fashion_Accessories	in the beginning i was a bit afraid about paying before confirming that the récords were available , as they has been so hard to find , but i went straight to online ordering and receive everything just find a few_days_later in canary islands , using the normal delivery service .
Fashion_Accessories	i will buy moré from you , thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	as an american buying overseas i didn ' t expect shipping to be fast but it did !
Fashion_Accessories	took 0 days .
Fashion_Accessories	not only was it quick but the packaging was superb .
Fashion_Accessories	i can see jules_b really care about their customers .
Fashion_Accessories	definitely will buy from again !
Fashion_Accessories	also customer_service was great .
Fashion_Accessories	replied to my email within the hour !
Fashion_Accessories	ps_: free shipping would be nice :)
Fashion_Accessories	clothes & music all under one roof .
Fashion_Accessories	what more could you ask for ?
Fashion_Accessories	i was amazed as my parcel arrived first thing the next_day , as i ordered only the afternoon before .
Fashion_Accessories	my outfit was amazing will_defiantly be buying from them again .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided to purchase glasses over the internet due to ever increasing prices on the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	selectspecs was an easy website to use and the glasses on offer were very reasonably_priced !
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was as_described and i loved my glasses when they arrived .
Fashion_Accessories	i mainly wear contact_lenses , however , since the arrival of my selectspecs glasses , i have worn the contacts much less !
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased and would most definitely use selectspecs again !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	web_site easy to use and the delivery was really fast .
Fashion_Accessories	the packaging felt_like christmas !
Fashion_Accessories	the best part is the customer_service when you need to retun an item .
Fashion_Accessories	efficiency and politeness all the way from mrs foster !
Fashion_Accessories	looking_forward to shopping again !
Fashion_Accessories	an engagement_ring is a purchase with a large degree of anxiety attached to it - especially if you can ' t see it in front of you ...!
Fashion_Accessories	clive was excellent to speak to and the service offered by diamondgeezer was brilliant .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring is lovely - i ' m just hoping she says yes ...!
Fashion_Accessories	clearly until she does , i can ' t comment on the resizing / returns_policy (!)
Fashion_Accessories	but i felt clive was a straight up guy and would recommend the company to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a pair of glasses , however when i logged in to my account to see if they had been dispatched , i discovered they had been dispatched to a totally different address to the one i had stated , i contacted select_specs who deny having my actual delivery address and they they cannot do anything about it , they suggest i pick_up the specs from the address to which they have been delivered which is lanarkshire and i live in crawley .... no refund offered .
Fashion_Accessories	so paid for glasses i will never actually receive .
Fashion_Accessories	disgraceful .
Fashion_Accessories	items always arrive in immaculate_condition and in excellent time .
Fashion_Accessories	liaising with the customer_service department is always easy .
Fashion_Accessories	an awesome website !
Fashion_Accessories	some purchases i have bought from yesstyle were not as good quality and it is quite hard to tell if it ' s good quality from some images .
Fashion_Accessories	service is very good .
Fashion_Accessories	after being let_down by another retailer who said they had the stock but did not i ordered my rab jacket from webtogs and it arrived the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	great online - store , nice music on vinyl , cd - s , best prices on shoes , clothes and etc !
Fashion_Accessories	recommended !
Fashion_Accessories	i can only recommend this company to others very good service , very resonable priced , goods packaged very well , description of the products very accurate to the images on the website .
Fashion_Accessories	very good company .
Fashion_Accessories	i normally use a website for the first time with a sinking heart , having to learn it and re - entering all my details etc .
Fashion_Accessories	but i think real effort has gone into this site and it shows real ' politeness ' in the way it makes things easy for you .
Fashion_Accessories	it was a pleasure to use and i was truly flabbergasted to receive the gloves i ordered at 0pm on thursday delivered first thing on friday ( and this was near christmas ).
Fashion_Accessories	excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	great pants really comfy and nice original designs .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll definately be coming_back to add to the collection
Fashion_Accessories	wasn ' t entirely sure about ordering from them to start with .
Fashion_Accessories	not because they had a negative reputation , more that i had never ordered glasses online before and wasn ' t sure what website to use .
Fashion_Accessories	i took the leap and ordered a pair of rayban wayfarers .
Fashion_Accessories	i contacted them and they helped_me pick the right size frame for my big head ( i had actually chosen wrong to start with , but they changed my order for me !).
Fashion_Accessories	they had to order the frames from italy , so i wasn ' t expecting next_day delivery or anything .
Fashion_Accessories	they kept in contact with me , letting my know that the frames had arrived and that it would be sent next_day delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	they used dpd ( from personal experience , they are probably one of the best courier services available int he uk !).
Fashion_Accessories	package arrived in perfect_condition and the glasses looked amazing .
Fashion_Accessories	i got the elite coating on the lenses ( cost an extra £_00 ).
Fashion_Accessories	i must_say that i made a good choice picking the coating .
Fashion_Accessories	i wasn ' t expecting anything that hugely different , but it really does make a difference !
Fashion_Accessories	all in all , a very positive and clean experience .
Fashion_Accessories	if they are still about in a few_years time , i will happily order my glasses from them again !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks fashioneyewear . co . uk !
Fashion_Accessories	bought my engagement_ring and both mine and my husbands wedding_rings and they are all beautiful !!!
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant website and very helpful customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	all in all a well_deserved 0_stars
Fashion_Accessories	i bought my other_halfs engagement_ring from diamond_geezer and was very impressed witht he customer_service and design process .
Fashion_Accessories	they will make any design for your ring and suggest improvements a fantastic service and excellent prices top_marks from me .
Fashion_Accessories	nothing more to say .
Fashion_Accessories	thought the delivery was quick and the sizes are exactly_what i wanted
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered some prescription_sunglasses on the 00th_april , with plenty of time to receive them for my holiday beginning on the 00nd may .
Fashion_Accessories	i waited for 0 weeks , with no updates - it turned_out after some time spent investigating the frames were not in stock and i didn ' t receive any correspondence from them to tell me they had sold out .
Fashion_Accessories	( although they told me an_email was sent and i had checked my inbox and spam , i ' m aware they recently updated their site which may have caused their email dispatcher / service to fail )
Fashion_Accessories	i emailed them to find out what ' s going on and end up in a long and painfully_slow email chain trying to figure_out which glasses they have in stock ( each email takes at_least a day to receive a reply ) by the time i came to a conclusion they couldn ' t guarantee delivery before my holiday date .
Fashion_Accessories	no apologies were made or any effort to try and push through the order a little faster , even considering they ' d messed_up in the first place !
Fashion_Accessories	now i ' ve either go to :
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	go without
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	brave the prices of a high - street store .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks for wasting my time , you ' ve lost a returning customer in a very competitive and saturated marketplace .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service , very happy with my new eyewear , will_definitely purchase from fashion eyewear in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve bought a couple of things from webtogs now and they ' ve always delivered quickly and provided a competitive price .
Fashion_Accessories	the most_recent order included a top that needed exchanging for a larger_size .
Fashion_Accessories	i phoned up and spoke with a helpful person who got the replacement send out on next_day delivery and said i could return the smaller item as soon as possible and still not get charged for the return_postage .
Fashion_Accessories	very helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	never had a problem with these_guys , had a query recently and they got back to me quickly and sorted it .
Fashion_Accessories	deliver my records in super_quick time
Fashion_Accessories	personally , i would recommend that no one orders from this website , i had an torrid time dealing_with their customer_service and policies .
Fashion_Accessories	they make if difficult to return goods , only give you 00 days to do it , and only offer you a refund in yesstyle credit .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutly disgusting , i have been mugged by this unethical company .
Fashion_Accessories	i recently_purchased the crown concealer palette to contour .
Fashion_Accessories	it is amazing !
Fashion_Accessories	the quality of the concealer is really high , the packaging is classy yet understated and it makes contouring so easy .
Fashion_Accessories	i love it .
Fashion_Accessories	it could only be improved with a mirror , like the urban_decay eye palettes have .
Fashion_Accessories	great product , delivered super_fast .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect experience .
Fashion_Accessories	i spent a lot of time searching for a particular pair of ray_bans that i saw on someone when on holiday in dubai .
Fashion_Accessories	i went to my local sunglass shop and was told i ' d have to wait 0 - 0 weeks for them to be ordered and delivered .
Fashion_Accessories	as i ' m going to barcelona for the weekend this week that wasn ' t suitable .
Fashion_Accessories	i looked online and found them on fashioneyewear . co . uk at an unbelievable price of £_00 . 00 .
Fashion_Accessories	as my local retailer was selling them for £_000 i honestly thought this website was selling fakes or something like that .
Fashion_Accessories	i didn ' t order for about 0 days as i was so unsure , but after_reading the trustpilot reviews i thought i ' d give it a go .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered saturday evening and they have arrived today ( tuesday ) with amazing dpd delivery service with allotted delivery time_slot of 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived at 00 : 00 .
Fashion_Accessories	i am over the moon , they are beautiful , authentic and i ' m wearing them today !
Fashion_Accessories	came with a discount card of 0 %_off next purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	will be ordering another pair very soon !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you so much .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy customer and telling all my friends !
Fashion_Accessories	i heard of diamond_geezer through a forum and so glad i dismissed my fears of buying something so expensive from the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	the guys called me to advise on the ring size as i initially ordered it way too big for the average female hand .
Fashion_Accessories	the progress emails are fantastic and regular and reassuring where other_companies might not keep you up to date .
Fashion_Accessories	and , the resizing process ( i had to get it resized for the perfect fit ) - what can i say .
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer received the ring on thursday_morning , must have resized , polished and re - posted it that same afternoon .
Fashion_Accessories	it was back with us on friday_afternoon .
Fashion_Accessories	unbelievable !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	the guys are clearly passionate_about their business and put in so much effort to make this big event for prospective couples seamless , stress_free and with a stunning end product .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely outstanding .
Fashion_Accessories	avoid the high_street , and have complete faith in diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased an engagement_ring from diamond_geezer after seeing them on dragons den and the update show when james caan visited them .
Fashion_Accessories	the choice is wide and the staff extremely_helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	the price is more_than competative to the highstreet and the quality of the product is fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d recommend them to anyone and use them again .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you for making_sure my sons costume got here before book day at his school .
Fashion_Accessories	he is very excited about wearing his musketeer costume !!
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll be coming_back again !!

Fashion_Accessories	a very good experience .
Fashion_Accessories	next_day delivery free of charge , and a the claims of ' no hassle returns ' are genuine .
Fashion_Accessories	moreover , the whole_process is very transparent with tracking options and a responsive customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	this review is based on a single purchase and return .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve been shopping at chemical for years now .
Fashion_Accessories	really good selection to choose from and i love the fact that nine times out of ten you get your order the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	from the very few minor problems that have arisen , they ' ve sorted it out very efficiently .
Fashion_Accessories	i do think they should reward their loyal_customers more often though , apart_from the recent tc promo_code there hasn ' t been much else .
Fashion_Accessories	also , wish they ' d put things up for pre_- order earlier like some other record shops do , it ' s the only time i drift to other shops .
Fashion_Accessories	but yeh , other than that , amazing shop and service
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased on the basis that select_specs were 0 / 0 the price of the high_street for designer police glasses and believed the sales_pitch and reviews that the lenses were the same .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve had several problems .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived a month after i ordered
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	despite the correct prescription being provided the lenses are extremely poor .
Fashion_Accessories	i got distorted peripheral vision which gave me headaches .
Fashion_Accessories	the advice on the website is to go to your optician and ask them to set them up for you .
Fashion_Accessories	not surprisingly my opticians told me to get on my bike as they didn ' t want to do selectspecs job .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	my opticians view is that the lenses are extremely cheap and as a result i have been experiencing the vision problems .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	the police frames i ordered were semi rimless and the lenses selectspecs provided were 0 - 0mm larger than the ones that police provided .
Fashion_Accessories	this ruined the look of the glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	0 .
Fashion_Accessories	there is no contact options except via e_- mail .
Fashion_Accessories	this become extremely frustrating when you have problems .
Fashion_Accessories	i have returned my glasses and 0 days in they have asked me the same questions again and i am no further forward .
Fashion_Accessories	my case is yet to be resolved .
Fashion_Accessories	we ' ll see how long that takes ..
Fashion_Accessories	so in summary i would say before like me you decide to purchase with selectspecs think carefully .
Fashion_Accessories	i will never purchase glasses from them or anyone_else online again .
Fashion_Accessories	life is too short !
Fashion_Accessories	ive used cr many_times over the last couple a years to purchase clothing and never had any_problems .
Fashion_Accessories	everything has always been delivered swiftly and in good condition
Fashion_Accessories	sunglasses - shop has all the information you need about your new sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	after searching the internet for prices for the sunglasses i wanted , i found that sunglasses - shop were extremely competitive .
Fashion_Accessories	not only that , they delivered my glasses the very next_day , which means a lot in terms of customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	i would not hesitate in recommending sunglasses - shop to other people .
Fashion_Accessories	ive used chemical on a few occasions whilst living outside of bristol and always recieved my orders well within the time_frame stated , and always arrives intact and undamaged .
Fashion_Accessories	recently placed an order now im living in bristol , and arrived either the very next_day or the morning of the second ( can ' t remember ).
Fashion_Accessories	once again very impressed with the layout of the website , the price for the quality and generally everything about chemical - records , word of mouth from friends is always positive .
Fashion_Accessories	will_continue to use them in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	highly reccommended (:
Fashion_Accessories	the ordering_process was simple and easy to complete , with a variety of payment_methods available .
Fashion_Accessories	the website is well arranged and easy to navigate with accurate item sizing guides and competitive_pricing .
Fashion_Accessories	the product was good and service outstanding throughout .
Fashion_Accessories	quick delivery
Electrical_goods	what i did find , however was a poor uncaring customer_service department .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve asked for a refund , but really , based on the experiences i ' ve had thus_far , i ' m not holding out much hope .
Electrical_goods	ordered saturday and received tues morning .
Electrical_goods	excellent communication_throughout , very pleasant_transaction .

Electrical_goods	very good initial sales support over the phone and the operator knew his stuff and didn ' t try to upsell to a more_expensive model of iem given these were a present for my sister .
Electrical_goods	ordered using royal_mail 0st_class delivery and it came 0 working day later .
Electrical_goods	this was especially impressive considering all the disruption caused by the heavy snow , but most_importantly well_done for hifiheadphones getting the order out within a few hours on the same day .
Electrical_goods	website is also aesthetically pleasing and joy to use .
Electrical_goods	will use again when i undoubteldy upgrade any of my cans or buy others presents .
Electrical_goods	so digitalrev have given me a canon_00d at £_000 cheaper_than the uk price and around £_000 cheaper_than the newer 00d which is not hugely different .
Electrical_goods	cant thank them enough .
Electrical_goods	dhl messed_around with the delivery but still received item less_than a week after purchase ( and would have been 0 days quicker had it not been for dhl in the uk ).
Electrical_goods	love the fact that the item came with an adaptor to charge the battery in the uk and the only negative is an instruction back in chinese .
Electrical_goods	however love the touch of adding the website to download one in english .
Electrical_goods	havent properly used the item yet but from first appearances and a few photos taken very happy so far .
Electrical_goods	the juicer is very practical , not too big or heavy , just enough ... works_fine and we enjoy juices and pulp as well ..

Electrical_goods	production_room is a great store full of awesome but competitively_priced gear .
Electrical_goods	the customer_service from their staff is second to none .
Electrical_goods	i always make the trip from doncaster to production_room ( leeds ) instead of seeking out audio_equipment locally .
Electrical_goods	00 / 00 will use every time .
Electrical_goods	s . d
Electrical_goods	i bought the amplifier at a great price , and although i found myself with a technical difficulty on arrival , that was due to my lack of inexperience .
Electrical_goods	hifi - tower emailed me back within a day or so and i was sorted !
Electrical_goods	0 / 0 for price / quality and speed of delivery !
Electrical_goods	i needed to transfer a lot of old photo negatives to positives onto my laptop and then print them .
Electrical_goods	the one i bought from hi fi tower worked_fine and was very easy to use .
Electrical_goods	the aga - t0 was delivered within 0 working_days with standard delivery , excellent service .
Electrical_goods	it performs superbly and was much_easier to set_up than other cheap re - buildable atomisers that i ' ve purchased before .
Electrical_goods	it really is extraordinary value for money .
Electrical_goods	a genesis style atomiser like this would have cost you a small_fortune a few_months_ago .
Electrical_goods	absolutely no leaks whatsoever .
Electrical_goods	its not for beginners but i highly_recommend it .
Electrical_goods	probably a good idea to also purchase some spare mesh and wire if you ' re starting out .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely give 0_stars !
Electrical_goods	but i received an_email instructing me to check the parcel and the content before signing :
Electrical_goods	====
Electrical_goods	important message : we strongly_advise you to check the parcel ’_s condition and contents before signing the delivery note . feel free to remove your product ( s ) from the box to inspect them , even if the outer_packaging doesn ’ t show any signs of damage .
Electrical_goods	====
Electrical_goods	the above message was in red and bold .
Electrical_goods	but when i received the parcel the delivery guy didn ' t allow me to open it ( obviously ) and said that i need to sign first as this is part of ups policy .
Electrical_goods	and to be honest , i think he is right ... how would you " open / alter " the package before signing ... you know , before signing it is still his responsibility and not yours !
Electrical_goods	be more clear next time .
Electrical_goods	other than that , great price and product condition .. so far at_least .
Electrical_goods	the service was brilliant !!!!
Electrical_goods	easy to place an order and they were quick to organise a delivery date .
Electrical_goods	the delivery company gave us a delivery time_slot to which they kept by it and were very helpful in bringing the product inside the property .
Electrical_goods	the staffs was very friendly and polite and will go out of their way to make_sure you are happy with the products you have brought and find other products that are similar if the one you are after is no_longer available .
Electrical_goods	i will use this again .
Electrical_goods	this was my first time ordering from digitalrev and it will not be the last , the price of the item was £_000 cheaper_than the uk and it was delivered in a couple of days .............. from bloody hong_kong how is that possible when companies in the uk can take a couple weeks sending something couple hundred miles_away .
Electrical_goods	have my eye on a canon 00 - 000 f0 or 0 . 0 now :_d
Electrical_goods	i purchased a nikon_d0000 from digitalrev . com , and it was an easy pleasant_transaction .
Electrical_goods	i received my item within a few_days from ordering .
Electrical_goods	as it was being shipped from hk , i expected more of a wait to be honest , but was pleasantly_surprised to receive it so quickly .
Electrical_goods	it was well_packaged and secure for the post .
Electrical_goods	the communication was top stuff , i received all emails and tracking_information asap .
Electrical_goods	not to mention that they have the best prices on the market for this piece of kit .
Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	the only_niggle was that the instruction manuals were all in japanese , however a sticker on the front of the manual directed me to a nikon web_page where i could download and print an english copy off .
Electrical_goods	so not a real problem at all .
Electrical_goods	cant_wait to purchase my next gear for this camera from these_guys .
Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	jim
Electrical_goods	from hertfordshire
Electrical_goods	it is the second purchase from this website . very well_packed and really quick delivery . i am really pleased and i will_definitely buy again from them .
Electrical_goods	vast product range , thorough and thoughtful customer_service both before and after purchasing the products which was very handy considering my inexperience with this level of camera hardware and software and highly competitive_pricing .
Electrical_goods	will be recommending to any colleague , friend or family in the future and have found my one stop_shop for all things camera .
Electrical_goods	i ordered a canon ef 00 -_000mm l from digitalrev and was more_than impressed with how quickly it got here .
Electrical_goods	i live in the uk - i ordered it on a friday_evening after work ( so around 0pm ) and it arrived monday_morning around 00 . 00am ; basically zero working_days !
Electrical_goods	even quicker_than amazon_prime !

Electrical_goods	did i mention their prices are really good too !
Electrical_goods	very competitive .
Electrical_goods	very fast delivery and really good price .

Electrical_goods	i think our prices are very competitive with the rest of the online_retailers .
Electrical_goods	of course i am a regular viewer of the kai entertainment series !
Electrical_goods	well_done to kai and his team on that .
Electrical_goods	you will be always my preferred online_retailer from now on , one suggestion though .
Electrical_goods	have you thought about keep a record of repeat customers and a may be overwhelm them with some inexpensive but a trademark goodie like a " digitalrev " mug when a customer spends more_than 0000 gbp in a years time .
Electrical_goods	just a thought ?
Electrical_goods	may be a goodie for the person who has this brilliant idea ?
Electrical_goods	regards
Electrical_goods	jishnu nandy

Electrical_goods	i would recommended digitalrev to anyone with low_budget prices are really good .
Electrical_goods	very efficient delivery - i had my item at the door within 0 days travelling from hk , so it beats some free deliveries within uk .
Electrical_goods	in the customs declaration the value was about 00_% what i paid , good way to avoid duty , but should anything happen ...
Electrical_goods	anyway , that ' s the beauty of ' grey market '
Electrical_goods	will i buy next time they have some grat deal ?

Electrical_goods	i found pixmania to be very easy to navigate through there website
Electrical_goods	picking items and paying for them online was simple .
Electrical_goods	delivery was very fast too
Electrical_goods	i was very happy with the service .
Electrical_goods	i made my mind up on the canon 00 - 000 l series based on my budget and the digital_rev review .
Electrical_goods	so happy with it and the delivery was super_speedy very happy
Electrical_goods	i chose to order from hifi_headphones because their website offered lots of advice that enabled me to make an informed purchase , also the support they offer gave me peace of mind that should any_problems occur it would be sorted .
Electrical_goods	i was kept well informed of the status of my order and the headphones arrived in good time and well_packaged .
Electrical_goods	i ordered the headphones as a present for someone_else and so i am unable to rate the product , but i am very happy with the purchase experience and would certainly shop there again next time i need headphones .

Electrical_goods	a big chunk of money for me .
Electrical_goods	roughly two and half thousand_pounds sterling .
Electrical_goods	to a random website store from honk kong ... i must be stupid right ?
Electrical_goods	well , the leap of faith paid off big time as i saved literally hundreds of pounds on rival company prices , the goods were delivered within a week and are in perfect_condition .
Electrical_goods	communication was spot - on , parcel tracking worked a treat , what more can i say ?
Electrical_goods	i ' ll be using them again .
Electrical_goods	fantastic service .
Electrical_goods	he never reply to your emails and he will never send the tracking_number .
Electrical_goods	i was forced to open a paypal_dispute and he canceled my account from his site .
Electrical_goods	stay_away from this store .
Electrical_goods	this website provide you with large_amount of products that you can choose from , with best possible deals available and good recommendation .
Electrical_goods	the shipping is fast and the product is in really good condition .
Electrical_goods	i had some initial apprehension about using an offshore company such as digitalrev for the first time especially around warranties .
Electrical_goods	i found a lot of reviews and success stories from acquaintances in a photography forum i am a member of and heard of people successfully using the digitalrev warranty when required to i decided to take the plunge and give it a go .
Electrical_goods	ordering was as easy as any ecommerce site but it was the delivery that blew me away .
Electrical_goods	dhl got the lens from_hong_kong to my house in 0 days !
Electrical_goods	and i had full tracking of where it was .

Electrical_goods	with their prices at approx_£_000 less_than on the high_street and other online_retailers you seriously cannot complain .

Electrical_goods	if you want to just try out the latest gear then thats fine and their product knowledge is amazing .
Electrical_goods	i have spent money with them based on in store recommendations and always been impressed !
Electrical_goods	i ordered a pair of replacement earpads for my headphones .
Electrical_goods	the confirmation and dispatch emails were quite funny .
Electrical_goods	the earpads were delivered promptly , and there was even a little surprise waiting for me with my earpads , which was sweet .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely_recommend hifiheadphones .
Electrical_goods	after a lot of deliberation about whether to order from here or pick one up locally , i eventually decided to ' risk it ' and save quite a bit of money by placing my order with digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	i needn ' t have had any concerns at all !
Electrical_goods	their communication from the moment i placed the order was great , and i was able to track my order from the depot in hong_kong right to my door in the uk .
Electrical_goods	it only took 0 days from start to finish and the camera is exactly_what i wanted .

Electrical_goods	great clean site with lots of information and good product shots , fast despatch and great order update notifications , plus the best price by_far on the web .
Electrical_goods	highly_recommended .
Electrical_goods	looking to start a long_term business agreement with them but wanted to find out some information first , everything i wanted to know was answered by ellie mcdonald so i really do advise this company to people
Electrical_goods	i was somewhat cautious with ordering from a foreign company , but i ’ m very happy i took the risk .
Electrical_goods	the price was excellent , £_000 for a canon 00 -_000mm , compared to £_000 on uk rivals such as amazon and john_lewis .
Electrical_goods	delivery was very fast too – ordered on tuesday_evening and arrived friday_morning using dhl_express tracker .
Electrical_goods	very happy with the lens and the service .
Electrical_goods	i will be buying again !
Electrical_goods	ordered the bundle pack for £_00 , a package that i would recommend to anyone_wanting to get into vaping .
Electrical_goods	comes with an excellent array of tips to experiment with .
Electrical_goods	wonderful vapour production when used with a 00 / 00 vg / pg mix and the battery_life is immense .
Electrical_goods	the only flaw that i found was that the imist , awesome as it is , does leak a tiny_bit so i found that i was using more liquid than i should have , but i was walking for 0 hours a day with it in my pocket , so that was probably a contributing factor .
Electrical_goods	arrival time was prompt .
Electrical_goods	woould and have recommended to friends .
Electrical_goods	you ' d be crazy not to use safer cigs for your beginner - pro vaping needs !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	ordered a 00 " full_hd led_tv
Electrical_goods	when i looked up in order history the tv became hd ready
Electrical_goods	then i tried looking for that tv to see if i had a mistake ordering it , but the tv wasnt on the website anymore and the one they sent out , the hd ready one wasnt on it either ... so in my conclusion this was a scam an nothing more .
Electrical_goods	i contacted pixmania and told them the situation , but they said that was what i ordered ... but it wasnt .
Electrical_goods	and they said that if im not happy i can give it to the delivery guy when it comes to my door , and they will take it and give me full_refund , but when the delivery came i wasnt at home at the time and my friend signed the papers for delivery and stuff .
Electrical_goods	my friend didnt know that i was going to send it back so its ok , but i was disapointed that i got no call informing_me of a delivery date or anything and for that i had to send the tv back trough post wich costed me 00_euros wich i doubt will be refunded .
Electrical_goods	im still_waiting for tv to be returned to france where they are based so i get my full_refund ... full_refund .
Electrical_goods	i had order a lens from digitalrev even tough the price was expensive than other_companies who are importing the products in uk , but they promised a delivery time of 0 - 0 days compared to others .
Electrical_goods	they undervalued the cost of the lens ( even lesser than half of the price i paid for the lens ), that it was held - up at customs .
Electrical_goods	i logged a ticket reporting the issue and then escalated , but no action was taken .
Electrical_goods	i finally managed to call their customer_services , which has ridiculous opening_hours ( from 0am to 00am gmt ).
Electrical_goods	i was promissed that it would sorted and the product would be delivered to me within two days .
Electrical_goods	even after several days past their commited delivery date , the product is not delivered and the most frustrating is that no efforts are made by digitalrev to get it released from customs and get it delivered , where in the responsibility of delivery lies with them .
Electrical_goods	update_: received call from digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	they promised to resolve the issue at the earliest .
Electrical_goods	fast & cheap & good !
Electrical_goods	what more i can say ?
Electrical_goods	top_notch customer care , really friendly guys , couldn ' t ask for better service .
Electrical_goods	headphones are sick too !
Electrical_goods	very happy customer !
Electrical_goods	really impressed with digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	so many bad things can come with ordering from foreign countries but they busted all myths .
Electrical_goods	i got a top quality uk product with guarantee , very well_packaged to withstand the modern airport baggage handler and arrived within 00_hours of ordering ( monday_evening - wednesday_evening ), way before expected .
Electrical_goods	i had questions i was unsure_about and got a non - robotic from the sales book response within 00_hours as well .
Electrical_goods	no_complaints and already been passing the name around the office .
Electrical_goods	thanks to all at digital_rev :)
Electrical_goods	ordered bose headphones from hispek - great price which nobody else could get near to .
Electrical_goods	had a request to call them about 00mins are ordering to confirm why i wanted the item send to an address which was different from my billing_address , good security .
Electrical_goods	item was dispatched next working day via courier .
Electrical_goods	received next_day .

Electrical_goods	but i have never felt as so valued customer before .
Electrical_goods	during conversation my baby was shouting in a background and what a surprise it was when among the stuff i have received there was a lolly pop for her .
Electrical_goods	that is a level of customer focus that you receive in a 0 * restaurants or your local_stores where you have done your shopping for last 00 years .
Electrical_goods	we had a chat about products and the information i have received was very important addition to what i have read about on the forums and in the reviews .
Electrical_goods	level of customer_service i have received is amazing but it was price and range of products that made me choose this site .

Electrical_goods	i ' ve used them a few_times to buy gadgets normally smaller hard_drives and the likes but with this tv now i wouldn ' t think_twice about ordering again .
Electrical_goods	i bought a dsi mopho from the production_room via amazon and though there proved to be a manufacturing_fault with the unit when it was delivered , the customer_service team , and particularly andy nolan , were extremely_helpful in collecting the faulty unit and chasing a replacement .

Electrical_goods	i was concerned_about many things , but mainly whether the product was new , did it come with a box , did it have a uk charger , would it work and whether it would arrive at all !
Electrical_goods	i ordered my camera on saturday and it arrived on tuesday .
Electrical_goods	everything perfect , as promised .
Electrical_goods	new , boxed , uk charger .
Electrical_goods	the box was opened before , as they put their warranty inside and ( i guess ) replace the japanese charger with the uk one .

Electrical_goods	no further contact by jan 00rd - two_weeks_later .

Electrical_goods	- they hadn ' t sent an_email , it wasn ' t on our mail server .
Electrical_goods	i asked for a refund , which they said would take up to 00 days ' because of banking regulations '.
Electrical_goods	funny how the payment can be taken out in moments .

Electrical_goods	they said they hadn ' t received any notification from me despite completing an order - referenced contact form on their web_site .
Electrical_goods	they said it would take five days to get back with an answer from the courier , they didn ' t get back at all .
Electrical_goods	they said they had sent an_email when they didn ' t .

Electrical_goods	as expected after_reading all other reviews , there were going to be zero problems with this company and i was right .
Electrical_goods	in fact my only_gripe would be with myself for ordering just a few_days before all the easter bank_holidays kicked in meaning i ' d have to wait for dhl to deliver !
Electrical_goods	the camera was as_described , all the menus and stuff on the camera were in english , it was a body that had come from one with a kit_lens in - not that i ' m bothered .
Electrical_goods	the delivery could be tracked all the way from_hong_kong right to my door_step , and included in my box was a small piece of paper explaining their warranty which is basically the same as any other company !
Electrical_goods	i fully recommend saving the money , the company was excellent and thoroughly deserve all the praise that they get !
Electrical_goods	i wanted a good price for my camera as i believe it ' s in great condition .
Electrical_goods	this was the best quote i could find on the internet !
Electrical_goods	there were no_problems in sending my camera across and i got an_email within a few_days about payment .
Electrical_goods	i have received my cheque this morning and i would recommend your company to anyone for very quick and reliable service !
Electrical_goods	i got a sharp 00 amazing tv more cheap tham ever .
Electrical_goods	pixmania is the best place to purchase something ever .
Electrical_goods	digitalrev is an excellent seller .
Electrical_goods	dispite being based in hong_kong and me placing my order on a sunday over here in england , my new lens arrived on the tuesday_morning .
Electrical_goods	for free delivery that is incredible , and faster_than most paid delivery options from other sellers .
Electrical_goods	the company has a popular youtube_channel that offers a funny and interesting approach to product reviews .
Electrical_goods	the website was easy to navigate and the price was £_00 cheaper_than everywhere_else i looked .
Electrical_goods	i am completely_satisfied , especially with their international 0 year_warranty .
Electrical_goods	this company is 000_% safe and trusted by thousands of customers .
Electrical_goods	i will_definitely be coming_back again !
Electrical_goods	buy confidently .
Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	i know the subject heading sounds_like an over statement .
Electrical_goods	but i ' m being completely serious .
Electrical_goods	i ended_up having several conversations with robin that lasted over an_hour each .
Electrical_goods	not that i ' d want to encourage it and make life difficult for them .
Electrical_goods	but the level of his knowledge is outstanding .
Electrical_goods	and his enthusiasm is utterly invigorating .
Electrical_goods	i feel_like i ought to ring periodically as a general pick - me - up to remind me that there are people out there with a remarkable passion for what they do , going hand in hand with absolutely thorough knowledge , understanding , good taste , intelligence , courtesy , and general friendliness .
Electrical_goods	i ' m not just a friend writing them a good review .
Electrical_goods	although they quickly felt_like friends .
Electrical_goods	robin convinced me to buy a pair of hd000 headphones along with a headphone amp .
Electrical_goods	and after my first listen , i ' m so completely blown_away that i really think they ' re going to add a whole extra facet of happiness to my life .
Electrical_goods	sorry if this sounds ridiculous .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve never written one of these reviews before .
Electrical_goods	i just wish all shopping could be like this .
Electrical_goods	it ' s not going to happen though .
Electrical_goods	these_guys just stand out for excellence .
Electrical_goods	and they deserve your business .
Electrical_goods	in short , i had to return item to digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	the customer_service advisor ( sam ) i spoke to via_email was very helpful and sympathetic .
Electrical_goods	when the item arrived back in hong_kong , they refunded me the total cost and then sent it to canon for inspection and repair .
Electrical_goods	canon ' s inspection said it wasn ' t faulty , but sam still offered to speak to management to see if they could cover some of the postage cost .
Electrical_goods	whilst the situation didn ' t go as planned leaving me a little frustrated ( canon saying there was nothing wrong with the camera ) this was not digitalrev ' s fault and they were very sympathetic .
Electrical_goods	if the item had arrived without the issue , which was not digitalrev ' s fault , then the service was second to none - 0 days from_hong_kong to the uk is amazing and their prices are very competitive !
Electrical_goods	i ordered sennheiser hd00 / headphones / few_months_ago ...( made in ireland ) and they ' re working pretty good !
Electrical_goods	what a quality .....!
Electrical_goods	ordered canon_000d on friday and it came on the monday - very pleased , also was the cheapest i could find without the worry of having to pay import_duties , as digirev take care of these .
Electrical_goods	unlike_other sellers digirev also offer free tutorials which again is great !
Electrical_goods	don ' t be worried to order , they ' re brilliant and i couldn ' t be more chuffed with the camera :_d highly_recommended !
Electrical_goods	*****
Electrical_goods	to be honest , i first looked up reviews of digitalrev before placing my order of canon_00d with 00 -_000mm lens .
Electrical_goods	the reviews made me feel so positive that i was comfortable spending the amount of money that i did for someone based out of hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	it ’_s unlikely that a canon product will be defective , but even if it does there is a 0 year digitalrev international warranty .
Electrical_goods	but i was more surprised with the speed that they couriered it .
Electrical_goods	within 0 hrs of placing the order , my dhl_tracking_number was updated on the website .
Electrical_goods	now , i dint expect that quick service .
Electrical_goods	placed my order on the 00th of december and had the camera with me on 00st ( would have got it on the 00th if dhl hadn ’ t delayed it !)
Electrical_goods	as someone rightly said in one of the reviews that i read , if one wants to give a quality service then you can anywhere from the planet .
Electrical_goods	later i told my friends about it , someone pointed it out that they were already members of digitalrev community .
Electrical_goods	i have already_recommended digitalrev to my friends and to my dad .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they send full instructions on how to remove all your personal data from the individual handset before sending it back to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the freepost_envelope arrives quickly as does the cheque once you ' ve sent them your phone .. there is even a choice of ways to be paid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really great company , would definitely use again and recommend !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would use them again a +
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma_mobile proved to be a considerably easy and quick process , within a day or two i received the necessary documentation to post my old phone to them ( free !)

Cell_phone_Recycling	no reservations_about recommending them to anyone and they paid more_than mazuma and envirofone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	superb and would trade with them again for sure .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cannot_fault this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they pay very competitive rates in the comparison_sites , but what drew me to them was that they pay the same day of receiving the phone direct to your bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you don ' t want to pay postage , you don ' t have to but i paid for special delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this money then went towards my new phone !

Cell_phone_Recycling	when i asked if my handset had arrived they responded with an_email_saying that i should not worry because my quote will not change because i have notified them of the date it was sent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if only every business was as decent as this !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found the prices were really fair didnt think i would get anything for my phones , and the pack and cheque were sent really fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i couldnt fault them on there service or how easy the website was to use .

Cell_phone_Recycling	before this i had it valued with envirofone . com who , because of the damaged outside , offered me £_00 , no thank_you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma_mobile are great !
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything was explained clearly , with as much care and attendion to details to make the whole transaction go smoothly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	from the moment i logged on , to the moment i got the money for my phone , each section was eplained , worked well and very understandable .

Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely_recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy and efficent way to recycle your old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recieved money just 0 days after my phone was collected .
Cell_phone_Recycling	initially i was skeptical_about these kinds of sites that offer fast cash for your old_mobile , but i was hoping to sell my iphone 0 to make a few extra quid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i read the overwhelmingly positive_reviews online about mazuma and thought i ' d give them a try .
Cell_phone_Recycling	suffice to say i posted my phone ( registered delivery ) at 0 :_00pm on wednesday and the money was in my account by 0pm on the thursday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	less_than a 00 hour turnaround !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was worried that the quoted price may change after the phone had been expected ( the phone was in working order but had very minor surface scratches and cracks ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	but no , the quoted amount was sent directly into my bank_account with no question .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process of making the order was really smooth and i didn ' t feel left in the dark at any time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	every_step of making the order was highly informative and plenty of options were given as to the method of posting .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as well as this , the terms and conditions were really clear and the important stuff was highlighted on the relevant_information .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended and would definitely use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brillaint service this is my second phone with a massive price difference from the first one and i have always got the full_amount .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phones in to mazuma but relised a few hours_later that i hadnt put in the order form , i rang them and the lady i spoke to was very helpful and sorted it out for me , and i recieved the money into my bank a few_days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will definatly use mazuma again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a bit_dubious using this sort of website but after spekaing to a friend who used mazuma i was convinced that they were legit .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was first_class from start to finish .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was offered a great price , able to send it back for free and the money was transferred into my account the day after my phone was received !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend iit to everyone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	super_fast transaction and money transfer ,..., no_problems what so ever .

Cell_phone_Recycling	nice to get some cash for something that is otherwise just sitting around in the drawer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy service to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t be more happy with the service .

Cell_phone_Recycling	its an easy to use website , with fast service and payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would really recommend the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service and prompt payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend this company to anyone - they do much_better deals for recycling your mobiles than other similar companiesaking to a friend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it only took about a week from the moment i confirmed it on the website until i got the money for the phone and it wasn ' t too bad a price considering it was a fairly old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as much as we may look upon these tv ads and large organisations as rip_off_merchants , i think it is now time for people to become realistic .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma have taken my phone , and put cash into my account , simple !.
Cell_phone_Recycling	they have given me a better price than any small retailer , and trust me i have been to loads over the last 0 weeks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so .......... get onto mazuma and let the small rip_off shops rott .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this company is a success for a reason , they are good .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a friend who had previously used mazuma_mobile had highly_recommended them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after using them myself , i have found the service extremely fast and excellent value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	by using the " print your own pack " option , the money was in my bank_account within 0 days !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will_definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received my envelope in the post and sent it and the whole_process was a breeze received my money the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_reccomended
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was really impressed with mazuma ' s service - the freepost_envelope arrived the next_day and the money was in my account the day after i sent the phone in and i was kept_informed of progress throughout .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i was kept up to date throughout the whole_process and i enjoyed the witty one liners on the emails .... will_definately_recommend this service to all my friends !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazumamobile
Cell_phone_Recycling	i hear numerous horror_stories about other_companies where you send off the product for them to rip into it and grade it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the price they display is never what you actually get .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however with mazuma as long as the product matches the clear to see requirements the price you are quoted is the price you get .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve sent numerous phones and always get what i ' m quoted .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent in my iphone in the packaging that was sent out to me which was easy to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then got my money for the phone straight into my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t be better !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick and easy to post them off , very good price for the phones and the money came quicker_than i thought .... only 0 days from posting them
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent
Cell_phone_Recycling	i probably could have got more money by selling the phones on ebay , but then i would have had to go to post_office to send phones out , plus all the hassle of non paying bidders etc , so in actual fact when you consider the ebay fees and hassle , mazuma was probably a better option .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was easy , straight_forward and hassle_free .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended and would definately use again in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i placed my order on friday , sent everything on monday ( free post ) and had my money into my bank_account on wednesday without any problem .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a mobile to sell ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	cant recommend mazumba enough , easy process and got paid the day the phones were received .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they do what they say , what more do you want ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	00 / 00
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service and fast delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only took about 0 days all in all to get the bag sent to me , my phone sent off and my money in my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would really recommend mazumamobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very pleased with the service i received from mazuma_mobile .

Cell_phone_Recycling	will only ever use mazuma now and have recommended to friends .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fair and fast service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	great communication .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was emailed when they had received the phone and payment was transferred into my account the same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	despite the fact that i sent my phone off a bit late , and that it had some minor_scratches on the screen , mazuma still paid me very promptly in full .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you ' d be hard pressed to find similar service elsewhere .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the mazuma website was easy to navigate - explained everything that was going to happen and even showed me how to clear all personal info from my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the transaction was fast , with the pre_- paid post bag supplied making everything trouble free .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was in the bank fast - couldn ' t be_happier !
Cell_phone_Recycling	my phone was 0 months old and worked_perfectly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent it to mazuma in a bubble_wrapped envelope , inside the normal postal envelope they send .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then i get an_email_saying it does not charge , then try ripping me off for £_00 less_than the offer they made me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	bunch of con_artists i will be reporting to trading_standards .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would have tried to talk to them but there lines are not open .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was extremely happy with the quality and the expedited service that mazuma_mobile provides .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i highly_recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_thing was dealt_with within the week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast payment_method really was fast !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would strongly_recommend using special or recorded_delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	call me paranoid , but i also used a brown envelope instead of the ' mazuma branded ' one provided , as i believe these are just an invite for people to pinch your handsets before they reach mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	otherwise , excellent service which i have already_recommended to family .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was so quick and simple - it took less_than 0 days from registering my old_phones to receive my money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_quibbles , no stress .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve already started recommending mazuma to all my friends !
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy way to make some money and get_rid of those old_phones in the house !

Cell_phone_Recycling	it couldnt have been easier .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service pleased with payment , no hassle , easy to deal with and quick payment
Cell_phone_Recycling	the process overall only took four days , that included me requesting a pack to send my mobile to mazuma in the post , mazuma recieving my mobile , and then me recieving my chosen payment option in the post .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i think the service is fantastic , fast and reliable and i would definately_reccomend it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i could easily keep_track of my order on the website so i wasn ' t in the dark about the process and from the emails i recieved and information on the website , it explained everything i needed to know so the process was easy , stress_free and fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i can ' t believe_how quick and easy the process was .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thought there must be a catch ... there wasn ' t
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	recived phone day after posting .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then got 0 emails over the day updating me on my order and had the money in bank by 0pm the same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma_mobile twice now to sell 0 old_phones and i have found their website useful - they send confirmation emails that eased your mind , and kept you updated with the process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s good to know that my old_phones are going to use elsewhere , and the amount i have been paid has been good .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is definitely a service i trust and will_continue to use in future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have recommended this to my boyfriend and friends too , who have all benefitted from this service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great prices for working and non working phones , fast delivery of sales pack and cheques .

Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' m always very sceptical of reviews .
Cell_phone_Recycling	were they written by the company ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	will it be ok for me ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	well , i had no_problems whatsoever with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i looked at several sites , some of which offered a fair bit more money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	but since mazuma has been well advertised and seemed more ' legit ', i went with them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	valuation was easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the bag came the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i popped my phone in and sent it off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the next_day i had the money in my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	bosh !
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy_peasy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d have no_qualms about using them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve thought about selling my old_phones for a while now .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i chose mazuma due to their other positive_reviews and was pleasantly_surprised at how smooth the whole_process was !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ordered the envelope from them , that arrived a few_days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received an_email a few_days_later as a reminder ( which is lucky as i had forgotten !
Cell_phone_Recycling	), popped them in some packaging and took them to the post_office .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a couple of days_later i received an_email_stating that they had arrived , a couple of hours_later and another email letting me know that they had been tested and that the payment would be with me by the end of the day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	00_minutes later the funds were in my bank !
Cell_phone_Recycling	could not be_happier !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve sold a couple of phones to mazuma and have had brilliant service both_times .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the reply package arrived within a couple of days of placing the orders and the money was in my bank_account within a day of them receiving it in their office .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a little concerned when i read the small_print , that when they receive your phone they may not pay the full price if they find any_issues with it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however , i needn ' t have worried as i received the full quoted amount .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole transaction was so easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they sent me an envelope , i popped the phone into it and posted it to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they emailed me to tell me it had arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they emailed me again to say that they had processed it and would pay me the full_amount on a specifed date via my chosen payment_method , paypal .... and they did !
Cell_phone_Recycling	perfect !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend to anyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	rubbish !
Cell_phone_Recycling	should have read reviews before using them !
Cell_phone_Recycling	after_reading reviews now it seems that others have had the same problem .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wonder_how many phones sent to them mysteriously go missing in the post ....
Cell_phone_Recycling	from start to finish , the process was simple and well explained .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the free post bag was a nice_touch as i never have a stamp so would normally not bother so is idiot_proof and great for the lazy person like me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the payment came quickly with an_email informing_me of its iminent arrival and the cheque cleared within_00hrs .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will be recommending this service to everyone
Cell_phone_Recycling	great !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick and easy to use and received my cheques very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	didnt get as much as i would have liked and 0 mobile we have didnt have any value but would recommend them :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	the process was very simple to complete and the credit was applied to the account quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my samsung_galaxy_s0 away for a guarantee price of £_000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however a few_days_later i was sent an offer of £_000 because the device tested faulty ( which it was not ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	in fact they had deducted over £_00 from the guaranteed price because of a very small crack on the corner of the device .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no where near the screen .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used to work in a phone shop and i know that this is classed_as slight cosmetic_damage not faulty .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i believe that a reduction of that much was unfair .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good service over all and very fast , however i won ' t be recommending them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this site is very simple to use , everything i wanted happened .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i must comment on how extremely easy the whole_process was from start to finish , and how mazuma_mobile send you regular e_- mail updates as to where you order currently stands .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definately use their services again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cheekily sold my 0s the day before the announcement of the 0 and even after the prices dropped , they paid the higher amount when i sent my phone in 00 days_later .

Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my phone into them perfectly_fine .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they send it back saying its faulty .
Cell_phone_Recycling	check my phone and the screen is completely damaged .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no compensation or anything .
Cell_phone_Recycling	joke of a company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	avoid
Cell_phone_Recycling	a lot_easier to use than i first expected .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received the money quickly too !
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definitely use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent 0 phones off to envirofone , the response and service was fantastic , would highly_recommend this service thank_you
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was quoted £_00 for a faulty htc one .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone was clearly damaged and did not switch on .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was then offered £_00 after review .
Cell_phone_Recycling	although this might seem like a reasonable_price for a faulty phone , the value of a damaged htc one is far_greater than £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i proceeded to send the phone to mazuma who offered and paid the full £_00 after inspection .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone will be disassembled and used to repair other phones for reconditioning and resale .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i do not recommend envirofone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i feel_like they were knowingly trying to hugely undervalue the phone and the more recent reviews from this site confirms that .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great prompt service , good communication of updates and swift processing of payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used envirofone several_times now and have never been disappointed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 ***** i love it
Cell_phone_Recycling	best service ever .
Cell_phone_Recycling	gave me a great price for my old phone .

Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent communication and service was so much faster_than_expected , would definitely_recommend !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	selling my phone to mazuma was so much_better_than trying to sell it on ebay .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got a great price , the postage was free and it was all done and the money in my account in 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was amazed at the speed at which i was able to sell my phone to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they sent me the bag and documentation within a day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then sent my phone the following_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was kept_updated at every_stage , via e_- mail , about the progression of my order .
Cell_phone_Recycling	before i knew it , the money was in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely_recommend to everyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great stuff .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was very quick and straight to the facts .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i compared the price offered to other comparitable websites and mazuma_mobile was by_far the best .
Cell_phone_Recycling	personally i used the bank_transfer method of payment and only had to wait a couple of days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would absolutely recommend mazuma to anyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sold my phone on the 00 . 00 . 00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was received on 00 . 00 . 00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it successfully passed_testing on 00 . 00 . 00 and the payment line reads " your payment was sent to you on 00 . 00 . 00 at 00 . 00 "
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have checked my bank_account every day for the £_000 owed to me and on the 0th working day thought something funny was going on .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i decided to email envirophone only to be told i am not receiving the payment until 00 . 00 . 00 , 0 weeks after i started this whole_process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will never use this company again , i will be telling everyone i know not to use them and if i hadnt been working all the time would have sold it on the high_street and got the money the same day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i asked for the phone back and was told i could not receive the phone back as the payment has already been sent !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	so in summary they have my phone and they have my money !
Cell_phone_Recycling	utterly disgusting company !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process from start to finish was very quick , this is the second time i have used mazuna and would definitely use them again .

Cell_phone_Recycling	quick , efficient service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted phone one day and received payment the following night , you couldnt ask for more for this company .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d half considered sending it to o0 because that ' s who i was with and they offered slightly more , however , i read some reviews which all said that o0 turn_around and offer you a much lower_price when they receive the handset so i didn ' t bother .

Cell_phone_Recycling	sold my galaxy_s0 for argos_vouchers , safe and securely with a free special delivery service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received confirmation e_- mail and passed test e_- mail next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received my gift_card in 0 working_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole transaction took less_than a week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after receiving my welcome_pack through the post on saturday i then posted my phone back to mazuma on monday_morning .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was made to me tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	could not believe_how quick the process was .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my phone was in perfect working order when it left - however , mazuma claimed it was damaged and not working on arrival to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	on top of this , i opted for argos_vouchers .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i did not receive vouchers , but a card which needs a 0000 number to be called to activate it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am profoundly deaf and unable to use a telephone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i merely use my mobile for texting instead of using a conventional phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they now have my mobile and i am unable to activate my cards - so i have lost out .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i won ' t use again .

Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to find the phone , helpful instructions .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the envelope arrived the next_day , it was strong enough to hold the 0 old_phones i sent off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recieved an e_- mail the day after i sent the phones off just saying my phones had been recieved and to expect payment in the next two days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i choose to give my bank_details and sure enough two days_later the money was in my bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you do not want to give your bank_details there is the option to just get a cheque sent to you , but as you can guess it would take longer to get the money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	all in all it was every quick and easy to do and if i will no doubt do it again when i get a new phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website was really easy and helpful .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it took literally minutes to sell my old phone and 0 day after a weekend to receive the return pack .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definately use this service again in the future and will recommend this site to anyone who is selling an old_mobile phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast payout , no hassle , used many_times before .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as stated on their website , as soon as they recieve the phone they pay you the agreed amount .

Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you :-)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i looked around at a few mobile recycle sites , and thought i ' d go with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent of for a postage pack which arrived within two days , i posted the pack on the friday and by monday the money was in my account and it was the amount i was told , alot of sites give you less money when they actually receive the phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great company , great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	000_% recommended
Cell_phone_Recycling	i almost sent my phone to envirofone for about £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fortunately , i used a price comparison site and fonebank offered me almost_double .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my phone off with the paid envelope and the money was transferred over quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	found the process really easy and would deffo recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i like the fact that if they dont think phone is worth what was quoted they send it back :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had my reservation about sending off a phone with the promise of money ( good money ) being paid to me , i needn ' t have worried .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole proses was easy and efficient , less_than 00hours from looking at the website to receiving funds .
Cell_phone_Recycling	one piece of advice though , post the phone special delivery , it will cost £ 0 . 00 but in my opinion worth is .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a friend send his standard royal_mail and it got lost in the post , and was left out of pocket .
Cell_phone_Recycling	special delivery is insured for up to £_000 and guaranteed next_day with a receipt .
Cell_phone_Recycling	incredibly surprised how well everything went , i was prepared for a bit of a haggle with mazuma over the price of my phone but they sent me an_email a day after i posted my phone saying a check had been posted for me for the exact amount i was quoted and the check turned_up the very next_day , very impressed , thank_you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was quick and easy to use and the entire transaction was smooth and efficent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the pack to send in my old phone arrived earlier_than i expected it to , and the money was in my bank_account the day after i posted it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a great price for my nokia mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma were extremely quick in paying me - was very impressed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i provided my details to mazumba mobile online on a sunday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received the postage bag on the tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted the mobile wednesday_afternoon and the money was in my account by the thursday - excellent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault at all !
Cell_phone_Recycling	hey there !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!....
Cell_phone_Recycling	the overall experience was awesome , fast response & so efficient !!!.
Cell_phone_Recycling	i first heard of mazuma_mobile services on a tv ad that i had watched , i thought to myself " why don ' t i give it a go " since i have a few non - working mobile_phones laying around , why not trade it in for quick cash .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so i did .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have never seen or heard of a fast response service that keeps to its word .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve even got my friends talking_about it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	awesome stuff , quality reassurance , customer friendly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the 0nd time i ' ve used mazuma and the service was very quick and easy both_times .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use mazuma again
Cell_phone_Recycling	even if got less money then i would of got from others providing the same service ... i wanted a hassle_free transaction without unwanted surprises and it was exactly how i expected it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you !
Cell_phone_Recycling	prompt payment
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely_brilliant service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	so quick , the money was in my account before i even knew about it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they also offered the best price for my handset .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definately be using again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	without any doubt , i recommend this to everyone out there
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was looking around to trade in my phone and found a site that offered me £_000 i looked up reviews on the site and so many people complained about them saying they never recieved the full_amount , so i decided to trade in with mazuma for £_000 instead and i ' m_glad i did i applied online recieved the pack a couple of days_later sent out my phone and within about 0days of applying on the site i had £_000 in my bank_account !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	more_than impressed !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	my advice would be if your looking around for the best trade - in price for what may seem maybe £_00 more you ' ll get a much_better deal and service with mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	as an untrusting , paranoid cynic , i ' d read reviews and looked at the small_print .
Cell_phone_Recycling	other_websites quoted various percentage deductions based on the phones condition .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mine was in reasonable condition , but had its fair_share of scratches .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma_mobile was straight_forward , honest with price and fast with the payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	faultless .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phone on saturday_afternoon and got the money for it on monday_morning .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they also offered the highest amount for it , so couldn ' t have chosen a better company !
Cell_phone_Recycling	typed in handset details and got an instant quote , bag came a couple of days_later - in it goes and bye_bye .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money in my account almost the next working day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy , reliable - able to track throughout .
Cell_phone_Recycling	used mazuma to sell three old_phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the process was really easy and very quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i choose the option to get argos_vouchers instead at this gave me more value back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	delivery was free and they kept me updated on each_stage of the process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	was very happy and am looking_forward to spending my vouchers !
Cell_phone_Recycling	have reccomended mazuma to friends and family already .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website is really easy to use , everything you need to do to send the phones arrives really fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they email you to let you know all was well and they also let you know when they post your cheque .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cant_fault this company , we will use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really prompt response , cheque was with me in no time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my new favourite website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to do online and payment recieved fast
Cell_phone_Recycling	got my pack the next_day after_placing my sell order .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i popped my two phones in the post ( i did through the post_office to get proof of posting ) and got the money transferred into my account on the next working day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so simple and fast to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only thing is the post bag , postage is paid but the bag has no protection for the phones so i wrapped mine in a little left over bubble_wrap just to make_sure they did not get damaged on the way .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very good service would use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 out of 0 for service xxxx
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy transaction .
Cell_phone_Recycling	postage bag and payment were received very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	exactly as_described , paperwork , emails very informative - done exactly_what was said wil use again
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sold my broken phone to mazuma as they buy these off you , i requested a pack to be sent to me and this arrived next_day , i packed my phone and sent it and had the money by the end of the week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was quick , easy and simple .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d definitely use mazuma again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phone special delivery and then between 00am and 0pm the following_day had four emails , two confirming the receiving and processing of my phone then the other two about the payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	there were no_quibbles at any point about the amount i was to be paid it was just put straight into my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	all in all from posting to receiving the money i would say it took about 00_hours and it ' s fair to say i was extremely impressed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma were great , fast , easy and hassle_free .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend to anyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	order was processed very quickly and money was transferred to bank same day as phone received !
Cell_phone_Recycling	top quality service !

Cell_phone_Recycling	fonebank gave me a higher quote than any other mobile trade - in site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the day after i sent my mobile off , they gave me a confirmation_email and 0 days_later the payment appeared straight in my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i couldn ' t be_happier .
Cell_phone_Recycling	honestly i had my doubts about mazuma , but , i have to say they are great .
Cell_phone_Recycling	whole_process from start to finish is seamless .
Cell_phone_Recycling	customer support is great !
Cell_phone_Recycling	always some one willing to help .
Cell_phone_Recycling	recommended to any doubters that are thinking of using any other similar company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only took a couple of days to send the phone in and get the cheque back , jolly good !
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the 0th or 0th time i have used mazuma and yet again they deliver a hassle_free , easy to use service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i always recommend to friends and family !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i simply typed in my details and a pack arrived in 0 days at my door with a pre_- paid bag to send my phone back in as well as clear_instructions as to how to pack my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone itself was , for lack of another word , fucked and they still paid a fair amount for it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you very much mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	i decided to enquire_about mazuma , after i accidentally caused a bleed in my phone due to dropping it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i hadn ' t owned my phone for very long and was gutted at what happened .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my phone was valued at £ 0 . 00 by mazuma in it ' s current condition .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and had it not been broken and still in working order would have only been valued at a mere £ 0 . 00 !
Cell_phone_Recycling	not recommended as devices are valued far too poorly , unless you are not really concerned at the amount offered for your phone , and would just at_least like to recieve ' something ' for it , however little .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was very happy with the service from mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i intially went to envirophone and despite only having the hanset only a month brand_new they tried to claim it had some damage and cut their offer by half !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was absoloutely appalled .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i requested it back and sent it off to mazuma instead .. they had it the next_day and i had the full payment in my account that day !

Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	to start i had reservations_about sending my mobile off , but these were to be short lived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma mobiles customer_service was simply outstanding .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and the most_important thing ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	the full_amount originally_quoted for my phone was in my account the same day i received confirmation from the post_office that they had received the handset !

Cell_phone_Recycling	nb : their is lot ' s of company who buy old phone and pay you bit more then mazuma_mobile , but when the pay time come you find out they are scam or making delay with the paymeny , so pleas read the review before you chose whom to sell your old_mobile .

Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma offered me the most money for my old phone , a blackberry 0000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	everywhere_else ( pawn shops etc ) were only offering my £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend this service to anyone_wanting to sell an old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	unless it is in perfect_condition where ebay is an option , mazuma is brilliant .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent in an old phone to mazuma and it was quoted at £ 0 because it was very old but i wanted it to be recycled and put towards a good cause rather_than me throwing it in the bin .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i requested the freepost_bag and 0 or 0 days_later it arrived swiftly in the post and i packaged the phone safely along with its paperwork and sent it back to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	two days_later i received confirmation that the phone had been processed and received .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast and effecient service and i am very pleased with how effectively the whole setup worked .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definitely be using again in the future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very simple to use and follow step by step instructions that are shown on the screen at all times

Cell_phone_Recycling	sent in my phone and cheque was received two days_later
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used money for your phone and they gave me the price they quoted , they didn ' t try and scam me like numerous other_websites of this type are trying to these days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you can use this team without_worrying .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i asked for a bank_transfer of the cash wich was supposed to be fast , instead recieved cheque which takes quite a lot longer to obtain the cash thanx mazuma for nothing , will be using enviro fone next time
Cell_phone_Recycling	this service was very fast and friendly , i wouldnt go anywhere_else to sell my old_phones
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma two or three time and have consistently found the service extremely simple and speedy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment is always prompt and even better now they cab send a faster pay payment directly to your account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i think they are great !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma was great , free postage bag sent out immediately and the return was smooth and money in the bank 0 days_later , very pleased
Cell_phone_Recycling	i did a lot of research into all the different companies that offer this service and for several key reasons mazumamobile came out on top .
Cell_phone_Recycling	- the website was easy to use
Cell_phone_Recycling	- they accept broken phones too ( i had my old iphone_0gs that would not turn on and still got £_00 !
Cell_phone_Recycling	).
Cell_phone_Recycling	- i sent my phone of with their pre_- paid envelope and they emailed me to say they had received it the next_day and by tea time i had the money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	- the price was not the best but it was less by only a couple of pence and considering everything else there is a value attached to peace of mind that puts them back on top again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely_recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	envolop was delivered quickly , and money came through very quickly , very good service , would use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	opted for payment via_bacs transfer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	notifications were prompt and payment arrived within agreed time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely_recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent off in prepaid_envelope and received money in account the very next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldn ' t have been more efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had a really good experience using mazuma , i was offered £_000 for my iphone_0g on monday , delivery envelope was received on tuesday and i had received my cheque for £_000 by saturday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a very fast and effective service from mazuma i cannot_fault them in any way and would recommend them to anyone who_wants to sell their old_phones and needs fast cash .
Cell_phone_Recycling	simple website , easy to follow_instructions , the bag for sending mobile back , was received next_day , payment issued within 0 days after sending mobile , great service !

Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wanted to sell my old sony_ericsson k000i phone , but was unsure what to do with it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then i saw the tv adverts and said , i must get around to doing that - post my phone off and get money in return .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i chose envirofone over the others as they gave the better price and looked a better company to deal with .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was not wrong .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i registered online , entered my details and found my phone using the imie number ( by the battery ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	the next_day i got a padded_envelope and a sticky address label ( postage paid ) to post my phone off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got an_email a few_days_later saying , they had tested my k000i and was working and would post a cheque out to me in a few_days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got the cheque and letter for envirofone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a brilliant service and i would highly_recommend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once the phones arrived the process went through in next to no time !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma stayed true to their offer and kept constant contact , i reccomened to everyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0_stars !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used them once before as well .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy , very quick , from filling in the online form to payment to my bank_account was less_than a week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	everything was amazingly prompt !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks :) x
Cell_phone_Recycling	there service and customer care received through mazuma_mobile is second to none !, even after a handset has been sold mazuma_mobile keeps you fully updated excellent service and customer care !
Cell_phone_Recycling	best phone_recycling company there is !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be telling all my freind and family
Cell_phone_Recycling	just received the money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it took a little longer_than i thought but i got the money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sorry for bad review
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to use website , simple process to post off my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fab communication at every_step of the way via emails .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very speedy bank_transfer !
Cell_phone_Recycling	all in all faultless ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	my only worry is with royal_mail .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i made sure i posted my device special delivery for insurance level purposes .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am very disappointed with the service which i received from this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used them many_times in the past however , on this occasion has changed my opinion i sent off a perfectly working phone with no damage !
Cell_phone_Recycling	however i was told this arrived with a cracked_screen !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	the fact they only give you a pathetic jiffy_bag and if dropped or chucked around by royal_mail can damage the goods i get penalised for it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	- what a joke so i was forced to accept a small amount for the phone or they return the damaged which has no value to me now .
Cell_phone_Recycling	secondly i wrote an e_- mail expressing my feelings as i disagree that i should be deducted the damage incurred through postage they haven ’ t even replied - what great service i re - sent the e_- mail 0 days_later as their auto response said a response within 00_hours and still no reply .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i put a read receipt on and a person called kayko ( or something like that read it and clearly just ignored it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have spoken to many people and this too has happened to them !
Cell_phone_Recycling	watch out as you won ’ t get what they offer you because apparently it will be damaged !
Cell_phone_Recycling	take photos of phone before sending to any phone place !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was kept_informed at every_stage of process
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick sending of envelope and final cheque
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a good price for item , reflective of age and condition
Cell_phone_Recycling	would reccomend !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	00 hour turn_around from posting to payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone away special delivery with an envelope provided and they paid money in to my account next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_messing_about !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma provided a fast and efficient service exactly as_described on their website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got the money exactly on the same day !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	keep up the good work !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you mazumamobile !
Cell_phone_Recycling	found six old_phones in my draws , sent them over and got over £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	registered , input phone details and waited for the packaging to arrive to post the phone in .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got the packaging a day later and decided to wait for the beginning of the week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i put my phone in a padded jiffy_bag then put it in the main parcel bag and took it to the post_office so i could track it and it was insured for upto £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the following_day i got a email_saying they had received it and it had been processed and i should expect the money within 00_hours , a few hours_later i had the money in my bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received a email 0 minute after they sent me the email_saying the order was complete saying they sent me a payment confirmation_email_saying they transfered the money via faster_payments .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this was much faster then i thought and they were the second highest price on the internet , the highest website didn ' t look very good and got alot of bad_reviews .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be using mazuma again in future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very good company , professional and never let you down , i am such a happy customer i ' ve sent 0 phones off in the space of 0 years .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recommend this service to anyone who_wants to sell their phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the money was in my account 0 days after posting mine !
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted phone to them and received the full money in my account the following_day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was a very easy service to use and i would recommend this to a friend or family or anyone that would want to have a quick and easy way of selling their old_mobile phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you mazuma_mobile !
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick transaction , the whole_process , from booking the order online , to receiving the money in my bank took about 0 days !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very impressed , i wish i had more old_phones to sell !
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service , got the money very quickly and got the amount my phones were valued at .
Cell_phone_Recycling	was very pleased i was able to make money from my broken phones !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was really happy with mazuma as it was all done so quick and easy and its exactly how its advertised so have no_complaints and completely_satisfied
Cell_phone_Recycling	great prices , easy to navigate website & fast response .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the only problem is that the packages sent out for delivery are sometimes too small .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the same size of package is sent out for six phones as well as ten phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it can be a tight squeeze sometimes .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was not the first time i used mazuma service and again they proved to be nothing less_than excellent really simple and speedy process no hassle at all .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will_definitely use it again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was excellent loved it :) thank_you x
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sell a used blackberry 0000 for £_00 which is reasonable given the speedy process in mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	does what it says on the tin , yeah you could get more on ebay ... but try selling a mobile on ebay !
Cell_phone_Recycling	impossible !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	no end of nigerian scammers bidding and not paying .
Cell_phone_Recycling	envirofone is easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received the best price with zoomfish , although i was a bit_wary as id never_heard of the company before - but i read some reviews which put my mind at rest .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( which is why im doing a review myself , for others to read ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was fast , easy and just brilliant .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was kept_informed of progress and money paid into my bank very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant site !
Cell_phone_Recycling	can ' t fault mazuma at all .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had the return packaging at my home within 0 days of applying and my money in the bank within a week !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the instructions were simple and the whole_process very straightforward .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma were very quick and very reliable , i sent my phone off in the post and 0 days_later the money was in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i also sent another phone off to envirophone to which they said the phone has a slight air line crack in the camera lense to which they offered me under half of what they said i would be given this has happened twice now with envirophone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i dont reccomend any one uses them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	where as muzuma are fantastic ive tried them a few_times now and they are fast reliable and are exactly_what they say they are but a bit better .
Cell_phone_Recycling	defininatly use muzuma mobile !
Cell_phone_Recycling	u cant go_wrong .
Cell_phone_Recycling	im a very satisfied customer !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	as before , service excellent and very quick despatch of postage pack and payment same day handset arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they advertise on their site about fast payments - i decided it would be worth to take a much lower payment than walking around second_hand mobile shops as it would only take 0 - 0 days longer and i could just send it off rather_than walking around town .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however , i sent my phone on monday 0th_july and they emailed me 0 days_later to tell me i would be getting my money on the 00th_july .... 0 days from sending is not what i was looking for ....
Cell_phone_Recycling	there are companies that can turn this around alot quicker , i wouldn ' t of sent them my phone if i knew it would take this long - i didn ' t need to sell it if i couldnt get the money within 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	total scam .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am really happy with my deal , good prise , fast money transfer to bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent the phone on the saturday , and the money was in my account on monday !
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant !
Cell_phone_Recycling	so simple and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	within a day the package had arrived , i popped it in the post and a few_days_later a cheque came .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no questions_asked , just perfectly straight_forward
Cell_phone_Recycling	good value for money , very quick and hassle_free service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would defiantly recommend mazumamobile to a friend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very simple process and the full_amount initially quoted was cleared in my account the day after i sent my phone in .
Cell_phone_Recycling	recommended .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have now used mazumamobile twice and have enjoyed both experiences as they are fast and efficient , i have had no_problems what so ever .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would highly_recommend the service they provide .
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely no_complaints .
Cell_phone_Recycling	super - easy to do , they transfer money to your account very promptly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast and easy way of making a few_quid for old_mobiles ya find laying about your house !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ll be using this service and recommending it to others , thank_you :-_d
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to use , good price paid for phone , and funds were in my account the day after i posted the phone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	though you may not get as higher price paid using ebay , there are no fees ( postage is free ) and it ' s hassle - free , no need to spend time creating an advertising page or dealing_with scammers .
Cell_phone_Recycling	recommended !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i registered on saturday , by the monday the envelope and details for posting arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i popped the phone back in the post as instructed and within_00hrs the money was being paid to my bank directly .
Flowers	so sunday came , no flowers , how very embarassing , and disappointing for my mother , when they did arrive they were already bloomed & starting to die .
Flowers	i contacted customer_service who ignored my emails , until they recieved 0 emails from me theye eventually replied .
Flowers	the reply was rude , & with numerous grammatical errors .
Flowers	they refused me a refund because i used a voucher_code ( which they gave me when i received flowers from them ).
Flowers	i suggest they dont give customers voucher_codes if they dont want to accept them !
Flowers	i would never use them again , too expensive for the few flowers you get , and very poor delivery service !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	ordered at 00am the flowers were delivered by midday - fantastic !
Flowers	i ' ve used serenata a few_times and have always been impressed with the punctual nature of the service though of late i ' ve taken time to read the emails and had to chuckle to myself .
Flowers	i would gladly use them again and i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend them to other people .
Flowers	a top_class service with a dash of humour thrown in .
Flowers	ordered flowers online from iflorist nothing showed up , they offered another redelivery and voucher but still dissapointed
Flowers	great fresh flowers every time !
Flowers	plus the delivery has never let me down after using these twice now !
Flowers	would definately_recommend .
Flowers	i ordered as a thank_you gift , the price for the amount of flowers was very reasonable and the bouquet beautiful .
Flowers	from order placement to delivery the communication was excellent and highly personalised to my order .
Flowers	all was delivered without a hitch and both myself and the recipient are delighted .
Flowers	many_thanks .
Flowers	i ordered the flowers the night before for my nan and they arrived as promised the next_day .
Flowers	she was so pleased with them for her_birthday and said that they were really unusual and beautiful !
Flowers	i ordered aztec sun flowers .
Flowers	thank_you so much !
Flowers	well i ordered some flowers for my fellow business owner ' s studio launch as a " good luck " not a problem for saturday delivery .
Flowers	however , 0 :_00pm i recieved a telephone call to state that they were unable to deliver the flowers , and they could try again for monday .
Flowers	unfortunately her launch party was today ( saturday ) and not monday .
Flowers	disappointment is an_understatement , i am so unbelievely upset that something nice i was trying to do for someone is completely thrown back into my face - they can offer me a refund , which is fine , but it doesnt rectify the situation .
Flowers	or the poor service .
Flowers	if they had called me earlier this morning , then i may have been able to find someone_else to deliver them .
Flowers	i will never order via these_guys again .
Flowers	flowers speak volumes , for once she was lost for words !
Flowers	placed an order days in_advance !
Flowers	was not delivered on time .
Flowers	family now thinks i do not care and took some convincing that i did make plans for stuff to be delivered .
Flowers	i am mortified that i had to make excuses for something i was prepared for !
Flowers	their customer_service dept is horrible .
Flowers	cant phone them , just this silly online thing .
Flowers	it took me throwing my toys to get a delivery charge refund !
Flowers	i will not recomend this company !
Flowers	please go to interflora !
Flowers	much_better !
Flowers	nice flowers delivered very fast .
Flowers	unfortunately no email was sent to confirm the order had been received , and the invoice is sent as a pdf attachment , which is much less convenient than just having the details written in the email .
Flowers	right , to set the scene - i had this date lined up with an absolutely_stunning girl and thought flowers were the perfect present .
Flowers	sadly this was not the case .
Flowers	now i ' m no connoisseur of bouquets , so i had no_idea of the quality .
Flowers	sadly the girl was a bit more educated in floristry than i .
Flowers	she took one look at these flowers and cried , and proceeded to throw them back in my face before legging it .
Flowers	her final words ?
Flowers	' not even a bee would go near those '.
Flowers	and that was it ...
Flowers	i believe this awful bouquet i received cost me my first choice wife .
Flowers	no but seriously , they were not the bouquet i was expecting by any stretch of the imagination , and i ' ll be using another florist in the future .
Flowers	my partner was very happy when she received the flowers and them red_roses were absolutely beautiful .
Flowers	i can only say thank_you serenata and i will_definitely use your service again
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my mother for mothers_day , received an_email_stating they will arrive on saturday .
Flowers	it didn ' t arrive on saturday hoped they will deliver on sunday .
Flowers	i waited and waited it never arrived !.
Flowers	i am so angry and disgusted , i will never order from iforist again , and will ensure i spread the word how unprofessional this company is .
Flowers	the fact i constantly receive e_- mails to remind me of what florist company i will never use again is annoying , the one time i attempted to use iflorist the delivery failed at first - basically it wasn ' t delivered at the desired date and time , so i contacted the company , not by phone to speak to a person , but by email , which is also ridiculous , surely the company has an office where someone can answer a phone ?
Flowers	the second attempt to deliver my flowers to my girlfriend also was forgotten about , so naturally i contacted the company once again .
Flowers	by this time the flowers were going to be a week_later than the desired date ( which wouldn ' t really have impressed my girlfriend , being one week after her_birthday ) therefore i demanded a refund , the only thing the company successfully achieved during this order .
Flowers	they took my money but never delivered .
Flowers	they have not replied to my emails and do not answer their phones !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	worst service i have ever received !
Flowers	avoid this company like the plague !!
Flowers	ordered 0 days ago still no delivery of valentines flowers that cost £_00 .
Flowers	rang twice and sent emails yesterday to get told they will be delivered !
Flowers	still nothing , and now they have closed the phone_lines !!!!
Flowers	order number 000000 !
Flowers	thanks for the great service !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered for next_day delivery , quick and easy to use service .
Flowers	no_hidden_fees .
Flowers	great communication all the way through from order to delivery .
Flowers	would recommend .
Flowers	i ordered 0 bouquets to give out to the mothers on my wedding day .
Flowers	they weren ' t the cheapest but i liked the fact they could be delivered to the venue without me having to physically go into a florist the morning of the wedding .
Flowers	i was shown the flowers before the wedding meal and i was extremely disappointed - not only did they already look half_dead there was barely any flowers actually in the bouquet - definitely not as many as was advertised on the website .
Flowers	i made the decision not to insult my parent / mother in law and told the venue to discard the flowers ( they really were quite pathetic looking ).
Flowers	i then sent one of my guests out to buy a nice bunch at the local_supermarket - cost half the price , were still alive and had a decent amount of flowers in it .
Flowers	i did contact serenata_flowers and they asked for images which i couldn ' t provide ( they basically got hidden behind a curtain out of embarrassment and i definitely didn ' t want to insult our parents by handing out such a crappy bunch of flowers and i didn ' t want to take them home with me either .
Flowers	they did turn_up when they are supposed to though - despite using the worst delivery company known to man ( yodel ).
Flowers	really bad_experience - would not recommend or use again .
Flowers	ordered flowers for delivery on monday , ( it now being wednesday ).
Flowers	after multiple messages to yodel to confirm the status of my package and countless assurances that my flowers would be delivered .
Flowers	i eventually contacted iflorist directly to only be cut_off in my first attempt to talk to an advisor and then only being offered a refund after being informed that yodel had in fact lost my package .
Flowers	despite talking to them that morning and them confirming that it shall be with me today .
Flowers	absolutely_terrible customer_service and well i can ' t really say anything about the flowers as they never arrived .
Flowers	avoid like the plague .
Flowers	i ordered a floral tribute for a funeral service last_week to be in the hearse and then placed outside with the other tributes .
Flowers	they were not in the hearse and did not arrive while we were at the service at all .
Flowers	myself and the other family_members are all witnesses to the fact that they were not there .
Flowers	as if this isn ' t bad enough , i have got in touch to obtain a refund and they are insisting that they were there and are at the crematorium for me to collect now ( a week_later !!).
Flowers	they have had me ringing the crematorium directly to check ( presumably because i ' m mistaken ???)
Flowers	and have fobbed me off on numerous_occasions regarding my refund .
Flowers	one week_later , still no refund .
Flowers	very upsetting and humiliating .
Flowers	don ' t entertain using them as they cannot be trusted and offer shocking customer_service .
Flowers	puntualidad en las entregas
Flowers	good service , nice flawers .
Flowers	i first used iflorist to send flowers to my sick mum in the usa , i have used other florists in the past but they are becoming so expensive and the choice of flowers are always the same .
Flowers	iflorist are a creative team who you can tell actually love their job by their posts on facebook .
Flowers	i have recommended you many_times to friends , sometimes it ' s good to search for better choices than stick to the ones that we know best .
Flowers	fab service :))
Flowers	i ordered the chocolate hamper for my mothers birthday , the order was placed 0 days in_advance .
Flowers	by 0 . 00 pm of the delivery day the hamper has still not been delivered .
Flowers	i have tried to contact the customer_service number provided on the webpage but it won ' t dial .
Flowers	i have contacted eflorist by email but have only received an_automated_response .
Flowers	i am completely disapointed with the service , and very embarrassed that my gift did not arrive .
Flowers	i wanted to get some flowers for a friend to brighten her day ; unfortunately , she lives in liverpool and i live in northamptonshire .
Flowers	i googled ' flower delivery liverpool ' to see if there were any local_florists nearby and came_across serenetaflowers which looked ace !
Flowers	i ordered the adore bouquet as she_loves red_roses and once they arrived i received a lovely text from her thanking me .
Flowers	she says they were absolutely beautiful !
Flowers	i ' ll definitely use this service again , thank_you !
Flowers	so it was my mother - in - law - to - be ' s birthday .
Flowers	i ' d already decided i needed to get her some flowers but i could leave the house due to having to wait for building regulations guys to come check out the work done on our house .
Flowers	i placed the order around 00am and , guess_what ?
Flowers	the delivery girl was knocking on my door by 0pm !
Flowers	i was absolutely amazed at how quick and easy the service was .
Flowers	though the bouquets themselves plus delivery is a bit much pricewise , i ' m still impressed at the service and will most_likely use again !
Flowers	vackra blommor levererade i tid
Flowers	very reasonable prices and speedy_delivery .
Flowers	gorgeous flowers .
Flowers	would recommend to others and definitely will be using again .
Flowers	it ' s now 00days later , still nothing .
Flowers	asked for a refund but hasn ' t arrived and i doubt it will after_reading the other reviews .
Flowers	total_con .
Flowers	i live in america and my mom lives in england .
Flowers	i am never able to have flowers delivered to her due to the high prices i am usually presented with online .
Flowers	i ' m really glad i found this place !!
Flowers	i was able to send her a very nice bouquet of chrysanthemums and chocolates for an extremely reasonable_price , with free shipping !
Flowers	she was overjoyed with them and said they were lovely .
Flowers	i used the chat customer_service twice , and while i can ' t remember the names of those who helped_me they were very efficient .
Flowers	i also liked the fact that they emailed me to notify me that the flowers had been delivered .
Flowers	thank_you , i will_definitely be using your services again !
Flowers	i purchased some flowers from serenata for mother ' s day and paid premium for sunday delivery .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn ' t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn ' t as special .
Flowers	when my mother opened the box , the flowers were on their side and looking really limp and fragile .
Flowers	the pot with some wadding in was bone dry and it seemed as though the flowers had been in the box for some time .
Flowers	when paying so much this is not acceptable .
Flowers	i wouldn ' t use serenata_flowers again .
Flowers	we have just returned from our_wedding in cyprus and used silk_blooms to purchase our flowers .
Flowers	the service we received from the beginning has been fabulous , mara would do anything to help you ( i kept adding on bits and bobs up to the last_minute ) and nothing was a hassle for her .
Flowers	our flowers travelled perfectly to cyprus and back to scotland .
Flowers	i would use silk_blooms again and would thoroughly_recommend them to anyone !
Flowers	ordered a bouquet of roses , lilys and sunflowers for my mum on mothers_day , selected the delivery date of mothers_day .
Flowers	recieved email the day before mothers_day stating they would be delivered today ?!
Flowers	this was obviously not what i wanted so i contacted them ( have not yet recieved a reply to the first contact i made ).
Flowers	saturday_morning the flowers arrived at my mums house , mothers_day she opened them .
Flowers	what had arrived was a disgusting bunch of yellow and white carnations !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	now everyone_knows that carnations are probably the cheapest flowers available .
Flowers	i used to work in a florist and so know this too well !
Flowers	my mum hates carnations !
Flowers	so do i and had i known this is what would be classed_as the subsitute for a bunch of gorgeous roses , lillys and sunflowers .
Flowers	i would never had ordered in the first place !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i contacted i florist on mothers_day to voice my disgust ... 0 days_later no reply ... contacted them again saying i have now sent two emails and recieved no reply .... no reply for another 0 days !
Flowers	contacted them again ... no reply !
Flowers	finally after two_weeks i recieved a generated message which must be sent to all saying they are sorry and value customer feedback ( which they dont ) i replied to this message again saying how i am not happy both with the deleivery date , the flowers , their service , basically everything about them !
Flowers	didnt receive a reply for another couple of days !
Flowers	then finally i am offered " a maximum gesture of £ 0 . 00 voucher " which is obviously no use to me as i will not ever use them again !
Flowers	i am still in the process of actually recieving a reply that is from a real_person ... looking exactly at my case and not just copying and pasting their ready made responses to complaints !
Flowers	i sent pictures of the flowers i had received but this has not been mentioned at all .
Flowers	the proof is there , just wish i could upload the pictures on here somehow to show you all .
Flowers	please do not use them - they will ruin whatever occassion you are sending them for and then do not even bother to reply to your complaint unless you do all the chasing .
Flowers	there are so many other genuine and caring florists available with great prices that wont let you down ... use them not iflorist !
Flowers	i ordered a premium service to have flowers delivered on mother ' s day .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on a different day , altogether losing that ' special ' factor to the gift .
Flowers	like many people on here , i ordered mother ' s day flowers for delivery to france last_week .
Flowers	despite numerous_calls and reassurances , no flowers were ever delivered .
Flowers	they are now " looking into it ".
Flowers	i have asked for a refund - according to my consumer_rights , if a delivery date was agreed ( which is was ) and the goods have not arrived by that date , that is a breach of contract and you can request your money back .
Flowers	i have been told someone will call me back in the next three days !
Flowers	i have reported this company to watchdog and would advise any other uk citizens to do the same .
Flowers	they cannot be allowed to get away with this awful service !
Flowers	ps you will notice after how every bad review there are a flurry of 0 star ones , all sounding quite alike !
Flowers	apparently iflorist have already been investigated for posting their own excellent reviews .
Flowers	i received a tin vase worth less_than £ 0 when i was meant to receive a vase that i paid £_00 . 00 for with my purchase of flowers .
Flowers	i contacted the complaints centre and offered to return this vase as it was clearly worth less_than was advertised .
Flowers	however all i received were some cut and paste replies from the company that completely denied any wrong doing .
Flowers	i ' ve sent three responses to this email over a period of three_weeks and have received no reply from them at all - what horrendous customer_service .
Flowers	i shall now be reporting them to the office of fair_trading for misleading marketing .
Flowers	absolutely deceitful and awful company - do not use !
Flowers	hi , im a student and wouldnt normally_write a review .
Flowers	i ordered for valentines and no delivery , and tried to contact with this company via_email and phone_calls , no response , i spent 00 . 00 on ordering from this website , and not only did they change my delivery date to the 00th ( after clearly having a confirmation_email_saying 00th_feb ) they failed to deliver on this date as well .
Flowers	if you were honestly considering ordering please do not order !!
Flowers	i normailly ignore bad_reviews on the internet thinking it was customers being fickle .
Flowers	do not order , do not order !!
Flowers	please tkae ym advice .
Flowers	arrived on the chosen date and my mum really liked them
Flowers	i just got a phonecall from my frail , upset grandma after she received a valentine ' s rose from me a day too_late , which was headless with dying leaves .
Flowers	she didn ' t want to tell me about it and had been wrestling with her conscience before calling , leaving her very stressed and confused .
Flowers	the customer_service assistant i finally got through to on the phone was very kind and apologetic , and offered a refund at once , but this really shouldn ' t have happened in the first place .
Flowers	terrible experience .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for next_day delivery .
Flowers	they looked nothing like how they were presented on the website .
Flowers	certain flowers were missing and some much smaller_than represented .
Flowers	they wilted after a few_days and did not last the 0 days guaranteed .
Flowers	when contacting them i they were not prepared to refund even with photographic_evidence and i was unable to obtain a refund even when submitting a dispute through paypal .
Flowers	overall i was very unsatisfied and would not recommend tele florist or eflorist !

Flowers	the webpage is easy to use and great for any given occasion .
Flowers	from the first moment you start to build your shopping_cart everything is simple .
Flowers	the follow - up emails that i received with a little sense of humor were a nice_touch even when there are so many of them .
Flowers	at one point i received three 00_%_discount emails for the same order .
Flowers	the only one and huge problem is the product itself .
Flowers	not only did i order a beautiful mix of flowers that looked awesome on your webpage but i order the deluxe version .
Flowers	and what i find out is that the person who received the flowers was delivered the vase the flowers and the balloon all separate and also there were just a handful of flowers .
Flowers	everything from the logistics planning to the customer_service follow - up are great ways to satisfy the customer , but if your product doesn ' t at_least fulfill your customer ' s expectations then the service as a hole will be lousy .
Flowers	i was trying to complain_about some flowers that i received yesterday from my son and his wife from serenata .
Flowers	they arrived with yellow leaves and looking quite dead looking and very sad .
Flowers	my daughter has made several_attempts to e_- mail photos and it keeps being rejected .
Flowers	not impressed !
Flowers	the link to reply with a photo has no way on the page to respond with a photo making a complaint impossible by seranata the comapny itself .
Flowers	it ' s very frustrating and costly trying to send photos by an i - phone ....
Flowers	i have found this company to be awful and in all my attempts to email a photo of the flowers has been rejected ... a complete_waste of my friday_evening trying to sort this out ... dont use this company
Flowers	really thrilled with the flowers , beautiful choices of bouquets and very speedy service .
Flowers	i liked the constant_updates by text so i knew when the flowers had been delivered etc .... only thing missing was the plant food .
Flowers	would definitely use again and recommend to others .
Flowers	not only do they fail to deliver valentines flowers as per their own 000_% satisfaction_guarantee , but they then switch the phones lines to a recorded_message so no one can get through to them and hide_behind facebook and twitter to respond to complaints .
Flowers	do not use ever .
Flowers	i recently_purchased a beautiful bunch of sympathy flowers for a close friend who is in mourning .
Flowers	as the property does not have a secure porch or external area , i requested that the flowers were left with a neighbour if there was no answer at the door .
Flowers	unfortunately this request was completely_ignored and i received a text alert stating that the delivery had been made and the flowers left ' securely at the front of the property '.
Flowers	i have no_idea where they were left but there is no accessible secure area at this property .
Flowers	not to mention the fact that the weather was appalling on the day in question , with heavy rain and winds , meaning that the flowers would be in no state to be fit for delivery .
Flowers	as it was , the flowers were never received , so i can only assume they were stolen or were delivered to the wrong_address .
Flowers	upon_receipt of the text alert , i immediately tried to make contact with your company and found it extremely frustrating that there was no telephone_number available .
Flowers	i therefore completed the ' contact us ' form and have received no correspondence since to give me any explanation or apology .
Flowers	well i ordered the bunch called wow as iv ordered them before for a friend and they arrived looking exactly as the picture .
Flowers	wow consistes of reds , pinks , purppless , green , yellow , orange roses .
Flowers	instead yesterday my little sister got delivered a aldi quality bunch of flowers consisting of yellow flowers mainly , a white carnation and a couple of purple flowers .
Flowers	awful colour match , awful substitutes not on the same value as the wow bunch at all iv requested a refund .
Flowers	another time i ordered from eflorist was mothers_day , i ordered sea breeze as it had gorgeous lilys and blue flowers .
Flowers	instantly when they arrived i was in shock , purple white and green weeds it appears is a suitable sustitute .
Flowers	had to quickly get online and ordered a beautiful bunch from serenata_flowers which where delivered exactly as they looked ( beautiful ) and were alot cheaper .
Flowers	eflorist said this was a suitable substitute .
Flowers	im only guessing the site is a con , offering gorgeous flowers and sending weeds
Flowers	disgusting vile service .
Flowers	they still_havent got back to me .
Flowers	hannah
Flowers	delivery service was brilliant , i recieved an_email on dispatch and also upon delivery , the flower was wonderfully presented !!
Flowers	the image does not do the actual product justice !!
Flowers	better_than i could of hoped for .
Flowers	after thinking i had received nothing today off my boyfriend , he rang and asked me if i ' d had a delivery .
Flowers	i said no and assumed they would be next door .
Flowers	after lot ' s of investigating we found them at number 0 - 00 houses out - on the doorstep !
Flowers	they had been delivered at 00am , i finally got them at 0pm - pretty_much dead !
Flowers	00 roses on valentines_day half_dead , especially after thinking he didn ' t care has left me and him upset !
Flowers	he works away during the week which makes it feel worse !
Flowers	i have tried_ringing them , i ' ve tried every number and each one just leaves a dead tone .
Flowers	please add me to your trading_standards letter - i ' ll be only too happy to complain !
Flowers	the service was quick and the website was easy to use .
Flowers	brilliant that delivery is free over mother day weekend .... thank_you thank_you thank_you x
Flowers	i wanted to surprise my wife at work and order the flowers from the site in the am for same day delivery ........ all now no delivery or response to emails .
Flowers	not even sure if i will get my monies back .
Flowers	i am truly disappointed and will not be using this service again
Flowers	please_note still_awaiting response from customer_services
Flowers	i am really really annoyed with the way the have dealt_with my order i ordered lilac and lime and got other order they cud have informed me really i wish i could have order something else i am really put of really put of
Flowers	better flowers from my two year_old picked from the park
Flowers	the only time you get a prompt response from this company is when you make your order , spend your money and possibly update your order .
Flowers	after that their customer_service is more or less non_existent .
Flowers	no contact number , ubless you have ordered with them and even then they dont pick_up the phone .
Flowers	i paid £_00 for flowers to be delivered in spain ( i live in england ) requested same day delivery .
Flowers	its now 0 days_later , i have recieved no confirmation of delivery email .
Flowers	i dont believe the flowers have got there .
Flowers	god_knows what i am going to do now .
Flowers	i should of just used [_external link_removed_] a like i was going to in the first place .
Flowers	thanks for the stress caused flora_queen .
Flowers	if you are happy to gamble with your money , like stressful situationsand generally like crap customer_service then please , use flora_queen .
Flowers	you have been warned !
Flowers	flowers where a gift to my nan for her_birthday and she loved them along with the little cake we included however they where delivered a day earlier_than requested when we kne she would not be in so nan had to go and collect them herself which wasn ' t great .
Flowers	simple ordering quick response from customer_service will now ditch interflora and use seranata , great value and my mother in law loved them !
Flowers	not only was i not able to place an order sucesfully via_paypal at the weekend ( apparently teething issues , which fine i can accept ), but the flowers that were delivered weren ' t even close to the image on the website .
Flowers	really don ' t bother , these were for my partners_birthday and i ' m so disappointed in the flowers
Flowers	wish i read reviews first ten i would of not brought from this company , i brought flowers from iflorist from my daughter to mum for mothers_day , first they were delivered earlyer then said , and when opening the box the flowers were all limp and the look like flowers you would buy from a garage fore court but at 00x the price and it came with a ballonoon which is a joke on its size , have left a email two days ago but they have not bothered to answer back .
Flowers	stay clear of this so called florist and tell your friends to .
Flowers	ik woon in engeland en wou bloemen bestellen voor mijn zus in amsterdam : de dienst was perfekt en de bloemen waren top kwaliteit !
Flowers	do not use !!!!!
Flowers	ordered for mother ' s day , confirmation order received to say it would be delivered on mothering_sunday .
Flowers	received an emai on the friday at 0pm to say they will be delivered on saturday .
Flowers	this is not mothering_sunday .
Flowers	called and spoke to a rude man , who told me it was better to receive them earlier then late or never at all !!!
Flowers	advised i won ' t get a refund .
Flowers	also then put down the phone on me .
Flowers	email sent to customer_services , which i ' m sure judging_by previous reviews might never be answered !
Flowers	had to explain to my mum why her surprise was now ruined , and why she now won ' t be getting any flowers at all .
Flowers	disgusted with the lack of customer_service given .
Flowers	do not use !!!!
Flowers	i am completely appalled at the whole situation , i have rang them three times now .
Flowers	all of those occasions i have spoken to poorly trained staff , who have never once apologised or offered any compensation .
Flowers	i have now ordered from interflora , a reputable company who i have used before .
Flowers	it goes to show a good price is too good to be true , because the service is shoddy .
Flowers	£_00 wasted , and £_00 i have been told apparently will be refunded when the " escalations team " reply to me , only if i refuse the delivery .
Flowers	which , isn ' t possible as its being delivered to a business address where my mum won ' t be on saturday !
Flowers	also advised that theres an option at checkout for gaurenteed sunday delivery .
Flowers	what a load of crap !
Flowers	i have gone_through the checkout_process again , and this option does not exist !
Flowers	useless .
Flowers	i will be reporting them to trading_standards , and i suggest looking elsewhere if you are considering buying from them .
Flowers	* updated on 00 / 00 @ 00 : 00 *
Flowers	just to update , i have had an_email from a manager stating that i didnt select gaurenteed mothers_day delivery , therefore will never get a refund .
Flowers	i have called , and asked the person on the phone to go through their process with me , as i cant see this option at checkout .
Flowers	when asked what website i was on , i told him iflorist . co . uk , he told me no thats the wrong one , you use m . iflorist . co . uk ( which i have checked now , and does have gaurenteed delivery option ) however , the usual iflorist . co . uk does not have this option .
Flowers	he told me i was lying , and that i needed to refuse the goods in order to actually get a refund , which i again told him was impossible , due to this being delivered to a business address and not a home address - so i have no control over who accepts it and who doesn ' t , as my mother wont be there today !!
Flowers	completely appalled with the service , so much for their no_quibble gaurentee !
Flowers	more like , take your money and run !
Flowers	i have reported them to the advertising agency , and will wait to be assigned a case manager for this .
Flowers	i will also be contacting_trading_standards first thing monday_morning .
Flowers	please_please_please do not use this company !
Flowers	they are a liability , and will not be in business for much longer if they operate like this .
Flowers	they are liars , and you will get a crap standard of service !
Flowers	save_yourself the time and money !
Flowers	emailed over a week_ago with a product enquiry , zero response .
Flowers	very poor ( non_existant ?)
Flowers	customer_service .
Flowers	i ordered a ' bouquet ' of roses for valentines_day for my partner .
Flowers	there was a change of plan on the day as i was working from home and i ' m_glad i was .
Flowers	my partner came in and told me she was thrown a box by the delivery driver who was rude and then she opened up to find some small stems with what looked like roses on the end .
Flowers	i was absolutely_disgusted with the product and delivery method .
Flowers	no where does it mention a delivery company will deliver these , not to mention ' in a box '....
Flowers	there was no effort made what so ever and the product was appalling .
Flowers	after complaining and sending 0 emails back and fourth .
Flowers	the company refuse to acknowledge what i am complaining_about and keep sending stupid responses to make there product sound amazing .
Flowers	part of the product is delivery and presentation to which no effort was made at all .
Flowers	the first thing they do is blame it onto the florist .
Flowers	no ... its not the florists fault !
Flowers	it is the fact the product does not match what is advertised on the website !!!
Flowers	image nor description .
Flowers	avoid this company with all means ..
Flowers	for £_00 i could of got a much_better bunch from asda and even £ 0 more_than what i paid would have given me an amazing bouquet from a florist and i know this through experience .
Flowers	i am now having to perform a chargeback through my card company .
Flowers	if i wasn ' t in when they were delivered , i probably would have got back to find the locks had been changed !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	update_: the roses are finally dead !!!
Flowers	well they didn ' t last long !!
Flowers	rip_off_merchants !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	thought this was a great website and overall service .
Flowers	was late in from work on the 0rd other flower websites would only allow to order until 0 for next_day delivery .
Flowers	your website till 00 was really useful and quite surprising you can still do to this time .
Flowers	flowers came well_protected packed and presented well .
Flowers	flowers themselves were very nice .
Flowers	delivery driver very pleasant .
Flowers	best of all was the funny emails i received as they had been sent and delivered .
Flowers	nice to go the extra_mile for a customer with things like that .
Flowers	made it a very pleasant buying experience .
Flowers	plus good price .
Flowers	defiantly recommend and would buy again .
Flowers	tom wells .
Flowers	i had ordered a bouquet of flowers and a box of chocolates to be delivered on my sister ' s birthday and on that day i got a message_stating that they had been delivered , but turned_out to be the opposite .
Flowers	not only did they not arrive , i had to ruin the surprise after asking my sister if she liked the flowers .
Flowers	how can you run a flower delivery business if you can ' t even send them at the promised date and time .
Flowers	never again !
Flowers	great service , quite fresh and lovely flowers .
Flowers	ordered it for my friends birthday and it was a surprise .
Flowers	she loved it but when i saw the greeting card i was disappointed .
Flowers	instead of nice greeting card which i paid for , it was the free card which was sent to her .
Flowers	it was too_late to do anything so i had to just deal with it and say nothing about it .
Flowers	i would definitely buy flowers again but would not trust with anything_else .
Flowers	received an_email_saying my flowers had been successfully delivered this morning , only to ring my girlfriend for her not to know what flowers i was talking_about .
Flowers	ruined the surprise and will now be looking for a refund unless they magically appear in the next few hours .
Flowers	extremely disappointed to say the least , i realise today is a busy day but i ordered two_weeks in_advance .
Flowers	will update if they appear ....
Flowers	i am very dissapointed with this website !
Flowers	its a total lie !
Flowers	i ordered flowers for a friend , i wanted somethig different but nice !
Flowers	they were flowers in a basket !
Flowers	but the ones delivered were absolutly crap !
Flowers	less flowers , looked messed not neat at all !
Flowers	they look nothing like what i had ordered , i paid decent money for quality not for something that looks crap , im very annoyed and will never be ordering flowers ever again from u ... sites like urs people should be able to trust !
Flowers	i want to put in a formal_complaint for the flowers that were delivered , i probably would have got a better service from morrisons ,!!!
Flowers	i came to serenata_flowers because i stupidly taught i would get my moneys_worth , i was just fobbed_off !
Flowers	ordered some flowers that were guaranteed for mothers_day .
Flowers	the flowers were never delivered .
Flowers	i spoke to customer_services and they called me a liar .
Flowers	this is unacceptable .
Flowers	i will never use them again and i would advise other people not to use them !
Flowers	delivery was very quick , although the driver did have to phone my partner to find her address , which spoilt the surprise somewhat - he could have phoned me or just checked google_maps etc ...
Flowers	also , the flowers looked fairly tired , which is a shame because at £_00 i ' d have expected better frankly .
Flowers	this is the second time i ' ve been disappointed with seranta ; i won ' t be using them again .
Flowers	ordered deluxe roses and lily bouquet 0pm and arrived at 0pm the next_day for free .
Flowers	my mother in law was over the moon and said they were really beautiful .
Flowers	very happy !
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	my flowers were not delivered on the day requested .
Flowers	when i complined they got back to me with a assurance of redelivery .
Flowers	i gabe them a second chance to deal with my order but they messed_up again .
Flowers	they keep forgetting ur order even after u complaint 000 times
Flowers	really not happy with this company i have sent so many emails about this and that i am getting sick of being ignored .
Flowers	the flowers was brown and dieing and not like the flowers on the picture and i never got the bubbly i order which cost me 00 . 00
Flowers	i spent £_00 . 00 on this company and got bad results never using this service again i have try calling emailing and calling the chat thing always offline got one email to send pictures as told and got nothing . i want a full_refund or i going take this further
Flowers	i ' m still_waiting for a response to my email or i will get trading standard '' s involve and watchdog
Flowers	it left my girlfriend speechless , so that ' s got to count for something !
Flowers	i was able to go on line with no difficulties , choose what i wanted and process within a short time .
Flowers	very user_friendly website .
Flowers	will be using it again soon !
Flowers	well firstly , this was meant to be a supprise , but the delivery failed as no access to the building , i questioned this , as the building is fully staffed from 0am - 0 :_00pm and had a reception with directions to deliver , i was told that the package was mis_- scanned and the driver came back and delivered the parcel within an_hour of my complaint .
Flowers	serenataflowers did a great job , flower are lovely and the girl i sent them too really really loves them , however her special supprise was ruined when i was forced to phone her before they eventually arrived to be on the lookout for a package .
Flowers	not happy with the delivery company .
Flowers	i ordered some flowers to be delivered to my parents who live in france for christmas .
Flowers	i was given a day and paid for them .
Flowers	they have never arrived !
Flowers	i have tried to contact them by phone and email .
Flowers	i was on hold for 00_mins with no answer - shocking customer_service !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i am really angry about this and would never recommend this company to anyone !
Flowers	totally disgusting !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	cant even get in touch with them to get a refund ................
Flowers	this is my second order with clare florist - order arrived on the specified day , in good condition .
Flowers	i would recommend this company without any reservations .
Flowers	dear christina
Flowers	email on may 00th :
Flowers	" dear christina ,
Flowers	thank_you for replying to our email .
Flowers	i have checked the details of your order and can confirm that the rose has been despatched form our rose nursery this week and will be with you very shortly if not already received . the tomato indigo rose is due to be sent the week commencing june 0 and will be received by the middle to the end of that week .
Flowers	please let me know if there is anything_else i can help you with .
Flowers	regards
Flowers	nathan timblin "
Flowers	nb : i called them directly a two days earlier and i was given different delivery dates , and the customer_service team admitted that my rose plant are already a week late .
Flowers	update on 00th_may : rose has not arrived and i ' m not counting that my tomato plants will be either .
Flowers	please could a member of sutton seeds contact me to arrange a refund asap .
Flowers	a very , very poor service .
Flowers	i ' m_afraid that i won ' t be using your services again in the future .
Flowers	ordered on the thursday , delivered saturday_morning as stated .
Flowers	quick response to my email enquiry , and very friendly tone .
Flowers	delivery driver very friendly too , which was refreshing !
Flowers	yet to give the flowers to the girl , but am sure she will be very please ;)
Flowers	thank_you very much !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	rich
Flowers	company kept me very updated on everything , from the time my order was made , till the point it was being dispatched and even to the point of where it had arrived .
Flowers	my girl arrived from work and saw a big bunch of roses , hasn ' t stopped playing with them since and telling_me how much she_loves them .
Flowers	i ' d suggest getting the bigger set of dozen roses , they can instantly fix any fight regardless how big it was
Flowers	great flowers .
Flowers	on time .
Flowers	good prices .
Flowers	also i once ordered an orchid from them and was mildly concerned_about a mail order plant from a species that often drops the flowers in 0 minutes and turns into a £_00 stalk .
Flowers	the arena_flowers one is immortal .
Flowers	it ' s still going strong !
Flowers	very pleased with flowers and had a very happy loved one who was so chuffed she sent me a photo of them !
Flowers	the flowers were gorgeous , however if i had not gone for a delux bouquet them i ' m not sure that there would have been enough in the bunch .
Flowers	delivery was very speedy , i placed my order on saturday_night for a monday delivery at no extra_cost and they arrived monday_morning , i received a text_saying they had been delivered .
Flowers	the only negative with the delivery is that my message said ' the flowers have been delivered and left securely at the front of the property ', i . e .
Flowers	had been left in a box on the front_door_step .
Flowers	overall great service and lovely flowers :)
Flowers	ordered flowers for my wife on behalf of our child for mothers_day .
Flowers	flowers arrived on the day ( at a charge ) in a box .
Flowers	on opening the box , the flowers were in , what can only be described , as a sad state .
Flowers	the roses were wilting with the head of one completely removed , the foliage was riddled with holes and chunks missing and remaining flowers looked dismal .
Flowers	the ' deluxe ' option was small .
Flowers	the 0000 number is constantly_engaged and their automated customer_service option fails to provide a response to any complaints made .
Flowers	biggest waste of almost £_00 , leaving myself and daughter thoroughly embarrassed .
Flowers	ordered flowers on friday for mother ' s day even paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to have them delivered on sunday due to living so far away from my partners mum , they waited in all day for them to be delivered and the flowers were a no show .
Flowers	called to complain and am still_waiting on hold 00_mins +
Flowers	i ordered flowers for mum ' s birthday and it was my first time ordering flowers online .
Flowers	the idea didn ' t sink that well until i actually had them delivered in perfect_condition .
Flowers	they were absolutely beautiful .
Flowers	not to mention the prices are reasonable too !
Flowers	i was quite anxious about the delivery , whether or not it will arrive on time ; but it arrived within 0 . 0 hrs after the despatching process was completed .
Flowers	overall , i was impressed with their service and would definitely_recommend it to flower lovers out there !
Flowers	i order my gf some flowers for valentines_day they turned_up but wasnt the right flowers i paid extra £_00 . 00 for luxury they suposed to have been valentine cupid with red_roses and lillies but wot i got was 00 red_roses and red berries i paid £_00 . 00 thinking they was going to be very good quality but i coud bought red_roses from the market for £_00 . 00 they are refunding me in 0 to 0 days but they said that on valentines_day so if i dont get refuded by next week i will be informing trading_standards dont buy from here total ripp off i coud get these better from interflora i will update when refunded
Flowers	ordered some flowers to be sent to my partner at her work for friday 00th_december .
Flowers	decided to choose the christmas kisses selection .
Flowers	ordering was quite straight_forward and with free delivery it seemed too good to be true ... well it was ....
Flowers	i decided to pay the extra £ 0 . 00 ish which stated ' guaranteed immediate email when flowers delivered ' as i thought well at_least that way i ' ll know everyone has gone_smoothly .
Flowers	well about midday i got a txt from my partner to say she had received that ...
Flowers	yet no ' guaranteed ' email which i paid the extra for !
Flowers	i emailed them ... no reply .
Flowers	i then got my ' guaranteed immediate email ' from them yesterday_afternoon to which i then forwarded this onto them stating they should at_least refund this charge to me .
Flowers	no reply .
Flowers	i went to visit my partner last_night and asked to see the flowers and oh my god iv never felt so embarrassed in my life !!
Flowers	they look nothing like the flowers i ordered .
Flowers	instead it ' s all green rubbish - i have no_idea what it is apart_from foliage i think it ' s called - i ' m not a flower person .
Flowers	but yes they looked dreadful !
Flowers	imagine my surprise when i then looked on here to see what the reviews were like and everyone is complaining_about the same_thing and that the company never reply to emails .
Flowers	well i ' m not gonna waste my time phoning the premium_rate number as i can ' t be wasting anymore of my money when they aren ' t in any way helpful or apologetic and don ' t seem to care .
Flowers	i ' m a team_leader in a call_centre myself and blimey if we treated our customers like that , we wouldn ' t have any and would have rubbish reviews like this !!
Flowers	seeing as our reviews on trust_pilot are 00 . 0 i think it speaks for itself .
Flowers	i florist need to get their act_together or they won ' t have any customers left .
Flowers	you are a disgrace !
Flowers	and i can ' t believe you don ' t even get back to customers who email you !
Flowers	disgusting service and i won ' t use them again .
Flowers	stick to what you know for future people
Flowers	i have given my scathing review of this company below , and it seems sooooooooooo many others were defrauded over the last few_days .
Flowers	this may help everyone , i finally have a refund for these_cowboys on the way - 0000 000 0000 - that is their phone number .
Flowers	option 0 - customer_service .
Flowers	i ended the call thanking them for ruining valentines for me and many others !
Flowers	:-)
Flowers	this is a review of the terrible service after ordering mothers_day flowers .
Flowers	i ordered these on friday the 00th of march and requested ( and paid more for ) delivery on sunday the 00th of march , mothers_day .
Flowers	i paid 0 separate delivery charges due to ordering 0 separate bunches for my mother , grandmother and aunt .
Flowers	well no flowers were delivered on mothers_day , or the day after ..... only my mother has received hers at 00pm today ( tues 0st april ).
Flowers	and they are of poor quality , stems are wilted and dying , they weren ' t even in water ?!?!?!?!
Flowers	they had a damp cloth around the bottom which is obviously not adequate or acceptable !
Flowers	i have tried in vain to contact them to complain and try and get a refund of some description , but to no_avail .
Flowers	0 separate calls to their helpline , which_resulted_in being held in queues for over 00_minutes at a time with no answer each time !
Flowers	i also tried the live_chat on their website - no answer and kept expiring my query and logging me out ?!
Flowers	i ' ve also emailed them , lets_see if that is any more successful ......
Flowers	overall extremely dissatisfied mothers_day flowers that just never came and when they did they were extremely poor quality .
Flowers	amazing bitching flowers
Flowers	i used eflorist in the past without problems when they were a relatively_small company .
Flowers	now they have grown they seem to not care about service .
Flowers	having ordered mothers_day flowers i received a text to tell me they had been delivered at 00 : 00 , this was a lie , they were not attempted to be delivered until 0pm on mothers_day , or what was left of it .
Flowers	the size of the flowers given what was spent was pathetic and they were all wilted having been driven around a van all day .
Flowers	immediately i sent an_email to eflorist to demand a refund and explanation for this poor deceitful service ............... as the time of writing this review i am still_waiting for a response .
Flowers	0 weeks_later ...... do yourself a favour and look_elsewhere as somewhere down the line they will let you down .
Flowers	if i could give 0_stars i would .
Flowers	ruined mothers_day for my mum .
Flowers	i ordered these flowers for my mother in law , time was against us so i used prestige - 000_% satisfaction , guaranteed delivery .... yep i fell for it all .
Flowers	i asked for these to be delivered on the saturday ( paid over £ 0 for this ), after checking the tracking detail , these were now going to be delivered on the sunday .
Flowers	not the end of the world i thought , someone will sign for them and she can collect when she returns to work .
Flowers	i have tried to contact prestige around 00 times , had 0 responses , your order has been delivered , the latest response , left in a security office .
Flowers	all security offices have been checked ( 0 ) i believe and no flowers have been received .
Flowers	now this may be the delivery company at fault , as i struggle to understand_why these were left in the security office during opening_hours . i have spoken to the delivery company who say that its down to prestige to open an investigation .
Flowers	i cannot get a response from them now , via phone , email , twitter or facebook , online_chat .
Flowers	they seem to have washed their hands of the matter , so they have stolen my money , not a small amount of money either .
Flowers	i want them to investigate , refund me , or at_least respond . dont ignore your customers .
Flowers	i paid for flowers , these have not been delivered .... sort it out prestige .
Flowers	its not about the money , its about a disappointed family_member who thinks we dont care , broken_promises , shoddy service
Flowers	highly_recommend service was excellent and was kept_updated all the time .
Flowers	beautiful flowers too and excellent value for money !
Flowers	ordered the flowers for a work colleague and she was absolutely_delighted .
Flowers	said they were beautiful and made her day .
Flowers	service was quick and hassle_free and was pleased with the email_updates on despatch and delivery confirmation .
Flowers	this was the third ( and last ) time i have ordered from serenata_flowers .
Flowers	the first two times all went well , that ' s why i decided to order from them even this time and to recommend it to my friends as well .
Flowers	today was my friend ' s birthday .
Flowers	she leaves miles_away so i wanted to surprise her with a flower bouquet .
Flowers	at 00 : 00 i received a text telling_me the order was out for the delivery , but at 00 : 00 still nothing so i emailed them and i was told at busy times orders can be delivered until 00 : 00 .
Flowers	even_though i did not think today was such a special day , i waited until then .
Flowers	at 00 : 00 i received a text informing_me the delivery failed because driver was unable to deliver on time .
Flowers	i sent a message straight_away through the website and the only answer i received was a request to specify the reason_why i was writing .
Flowers	so sent it again and now waiting for a reply ( and a refund ).
Flowers	i am very disappointed .
Flowers	when i read the order was sent via yodel i knew they would be trouble .
Flowers	but even serenata from their side should make it easier for customers to get hold of them .
Flowers	no phone numbers or emails provided , only a stupid form to be completed online each time .
Flowers	and even that one doesn ' t seem to work properly .
Flowers	when i complained the first time about the delay , they should have checked with the driver what was happening .
Flowers	at 00 : 00 is way too_late for anything .
Flowers	the surprise was spoiled and nothing will bring it back .
Flowers	i was waiting for plant over 0 month !!!
Flowers	faster could be from china .
Flowers	no respond to any of my emails !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	plant came with disease .
Flowers	i find the same plant in blackmoor much cheaper .
Flowers	i will never buy from suttons again .
Flowers	despite assuring me that prestige_flowers could deliver on mothering_sunday , i chose them as a flower delivery company because of this .
Flowers	i then paid for them to deliver on the sunday , happy that this would be met by htem as they had specifically advertised mothers_day flowers .
Flowers	to my horror , the flowers were actually delivered a day early and ruined my surprise completely .
Flowers	prestige_flowers used royal_mail to deliver the flowers , not a particular courier so it wasn ' t surprisingly they didn ' t deliver on a sunday !
Flowers	i then wrote to prestige_flowers explaining my upset and reminding them that their website states 000_% satisfaction guaranteed which i was not .
Flowers	the reply i received was most unhelpful and i was offered no consolation or attempts to keep me 000_% satisfied which is a guarantee they pride themselves on .
Flowers	after further e mails from my part i was eventually offered a measly £ 0 off my next purchase with them .
Flowers	i will never use their awful service again and urge you to do the same .
Flowers	all you have to do is a web search of the company and read the plethora of negative_reviews !
Flowers	quick and easy with fast delivery , flowers were truly appreciated .
Flowers	i ordered 00 red_roses ( premium size ) to arrive 00 feb for a price of £_00 . 00 .
Flowers	delivery time was fine ( notstanding the website didn ' t work properly when i ordered the flowers initially and i had to call their customer_services line to arrange a refund ) but when they arrive the quality of them was appalling .
Flowers	not only did they look nothing like the picture on the website , but the roses were tiny and the foilage was hardly noticable .
Flowers	i literally could have picked_up a better set at tesco for £ 0 .
Flowers	i ' m so disgusted i ' ve taken pictures and saved the image off the website and i am considering sending a letter to the oft .
Flowers	iflorist : i ' ve sent you an_email to the above setting out the same complaint , so please have the decency to respond .
Flowers	placed my order on tuesday_afternoon .
Flowers	received email confirmation and sms confirmation .
Flowers	received further confirmation on despatch , out for delivery and then finally when it was delivered .
Flowers	great overall experience
Flowers	flowers delivered on time and the recipient said they were outstanding
Flowers	serenata_flowers kept me up to date with all stages of the process , the flowers were great and they did the job far better_than i had imagined .
Flowers	great service .
Flowers	ordered these red_roses for ellen as it was our 00 wedding_anniversary 0n 00 / 00 flowers arrived mid morning very well_presented and a pleasant_surprise for her
Flowers	i usually use another very popular internet florist ( rhymes with tinterflora !)
Flowers	but they had run out of all mothers_day bouquet in my ( large ) town .
Flowers	this was a good week before mothers_day .
Flowers	i am furious so i tried iflorist with some hesitancy as i hadn ' t used them before and mothers_day is a high pressure situation .
Flowers	to my delight my mums flowers were amazing and delivered at the exact time they said theu would be ( on mothering_sunday for no extra charge ) and everyone was happy and delighted , especially my mum who had an amazing bouquet .
Flowers	thanks i florist for saving my skin .
Flowers	i think i will convert to you for all my flowers .
Flowers	i bought some flowers , chocolates , a balloon , a vase and a teddy_bear for my mums_birthday !
Flowers	once the flowers opened they were beautiful !
Flowers	i had my mum take pictures for me too see !
Flowers	everything arrived on time and in one piece and my mum also said the chocolates were delicious too !
Flowers	one thing tho is the lillie ' s only lasted a week !
Flowers	so them coming unopened really didn ' t make a difference in them lasting longer ... just made us wait longer to see the pretty orange flowers .
Flowers	part from that everything was great .
Flowers	will be happy to use this website again !!
Flowers	:)
Flowers	i was sending flowers to a friend for a wedding and was helped along the way by a sales representative via_email who was extremely_helpful :-) i will_definately be using eflorist again as it is so simple to send flowers and gifts to loved_ones without even leaving your home .
Flowers	the flowers are magnificant and fresh also .
Flowers	first_class service from start to finish .
Flowers	thank_you eflorist !
Flowers	ordered flowers for valentines_day , never arrived on the 00th and when delivered on the 00th contained the wrong flowers ( roses my fiancee hates instead of tulips ), a broken vase and chocolates instead of the balloon .
Flowers	to top it off the horrible roses we recieved barely lasted the day .
Flowers	raised ticket on the 00th and still not heard_anything back .
Flowers	i find it quite shocking that we never recieved anything to say there was replacement items , the delivery was late and they have not replied to my ticket .
Flowers	i expect a full_refund and apology .
Flowers	stated next_day delivery , and that is what i got .
Flowers	i received a text_saying the flowers had been dispatched and then another text when they had been delivered .
Flowers	very happy with the service and would recommend to friends
Flowers	i ordered some flowers from serenata_flowers .
Flowers	com as part of a valentines present which were described as deluxe along with a heart shaped balloon at a cost of £_00 .
Flowers	when the package was opened i found the balloon had been popped in transit and the flowers were no different to those being in tesco for £ 0 .
Flowers	i have left several messages to complain to which i have received the same response stating my flowers had been delivered on time but nothing in response to the popped balloon .
Flowers	if you have money to throw_away , feel free to do business with serenata because that is exactly_what you will be doing .
Flowers	it was easy to order some beautiful flowers , and the step by step updates allowed me to be aware of their dispatch and know that they had been delivered safely !
Flowers	the flowers were very much_appreciated and had numerous comments on their quality and beauty !
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	the flowers went down a treat , and i was particularly impressed by the communication - a delivery confirmation_email - as i was out of the country and this was great reassurance !
Flowers	i ' ll start by saying i am truly shocked by the number of positive_comments on this page ( even if a lot of them look like they were written by the same person ).
Flowers	i don ' t usually_write_reviews but the service i received from was so bad that i thought i would share in the hope that others do not turn their backs on other trusted retailers and order from iflorist .
Flowers	it started back on march 00th - as i usually do around that time of the year , i decided to order some mother ' s day flowers .
Flowers	after browsing online for a while i came_across iflorist - they had a nice looking website , the flowers seemed great value for money and they offered delivery on mothering_sunday ( for an additional £ 0 . 00 ).
Flowers	so impressed was i that i decided to place an order with them rather_than interflora ( who i have used before ).
Flowers	big_mistake .
Flowers	i ' d like to be able to comment on the quality of the flowers but quite simply they never arrived ( something i only found out late sunday_evening ).
Flowers	when i queried the disappearance with iflorist support i was told that the flowers had been ' lost in transit ' and that they would be re - delivered ( same flowers or new flowers i don ' t know ).
Flowers	i said this wasn ' t the point and emailed them asking for a refund and suggested they send something to my mother by way of an_apology .
Flowers	i then emailed them again asking for a refund .
Flowers	and again asking for a refund ( they are not very responsive ).
Flowers	eventually ( after contacting my bank ) i was issued with a full_refund ( or so they say ) but i sincerely doubt my mother will ever receive anything by way of an_apology from them .
Flowers	in the past i ' ve used quite a few different online florists and the service i have received has always been of an excellent standard ( something i expect when paying so much money ) and i wouldn ' t want to tarnish them with iflorist ' s brush but in short , if you are considering ordering from this company then don ' t - you would be better off buying flowers from your local petrol_station .
Flowers	buying process was simple and form easy to understand .
Flowers	range was good and special_offers made it all good value .
Flowers	my boyfriend ordered flowers from this company to give to me on valentine ' s day .
Flowers	after being told to stay in the house and await a delivery they never came , so my boyfriend had to tell me what he was expecting .
Flowers	i was appalled .
Flowers	the flowers didn ' t arrive until the 00th_february at about 0pm , by which time they were dead .
Flowers	i wrote a lengthy email to the company telling them about the incident and how it was unacceptable that a flower delivery service could be so careless .
Flowers	i received a dry and careless reply of about 0 words and then the status of my case was changed to ' closed .'
Flowers	in my opinion , a flower delivery service that cannot be on time on valentine ' s day is just a disgrace .
Flowers	yet , they barely bothered to say sorry .
Flowers	to add salt to the wound they offered my boyfriend a voucher for £ 0 off his next purchase .
Flowers	ha .
Flowers	like we would ever use them again !
Flowers	don ' t touch this company with a barge_pole .
Flowers	i was very impressed from start to finish , kept in the loop at all times and i have been told that the flowers were the most beautiful they had ever received : ) will be using again for sure !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for valentines_day and paid for delivery guaranteed by 0pm on the day .
Flowers	the flowers did not arrive until 00am the next_day , i was not informed that this would be the case , and the tracking link i had been sent was not working .
Flowers	i could not contact iflorist through their online customer_service as it said there was nobody online , so left a ticket , with no response .
Flowers	when the flowers did arrive , they were not what i had ordered , again i was not informed that this would be the case .
Flowers	because of this i opened another ticket to complain that now even_though the order had arrived it was late , and was not correct .
Flowers	i had no response to these tickets , despite updating them , until today ( 00 / 00 / 00 , 0 days after the original complaint ) and so used the online_chat service .
Flowers	i was told they would substitute goods when what was ordered was not available for something of equal or higher value .
Flowers	i accepted this , although it would have been helpful to have been informed of the change , even now the order does not state that what was ordered was not what was delivered .
Flowers	i was also told that the delivery was late due to adverse_weather_conditions beyond their control .
Flowers	that is acceptable , but i was not offered a refund on my guaranteed delivery until i asked for one .
Flowers	i will not be using the company again
Flowers	i would never ever use this company again ,
Flowers	worst company ever and not told when delivery did not go through ,
Flowers	do not use this company , go to interflora , only used because were cheaper and recommended , never had this problem with if ,
Flowers	will never use again ,
Flowers	complaining to everyone on this poor poor company ,
Flowers	save_yourself a headache and never use
Flowers	serenata_flowers add a little something extra to sending flowers to a loved one .
Flowers	i was so happy with their service and the personalised and funny emails i received were a special touch that made me smile .
Flowers	i would definately use them again :)
Flowers	awful ordered flowers for valentines_day a week earlier didn ' t turn_up no email nothing :-(
Flowers	i have never sent flowers before so i have no comparison for this service but it completely exceeded my expectations !
Flowers	right from recognition of order to the delivery of the flowers to my friend i received notification of the status of my order , both via text and e_- mail , which i found a very reassuring for a service that i have never used before .
Flowers	although i never saw the final product my friend said that they were beautiful .
Flowers	i am still_waiting to hear how yummy the chocolates are .
Flowers	i use the next_day delivery service which was a complete bargain compared to the extortionate amount of money other_sites are charging !
Flowers	i would definitely highly_recommend serenata and use again .
Flowers	thank_you so much !
Flowers	!
Flowers	very good !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	very good communication from serenata .
Flowers	helped with an issue with discount_codes and made me feel the most_important customer .
Flowers	the courier was polite and punctual .
Flowers	definitely_recommend using again .
Flowers	this was the second purchase for new this year !
Flowers	flowers delivered to my partner at her work , genuinely the bouquet looked pathetic and nothing like the picture .
Flowers	complaint made and received no response !
Flowers	the easiest_way to explain the quality of product from this company is to imagine buying a bouquet of gas station flowers and accidentally dropping them in petrol before setting them alight then leaving them on top of the roof of your car and driving off and waiting for a few weeks of cars to repeatedly run over them .
Flowers	going back , finding a dog defecating on them and then delivering the flowers to your loved one and actually having the audacity to pass them off as a £_00 bouquet .
Flowers	disgusting .
Flowers	oh , and the " customer_service " line that is open 00 / 0 has taken 00days to reply to my message ...
Flowers	so don ' t bother complaining .
Flowers	here a copy of the email i sent the company , this should explain everything .
Flowers	this is the second time i have had to contact you regarding this issue .
Flowers	the fact that you are responding to queries raised over facebook before the queries that have been raised via your website is disgusting .
Flowers	here goes , again .
Flowers	i ordered on the 00th_february_0000 , you guaranteed that my order would be delivered on valentines_day , it wasn ' t , you ruined valentines_day for fiancé and i . i paid £_00 . 00 , the flowers arrived today , in poor condition .
Flowers	i can safely_say that you are the worst company i have ever_dealt_with , you couldn ' t even answer my phone call yesterday , guess this shows how big of an issue this is and how many customers you have upset .
Flowers	i hereby request a full_refund for your incompetence .
Flowers	yours regrettably ,
Flowers	mathew
Flowers	lovely flowers arrived next_day and were wrapped beautifully , my mum was very happy
Flowers	i bought the strawberry sundae and oriental breeze from you .
Flowers	i was expecting a big bouquet , of beautiful blossomed flowers .. little did i know i as a student and money doesnt come round easy for me , was spending my hard_earned money on nothing better_than a bunch of flowers that looked like i bought them from a garage for nothing over ten_pounds .
Flowers	i made two complaints as both of the bunches i bought were a minuscule bunch of flowers and were ' waiting to bloom ' as one of your computers told me , to which i thought was a person replying to me but no it appeared to be a computer replying to me as i received the same message over and over .
Flowers	not only were the flowers awful , but so is the customer_service .
Flowers	i asked for a telephone_number and you declined me of giving me one and said the same excuse that i had previously heard twice saying ' we deliver the flowers at different stages of their lives '.. as far as i ' m concerned the flowers looked like i could ' ve gone to a florists and put them together myself .
Flowers	you advertise your flowers to be beautiful but is the opposite of what you deliver .
Flowers	i am extremely disappointed with the products delivered , the customer_service and how you go about dealing_with customers .
Flowers	i will not ever be shopping with serenata_flowers again and will not be telling my friends to use them either .
Flowers	also , my friend ordered some flowers of the same price to my house through inter flora , i sent a photo to serenata_flowers , the photo clearly shows a difference in the look , amount and care that has gone into them .
Flowers	serenata_flowers replied with ' the flowers are at a different stage of their life ' once again , i am so disappointed , not only for the people i sent them to as it looks_like i haven ' t even bothered to get them a nice bouquet of flowers , also i am very disappointed with your company as i trusted the company , to deliver good quality flowers to my loved_ones and i trusted them with my money which they have completely taken for granted .
Flowers	one star isn ' t even deserved .
Flowers	the communication with the company was good .
Flowers	i had a text at 0 in the morning saying my flowers had been delivered , then again at 0pm then they was delivered around 0pm .
Flowers	they was left outside my front_door , for anybody to come a steal .
Flowers	then at 0pm i received a text_saying that they had been delivered , but they was badly delivered 0 hours before .
Flowers	the flowers i had ordered was nothing like what i expected , they was dead and was a very small bunch of flowers .
Flowers	waste of my money and my time !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	roses were well_packed and delivered on time but it was a very small and pretty shabby bunch for £_00 . 00 .
Flowers	i could have got a much_better valentines bouquet for less_than half the price from morrisons .
Flowers	i live in the uk and sent some flowers to my girlfriend in chicago , us .
Flowers	arrived on time and in good condition , girlfriend loved the surprise !
Flowers	i don ' t normally_write_reviews but have seen theregister . co . uk article and hoped my experience would help .
Flowers	serenataflowers are great
Flowers	, nice packging , fresh flowers n yep birthday cake is nice aswell .
Flowers	.
Flowers	.
Flowers	erm just one thing i will say please on your site just allow the one who ordered to change or edit the recipent address before a limited time or may be one day before the delivery .
Flowers	nice deal n on time delivery just happy ;)
Flowers	many thanksss
Flowers	saqib
Flowers	they ' re professional and the website is really easy to use .
Flowers	i used same day delivery ordered at 0am and they were delivered by 0am .
Flowers	an absolutely fantastic service given from start to finish , initially stopping their journey to take my phonecall then keeping me totally in touch throughout the process .
Flowers	wildflower favours performed incredibly to get my 000 save the date cards sent out so quickly and when they arrived they were posibly even better looking than on the website .
Flowers	i can ' t recommend this company high enough .
Flowers	thank_you so much .
Flowers	my mother lives a few_hundred miles_away so iflorist ' s delivery service seemed like a great idea - a combo of flowers , chocolates and cards with guaranteed delivery by mothers_day .
Flowers	i received my order confirmation with a delivery date of saturday ... saturday rolled around with no phonecall from my mum .
Flowers	fair_enough i thought , they ' ll get there tomorrow .
Flowers	called my mum yesterday and she was disappointed that she hadn ' t received anything , and i felt_like a terrible daughter .
Flowers	i have since contacted iflorist via_email , through their support centre , twitter and facebook .
Flowers	they have ignored every message i have sent , and have even gone so far as deleting my a facebook message i posted requesting a response .
Flowers	absolutely_terrible company that i will not be going anywhere_near again .
Flowers	i expect a refund immediately , and an_apology , though with the level of customer_service i ' ve seen here i imagine i ' ll be fighting for it .
Flowers	oh , and if you want a laugh , have a look at all the photos of dead flowers people have received on twitter - it ' s hilarious !
Flowers	maybe it ' s a blessing in disguise that nothing was delivered .
Flowers	the colours shone through on the web_page dispaying the elegance and sophistication of every boquet combination , a joy to send to my mother .
Flowers	the process was simple and stress_free taking moments to secure a touch of brilliance for the recipient of the present - my mum
Flowers	ordered flowers and chocolates on 0nd feb for delivery on the 00th ( specifically ).
Flowers	had email to say delivery would be week commencing 00th .
Flowers	i am sending these as a gift to my long_distance partner and she is so disappointed that they have not arrived today .
Flowers	frantically tried to contact iflorist in every way possible but no reply .
Flowers	really disappointed with their customer_service and will never buy from them again .
Flowers	will re - post if by some miracle they arrive late today , however i doubt it .
Flowers	ordered a dozen roses to be sent on valentines_day a fortnight in_advance , only to be told on the afternoon of valentine ' s day that they could not fulfil my order , despite the fact they " 000_% guaranteed " it .
Flowers	shoddy .
Flowers	no option of a total refund , just a 00_% refund .
Flowers	so , they keep 00_% of my money whilst i am left aggrieved , with 00_% of the cost down , no flowers and a very annoyed girlfriend !
Flowers	rubbish .
Flowers	will not be using again .
Flowers	i was a little hasty when ordering flowers online for my mum for mothers_day , however i was very pleased with the email_updates_throughout my order and dispatch process , and my mum was over the moon with the results !
Flowers	especially the cute little instruction cards that came with the flowers .
Flowers	thankyou very much
Flowers	eflorist are a company i would recommend .
Flowers	the ordering_process is simple and effective .
Flowers	there were no_problems using this site to place an order unlike a very well_known florist .
Flowers	an_email to confirm the order was sent , which was good as it put my mind at rest , knowing that the order was registered , again , unlike a very well_known florist .
Flowers	the flowers were beauitful and it was a smooth_transaction .
Flowers	the discount was much_appreciated and the fact that there is another discount for my next order is great .
Flowers	i would recommend this company to anyone_wanting a smooth , simple , trustworthy and effective florists and i will use them again when i next need to send flowers .
Flowers	an_email / text confirming the flowers have been successfully delivered would be even better .
Flowers	there was no sympathy option for flowers to the us so i chose a florist ' s choice bouquet to send my condolences .
Flowers	i had emails from two people commenting on the beautiful flowers .
Flowers	sounds_like a good job to me .
Flowers	thank_you .
Flowers	when i came_across your website i was immediately attracted to the arrangements and the variety and for very reasonable prices .
Flowers	i was taken with you and found what i wanted immediately .
Flowers	i was very reassured receiving texts at every point of the transaction and really_appreciated the delivery options as my mum is not always guaranteed to be in .
Flowers	your choices of bouquets and arrangements are second to none and really different .
Flowers	i will_definitely use your services again .
Flowers	thank_you for making my mums day .
Flowers	je vois que_je_ne suis pas la seul à m ' être fait avoir !!!
Flowers	j ' ai_commandé des fleurs pour ma compagne habitant au royaume - unis avec une date de_livraison au 00 / 00 .
Flowers	j ' ai inventé un stratagème afin que celle - ci reste à_l maison pour pouvoir recevoir le bouquets .
Flowers	non seulement elles n ' ont jamais été livrées mais malgré mes e_- mails à floraqueen aucune réponse ne m ' a été faite .
Flowers	a fuir absolument !
Flowers	ordering was easy , delivery was fast and the flowers were amazing .
Flowers	00 / 00 , would recommend .
Flowers	wanted to send my aunty in france a thank_you bouquet so found iflorist online .
Flowers	they offered delivery to her address at reasonable rates .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on time in perfect_condition and she was very pleased with her surprise !
Flowers	will_definitely use their service again .
Flowers	ok correct me if i am wrong , i florist relies on you handing_over your money online and then the order being delivered .
Flowers	i don ' t accept the excuse that valentine ' s day is a busy day , if you sell flowers what the holy crap do you expect !?
Flowers	it ' s hardly a bloody surprise you have had at_least a year to sort your delivery line out .
Flowers	i ordered flowers yesterday , paid all the extra £' s to make_sure it was delivered and here we go nothing .
Flowers	i am looking for a reply iflorist ( i have lodged two tickets and tried to call you ), within the next_day or i will be reporting you to ts for taking all our money and then disappearing off into the sunset .
Flowers	honestly what a bunch of amateurs ; having a flashy website doesn ' t make you a reputable company , don ' t use these_jokers
Flowers	i ordered well in_advance a nice bunch of flowers for my mother to be delivered on saturday as she works on a sunday .
Flowers	it is now 0pm on the monday and they have still not arrived .
Flowers	i payed a lot of money for these flowers and feel totally let_down .
Flowers	when i eventually got though to iflorist on sunday_night ( they had been offline all day ) i got no apology .
Flowers	they gave me a link to the delivery tracking website which showed by flowers had been " in transit " since friday .
Flowers	if they do ever arrive the flowers will be approaching the end of their natural life .
Flowers	iflorist should not be taking our money if they cannot uphold their end of the bargain .
Flowers	had they said they could ' t deliver on the saturday then i would have simply sent something else .
Flowers	i have emailed demanding a full_refund and have not received any word back as of yet .
Flowers	very distressing interaction which has caused a lot of stress over the last few_days .
Flowers	i will never use this company ever again .
Flowers	given the number of other negative_reviews showing others being let_down also , i ' ve decided to write to trading_standards .
Flowers	love the flowers and delivery time
Flowers	ordered some flowers today for the mother ' s day weekend for my mother in law today and i always find browsing sites for items daunting but i must_admit that when i went on i found that what i would want is how it was all laid_out in front of me .
Flowers	like a sit_down brochure .
Flowers	i found something i liked really easy because of the lay_out of the pictures i even found a little gift balloon i could add .
Flowers	bonus too was they gave the offer of free chocs and a card .
Flowers	don ' t get that everywhere !
Flowers	anyway i ordered my flowers card balloon and put what i wished for them to put in the card and continued with ease to the checkout and voila !
Flowers	all done .
Flowers	instant email confirmation came through and not over stressed by the whole experience .
Flowers	probably took longer to write this than order . lol it ' s that easy .
Flowers	;).
Flowers	congrats on a site that ' s not confusing . com !
Flowers	;)
Flowers	last_year i ordered valentines flowers from iflorist for my girlfriend ... that arrived a day late with no apology or reply when i emailed their seemingly non - existent customer_service department .
Flowers	i then completely forgot about this and made the mistake of ordering from them again this year and guess_what , flowers for valentines_day delivered on the 00th despite them saying they would deliver on the 00th !
Flowers	seriously what is the point ?
Flowers	they even sent me an_email on the 00th saying how my flowers had been ' successfully delivered as requested ', are they taking the mick ?
Flowers	!
Flowers	and to make it worse the flowers were supposed to come with champagne , which they randomly substitued for bucks fizz with no warning .
Flowers	i sent them an_email on the 00th to complain but after last time don ' t expect any response , if anyone from iflorist is reading this don ' t bother_replying now i will make_sure i never order from you again and will tell anyone who asks me the same_thing !
Flowers	do not use this service unless you enjoy being left endlessly on hold once your order fails to turn_up .
Flowers	having ordered a bouquet for mother ' s day ( ironically at the recommendation of a banner advertising specifically mother ' s day services ) four days in_advance , i was surprised to learn that the next_day , my order hadn ' t turned_up .
Flowers	i emailed twice and received useless automated_responses and then decided to ring them .
Flowers	i was on the phone to an unhelpful operator who specified a ' technical difficulty ' which had prevented the flowers from being delivered .
Flowers	i quite reasonably requested a refund but again , my query had to be passed on to the ' customer_service escalation manager '- who sends one automated email to confirm your phone call and nothing more .
Flowers	after three days of no contact i decided to ring again to be told that a refund had been authorised - and yet i had not been notified of this .
Flowers	no email with an_apology , no compensation , not even a lousy refund confirmation .
Flowers	i wanted to show my appreciation on a public holiday for someone i care about - and the one service that they are supposed to provide apparently is beyond them .
Flowers	terrible customer_service , didn ' t even notify me that there was a problem with my order .
Flowers	i cannot stress this enough , do not order from them .
Flowers	my family received nothing for christmas as a result of ordering from this company .
Flowers	i ' m not someone who can normally afford to buy flowers in any case , so when i discovered that my flowers had not been delivered and then found them uncontactable i was naturally very disappointed .
Flowers	please do not use this company .
Flowers	at_least my parents got to see a picture of what they would have looked like and appreciated the sentiment .
Flowers	such a waste of money for effectively thin_air !
Flowers	i placed my order sunday_afternoon , and had an_email and a text promptly confirming my order .
Flowers	i had a further text and email early monday_morning to say the delivery had been dispatched .
Flowers	i had a final text and email a shortly_after confirming delivery .
Flowers	i also had a very happy mother .
Flowers	if only all service providers were this flawless and efficient , the world would be a much_better place .
Flowers	would not hesitate to recommend , and serenata will be my first choice for any future flower deliveries .
Flowers	thank_you .
Flowers	i purchased flowers for valentines_day on 00th_feb and paid extra for recorded_delivery for 00th_feb . my fiancee was at work all day and nothing arrived .
Flowers	i checked online today to find that an apparent attempt at delivery was made around 00 :_00am yesterday .
Flowers	this just isn ' t so .
Flowers	it ' s a training college for nurses and health practicioners .
Flowers	the doors are always open and at the very least , there is a buzzer .
Flowers	i have come to the conclusion that they were simply not delivered .
Flowers	apparently they are out for delivery today but i no_longer want them as a ) they are no_longer fresh and b ) i paid extra for delivery yesterday c ) the service i have recieved is non_existent and i am_appalled .
Flowers	i hereby ask that you don ' t deliver and i would like a full_refund .
Flowers	my fiancee is very upset and i am livid .
Flowers	i am now considering contacting my friend from trading_standards who will advise us further .
Flowers	regards
Flowers	alistair darby
Flowers	i ordered two of the fruit pastille bouquets for mother ' s day 0000 , described on the website as ' a collection of stunning mauve and orange coloured miniature gerberas , nestled amidst green trachelium and lime hypericum .'
Flowers	( see photo ).
Flowers	i chose these as i was fed_up with the usual pink & white bouquets .
Flowers	what was received by both mum ' s was a pink & white bouquet ( see photo ).
Flowers	i do appreciate that mothers_day is a busy time for florists & that stock may run low on certain flowers but i would rather have been told the bouquet i wanted was unavailable or out of stock so that i could choose an_alternative myself than for a pink & white bouquet that i didn ' t want to be delivered .
Flowers	the only saving_grace to my disappointment is that both mum ' s loved having fresh flowers delivered .
Flowers	el servicio es excelente .
Flowers	fue una excelente sorpresa para mi novia recibir el arreglo de noche , cuando no lo estaba esperando .
Flowers	todo salió perfecto .
Flowers	le encantaron los chocolates y el champagne fue mejor de lo_que esperaba , y por supuesto las flores hermosas !
Flowers	got my wedding flowers from silk bloom , such a personal service , adapting to what you need and very efficient .
Flowers	the flowers are beautiful with such attention to detail .
Flowers	i have had the same issues .
Flowers	no response to my emails , or telephone_calls .
Flowers	i think we should all get together and do something about this - does anyone_else agree ?
Flowers	the services was great and texted me at every_stage from taking the order online to dispatch and delivery .
Flowers	i would reccommend serenata to anyone and already have at work .
Flowers	thank_you for making my mum ' s birthday special
Flowers	if you can ' t keep up with the demand state this or do not accept more orders than you can handle !
Flowers	!
Flowers	it ' s valentines_day , i ordered my flowers to be delivered yesterday just in case and you couldnt even deliver it the day before !
Flowers	!
Flowers	made my order on the 0nd of feb !!
Flowers	rubbish .... now i ' m not happy neither is my girlfriend !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i would recommend floraqueen , i have used the service twice and may i say the customer_service was impeccable !
Flowers	super_fast response , order was delivered on the same day requested !
Flowers	mind you i was ordering from saudi arabia to be delivered into agadir , morocco !
Flowers	it was great experiance with positive_feedback and happy :)
Flowers	firstly let me know at 0pm on valentines_day that they would not be able to fulfill ( which defeated the object and forced me to go to a local_florist who gave me their last rose , but it was awesome !!
Flowers	), but would give me 00_% back , and double the roses , and 00_%_off my next order ( which i will not be using !!!).
Flowers	the roses then came the next_day squashed in a box , with two bunches of 00 ( very random ), all closed .
Flowers	when i complained was told that the outer petals are for protection , and that they ship them to give the maximum time to last , and 0 weeks on 0 out of 00 actually opened .
Flowers	awful customer_service , awful flowers , just plain awful .
Flowers	pay the extra and support a local_florist instead , totally worth it .
Flowers	brilliant communications , sending me texts keeping me updated with my order .
Flowers	flowers were beautiful , as expected .
Flowers	definitely_recommend !
Flowers	a friend of mine who has been suffering from a very bad bout of ' flu , received your delivery of flowers yesteday , as promised , and these have raised flagging spirits .
Flowers	i got a telephone call to say how wonderful and what a nice surprise .
Flowers	this is the first time i have visited this website upon recommendation from a friend .
Flowers	i am not disappointed !
Flowers	lovely interface , very pretty website and a expansive range of flowers .
Flowers	i am especially touched by the free chocolates that came with the order and also the personalised card .
Flowers	my grandmother is 00 years of age and is like a second mother to me so i want only the best for her , and i know that the rose is her most favourite flower .
Flowers	thanks to iflorist . co . uk i am assured that my gift to her on mother ' s day will make her so happy .
Flowers	i am now recommending this website above my previous favourites ( marks and spencer , interflora )
Flowers	thank_you very much !
Flowers	after ordering a bouquet of flowers for my girlfriend for the 00th_feb .
Flowers	the bunch that arrived were not the ones i ordered .
Flowers	so obviously i complained , can ' t ring only email which is annoying for me but the first response was apologising about the quality .
Flowers	i wasn ' t complaining_about the quality , i was complaining that the wrong bouquet arrived .
Flowers	second email arrived saying sorry for the confusion but wanted photos , that i sent .
Flowers	a reply asking if i wanted a replacement bunch sent or a 00_% refund .
Flowers	i ask for a refund .
Flowers	this was on saturday .
Flowers	i ' ve now sent 0 emails saying i wanted the refund with no response .
Flowers	all other responses were done within an_hour but amazing these emails have been ignored .
Flowers	very poor customer_service and actually just rude !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i paid 00 pounds for a dozen red_roses to be sent on valentine ’_s day .
Flowers	the product received consisted of 00 small roses which were in the process of decomposing with black and white marks all over the petals .
Flowers	go for 00 pound roses at a supermarket and save_yourself 00 pounds and a very embarrassing moment .
Flowers	daniel
Flowers	bright , friendly , well_laid_out website makes the whole_process of buying flowers easier ( being a man who_knows little of flowers , that ' s a big positive !
Flowers	).
Flowers	plus with the added_bonus of nectar points , i ' ll definitely be using the site again .
Flowers	i had 0 bridesmaids and 0 different wedding colours and a lot of variations happening but silk_blooms were fantastic , even wen i was confused by how complex it was all turning out to be , they were very organized and patient and the flowers turned_out better_than i had ever imagined .
Flowers	i highly_recommend them just like my friend_recommended them to me .
Flowers	if you ' re looking for artificial flowers for your wedding this is the place to go .
Flowers	i cannot complain_about the size of the bunch as it was big ( and i should think so after purchasing the grandissimo size but i dread to think how small the small size must be ).
Flowers	but what i will complain_about is that the bunch received contained only small yellow and pale pink flowers , not the large vibrant pink and reds demonstrated in the photo .
Flowers	as people usually use this service to deliver straight to a loved one i assume that the company believes they can get away with sending flowers that are similar to the ones the buyer believes they have bought in the likelihood that they won ' t actually see the product .
Flowers	i ' m quite disappointed by this but mum loved them nonetheless , so that ' s a bonus !
Flowers	really easy to place my order , confirmations throughout the whole_process to keep your mind at rest throughout the tense time before your surprise is delivered !
Flowers	!
Flowers	would highly_recommend this service : ) and will be using again no doubt !
Flowers	i could not be stronger in my recommendation that people go nowhere_near iflorist . co . uk .
Flowers	i ordered wine as a wedding gift , received confirmation that it would be delivered on the specified date ( i . e .
Flowers	before the couple got married and left to go on honeymoon ) but it didn ' t turn_up .
Flowers	i had paid extra to be able to track the order but all that the tracking said was that the order had been allocated .
Flowers	i tried to contact them online but online_chat just brought me through to logging a complaint .
Flowers	the only response i got from that exercise was a request that i be patient .
Flowers	nothing was delivered and i have received no further communication from them .
Flowers	the money was efficiently deducted from my account , which appears to me to be the only thing the people running this site are capable of doing .
Flowers	it ' s a very slick - looking site but is apparently run either entirely inefficiently or else by fraudsters .
Flowers	i will have to buy another wedding gift for my friends , which they won ' t get until they return from honeymoon .
Flowers	next time , i will ensure that i read all reviews of the company i use .
Flowers	this is a good company and i wouldn ' t use anyone_else now , having discovered them .
Flowers	great communication too .
Flowers	the flowers look lovely but scent is sadly absent .
Flowers	guess this is to be expected nowadays .
Flowers	pity .
Flowers	my bf paid 00 pounds for the flowers and paid extra on top on that to get the flowers delivered on valentine ' s day .
Flowers	it didn ' t get delivered until the day after , and the flowers were so small and half_dead .
Flowers	never been so disappointed !!!!!!
Flowers	never order from there !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered some flowers in november for the saturday before_christmas , asking the family to stay in so that they would receive them .
Flowers	i presumed that ordering them so far in_advance and for a few_days before_christmas would mean that there would be no_problems ... boy , was i wrong !
Flowers	they did not arrive , and after_speaking to three members of the online team i got no explanation of why they did not arrive other than the mysterious umbrella of ' technical_issues ', and got offered a voucher for £ 0 . 00 off my next purchase .
Flowers	the online_chat cut_off before i could receive my voucher , but after another 00_minutes with another member of the team i received it .
Flowers	i had worries about ordering from iflorist again , but ignoring my instinct i nevertheless ordered a new bunch for christmas_eve , asking the family to stay in .
Flowers	again , no flowers arrived .
Flowers	there was no email or contact from the company with any explanation , and after i spoke to the online team again , i finally got told that ' your product got out of stock ' and ' it should be tomorrow '.
Flowers	seeing as this was the second time i had tried getting flowers and it was too_late to send them now anyway , i just asked for a refund as there was no guarantee of them getting sent .
Flowers	i had to speak to two of the online team over a painstaking 00_minutes before i they said that they could not give me a refund without speaking to the warehouse .
Flowers	they invited me to ' come on chat tomorrow for the same ' to further discuss the issue , as ' due to hectic schedule we are unable to get back to most of our customers ' and they ' would appreciate if you can come on chat to sort it out '.
Flowers	thanks a lot .
Flowers	i still have not received any information .
Flowers	absolutely_fuming .
Flowers	i can understand_why there is no phone number , but i have found that the online team is slow with no tact or explanation .
Flowers	they are , however , better_than the email team who do not respond at all to issues .
Flowers	i do not usually complain_about companies , but was so appalled by the lack of communication and help with this company that i felt as if others should be warned .
Flowers	i purchased some flowers for my mum for mother ' s day and straight_away i regretted it !!
Flowers	! they took the payment for the flowers out of my account twice !
Flowers	i immediately contacted them about it and its been two_weeks and still i have yet to receive my payment back !
Flowers	not only that but they were also delivered 0 days early which is better_than late but still when i order flowers to be there on a certain day and pay for it i expect them to show up on that day !!!
Flowers	i will never again order from this company and warn_everyone_else to stay_away !!!!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered flowers for a friend ' s birthday which did not arrive .
Flowers	the next_day i spent over 0 hours trying to get the flowers delieverd .
Flowers	the phone number for customer_services is very hard to find on the web as they like you to submit emails to them which they say they will relpy to within the hour ( but actually makes things much harder to sort out ).
Flowers	i have so far sent 0 emails and have tried to phone their number which just appears dead .
Flowers	i have emailed them twice and asked them to phone me and have requested a full_refund twice .
Flowers	i have not had a call nor has the request for the full_refund been acknowledged although on their site it promises 000_% satisfaction .
Flowers	they have said that they will try to deliever the flowers tomorrow which will then be 0 days late for my friend ' s birthday , i will never use this company again .
Flowers	this is such an easy way to get flowers delivered to anyone !
Flowers	!
Flowers	easily select over so many choices .
Flowers	adding various accessories !
Flowers	fantastic , delivered on time .
Flowers	receiving emails notifying me when delivered .
Flowers	definatly using again !
Package_Service	online tracking very useful .
Package_Service	would recommend :-)
Package_Service	cant_complain at all
Package_Service	we ' re a regular user of parcel0go .
Package_Service	send many parcels all over the continent with them .
Package_Service	their live help is particularly_useful , particularly catherine , who helps with the order queries .
Package_Service	very good prices , can ' t be_beaten anywhere .
Package_Service	i have used parcel to go a number of times and can say that the chat_function is great .
Package_Service	have had a great service today from sammie_taylor
Package_Service	complete mess , courier couldn ' t be bothered to deliver my parcel .
Package_Service	neither courier or parcel0go wanted to listen to my complaint .
Package_Service	kept getting passed between the two .
Package_Service	avoid
Package_Service	even on late sunday_night my problem was resolved within the minutes .
Package_Service	katie was very professional and quick .
Package_Service	great customer_service !
Package_Service	vidas
Package_Service	i was connected within a minute .
Package_Service	my issue was that i had ordered a duplicate parcel , and needed to cancel one .
Package_Service	the service i received ( from sammie_taylor ) was very quick and polite .
Package_Service	very friendly and efficient customer_service .
Package_Service	all my queries have been responded swiftly .
Package_Service	thank_you very much , emma !
Package_Service	do not use dpd !
Package_Service	dpd are hands_down , the most unreliable delivery company in the uk .
Package_Service	i have lost two days work waiting for deliveries that never arrived .
Package_Service	on their online parcel - tracker , it claims i ' refused ' the delivery and therefore the package has been returned to the sender .
Package_Service	this is obviously complete nonsense .
Package_Service	i have read similar reports all over the internet and find it baffling that so many retailers still use this terrible company for their deliveries .
Package_Service	avoid at all costs .
Package_Service	they missed the collection date , then when i rang up to find out why , they had no answers , by the looks of the tracking the order had not even gone_through to the courier .
Package_Service	all they could offer was to collect the item another 0 days_later , which was 0 days after i placed the order - even then could not guarantee it was going to be picked_up .
Package_Service	i asked for a refund and the phone operator took on an attitude .
Package_Service	total disgrace !
Package_Service	* edit to add ...* far too many 0 star / 0 review for this company .
Package_Service	trust_pilot should investigate .
Package_Service	if they spent as much time woking on their service as they do bombing social_media sites ,, they might have a good company .
Package_Service	also , either they ' re incredibly racist employers , or they do not give their staff the dignity to enable them to use their real name .
Package_Service	has anyone spoken with someone on live_chat that didn ' t have a biblical ' white ' name ?!
Package_Service	all hints at what a sneaky , deceitful company this really is .
Package_Service	following a number of bookings for supposed ' next_day ' service , with such a low collection rate ( from collections in central_london - hardly the outer hebrides !)
Package_Service	it is clear this company easily maintains it ' s ' low ' rates by simply only managing to complete x % of the collections .
Package_Service	it ' s clear when you phone to complain ( after realising that the obvious move of allocating your failed collection to the following days service isn ' t automatically done !)
Package_Service	they clearly know and expect such a regular occurrence to be part of their business .
Package_Service	their review %' s are disingenuous ( almost laughable ) and simply an example of the fraudulent practices of this company .
Package_Service	i shall be reporting them to trading_standards as they are deliberately overstating their abilities .
Package_Service	do not use !
Package_Service	absolute_joke of a company , there customer_service is none existant , rediculous live_chat system allows them to disconnect the chat whenever they dont like what you have to say .
Package_Service	i asked 0 times to actually speak to a manager and was told they could not give me their numbers out , so i asked for the email address of the md and i was told he did not have one .
Package_Service	asked for a refund .......... got no response , asked for tracking_details ........ no response .
Package_Service	i really do hate this company and i will be so glad when i read that they have gone to the wall .
Package_Service	surely not long away now
Package_Service	i made an error on my parcel and p0g ' s sarah_hayes helped_me very quickly , best service i have had from anybody at p0g so far , she is great :)
Package_Service	i really love the p0g live_chat and the agent are very helpful .
Package_Service	my queries were resolved asap and i have saved a lot of money on phone_calls .
Package_Service	it takes seconds to connect to an agent .
Package_Service	i will like to mention sammie_taylor in particular for great customer_service experience .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	dealing_with sammie is always so easy as she knows what shes doing and susses the problems out instantly very good service thank_you craig
Package_Service	interparcel offers a fantastic service and is a worthy alternative to the usual royal_mail services for anything from small packet size upwards .
Package_Service	the site is easy to use and takes the hassle out of having an account with one of the couriers directly .
Package_Service	highly_recommended if you post anything .
Package_Service	sammie was great at helping me and done everything i expected an advisor to do :)
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	problem solved in less_than 0 minutes would recommend this company to anyone .
Package_Service	( well he would be if i ran the company !)
Package_Service	a huge thank_you to ben who has spent time and effort resolving a problem with the delivery of my parcels .
Package_Service	he was very professional , courteous and a credit to your customer_service team .
Package_Service	thanks ben !
Package_Service	wendy
Package_Service	quickly resolved the issue
Package_Service	after using parcels to go for some time , we have changed business premises , we were unable to book collections at our new address due to something that happened back a few_years_ago before we moved in , i have been in contact with the company before this time and was advised that they could not collect from out area , i have chatted today with emma , and she has managed to arrange our new address to be able to have collections again , which will now save us money on collection charges !!..
Package_Service	she went above and beyond her duty to help me and was also very helpful ..
Package_Service	thanks you emma , you have made my day !
Package_Service	very helpful , attentive and thorough service .
Package_Service	my rep , emma , answered all my queries and helped_me solve my problem .
Package_Service	i definitely_recommend their services to one and all .
Package_Service	thanks emma .
Package_Service	good service , affordable price and the live_chat for queries are straight to the point and answers all the doubts .
Package_Service	unfortunately my parcel went missing & after being investigated it could not be found .
Package_Service	philip marsh , executive service co - ordinator was very helpful and is very good at his job .
Package_Service	i have just spoken with jenny via live_chat and it was a pleasant_experience , veto professional and polite .
Package_Service	would happily use this service again .
Package_Service	good online service .
Package_Service	staff very friendly and polite .
Package_Service	very helpful in giving quotes and quick response time .
Package_Service	recommend !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i had help from hannah , she was thorough , extreemly helpful and seemed cheerful and happy to help .
Package_Service	i appreciated her speedy work to ensure that i made it out in time .
Package_Service	she was efficient and i would definatly recomend parcel0go .
Package_Service	organised courier for a ebay transaction , deliveree was out when supposed to be in .
Package_Service	parcel0go tried several_times to re - deliver , then came up on the tracking screen as awaiting instruction .
Package_Service	went_onto the live_chat , spoke rose who was very helpful and had sorted re - delivery out within 0 minutes .
Package_Service	many_thanks
Package_Service	catherine was extremely_helpful and professional .
Package_Service	she was thorough with her questions to enable an exact quote and emailed the details for later use .
Package_Service	she endevoured to find the best option for my customers needs .
Package_Service	i will certainly use the chat service again !
Package_Service	thanks catherine !
Package_Service	i have used p0g many_times and have always had great experiences .
Package_Service	the odd_occasion i did have a little issues it was resolved by sam very quickly so once again big shout out to sammy .
Package_Service	great service you have their keep up the good work .
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	matt - comms consult
Package_Service	i ' ve used interparcel maybe 00 times before - and about 00_% of the time there has been an issue .
Package_Service	the latest issue is that they have re - arranged collection 0 times now as the courier didn ' t bother coming to collect the parcel .
Package_Service	the email responses from the heads of customer ' service ' were bordering on obnoxious , and quite_frankly , i ' m seriously disgusted with the service and the manner in which i ' ve been treated .
Package_Service	i ' d rather take a cheese grater to my eyeballs than have to deal with interparcel again .
Package_Service	so far i only used the chat option to clear up some queries of mine .
Package_Service	daniel has been more then helpful and very speedy in his replies to me .
Package_Service	many_thanks
Package_Service	dani
Package_Service	answered my questions without any delay , i wasn ' t expecting live_chat to offer such good value .
Package_Service	i needed to send a parcel and catherine at parcel to go was very helpful .
Package_Service	she guided me through the whole_process .
Package_Service	will_definitely use again
Package_Service	i use this service a lot and it is hassle_free and great value .
Package_Service	i had a message came up with my last order to speak with a member of staff over live_chat .
Package_Service	i spoke with a lady_called emma and she was very helpful and polite and . manually entered a few details for me .
Package_Service	i decided to use collect_+ for the first time after trying to sell a few items to pay for expensive vets bills .
Package_Service	i used the standard two day delivery service and it was not overly clear to up the insurance value on the item ( my fault completely , assuming the claim was accepted )
Package_Service	i sent the parcel on 0st_july and the parcel was collected the next_day all smooth and clear , the parcel arrives at the national hub at 00 . 00 and that was the last transaction date .
Package_Service	i spend over an_hour on the phone to admin yesterday trying to track this lost parcel , how can a parcel get lost when it was packaged that no one would open it or see in it .
Package_Service	although i cannot see it it was taken to another depot the next_day at 0 . 00am , this doesn ' t show up on my transaction details and only came to light this morning after numerous checking !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i thankfully have a very patient ebay buyer which i am going to have to refund and be out of pocket because one of collect +' s light fingered staff on night shift .
Package_Service	sadly the packet was small and light weight enough to make it obvious that it was a mobile phone .
Package_Service	what a complete_joke , i can claim and if i win i will get £_00 back which means a refund to the ebayer of £_000 , ebay fees of £ 0 , collect_plus fee of £ 0 total out of pocket and having to find = £_000
Package_Service	thank_you very much no i am even more out of pocket !
Package_Service	i will never use your service again , i have sent 000 ' s of parcels through royal_mail standard non signed for and all arrived perfectly !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	avoid like the plague and recent feed_back seems that this is happening more_than it should !
Package_Service	very angry customer who is severely out of pocket now and struggling to find funds for vets !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	thank_you for your fabulous service and customer care , not !
Package_Service	i think you should be searching harder for this item !!!

Package_Service	having dealt_with parcel0go for sometime i can_honestly say that they have helped open doors for my business .
Package_Service	p_& p premier plumbing is a local , independent company , the majority of our revenue is generated from footfall in the store .
Package_Service	having recently entered the world of ecommerce but not generating enough revenue quite yet to compete with the ' big guys ' parcel0go offer everything we need .
Package_Service	we started out sending 0 or 0 parcels on the odd_occasion , now we send out 0 or 0 a day and hopefully this will only grow and grow .
Package_Service	parcel0go are quick , easy and a pleasure to deal with .
Package_Service	martin , our regular delivery driver is a top guy and samantha in the office always goes the extra_mile to help us .
Package_Service	even today , one slight error on my part was quickly and effortlessly resolved and that ' s very rare to find these days .
Package_Service	samantha answered my query within minutes and i was back on track !
Package_Service	parcel0go come highly_recommended and are an_absolute delight to deal with , whether you are a one off or returning customer , choose parcel0go .
Package_Service	used them twice buying items from amazon , kindle get stuck at their delivery hub for 0 weeks ( replacement by amazon delivered by dpd no problem ) then next order couple days ago sent by amazon to their delivery hub at gatwick and disappeared .
Package_Service	customer_service talking bullshit like " yes , yes we will send delivery tomorrow next_day nothing , next phone call same_thing tomorrow " order cancelled and replaced by amazon ( delivered by dpd on time messages about delivery time , online tracking extra service )
Package_Service	please for your own good do not use collect_+ >>>> ever
Package_Service	just have a look on other reviews this service is total trash
Package_Service	was connected to [_name ] on the live_chat who was friendly and helpful and answered everything i needed and more .
Package_Service	she answered my question and told me everything i needed .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	a +++
Package_Service	i had a problem i placed more_than 0 order for 0 parcel and i wanted to cancel them .
Package_Service	i contaced katie and she was a great help she helped_me to cancel my order and put the money back in my account .
Package_Service	she was a great help .
Package_Service	thank_you katie
Package_Service	spoke to dianne via live help today .
Package_Service	to clear up some queries on a tracking_number that didnt work .
Package_Service	within 0mins i knew what was going on !
Package_Service	she was very polite and i cant_fault her !
Package_Service	promote this woman !
Package_Service	i ' ve just pg0 a few_times in the past and never had issues ( i ' ve even recommended them to friends and family , but it ' s often said that you don ' t know how good or bad a company is until you hit a problem .
Package_Service	here is a overview of a issue i have just had with p0g ( this is a extract from the live_chat on there site , although i ' ve lost their responses )
Package_Service	hi there ,
Package_Service	this is in regard to order number p0g - xxxxxxx , which i have had an issue with
Package_Service	i ' ll give you a full history of what has happened so that you can see where i ' m coming from .
Package_Service	i placed the order on the 00 / 00 /_0000 with a collection date of 00 / 00 /_0000 .
Package_Service	on the 00 / 00 /_0000 at around 00 : 00 the tnt driver refused to accept the package as it was not in a cardboard_box ( it was securely bagged and taped however ).
Package_Service	i contact you via your live help system within an_hour of the driver refusing the collection to see what my options were .
Package_Service	i was advised that unless the item was correctly boxed , then the package would not be accepted .
Package_Service	on this basis , i was told the best thing would be to cancel the collection , accept a refund ( i was even offered an extra £ 0 credit if i took an p0g account credit ) and re - arrange the collection with someone_else .
Package_Service	so , this is the course of action i took and i had an_email confirmation that the refund had been requested by 00 : 00 ( less_than an_hour after the refused collection ).
Package_Service	i then arranged for an_alternative collection via another courier ( actually a man with a van service )
Package_Service	it then seems that the following_day ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) that the same tnt driver came back to collect the item again and this time accepted it ( without any changes being made to the packaging from the previous day ),
Package_Service	this is despite the fact that i had cancelled the collection with yourselves the previous day .
Package_Service	the item was the delivered to my workplace on the 00 / 00 /_0000
Package_Service	today is my first day back in the office and the package was waiting for me as expected , however i ' ve now got another company wanting to charge me for wasting their time for attempting to collect a package that has already been collected .
Package_Service	so a situation has been caused by p0g not cancelling the collection as agreed .
Package_Service	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package_Service	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package_Service	the customer_services were just not interested , they seem to think that it ' s acceptable for their driver to pick_up an item 00hours after the order had been cancelled and don ' t care that i ' m now looking at charges from the alternative courier i booked .
Package_Service	i ' ll make_sure that i , or anyone that i know , never use this company again .
Package_Service	paul mccaffrey
Package_Service	never_experienced such bad service in my life !
Package_Service	my friend ordered a package on river_island for my birthday , i live in the us , they live in england .
Package_Service	this was scheduled to arrive the day of my birthday 00th_may .
Package_Service	no sign of it .
Package_Service	still no sign for the next 0 days , and then my friend rings up , they decide to then tell us we have to pay duty on the items ordered , apparently it ' s in the small_print ... why wasn ' t it made clear so that the package wouldn ' t be held up ?
Package_Service	no one informed us it was even held up .
Package_Service	when asked what would have happened had this not been paid we are informed that it would have just been sent back to the uk .
Package_Service	i think it is completely appauling that they didn ' t tell us this !
Package_Service	why would they not make this clear and let us pay when we pay for delivery ???
Package_Service	how were we supposed to pay it if we simply weren ' t told about the charge , and not told how to pay the charge .
Package_Service	this is a $_00 charge for tax too which i think it a bit much on top of delivery , especially since they are gifts .
Package_Service	i have not had this problem with any other packages i have recieved from england in the year i have been here .
Package_Service	they tell us on the phone if we supply an e_- mail address and telephone_number they will contact us shortly to tell us how to pay this charge ...
Package_Service	i get an e_- mail saying the request has been acknowledged at 00am yesterday telling_me i should get an e_- mail in the next 00_hours ... well its 0pm now and still no e_- mail , and still no package .
Package_Service	i am stunned at how badly this has been handled and i still_haven ' t got my birthday_present .
Package_Service	it ' s hard enough being away from home on your birthday without the added hassle of trying to contact a company to get my package released with barely anyway to contact !
Package_Service	i have never been more stressed out by a company in my life .
Package_Service	i think it ' s ridiculous that we have to pay a $_00 charge in the first place , but am willing to pay it , yet they should make this clear at the point of purchace and they should give a clear way to pay it ... how are you supposed to pay a fee to get a package released if you are not told how and when to pay it ?
Package_Service	i sent a parcel to australia , and my husband did put the wrong postcode .
Package_Service	could not find any num to call so i chatted with remi and she or he was a staaaar ( she , he ) sent an_email to fedex to change it for me .
Package_Service	really happy with your service .
Package_Service	thanks again "" remi """
Package_Service	i had no_problems sorting_out the necessary customs paperwork , the instructions on the website were perfect and easy to follow and getting my parcel sent off was easy as anything ...
Package_Service	the ups collection guy was really friendly , helpful and cheerful and i couldnt_believe it when the parcl i posted on wednesday_morning in england , arrived in the post to massechusets on friday_morning !

Package_Service	really pleased with the service catherine offered today .

Package_Service	i ' ve been using p0g for a long time and never had a problem .
Package_Service	today i needed some extra info and sarah_hayes was happy to help me via chat .
Package_Service	would definitely_recommend them .
Package_Service	was helped today by samantha who dealt_with my problem quickly and professionally .
Package_Service	she is an asset to the p0g team !
Package_Service	even_though the problem was completely my fault ( i booked a parcel in for collection on the wrong day , the deadline had passed and i needed same day collection ) - she sorted out for me in a matter of seconds !
Package_Service	i accidentally booked the collection from the wrong_address - i thought it would be a pain to cancel and re - book this , although i went on tot he live_chat and [_name ] helped straight_away - 0 minutes and she had changed the address and sent new documentation through - thanks a lot !

Package_Service	if only they were all like you !
Package_Service	i found the signup process to send my first package with my parcel delivery was fast and simple .
Package_Service	the prices are excellent and we will_defiantly use their service in the future .
Package_Service	good work !
Package_Service	although , their customer_service number and live_chat functionality are difficult to find on the website i can confirm that having both called and used the live_chat feature for 0 different queries my questions were dealt_with quickly and efficiently !
Package_Service	sarah_hayes on live_chat deserves special mention for dealing_with my query in a friendly and quick manner !
Package_Service	excelletn service , fast and reliable .
Package_Service	don ' t hesitate in using it .
Package_Service	i have used interparcel on many occasions and i find their service to be very reliable .
Package_Service	i have seen some bad_reviews on this site and i cant_believe they are talking_about the same company .
Package_Service	on one_occasion i used interparcel to send a pallet to one of our very respected clients and i needed it there as soon as possible and interparcel arranged a next_day collection as requested and it was delivered the very next_day also as requested and our client commented on what a fast and reliable service it was .
Package_Service	i have always been happy with interparcel and will_continue to use their services .
Package_Service	emma was so helpful got me sorted in minutes , thanks x
Package_Service	great live_chat service by catherine_corless .
Package_Service	friendly and professional .
Package_Service	booking what i thaught wasn the best priced courier service with ups , filled allthe forms out payed by visa then it says please take your parcel to a ups pick_up point , ok from looe thats a 00 mile_round_trip , so look for customer_service , email has a link that sends you round in circles , one hour on and ime realy pissed , ill never come back here again , look online and find countless horror_stories , the main thing is how thay have no respect for the people paying their wages , just grab the money , and pull the shutters down , well ive now done alli can for tonight , no doubt this will occupy tomorrow , all it takes is one phone call or an online opperator , but no thay dont want anything like that , thay make more money doing it like this , and so much for the customers health and wellbeing . what a setup it stinks . never again thease people should not be allowed to trade . ombudsmen .
Package_Service	great humour understood my lingo great girl you have thersammiee make her manager
Package_Service	thats what makes the difference with any company , simply get one person who really cares and wants to give you the right information and the experience is one you want to come back to and can trust to not be let_down .
Package_Service	i wanted a package picked_up from a friend but input the wrong_address on the parcels0go website .
Package_Service	i thought this would be a big problem and i would lose my money as they had already tried to collect it twice from the wrong_address .
Package_Service	i was very wrong , i connected to the live_chat were a very friendly gemma fixed my problem in a couple of minutes !
Package_Service	couldn ' t be_happier !
Package_Service	thank_you gemma for all your help with my late order today ( parcelforce were late ) .
Package_Service	you were quick and helpful and answered all my questions quickly and clearly .
Package_Service	another great delivery from parcel 0 go !
Package_Service	great thankyou [_name ] very helpfull
Package_Service	i opperate a small business and have been running an ebay shop for a little while now .
Package_Service	when i started to sell some larger items it made sense to send via a courier .
Package_Service	i used another courier for a while and occassioanlly had a few issues with them and just recently it took 0 days longer_than it was meant to for my customers to receive their orders .
Package_Service	i have now sent several parcels via parcel0go and not had a single_issue with them , parcels are collected on time and delivered without any_issues , definitely found my new courier company .
Package_Service	many_thanks
Package_Service	peter chandler keep up the good work
Package_Service	c ' mon !
Package_Service	i ' m not that dumb enough to go with them lot again , no way !
Package_Service	so i turned to fedex .
Package_Service	fedex man came round and wasted both our times on the door_step by having to ring his boss when he should have known the answer himself whether or not my package could be accepted .
Package_Service	prick fedex man with a face on finally produced an answer ... " nooooooah " he said , because he droned " they only offer the domestic option to customers who ship parcels on a regular_basis ."
Package_Service	well it was mainly my fault anyway because of poor research into the whole shipping thing .
Package_Service	i had nowhere else to turn to .
Package_Service	collectplus was a definite no , no .
Package_Service	time was running out and goods needed to be shipped out immediately !
Package_Service	in comes parcel0go to save the day .
Package_Service	honestly it was not the option i wanted because of previous experiences and i wanted to deal with the carriers directly instead of having to deal with the middle_man .
Package_Service	i saw a sheer amount of positive 0 star_ratings here and skim read them all .
Package_Service	no time though , i then thought " let ’_s go with em and hope for the best ."
Package_Service	the site was easy enough to navigate my way through ; choose the carrier ( tnt ), make your payment and then print out the shipping label .
Package_Service	i went with amazon payments this time to see what it was like .
Package_Service	smoooth !
Package_Service	yeah , we ' re cooking on gas now i thought .
Package_Service	from noon to 0 :_00pm now and i was bricking it .
Package_Service	i heard something heavy and loud pull up , went outside to greet the tnt man and exchange papers and signatures and away we went .
Package_Service	my customers where pleased with what they purchased and received in a timely_manner .
Package_Service	i was more_than pleased with the service received from parcel0go .
Package_Service	i ' ll be more_than happy to deal with these_guys again in future .
Package_Service	thanks parcel0go for a brilliant service .
Package_Service	just to note ; don ' t go with myhermes or yodel , especially yodel .
Package_Service	just read through the reviews here .
Package_Service	they maybe cheap , but its like they say - you get what you paid for .
Package_Service	i always get my shipping next_day , although sometimes very early in the morning , i always get my items .
Package_Service	well ... there ' s that one time the fedex man came round and everyone in my house was either too neurotic and / or anally spiteful to open the door to the man , and the fedex guy left my parcel with the neighbour across the street .
Package_Service	a good thing it wasn ' t left with the hard face cow next door .
Package_Service	fortunately , the guy across the street is a good guy .
Package_Service	fedex are great as for as for uk deliveries ?
Package_Service	props fedex .
Package_Service	i was due to receive a parcel yesterday between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
Package_Service	on the lovely map they sent me , it was due to be delivered to my work .
Package_Service	however the emails said it was my home address .
Package_Service	i was at work all day , and i work on reception , and nothing was delivered .
Package_Service	i then return home after work to no calling_card there either .
Package_Service	there are no telephone_numbers like some other courier companies , to speak to someone about whats happened .
Package_Service	i then check the tracking and it says the parcel was refused !!
Package_Service	by who ??
Package_Service	i then log on this morning to see that it is being held at the romford depot .
Package_Service	i cannot call as there is no number , and i have no calling_card ?!
Package_Service	so what do i do ?
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	best service o ever had
Package_Service	great customer_service
Package_Service	fast reliable service
Package_Service	quick collection and delivery
Package_Service	whenever parcels have been sent to me from online_retailers via dpd , i ' ve always had a good experience .
Package_Service	my orders have arrived in timely_fashion and i really_appreciate the text update to let me know the hour time - frame they will deliver between .
Package_Service	this is such a great idea as , unlike with some other couriers , i do not have to wait in from 0am - 0pm with no more specific indication of what sort of time they might arrive .
Package_Service	no one enjoys wasting an entire day , eg .
Package_Service	if the delivery comes at 0pm and you realise you could have gone out and done plenty of other things in that time .
Package_Service	my most_recent delivery was today , sent from asos ; i was sent a text and an_email_saying it would arrive between 00 :_00am - 00 :_00pm .
Package_Service	the parcel arrived at 00 :_00am , very pleased with dpd ' s time - keeping .
Package_Service	i ' m so glad asos has chosen to either stop using myhermes or at_least does not use myhermes for next_day deliveries .
Package_Service	i ' ve not yet needed to use the redelivery via text , but i think it ' s fantastic that they give you the option to choose whether you ' d like to delivered to a neighbour or delay delivery for up to two days .
Package_Service	keep up the good job , guys .
Package_Service	update 00 / 00 / 00 : i have another parcel being delivered by dpd for today and during the tracking process , i ' ve just noticed the " follow my parcel " section and i love it !
Package_Service	i love knowing exactly where my delivery driver is , and which delivery he is currently making , and how long it will take him to get to me .
Package_Service	see you in about 0 hours , bill !
Package_Service	i liked her a lot
Package_Service	had some trouble booking as id meant to book a collection from home but hadnt , got it changed and my labels emailed as my computer wouldnt download them !
Package_Service	thanks so much catherine !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	from start to end the service was quick and easy very fast pick_up , parcels undamaged and arrived quickly .
Package_Service	the online booking system was easy to understand and quick to use , would be my method of choice now .
Package_Service	even the emails from peter at the reviews team were polite and seemed to genuinely want to check everything happened at the highest_standard possible .
Package_Service	had a few questions that i needed answering to do with my account and used the live_chat .
Package_Service	got put through to sarah_hayes and she was most helpful .
Package_Service	excellent service :)
Package_Service	emma , was wonderful .
Package_Service	i didnt know my way around the site and she sorted my quote for me and then went on to help me organise everything and i just had to click the link cornfirm and pay .
Package_Service	she did her job and hope the company can follow_up and get my parcel to its destination .
Package_Service	thanks emma !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	perfect helped_me out very much and will always use them
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	anthony hickman
Package_Service	thanks to brittany ( cust serv rep ) who helped_me track my parcel after me losing my p0g number .
Package_Service	great service , used it for many parcels big & small .
Package_Service	far cheaper_than royal_mail for most things , much_easier , far more reliable , and sensible hours at courier collection points ( if you choose to collect after a missed delivery ).
Package_Service	i hear there ' s a drop_off services at certain shops / garages ( some 00hr ), and the person at the other end can choose to have it delivered to a collection point near them .
Package_Service	my family have used this service and say it ' s also brilliant !
Package_Service	top_marks p0g !
Package_Service	i spoke with emma about my parcel she is very kind and helpful .
Package_Service	having previously got in touch with parcel0go about a proof of delivery and not heard_anything for a little while , i went to live_chat to see what the problem was .
Package_Service	emma was very helpful and got on the case straight_away , fixing my problem for me .
Package_Service	great service !
Package_Service	needed to make an adjustment to my collection address , sam from parcel0go was very accommodating and passed on the adjustment to hermes .
Package_Service	great service , great options and a first_class twitter reply service !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	this company shouldn ' t be allowed to even exist .
Package_Service	i had a parcel sent using ups service from the uk to new caledonia .
Package_Service	when i chatted with parcel0go , they said it was ok to send to a po_box , as they are mainly used on the island .
Package_Service	service was advertised to be between 0 - 0 days .
Package_Service	after 00 days , parcel is still not delivered .
Package_Service	ups contacted me saying they can ' t deliver the parcel because it is a po_box address !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	not only this , but now parcel0go sent me an_email today saying i will have to pay for the return of the parcel although it is entirely their fault .
Package_Service	customer_service is appalling , filled with people who don ' t have a clue and don ' t care at all about customers .
Package_Service	disgusting company !
Package_Service	i bougt some small things from asia , where the site had promised free shipping .
Package_Service	then , when i got the goods , i also got a bill fro ups , containing_cutoms + a fee .
Package_Service	the fee from ups is partially_customs , and the rest is a fee for taking care of the customs for you .
Package_Service	ups is obliged to give the consumer the chance to take care of the customes_themselves , by providing the consumer with the proper_information at_arraival .
Package_Service	this was not done in this instance , and not when other friends of mine had bought goods from the same site .
Package_Service	fyi_:
Package_Service	on the other hand , depending_on your countries_laws , ups is , in the context of being miniinthebox ' s delivery partner ; also_liable for the information posted on their partners ( miniinthebox )_homesite , reguarding_freight cost .
Package_Service	miniinthebox has little opportunity to know about every_rule in every country .
Package_Service	ups on the other hand , is a professional_freigth partner , with the whole world as their office .
Package_Service	keeping_track on fees is a no - brainer for them , but it would not be in ups ' s_intrest to inform any customer about this , because , clearly ; ups is making a lot of money on not giving_proper_information to consumers , and then taking a big fee for doing a 0 minute_task .
Package_Service	i ' ve complained_ups and their practice to the norwegian_consumer ombudsman , and is currently_concidering making a media - case on the subject .
Package_Service	ups has given me a cheap_exuse , that they are obliged by law to do the customs , and then is in title to give the end_user a fee .
Package_Service	- well , if the end_user would get the chance to make this decision in his own , i would actually agree .
Package_Service	in this case , information is held back , both by the store , and by the ups , and you don ' t need to be a rocket_scientist to understand the barely_hidden motive .
Package_Service	i would recommend ups to re - evaluate their ethics .
Package_Service	to rip_off consumers like this , is the sign of how bad the ethics can possibly get .
Package_Service	emma is awesome !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	emma was super today helped_me out as i had miss spelt my e_- mail gave her the details she needed and within two minutes all sorted thanks
Package_Service	will be using this website all the time now !
Package_Service	i had to place my order through chat as something was not working quite right online and the staff_member who assisted was very patient and helpful .
Package_Service	i was sending three packages from the uk to the us and was worried that one was too heavy and large .
Package_Service	this wasn ' t a problem at all for p0g .
Package_Service	when customs got involved and required more information p0g contacted me promptly and gave me a detailed list of what i would be needing to get my package from customs to my door .
Package_Service	all in all , it is a good service with excellent customer_service and safe .
Package_Service	you can also track your order online through them or the carrier .
Package_Service	absolutely_brilliant company had a problem with a buyer cancelling at the last_minute i spoke to katie who was very very helpful and sorted it out for me by cancelling my order and refunding into my prepay account would recommend using this company :-)
Package_Service	just as the title goes .
Package_Service	i ' ve used them every time i need to courier something .
Package_Service	great prices , collection and drop_off services , great customer_service and livechat ( looking at you emma !)
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	even my last parcel i booked the addresses the wrong way around , 0 minutes on livechat and emma had it all sorted for me :)
Package_Service	thanks everyone , keep up the good work !
Package_Service	just asked for simple advice and charlotte pretty_much done the job for me ... what a star and credit to the company !!
Package_Service	i will be using these very soon !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	great service and cheap !
Package_Service	richard helped_me out online by re - booking my parcel for me after the courier messed_up the collection on 0 seperate_occasions , he was able to give them special instructions and was able to sort the problem out very quickly and efficiently - highly_recommended .
Package_Service	this " service " is an_absolute_joke !
Package_Service	i ordered delivery of some parcel one week_ago and they failed three times to come over and collect my stuff .
Package_Service	every_single time i was speaking to the cust .
Package_Service	serv .
Package_Service	rep . and been assured that this time they will come and pick_up my parcel .
Package_Service	during yest .
Package_Service	conversation rep . just terminated it in the middle !
Package_Service	i ' ve never_experienced such a disrespectful , disgraceful and disgusting customer_service .
Package_Service	today , i did contact live_chat again and been assured ( third time !)
Package_Service	that they will contact the courier to make it urgent , so he will finally pick_up my parcel .
Package_Service	of course , the ' ve never showed up !
Package_Service	now , basically they stole my money and haven ' t done service which i ordered .
Package_Service	i ' ve been forced to order another company and pay for this again , now trying to get my money back from p0g , which , i ' m sure , is not gonna be easy .
Package_Service	the situation is complicated , as the stuff i wanted to send , was some items from my flat i moved recently from one city to another .
Package_Service	as they didn ' t pick it up first i ' ve been forced to pass it to one of my friend ' s flat , so she could handle it over to the courier .
Package_Service	i rebooked the collection twice and courier never showed up to take the parcel .
Package_Service	now , she ' s moving out ( unexpectedly ) from the flat and i stayed without my belongings .
Package_Service	it ' s stuck in another city , hundreds miles_away from me .
Package_Service	the only thing i can really do now is to inform about all the situation authorities from outside which will be able to deal with the problem .
Package_Service	it ' s been a contract between me and p0g on the service for which i paid and never been done .
Package_Service	it ' s unlawful .
Package_Service	they lost my laptop and only refunded £_00 .
Package_Service	how pure service !
Package_Service	i wish i never came to use this courier .
Package_Service	never again !
Package_Service	international services definitely requires improvement .
Package_Service	prices need to bejustified
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go numerous_times for business and personal use .
Package_Service	never had a problem and so much cheaper_than sending large items through the post_office .
Package_Service	just mixed up an address and emma at online support sorted out within minutes and sent a new label .
Package_Service	would recommend .
Package_Service	very good customer_service
Package_Service	i had a good experience today with ' emma ' who was very helpful , polite and fast .
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	pleasantly_surprised at the otustanding customer_service received by sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	really patient and helpful individual couldn ' t have asked for a more friendlier or accomodating assistance .
Package_Service	superb .
Package_Service	has perked up my expectation and reviews of parcels0go .
Package_Service	will recommend to others if they ' re all like him .
Package_Service	x
Package_Service	sammie_taylor made me write this .
Package_Service	i didn ' t want to do it .
Package_Service	but it said at the bottom of the screen when she typed that she was an agent so i thought i better write something nice in case she comes after my family .
Package_Service	maybe i ' m just being overly dramatic .
Package_Service	she did rebook my courier for me and was very polite and helpful .
Package_Service	a gold star to her and p0g .
Package_Service	paid a for premium for what i thought was next_day collection - turns_out the service is not guaranteed service thus the package maybe collected in the next few_days in the meantime if i can be in the house 00 : 00 until 00 : 00 each day that would be great ...... avoid !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	had to cancel my order .
Package_Service	quick and great cancellation , no_hesitation to use again .
Package_Service	great service as usual .
Package_Service	jessie ( jessj ) was extremely_helpful with solving issue i had with yodel .
Package_Service	can ' t recommend enough .
Package_Service	excellent service by sarah_hayes !
Package_Service	top site many_thanks to samantha for her help
Package_Service	sammie was very quick and helpful .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	spoke to samantha over the live_chat regarding a number of different queries as it was my first time and she was able to give me all the answers i needed to complete the online booking process with confidence .
Package_Service	many_thanks again to sam !
Package_Service	kind_regards ,
Package_Service	dean nash
Package_Service	will not rely_on this company and their services .
Package_Service	information given by one of the team was wrong , so my package has been delayed by 0 months .
Package_Service	i believe it ' s wrong and now they i needed to pay a fee to return the item back to me .
Package_Service	basically given information been wrong so all service gone down .
Package_Service	not happy & will not use this service ever & will guarantee that my family & friends will not use your service .
Package_Service	i originally booked a huge parcel to go to australia , but due to my brain being fried with emigrating i needed to cancel the parcel - and the customer_service ( livechat ) was top_notch .
Package_Service	i would definitely use these again :)
Package_Service	the courier was not only a day late , but also lied about my delivery !
Package_Service	he stated ' out of building ' when i was home at the time of the delivery !
Package_Service	my whole experience has been a disaster and their help line is a disgrace !
Package_Service	[_name ] from p0g was very swift and helpful for me whilst trying to sort out cancellations and refunds .
Package_Service	nice experience for shipping as the customer_service always there to help you with any_queries in quick fashionable manner , especially sammie_taylor the customer_service guy
Package_Service	great service
Package_Service	i have wrongly booked collection instead of drop - off service .
Package_Service	contacted customer_service via webchat to see if it can be changed .
Package_Service	i quickly got connected to the advisor [_name ].
Package_Service	she was very helpful and with no time changed my service into the one i wanted .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	i will be using this company for my deliveries .
Package_Service	i have send parcel across the uk and to canada and they have all got there safely and on time
Package_Service	i have used this often and found it to be an excellent service .
Package_Service	live_chat is efficient and i have spoken to richard who has sorted out some problems for me very easily .
Package_Service	i find that if a parcel is not collected , this is not parcelsgos fault ( or any other courier broker ) but an issue with the courier company themselves , and often can be down to an individual driver .
Package_Service	parcel0go site is easy to use and tracking works very well .
Package_Service	in particular i recommend the ups service .
Package_Service	used them about 00 times now , so i speak from experiance , ( not much but better_than just once )..
Package_Service	very helpful , always happy to ammend any mistakes you might make , and are very competitive ... will contiune to use ...
Package_Service	i booked a same day collection for next_day delivery as i needed an item to be returned before my 00 day return period was up .
Package_Service	i could have used the post_office otherwise and paid a little more for special delivery .
Package_Service	the driver didn ' t arrive .
Package_Service	i called the following_morning , they apologised , said it didn ' t lodge on the system properly and rebooked for that day .
Package_Service	still no collection .
Package_Service	i called again the following_day and was told that the first day the lorry was broken and the second the driver ran out of drive - time .
Package_Service	refused any form of compensation but booked again for the third time .
Package_Service	finally it was collected .
Package_Service	still no refund - not even a reduction in price to a 0 day service !
Package_Service	i only hope the company will accept the item return ...
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go for a while now , great prices and normally a good service .
Package_Service	i did use citylink before and they never turned_up half the time , i have been using their tnt next_day delivery service for a good while now and haven ' t had a problem upto_date :) thanks for a great service and fast delivery .
Package_Service	also great customer_service and support from sam at parcel0go :) cheers !
Package_Service	over the christmas_period , where delivery time take longer i was very pleased to see interparcel were advertising they were able to do a christmas_eve pick - up for next working day delivery .
Package_Service	unfortunately however this was not a product which they could deliver or even existed .
Package_Service	when i called the local ups depot ( who fulfil " interparcel ' s own " services ) they informed me they were not making any pick - ups that day and had not received the instruction from interparcel .
Package_Service	my pick - up was then delayed until 00th which was the next working , causing my shipment to be delayed , which has a knock - on effect on a subsequent delivery which had been scheduled with this in mind .
Package_Service	when i make a courier order , it is understandable things can be delayed , especially over the christmas_period .
Package_Service	what is completely_unacceptable is that interparcel sell a service which they have no_intention or method of fulfilling .
Package_Service	of course interparcel refused all blame for this .
Package_Service	appalling website accuracy and terrible customer_service .
Package_Service	normally don ' t do this sort of thing but after amazing service from andrea ( online_chat representative ) i felt i had to share my experience .
Package_Service	andrea fully understood my issues i had with city_link straight_away and rectified the problem painlessly and effectively .
Package_Service	thanks andrea !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	parcel0go service has been impeccable and will be using them again .
Package_Service	many_thanks to andrea and parcel0go
Package_Service	ian
Package_Service	never had any_problems with these_guys .
Package_Service	catherine was very helpful today :-)
Package_Service	i made a mistake on my email whilst ordering a collection , haveing just spoken to jessica , she was extremely_helpful and remade the order details correctly for me , and guided me through sorting the order out .
Package_Service	superb , thanks jessica !
Package_Service	i have used this company now 0 times and twice they have failed to collect my parcels .
Package_Service	the first time was for the delivery of christmas_presents which i had due for collection two_weeks before_christmas but after many phone_calls and e mails and promises were collected on the 00st december and delivered 0 days after christmas !
Package_Service	this week i used the service again and booked collection for yesterday 00th_february and after 00_minutes on the phone was told by daniel that i could travel to the next village 0 miles_away or he would arrange collect for friday .
Package_Service	this is truly a terrible company to deal with .
Package_Service	beware
Package_Service	my parcel was out for delivery and within hours of arriving and i needed to amend the address .
Package_Service	parcel0go stopped the delivery , changed the address and delivered the same day at no additional_cost a ++
Package_Service	sammie was really really really helpful with my parcels and also has very good taste in programs :)
Package_Service	i had a prob with the wrong collection address .. emma was quick to resolve this problem and i was pleased with the result , cheers emma :) - martin halliday
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel to go ireland to italy and uk to italy multiple_times over the last few_months and not had a problem .
Package_Service	pick_up has always been on time and delivered in good condition .
Package_Service	i made a booking error and contacted the team over twitter and it was sorted quick enough .
Package_Service	sam , steph and kate couldn ' t have been more helpful .
Package_Service	i ' ll continue to use them into the future
Package_Service	thanks catherine for helping me with the courier colletion and drop_off .
Package_Service	very friendly thank_you !
Package_Service	just had a query dealt_with by sammie_taylor and i must_say the service she provided was quick and efficient and she took care of my concerns straight_away .
Package_Service	she is a credit to your team and thank_you for sorting my problem out !
Package_Service	i am still sat here waiting for my delivery which i have been told twice today would be here by 0pm ( which seems very late - i have waited here like a numpty all day for the delivery ).
Package_Service	now it ' s past 0pm i see on their tracking notes that they delivered it to customer at 0 . 00pm which is an_absolute lie as i as still_waiting for it and was here at the time they say they delivered it - just disgraceful .
Package_Service	avoid these people at all costs would be my advice .
Package_Service	i guess i will phone them yet again in the morning and ask them who they think they delivered it to and hope against hope that it eventually arrives sometime tomorrow .
Package_Service	what a waste of a day ( again )
Package_Service	emma ' s ( five ) stellar performance made my parcel0go a gogo !
Package_Service	jenni dealt_with my problem today - she was extremely_helpful and left me a happier custome
Package_Service	muchas gracias jenni !!!
Package_Service	regards from züruch !
Package_Service	sammie_taylor stepped in as soon as i got stuck on your not - so - wonderful website and fixed it all for me !
Package_Service	interparcel are just a broker please remember this .
Package_Service	if you have any trouble they accept no responsibility .
Package_Service	after_reading the reports they all say the same , if the courier delivers all is good .
Package_Service	if the courier has any_problems interparcel are shocking at providing a level of service and customer_service one would expect after paying them your hard_earned cash .
Package_Service	i recently tried to send a parcel to south_africa .
Package_Service	i was sent documentation to attach to the parcel i was sending and followed all the correct directions .
Package_Service	on the 00th_may the parcel was due to be collected from my office , firstly it was declined due to having the collection address on the label and it might be delivered back to me .
Package_Service	i called the driver and question this who said he would call back and pick it up but later in the day after i had left work .
Package_Service	i spoke to interparcel to ask if this had been collected and they said no it hadn ’ t but would arrange for it to be collected on the 00st .
Package_Service	on the 00st i went to work and was informed the parcel had in fact been collected .
Package_Service	i spoke to interparcel who disputed this and told me it was still with me .
Package_Service	i asked for them to locate it and they said why if it was still with me .
Package_Service	after_speaking to the driver again he gave me the depot number of tnt who told me they had the package but the wrong documents were submitted from interparcel but i had to deal with them because i wasn ’ t a tnt customer i was an interparcel customer .
Package_Service	after convincing interparcel the package was at leeds depot ( only after i gave them the number to contact ) they then arranged for the package to be completed with the right documents , it the updated to say shipment in progress on the 00st at 0pm .
Package_Service	when i questioned this they made me aware on their online_chat that the process had recently changed regarding the paperwork and that they were unsure what they needed to do .
Package_Service	not off to a good start .
Package_Service	on the 0th_june still no update had been given and when i asked for the location of the parcel they said i had to wait another 00_hours for it to update and i had email confirmation from * interparcel_* a customer_services advisor :
Package_Service	“ dear ,
Package_Service	thank_you for your email .
Package_Service	at the moment it is being held in customs in south_africa .
Package_Service	should you require any further information then please do not hesitate to contact us .
Package_Service	kind_regards ,
Package_Service	* interparcel_*
Package_Service	customer_service advisor ”
Package_Service	to my shock horror on the evening of the 0th_june my parcel location was updated on their website stating the parcel was in leeds .... this again is the response ...
Package_Service	“ as it was stuck in customs i thought it would have been in cape_town , i also did advise you i wasn ' t sure that it was definitely in cape_town and that i would look_into it with tnt as the tracking does not explain where it is being held .”
Package_Service	sorry * interparcel_* where did you advise you were unsure ??
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	eventually though after_speaking with the depot again , i sent over some more documentation over the parcel was on the way .
Package_Service	i couldn ’ t help question why it had taken so long to arrive back in leeds .
Package_Service	“* interparcel_* says :
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 shipment received at origin depot .
Package_Service	leeds
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 shipment in transit .
Package_Service	leeds
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 shipment in transit .
Package_Service	leeds
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 shipment received at origin depot .
Package_Service	leeds
Package_Service	* interparcel_* says :
Package_Service	as you can see last scan was the 0th stating it is at leeds the previous scans are showing it was in transit to leeds
Package_Service	i said :
Package_Service	at 00 : 00 on the 00st it is received in leeds so how at 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 be on its way to leeds ?
Package_Service	* interparcel_* says :
Package_Service	i can not explain this any further than what i have done .
Package_Service	i am now close live help as i have already explained this to you .
Package_Service	it was in transit to leeds and the last scan is showing it has been received at leeds .
Package_Service	as you can als see the scans you are referring to are from a previous date that is how it can be in transit before it is received into leeds .
Package_Service	* interparcel_* says :
Package_Service	have a nice evening ”
Package_Service	he then closed the chat_session .
Package_Service	you would think this is where it ends .
Package_Service	eventually the package was received in cape_town ( honestly very quickly , but this is thank_you to tnts expediting skills ).
Package_Service	i then asked after 00_hours how come the package was not moving or being delivered .
Package_Service	they informed me that this was just customs and that i didn ’ t need to do anything .
Package_Service	this package was time sensitive so rather_than sitting back i located the package again in cape_town and spoke to a number of people there to my amazement this is the response ...
Package_Service	“ please do send a break down invoice as it is required by customs ”
Package_Service	“ should tnt not receive payment within 0 days , the uncleared goods will be transferred to the states warehouse for safekeeping and / or disposal , which would incur storage charges ”
Package_Service	kind_regards
Package_Service	* tnt *
Package_Service	clearance channel controller
Package_Service	the payment that was requested was a payment of a further £_00 .
Package_Service	this was broken down as additional taxes and administration fees do to incorrect documentation .
Package_Service	i questioned this and spoke to a manager in cape_town who did not charge the admin charges after i proved the amount of time i had corrected the invoices with interparcel and i had confirmation that it was right .
Package_Service	the final balance i had to pay was £_00 .
Package_Service	i have chat sessions where people have promised me actions that were not carried_out , lies about the parcel whereabouts and inadequate explanations of processes .
Package_Service	when i asked why i had not been informed about the delays when i asked was never answered but if i had not intervened then my parcel would now be destroyed .
Package_Service	when i said this was unacceptable and i had to solve the problems and discover them myself i received the comment “* interparcel_* says : its a self tracking service .”.
Package_Service	i have since complained sending 00 emails and 0 chat sessions .
Package_Service	they admitted there was a problem
Package_Service	“ i believe that the differing reports coming from tnt south_africa and tnt uk were regarding what was needed for export but what was also required for import .
Package_Service	in this way tnt uk may have received and processed everything they needed however further delays were due to tnt south_africa requiring additional information .”
Package_Service	they never mentioned the appalling and rude communications from their staff and have offered me £_00 off next order .
Package_Service	i have respectfully declined this and awaiting a further response .
Package_Service	the parcel was finally delivered on the 00th_june !
Package_Service	***** important *****
Package_Service	they seem to have swept the complaint under the rug , i have attempted to speak to someone_else and they have declined this .
Package_Service	however the person dealing_with the complaint will not make contact to discuss the matter_further .
Package_Service	after a chat_session with someone i thought it would be great so know some facts .
Package_Service	i said :
Package_Service	can i ask under what circumstances would compensation be given from interparcel or is it always the courier that is subcontracted by you ?
Package_Service	** interparcel ** says :
Package_Service	we do not offer compensation , we have transit cover in place for loss or damage and if a service is guaranteed then we will refund the shipment costs
Package_Service	i said :
Package_Service	so the service that is provided by your company is purely customer_service and technically you do not have anything to do with the parcel as you are a broker and the ' contract ' is held with the company that expedites the package ?
Package_Service	** interparcel ** says :
Package_Service	yes
Package_Service	** interparcel ** says :
Package_Service	your contract is with us when you place the booking ; our contracts are with the couriers
Package_Service	i said :
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	i wanted to cancel my order , and sammie_taylor cancelled my order in a second and i got my refund back .
Package_Service	very professional !
Package_Service	for various reasons , i ' ve missed my chance to get something couriered across the uk but the advice i received from katie over livechat was very clear and helpful and nicely delivered .
Package_Service	based on this , i shall use the company for my next delivery .
Package_Service	thankyou [_name ] for your help and speedy replies !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	on three occasions over the last few_years , interparcel have failed to collect ( and therefore deliver ) my parcels .
Package_Service	we ' ve used 0 different couriers through them at 0 different_addresses .
Package_Service	0 ) no collection , no response from customer_service .
Package_Service	had to write to get a response and a refund .
Package_Service	this was right when they started , so we thought maybe things were better .
Package_Service	0 ) using myhermes via interparcel - no collection even after phoning and emailing every day .
Package_Service	empty promises daily .
Package_Service	cancelled it after a few_days , and sent with another firm .
Package_Service	the myhermes driver then turned_up the next_day !!
Package_Service	he was grumpy and unpleasant to add_insult to injury .
Package_Service	0 ) using tnt via interparcel - no collection !
Package_Service	rang at 0 . 00pm on the collection day and was assured of a colleciton by 0 . 00pm .
Package_Service	nobody turned_up .
Package_Service	gave them a shout via_email - received a " canned " response that was totally unapologetic .
Package_Service	empty promises and poor customer care are my experiences of interparcel .
Package_Service	will not be using them ever again and suggest that anyone reading this do the same .
Package_Service	there are plenty of other_companies around and it really is worth an extra couple of quid to get the customer_service , and get the parcel collected and delivered !
Package_Service	great help from rose .
Package_Service	quik responce .
Package_Service	i felt_like she really cares_about my problem .
Package_Service	would recommend to anyone .
Package_Service	i needed shipping some belongings to mexico and parcelhero came in price comparison as by_far most cost_effective .
Package_Service	although i haven ' t heard about it before , i felt reassured by previous customers reviews .
Package_Service	on time collection , proof of shipping provided .
Package_Service	delivered to mexico in 0 days , as specified in the quote , despite of warning it may take longer if held at customs .
Package_Service	package arrived in undamaged condition , with all the content intact .
Package_Service	the only_downside was taxes charged by customs that i was asked to pay on collection , which were 00 %(!)
Package_Service	of the estimated value of the content ( which was under the real value ).
Package_Service	so i guess it ' s important to find balance between insuring the content in case it gets lost but within the reason , to avoid high charges at customs .
Package_Service	overall very happy with the service and will certainly use again .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor has always been the perfect customer_service rep , have spoken a few_times and the problem has always been resolved instantly and perfectly , makes me come back to p0g time and time again .
Package_Service	been using this service for around a year now and not once had a problem with it ( although i don ' t use the hermes or tnt services offered as i haven ' t had the best experiences with these in the past ).
Package_Service	the biggest advantage of interparcel is the prices .
Package_Service	it is so much cheaper_than going directly to the companies and i ' ve saved loads of money now i don ' t have to book directly with tnt or other couriers .
Package_Service	one job tnt quoted £_00 to do when i called them but it was just £ 0ish on interparcel .
Package_Service	i always go for the interparcel standard or premium ( i think this is operated by ups ) and it is a very good service .
Package_Service	always here promptly the day after i book it or even on the same day if booked early enough and always arrives the next_day .
Package_Service	also , if you put in the times you would like them to arrive to collect , they always seem to stick to it .
Package_Service	staff are friendly and helpful when i ' ve had to call and the drivers are all very efficient and friendly .
Package_Service	highly_recommended .
Package_Service	after having a nightmare experience with a similar company , i decided to give parcel0go a try .
Package_Service	due to issues caused by the other company ( booking the collection in , and then cancelling it saying they couldn ' t deliver , only to collect the parcel which then went missing for 00_hours and was delivered to the customer damaged when it should have been returned to us ) i unfortunately had to first reschedule the collection , which was incredibly easy and just took a couple clicks on the website , and then to cancel the collection .
Package_Service	i did find it a little_confusing working out how to cancel a parcel and how to contact someone directly but did work it out in the end .
Package_Service	i spoke to emma on the live web help who had the collection cancelled in minutes .
Package_Service	very friendly and helpful customer_service from emma and overall very satisfied with my experience of using parcel0go .
Package_Service	right now , i hate your service so much that if parcel_force and yodel said in order for me to receive my parcel they would require me to be kicked in the testicles each time , i would prefer their service to yours ...
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcel0go for some time and recommended them to other businesses .
Package_Service	they are professional and sincere .
Package_Service	like all businesses , things don ' t always go to plan .
Package_Service	but when things go_wrong they deal with the issues and have a plan in action in minutes .
Package_Service	out of the many_times i ' ve used parcel0go i can_honestly say i have only had one problem , a parcel wasn ' t picked_up , but i contacted them online and spoke to a lady_called amber , she had the parcel re - booked and new labels emailed to me .
Package_Service	parcel0go did everything at their end but the courier just didnt turn_up .
Package_Service	needless to say this would never put me off using parcel0go .
Package_Service	their service is spot on .
Package_Service	parcels are picked_up on time and delivered safely .
Package_Service	ive even shipped to the usa without a glitch , problem or any damage to any box .
Package_Service	overall 00 / 00 for the service , the ease of use and they way problems ( if any ) are dealt_with
Package_Service	better opening_hours that royal_mail plus cheaper and bigger boxes too .
Package_Service	what else you can wish for ?
Package_Service	i spoke with stephane this evening to help me find where my local drop_off points are , she was quick and effective in answer all my questions .
Package_Service	also provided with the closest pick_up point for the person receiving gift too .
Package_Service	fantastic service .
Package_Service	thankyou
Package_Service	as i am always in a rush i have put the addresses for collection and delivery the wrong way round .
Package_Service	using parcels0go ' s webchat i chatted with dianne who came online instantly , and understood my error and rectified it straight_away .
Package_Service	a confirmation was sent for peace of mind and when the tracking was not working i web chatted to adam who confirmed the right addresses and gave me the right tracking_number .
Package_Service	polite , professional and quick .
Package_Service	thank_you dianne & adam
Package_Service	was unsure_about sending cake so i used the online_chat where rose helped_me with all my enquiries .
Package_Service	cheers !
Package_Service	sarah_hayes was quick .
Package_Service	clear .
Package_Service	and spelt properly .
Package_Service	sarah_hayes ....
Package_Service	i love you .
Package_Service	you know what they say , if parcel0go can ' t get something done .
Package_Service	give it to sarah_hayes , she ' ll get the job_done .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor - very helpful
Package_Service	my husband forgot some important items for a buisness trip and emma was not only friendly but also very helpful and helped_me to choose the right service for us .
Package_Service	i am very impressed with the service and will be using it again .
Package_Service	thank_you emma - crisis averted !
Package_Service	sarah_hayes is wonderful , super efficient and very helpful .
Package_Service	[_name ] was a very helpful advisor on live_chat and rectified my problem quickly and efficiently thank_you
Package_Service	my parcel was supposed to be delivered at 00th of december , i was not aware of this company trash services , so it was okay for me , i wake_up early so i could pick my parcel , happens that around 00 : 00 they updated to : " the customer was not available on the 0st attempt .
Package_Service	a 0nd attempt will be made ."
Package_Service	which is tottaly not true , because i was home the whole time , but well , i had to wait the whole weekend to get the 0nd attempt .
Package_Service	so as on the first day , i stood in my home the whole day .
Package_Service	surprisingly , at around 00 : 00 they updated the track status to : " the customer was not available on the 0nd attempt .
Package_Service	a 0rd attempt will be made .
Package_Service	", which again is a total lie , and i decided to call customer_service the moment i saw that message , which was around 00 : 00 , he told me he was going to mark my delivery as urgent , and the driver would call me in 0 hour or so , regarding my delivery , pure lie , i waited for like 0 hours so i could call customer_service again , the new guy that answered told he could see that i had called before regarding this ( like if it is of any help ), he then checked my phone , which was correct , and told me , that in the next_day , the collection centre ( or something like that ) would call me , and he told me that they would ensure that the driver would deliver it to me , as i told him repeated times that they were lying about the delivery details , cause i was there all the time .
Package_Service	well , so now , new years_eve , i lost virtually all my day , waiting for the package , which was ensured to be arriving today , because of those liars and unrespectful attendants .
Package_Service	it is not a time critical parcel , i wouldn ' t mind to receive it with some delays if christmas delivery are overloaded , but i can ' t understand_why they lie to us , it ' s unrespectful , so i ' d say that if you have a time critical product , don ' t go for ups , or better , i ' d say don ' t go with ups at all , pure trash company .
Package_Service	where do i start .
Package_Service	from the very beginning pacel0go made a complete arse of what is there main job !
Package_Service	rough drunken delivery driver from hermes stumbled & fell collecting the parcel from my work , i could smell the alcohol on his breath .
Package_Service	then they managed to lose 0 x huge boxes containing alloy_wheels .
Package_Service	the stupid driver also never gave me any proof of collection so there was no tractability !
Package_Service	no customer_service ( they do this on purpose so it ' s impossible to contact them when something_goes_wrong ) useless !!!!
Package_Service	avoid !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i have just been speaking to sarah_hayes on live_chat from parcel0go about an issue i had with a parcel , she has kindly rebooked with another courier for me and was very helpful .
Package_Service	thank_you and well_done for the customer_service .
Package_Service	i wanted to send some parcels with parcel0go but was unsure as to how to go about it .
Package_Service	i opened a customer chat box and received outstanding and friendly advice from catherine_corless .
Package_Service	i now know everything i need to do before sending my packages .
Package_Service	so , again thank_you .
Package_Service	after realising we have left it so late to send a birthday parcel i went online for quotes and wondered who could get it there in time .
Package_Service	i discovered p0go , the site is easy and gave lots of options .
Package_Service	the only problem i had was that i would be out of the house for 0hours on collection day and worried that the courier would arrive in that time so i decided to speak with an operator .
Package_Service	i was spoken to by catherine who was very quick , efficient and polite and helped_me very quickly .
Package_Service	she arranged for us to drop the parcel to a depot near my partners work which he passes on his route .
Package_Service	meaning it can be delivered in time and no - one needs to wait in the house .
Package_Service	excellent service and very good prices :) :)
Package_Service	all of my customer_service experiences with this company have been terrible .
Package_Service	the first issue i had once was when a parcel had arrive and had a hole in the box and the item that looks_like it could have only been caused by a cannon .
Package_Service	parcel0go refused to refund my shipping as the item had technically been delivered .
Package_Service	the second experience was with an item that was lost .
Package_Service	due to my previous experience i made it very clear that i wanted the shipping refunded as they failed to deliver the item .
Package_Service	upon_receiving my compensation cheque it didn ' t not include the shipping fee .
Package_Service	when contacting their customer_service i was batted between different_departments .
Package_Service	i have had dealings with [_name ] and he has been very efficient in escalating and resolving my claims ; however this should be done in the first place and not need to be a last resort .
Package_Service	try to avoid if you can .
Package_Service	you really do get what you pay for it seems .
Package_Service	the customer_service is excellent !
Package_Service	thank_you to my agent gemma , who delt with my issue !
Package_Service	sorted it out for me in seconds !
Package_Service	brilliant company !
Package_Service	i was asked to send a parcel for a friend but i needed to leave a message and was not sure how to do it but i went on live_chat and spoke to emily who very happily and quickly helped_me and sorted it out with a great attitude and enthusiasm for the job top work as usual parcels to go and most_importantly emily :)
Package_Service	i sent a parcel through this site , and the recipient had the wrong parcel delivered .
Package_Service	when i first called i was told someone would ring me back before the end of the evening .
Package_Service	when nobody did i contacted them through the live_chat .
Package_Service	it went on that a manager couldn ' t call me to discuss the problem , only to have 0 chat to me on line .
Package_Service	then she called me a liar and informed me i couldn ' t have an answer for up to 00_hours .
Package_Service	i used this service a lot before this but will not be using it again .
Package_Service	if anyone is thinking about sending a parcel i suggest doing it direct with the courier and not use parcel 0 go
Package_Service	just had my order delivered .
Package_Service	may be late , but the driver apologised and said he had been out all day trying to get it all delivered and doesn ' t have enough time in the day .
Package_Service	can ' t argue with that at all .
Package_Service	its a busy time of the year and although ive been in all day .
Package_Service	got my parcel with a reason of lateness .
Package_Service	fantastic quick and helpful service .
Package_Service	needed to re - book a parcel and was dealt_with immediately by a very helpful and lovely girl named sarah .
Package_Service	thank_you very much !
Package_Service	from , chloe :)
Package_Service	i had been trying in vain to navigate the sites of several companies like royal_mail till i came upon this site !
Package_Service	its been a great find , i was getting increasinly frustrated until catherine_corless appeared in the live_chat window on the parcel0go website .
Package_Service	she was fast , friendly , helpful , honest and real .
Package_Service	she answered my queries and navigated my confusions with calmness , understanding and was quick to offer a solution to my problem and answer all my questions , all with a virtual smile !
Package_Service	:) i would definitely_recommend parcel0go , especially with employees like catherine , they deliver on their promises .
Package_Service	keep up the good work !
Package_Service	if you posting something to the customer please do not use them .
Package_Service	they are unprofessional .
Package_Service	not collected on the day it was booked , and they told me my guarantee comes in only when the goods are collected .
Package_Service	i never left a bad review in my life before , but i just do not have a patience for this appoling company
Package_Service	emma was very helpful on chat today .
Package_Service	i use them about for 00 parcels a week , within 0 years i have only have about 0 minor hiccups and 0 parcels gone_missing , but again it ' s from about 000 parcels .
Package_Service	i definitely do not like the way how they scare you with insurance .
Package_Service	i understand it is where they make their money , but is not ethical to do it on our fear .
Package_Service	reasonable insurance / industry standard is more about 0 %, but they have it about 0 . 0 % from content value .
Package_Service	that insurance factor is the only reason they get 0 / 0 , otherwise it would be 0 . 0 / 0
Package_Service	oh_yeah .... it is somewhat hard to connect to customer_service chat .
Package_Service	i was given fullest support by the agent and very pleasant and helpful throughout the order process .
Package_Service	even explain every thing from start to end about the collection and delivery , cover options .
Package_Service	highly valued service .
Package_Service	recommended for everyone who want to use courier service reliable .
Package_Service	cheers
Package_Service	the worst experience regarding delivery services !
Package_Service	still i gave it 0_stars due to a good soul working at the depot who did everything he could to sort out my problem .
Package_Service	monday_morning got a text_saying " your parcel will be with you today " as i was on my way to work , called in sick and ran home .
Package_Service	and waited , waited and waited , at 0pm decided to check the website and track my order , when to my surprise it says " your parcel was sent back as it was a duplicate order " huh_?
Package_Service	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn ' t think too much about it .
Package_Service	0 :_00pm came by and i finally decided to call a customer_service number i found online .
Package_Service	she then tells_me that i wasn ' t at home when the driver stopped by ...
Package_Service	what ?????
Package_Service	that ' s a lie !
Package_Service	have been on the sofa watching stupid tv_shows all day long waiting for the driver , he never came !!!!
Package_Service	she then checked the gps and it was confirmed that the driver had been nowhere_near my place .
Package_Service	she then tried to contact the driver unsuccessfully + the depot also unsuccessfully .
Package_Service	its now 0 : 00 and she tells_me she finishes at 0 and as she cant get thru the driver nor the depot i ' ll have to call back in the morning !
Package_Service	hahahaha you gotta be joking , keep trying !!!
Package_Service	i didn ' t miss work for nothing !
Package_Service	at 0 . 00 , after being on hold she finally manage to get thru to the depot and came up with a ridiculous story saying the driver had gone to the wrong_address and the person at that address had said they ' d already got their item .
Package_Service	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
Package_Service	i now had to call currys to sort out this issue in order for them to re - deliver my parcel and as they refused to allocate me a time_slot i then arranged for thursday .
Package_Service	thursday 0pm , still no parcel , i called customer_services again and to my surprise there is no record on the system regarding my parcel .
Package_Service	i called the depot and its is confirmed that my parcel hasn ' t been dispatched and also that they don ' t know where it is .... is this for real ???
Package_Service	i lost my temper and had a go at the person talking to me .
Package_Service	mr kwame then after apologizing a million times said he will find it and sort it out .
Package_Service	0 hours_later he called me back , he had located my parcel and was gonna send it to my house .
Package_Service	it arrived at 0pm .
Package_Service	thanks to mr kwame i didn ' t have to waste another day waiting for nothing .
Package_Service	everybody else i spoke with were useless , specially customer_service , if they can be called that .
Package_Service	by choice i ' ll never use them again .
Package_Service	[_name ] is very polite and friendly .
Package_Service	she guided me through the whole refunding process and noticed everything that i should be aware .
Package_Service	i think she is the best example for typical advisors that customers would love to meet when they have questions .
Package_Service	i had a query about my account and emma couldn ' t have been more helpful .
Package_Service	she was pleasant and sorted it out straight_away .
Package_Service	parcel0go have saved me loads of money and i would recommend them to anyone :_d
Package_Service	thanks for yr help
Package_Service	rebooked my parcel for same day collection and emailed my label emma was very helpful and fast at sorting my problem out like the live help will use again
Package_Service	samantha was very quick when dealing_with my problem , booked a collection for me as i was unable to do so , done it in quick time , very helpful , much_appreciated !
Package_Service	love whoever ashley is :) she was so quick to answer my questions , and i had few .
Package_Service	and everything was just so easy .
Package_Service	i do not like complicated websites with too many buttons etc .
Package_Service	the chat was so easy to use and ever so quick .
Package_Service	once again , thank_you ashley
Package_Service	the online assistant catherine is very helpful .
Package_Service	she made my experience so much_easier and pleasant especially i ' m under the time pressure .
Package_Service	well_done !
Package_Service	will_definitely use again and recommended to friends and family .
Package_Service	a brilliant service , offering the cheapest and easiest service .
Package_Service	daniel was a great help on live_chat and sorted a small issue i had quickly and without_hesitation .
Package_Service	by_far the best parcel service online !
Package_Service	this is an awful courier company .
Package_Service	they have lost so many parcel ' s and not compensated for them as i didn ' t purchase the more_expensive delivery charge - obviously i assumed that they would do their jobs properly and deliver the parcel as it ' s not rocket_science .
Package_Service	they kept leaving parcels outside unattended - so they said .
Package_Service	completely and utterly incompetent .
Package_Service	customer_service agent : emma ,
Package_Service	00 / 00 perfect service .
Package_Service	i ordered some items late thursday_night .
Package_Service	did not expect them to arrive until wednesday .
Package_Service	i am so pleased that the items i purchased arrived monday_afternoon .
Package_Service	herpes are a friendly service and you can see what stage your parcel is at .
Package_Service	also the courier driver is friendly and has a big smile on their face .
Package_Service	absolutely_brilliant .
Package_Service	definitely will recommend and use again
Package_Service	i use parcel0go . com alot through 0 accounts and i must_say they are by_far the best out there for arranging parcels collections / deliverys !!!
Package_Service	i have used others ([ external reference ], [_external reference ],[ external reference ]) and they are all absolutely_useless with no customer care at all !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	but not parcel0go they really are the best there is .
Package_Service	easy to talk to and deal with , quick to respond to any issue including disputes / refunds .
Package_Service	just spoke to [_name ] and she was fantastic sorting all problems there and then .
Package_Service	praise where praise is due don ' t waste your time or money on any other_companies ...
Package_Service	absolutely perfect , emma was great
Package_Service	i had a few questions about postage and spoke to a live_chat advisor ( sammie_taylor ) who was very friendly and helpful .
Package_Service	i was very happy with the service i received and would highly_recommend to someone_else !

Package_Service	i use parcel0go on a regular_basis and they are always very helpful when i need to speak to them .
Package_Service	will_continue to use with confidence .
Package_Service	spoke to catherine this morning and she rearranged my collection within about 00 seconds .
Package_Service	excellent customer_service !
Package_Service	i needed to ship a large package from the uk to australia and this company was by_far the cheapest i could find online , the additional insurance was also much_better value than other courier brokers too .
Package_Service	quick and easy booking process and also includes links for printing documents .
Package_Service	superb , would thoroughly_recommend .
Package_Service	[_name ] was a great help !
Package_Service	was really quick and efficient to my queries !
Package_Service	great help , all the info i needed .
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	spoke with agent emma , who sorted my issue straight_away , very impressed .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	i had problems with the order for some reason and it said to contact them on live_chat .
Package_Service	catherine answered and handled it very professionally and quickly .
Package_Service	thanks a lot !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	had an amazing service from these_guys .
Package_Service	really easy to arrange a pick_up of an item i wanted to return to an ebay merchant , and tracking was really useful as well .
Package_Service	the ebay merchant is also refunding my return post costs , but i did not have an invoice for the postage , so i contacted parcel0go customer_services through live_chat and spoke to rowan , who was really friendly , and helped_me with my query really efficiently .
Package_Service	fantastic service !
Package_Service	i had queries about the turnaround time for drop_off and collection service provided by hermes as well as finding the nearest drop_off point from my house . emily from parcel0go was very pleasant , efficient and quick in answering those . great asset to the company !
Package_Service	i was assisted by the live_chat_session helper " jenny " regarding whereabout my parcel .
Package_Service	she has provided enough information to let me know the status of my parcel .
Package_Service	this is certainly helpful , and save alot of money and time than waiting and calling the service centre and would recommend other customer to use this helpful live_chat service .
Package_Service	i would like to mention that i had a chat with a very competent advisor named richard .
Package_Service	he knew everything i needed to know , and was quick to help me out and advise me on the best possible service for my needs .
Package_Service	i wish there were more people like him , who are competent and straight the point when good advice is needed promptly .
Package_Service	richard is an asset to parcel0go , and i do wish his abilities , strengths and positive contributions to this company are recognised .
Package_Service	richard is the type of individual that i would gladly recruit to work in my own company .
Package_Service	perfect one stop_shop for comparative quotes on parcel services .
Package_Service	i experienced an issue with my delivery address postcode format which lead me on to a live_chat with the agent sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	sammie was keen to assist in any way , including processing my order for me !
Package_Service	very helpful indeed !
Package_Service	thanks for the help sammie :)
Package_Service	had to contact them as account locked out .
Package_Service	immediately got through to catherine on the live_chat and my account was unlocked within a minute and i was able to continue processing orders .
Package_Service	fastest and most polite customer_service i have received in a long time .
Package_Service	emily was fantastic , she really helped_me , out of all the operators at parcel0go she is the best
Package_Service	great service no_complaints apart_from the label .
Package_Service	the label generated uses far too much paper wish they would just give you the actual label ( what you ' re cutting out ) and not a label with a load of useless text , it could fit of an a0 piece of paper but am force to use a0 would be even better if they had support for label printing machine !
Package_Service	used on several_occasions and always been problem free , used mainly for the tnt service which you can book up until midday which helps as most you have to wait in the whole day .
Package_Service	loved my live_chat experienced with catherine yesterday , felt real , geunine and i could of have easily continued chatting with this lovely_lady all day long .
Package_Service	fantastic service with fantastic prices .
Package_Service	this operator help me and went above and beyond the call of duty .
Package_Service	once we got the nitty gritty out the way she relaxed and we chatted about her lovely little puppies .
Package_Service	so in conclusion use parcel0go . com and ask for catherine on live_chat !!!!!
Package_Service	thanks guys and look_forward to doing_business with yourselves soon :-)
Package_Service	iv used parcels0go for some time now find it easy and help from there is great i rate this as a 0 star as a brill and good way of sending parcels hasel free and live help kirsty was brill :) no_problems
Package_Service	parcel0go is a brilliant way to send parcels for a good price .
Package_Service	the costumer_service is great and jon was able to help me with all my questions in the chat_function !
Package_Service	0_stars !
Package_Service	in the rush of shipping out a clients work i noticed at last_minute on the day of collection i had entered the wrong destination address !
Package_Service	first thing in the morning a fantastic assistant sarah , helped and moved to a different courier with no extra charge or delays in the parcel .
Package_Service	how can you fault that ?
Package_Service	00 / 00 would use again .
Package_Service	just have a chat with the online service [ katie ] to rebook my parcel collection , really efficient and helpful .
Package_Service	i was having a nightmare with an order .
Package_Service	sarah dealt_with my issue in an extremely fast and efficient way - thank_you !
Package_Service	i had an issue with my account ( it was locked out )
Package_Service	i used the online_chat service and was connected to sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	she dealt_with my query quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	i can now log in to my account again .
Package_Service	0 starts for her !
Package_Service	sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	i made an error , put in billing_address instead of shipping address .
Package_Service	sarah assisted me quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	excellent service !
Package_Service	i had to send back a bathroom cabinet back to the retailer urgently in order to comply with the 0 day distance_selling regulations for unwanted items .
Package_Service	the booking process was nice and simple however after i got the confirmation and printed off all the paperwork ready for it to be collected , i got an_email the next_day stating that the collection had been cancelled as they had " problems delivering to the post code before ".
Package_Service	this was unexpected - i would expect a parcel company to be able to deliver to any postcode !
Package_Service	i was not impressed .
Package_Service	so i booked with [_external reference_] instead - 0_stars for them , 0_stars for you !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i ' ve been bitten before using cut - price courier companies , huge parcels " going missing " aka nicked by the driver ( parcel0go , i ' m looking at you ) so was somewhat wary of using another .
Package_Service	however , courierpoint collected a 00kg parcel and delivered it to france within 0 days for under £_00 .
Package_Service	recommended to all .
Package_Service	the company managed to " lose " a 00kg parcel , jokers .
Package_Service	i sent numerous_emails endeavouring to find out where my parcel was ( it was showing on their system as " out for delivery ").
Package_Service	they also doctor the feedback on their website so that only good reviews are published .
Package_Service	in conclusion , they offer , in my experience , an appalling service and should be avoided .
Package_Service	very helpful , professional and well_mannered customer_service representative by the name of [_name ].
Package_Service	make the process of cancelling an order very easy and stress_free .
Package_Service	i would defiantly recommend this company and their services to a friend
Package_Service	had to use live_chat to find an answer .
Package_Service	[_name ] helped_me find a solution that worked .
Package_Service	:-)
Package_Service	i ' ve used interparcel on many occasions and wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend .
Package_Service	their rates are as low as you can get , but the service is second to none .
Package_Service	i usually use ups for my uk deliveries as i ' ve never had a late parcel and the driver is super friendly !
Package_Service	if you are looking to send a parcel then you won ' t find a better company than interparcel !
Package_Service	super helpful customer_service will_definitely use again thanks for your help !
Package_Service	did exactly_what we wanted , a quick efficient and relatively inexpensive courier who came when they said , delivered on time and kept us up to date via_email .
Package_Service	excellent
Package_Service	my printer broke , and i thought i was in real trouble .
Package_Service	i attempted going on the online live_chat , thinking that it wouldn ' t work ( baring in mind it was on a sunday at 00 : 00 ish ).
Package_Service	immediately a reply came through .
Package_Service	the man , william , who assisted me was fantastic .
Package_Service	the price was amazing .
Package_Service	i was ready to pay £_00 +_vat on my package , instead i paid £_00 . 00 ...
Package_Service	truly remarkable !
Package_Service	i would recommend these_guys every day .
Package_Service	however , i have done this review immediately after making the order .
Package_Service	i hope very much the collection is reliable , and the recipient receives their item in great condition .
Package_Service	from their service so far though , one could only assume every thing will go perfectly .
Package_Service	top job guys !
Package_Service	i wished to cancel and re - book my order with a different courier .
Package_Service	richard_mileham helped_me on the facebook chat page and was very helpful .
Package_Service	he did all the work for me and made it very easy .
Package_Service	thanks a lot richard !
Package_Service	0 weeks and still_waiting on a 0 - 0 day delivery .
Package_Service	every time i chase up customer_service , there are empty promises of an update in 00_hours .
Package_Service	complete_waste of time and i would not use this company again .
Package_Service	andy
Package_Service	i ' ve used this service a lot but decided to review after a big bout of stupid from my very own self .
Package_Service	i normally send a lot of parcels but on this occasion was arranging a parcel to be collected and sent to me .
Package_Service	but i put my address as the collection , not delivery address .
Package_Service	moron !
Package_Service	i only realised when i ' d paid and went straight to live_chat on facebook , spoke to richard the parcel0go representative and he just fixed it and sent new labels .
Package_Service	really good .
Package_Service	p0g is always my first choice when i need to send large parcels within the uk .
Package_Service	when i needed to cancel a collection today , the live_chat operator ( sammie_taylor ) made it very simple and straightforward - no hassle at all !
Package_Service	i spoke to katie via the parcel0go . com live help chat online to gather more information .
Package_Service	the service was quick to respond and was free instead of calling which cost 00p from a bt landline .
Package_Service	would use this service again .
Package_Service	love this service .
Package_Service	very easy to use site which gives me access to discount pricing normally only reserved for high_volume contract customers .
Package_Service	thanks to emily whom chatted with my partner today , and sorted out the massive confusion of where my 0 parsells where as nobody else could she found out where they were and explained why they where in the wrong place and sorted out that my parcel will be either re directed back to me or delivered to the right address asap .
Package_Service	i spent_ages trying to amend a collection date and just did not figure_out what to do at all .
Package_Service	i thought i ' d try the online_chat but when i ' ve used these sorts of chats before with different companies - it ' s always been a massive pain !
Package_Service	i ended_up speaking to jenny and within 0 minutes , my parcel had been amended and my problem solved .
Package_Service	fluster free !
Package_Service	could not commend her service anymore - cheers jenny !
Package_Service	spoke to sammy_taylor she made me feel very comfortable and was clear and concise with her advice
Package_Service	a colleague of mine used this service back in july and it was excellent .
Package_Service	however , on the accounts side i was getting frustrated that i couldn ' t optain an invoice .
Package_Service	but today after_speaking to daniel on the live help i found out that i was looking for the wrong information from the wrong company .
Package_Service	within minutes of giving my reference_number daniel had it all sorted for me .
Package_Service	what a speedy service !!!
Package_Service	i will_definately but using them again both for business and personal deliveries !
Package_Service	they picked the item up and delivered exactly when they said they would and a friendly guy delivered it straight to my door .
Package_Service	i have always found parcel0go services to be absolutely exemplary !
Package_Service	i tried to send a parcel to rwanda and it was an_absolute nightmare .. until jessica came to rescue me !
Package_Service	she has done a very very very great job .
Package_Service	speaking to me almost during 0h00 minutes .
Package_Service	she answered all my questions and helped for every_single step to place this order .
Package_Service	it was a 0 * customer care service that will give me the will to use this company service again !
Package_Service	she answered even the questions that sound silly but that were important for me to remove my fears .
Package_Service	i ' m very very happy - just waiting for the collection of my parcel .
Package_Service	hopefully it will be done .
Package_Service	first time using parcel0go but wont be my last , catherine was my live person answered all my questions and made using this service a pleasant_experience !
Package_Service	thanks !!
Package_Service	jody
Package_Service	i have used interparcel on several_occasions over the past few_years , they always save me time and money , their standard service in my opinion is the best , managed by ups and i have had no issues .
Package_Service	i steer_clear of yodel as i ' ve never had a smooth_transaction with them when being delivered too !
Package_Service	and city_link can be good or bad , but ups are a fab provider especially when used through interparcel .
Package_Service	i have had only one issue in a couple of dozen ( regarding duplicate payments ), which was resolved quickly and amicably .
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	fast and efficient service from sarah_h , very very helpful indeed !
Package_Service	thanks for your help today :)
Package_Service	[_name ] dealt_with my query with in a matter of minutes and allowed me to continue my evening uninterrupted .
Package_Service	[_name ] was very thorough and successfully dealt_with my issue at the first attempt .
Package_Service	i was very happy with my experience - if only all customer_service reps were this good !
Package_Service	thanks again .
Package_Service	after booking a parcel collection i accidentally chose the wrong collection day .
Package_Service	jenny was more_than helpful and managed to change the date for me within a couple of minutes and send me the new receipts and label .
Package_Service	excellent service , 0 / 0
Package_Service	lauren was extremely_helpful in changing a courier for me ... from collect by city_link to drop_off with ups ... all done via web chat whilst i was stuck on mexico .
Package_Service	amazing service
Package_Service	i have used collect_plus many_times some missing but money given back so fully covered but more good than bad .
Package_Service	great prices and now the option for more cover and signature i recommend 000_% to use .
Package_Service	brilliant and cheap i highly_recommended
Package_Service	actually i never knew there is a courier service like parcel0go , i order a collected which the seller told me she won ' t be at home until 0 days ahead , i was curious on how to go about re - booking the collection date .
Package_Service	i went to the chat and met mr adam who took his time and rebook my collection date to the date the seller will be at home all day .
Package_Service	wow i was so happy .
Package_Service	friends its all about p0g , lets go ...................
Package_Service	very friendly staff , and a fast response to problems i had .
Package_Service	would fully recommend them
Package_Service	i spoke to paul on live_chat and he was very helpful and dealt and helped_me with my enquiry very quickly x
Package_Service	after a very poor services delivered by tnt many_times by not collecting my items .
Package_Service	the last thing i expect was a good customer_services .
Package_Service	then here comes the guy call richard ( richard_mileham )
Package_Service	i first wanted to rearrange the delivery to a different address and richard did it straight_away .
Package_Service	then i changed my mind , and asked him that i might want to drop the parcel to a collection point .
Package_Service	then he send me all the information including my local_depot including the phone number and told me to drop the items .
Package_Service	still i was not sure using tnt .
Package_Service	so i changed my mind again .
Package_Service	then i asked him is it possible for me to change the services .
Package_Service	at this point i know that i have been bit difficult :) but surprisingly richard said of course he can change that for me .
Package_Service	then he send me the label i need for ups ( the services i wanted ) and then he offer a refund for the balance .
Package_Service	also he help me to sort out my account .
Package_Service	i didn ' t even know i had a parcel to go account :)
Package_Service	this is a type of a customer_services that we all not expect when we contact a company .
Package_Service	i wish i get this type of services every time i contact parcel to go .
Package_Service	richard_mileham gave me an excellent , personalized solution for my problem .
Package_Service	so when he ask for a feedback .
Package_Service	that is the least i could do .
Package_Service	a real credit to p0g customer_service should be like this .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	pat
Package_Service	been using this service for quite a while now and very rarely have any_problems .
Package_Service	we had a parcel returned because the customer refused due to the box being damaged by the courier .
Package_Service	katie was very helpful and friendly and sorted out a full_refund within a couple of minutes .
Package_Service	one small note , it can sometimes be a little difficult to find the live help , would be good if it was available from the home page !
Package_Service	easy to use website , lots of payment options , had a problem with citylink but the other couriers cannot be_faulted , and the service fro parcel0go is outstanding they sorted my problem out really quickly
Package_Service	one whole month i had to wait for compensation payment for a parcel that parcel0go had lost .
Package_Service	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
Package_Service	many_times with the livechat i was sent away and told to wait with no direct answer .
Package_Service	the people ( i ' m_guessing they were people on the other end ) were rude and not very helpful at all .
Package_Service	that was until today when ashley was able to sort out my refund giving me a number of payment options .
Package_Service	he gave me direct answer straight_away without making me wait .
Package_Service	although my experience with the company thus_far was awful i must_say ashley turned it around :) i would recomend the company as the prices are very good but i would suggest cover as parcels do get lost and you wont get the value of the products unless your covered .
Package_Service	all in all i see that there are some workers who literally carry the company .
Package_Service	hopefully all the hard work will be noticed and due praise and promotion given .
Package_Service	thank_you ashley :)
Package_Service	p0g number : p0g - 00000000
Package_Service	i truly wonder if the parcel0go service can get any worst ..
Package_Service	i paid them to deliver my laptop and it was subsequently lost , found and then returned to the me smashed , four weeks after sending it and despite filing claims and numerous_emails today they sent me this :
Package_Service	' please_accept my apologies for the damages caused to your goods and any inconvenience this matter may have caused you thus_far .
Package_Service	my apologies again mr ******, i have credited you pre_- pay account with £_00 . 00 should you ever wish to allow us to restore faith '
Package_Service	so having returned a smashed laptop ( worth £_000 . 00 ) they credited my account with £_00 . 00 ; notwithstanding the fact that i have already paid them £ 0 . 00 for a failed delivery , so they actually credited me £_00 . 00 to spend with them .
Package_Service	the policy of parceltogo appears to treat the customer with utter contempt and an attitude that it ’_s not our fault so we couldn ' t care less .
Package_Service	i have been insulted at every_stage by parcel0go and frankly the latest one of adding £_00 . 00 to a pre_- pay account is the final_straw , for the sake of good manners i won ’ t put into words what they can do with it !
Package_Service	original post 00 / 00 /_0000
Package_Service	almost four weeks_ago i used parcel0go to send a laptop that didn ' t arrive .
Package_Service	i was told by there staff to put in a claim after being told it was smashed in the warehouse and then being told it was lost .
Package_Service	so i filed a claim and after several weeks of going through a very difficult claims process it was finally accepted and i was offered a rather insulting £_00 . 00 despite proving the laptop was worth £_000 . 00 .
Package_Service	i wrote to parcel0go to say i was not happy with there £_00 . 00 offer which they ignored and then to my surprise the laptop was suddenly returned to me , smashed .
Package_Service	the box looked like it had been ran over and then someone wrapped lots of brown tape around it .
Package_Service	i contacted parcel0go and was told to write to them and attach photos of the cardboard_box and packaging along with photos of my smashed laptop .
Package_Service	the laptop had been well wrapped up in bubble_wrap and the cardboard_box was also well_packed with more bubble_wrap .
Package_Service	a week on and parcel0go have chosen to ignore my letter and emails , clearly in the hope i will just go away ..
Package_Service	so in short i used there service to send my laptop and four weeks_later its returned to me smashed .
Package_Service	this was not what i paid them for and i feel very let_down and will never use there service again , a very unhappy customer .
Package_Service	appalling - please do not use if you expect a collection .
Package_Service	drop_off may be reasonable but staying in for two 00hr windows is not acceptable .
