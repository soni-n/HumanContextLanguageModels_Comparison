Fashion_Accessories	excellent product , commented on by numerous ppl including strangers
Fashion_Accessories	had no_problems with cr they where fast with the delivery and good :_d
Fashion_Accessories	they are just great , i havent had a warped record yet ,
Fashion_Accessories	my husband and i bought our_wedding_rings and i can ' t speak highly_enough of both the rings and the service we received .
Fashion_Accessories	from day one we received update emails letting us know exactly how far along the production process was , and we received the rings on the date promised when the original order was placed .
Fashion_Accessories	i had a very specific idea of what i wanted and was able to order exactly that , while my husband wanted to view a number of options and the website has so much choice he was able to browse to find just what he wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	you came very highly_recommended from a difficult to please friend , and i hope i have the opportunity to you use again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	many many_thanks .
Fashion_Accessories	this online store has a wide_range of things to pick from and all of their clothes and accessories are adorable as hell , not to mention that the price is quite affordable for me too .
Fashion_Accessories	i did my research about crown_brushes ages_ago and decided to give it a try !
Fashion_Accessories	so impressed !
Fashion_Accessories	being a proud owner of hundreds of mac , smashbox , estee lauder and other high - end brushes i was kinda not willing to believe that i could get quality brushes for bargain prices but i was wrong !
Fashion_Accessories	crown_brushes are really good quality , do the job perfectly and delivery is super_quick .
Fashion_Accessories	will be buying some more soon !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you , crown_brushes , you made my day xxx
Fashion_Accessories	use this website / company all the time and they never let me down .
Fashion_Accessories	great choice of products and great customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	i will be back to use it again very soon !
Fashion_Accessories	everyone has been faced with the terror of buying off the net !
Fashion_Accessories	you never know whether your order will actually get to your door ... you find yourself wondering_whether the " computer will send you the product you chose !".
Fashion_Accessories	with webtogs , i had the support of real people behind the computer screen , which made my purchase experience absolutely wonderful .
Fashion_Accessories	i had arranged for my parcel to arrive as a next_day delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately the delivery company messed that up .
Fashion_Accessories	contacting webtogs was incredibly easy !
Fashion_Accessories	there were no long phone cues , easy to find contact details , but more_importantly , everyone i was served by , was incredibly patient and committed to providing me with a positive shopping_experience .
Fashion_Accessories	they contacted the delivery company and made sure my order got to me the next_day , at a specific time and place i requested .
Fashion_Accessories	no questions_asked and all at my convenience ... literally " zero hassle "!
Fashion_Accessories	i was also very pleased at the condition of the products i received , as they were in their original manufacturing packaging and the packaging used for their postage , made sure they reached clean and intact !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought an engagement_ring back in 0000 whilst deployed away with the army .
Fashion_Accessories	luke at diamondgeezer was brilliant at helping me sort out the purchase of the ring from many miles_away .
Fashion_Accessories	he worked within my budget to create a ring which my fiancée loved when the question was finally popped ( phew !
Fashion_Accessories	).
Fashion_Accessories	we ' ll certainly be going back for the wedding_rings .
Fashion_Accessories	0_stars : perfect – no reservations , i would recommend this company to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	i usually have no problem with chemical except with this order and a few others .
Fashion_Accessories	with this order i opened the seemingly large box to find only 0 records out of 0 i purchased .
Fashion_Accessories	one , this confused me as to why they were gone as there was no note or indication , and 0 , it annoyed me because they have sent me small packages in large boxes before , causing the records to get bent and damaged during shipping .
Fashion_Accessories	after talking with customer_service and filling out a form they sent 0 of the 0 remaining records .
Fashion_Accessories	again , this angered me as the record that was now sold out was in stock when i purchased it .
Fashion_Accessories	it would have been nice if they had apologized for the missing order or even asked if i had wanted a new record instead of just automatically refunding it , but it was more like filling out an insurance claim .
Fashion_Accessories	i received the missing items 0 weeks_later , though i play gigs and needed them before then .
Fashion_Accessories	also , as mentioned earlier , i have received orders of a few records sent in a very large box .
Fashion_Accessories	since i live overseas this leads to the box getting smashed and the records getting warped or bent .
Fashion_Accessories	also living over_seas it is kind of hard to return a damaged record without paying even more_than it cost for shipping .
Fashion_Accessories	picked my lovely diamond cluster on the diamond_heaven website !
Fashion_Accessories	the minute i saw it i knew that was the one i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	despite my husbands panic we found the ring was easily within our budget and managed to upgrade the diamonds !
Fashion_Accessories	took just under 0 weeks to arrive and i can ' t stop looking at it .
Fashion_Accessories	will be back for my next birthday treat !

Fashion_Accessories	selectspecs has a love - it - or - hate - it reputation on the internet ' s reviews .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a pair of titanium glasses with - 0 prescription thin / light reaction - coated lenses .
Fashion_Accessories	0 weeks_later , as predicted by them for " high / complicated prescriptions ", they have arrived from_hong_kong , on specification as according to the prescription sheet and reference glasses i sent them .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses , especially for the admittedly bargain price of £_00 , seem reasonably good quality , if a little light and plastic - feeling .
Fashion_Accessories	so why three stars ?
Fashion_Accessories	because of their suspectness .
Fashion_Accessories	apparently no manned telephone_number due to ' over - demand '.
Fashion_Accessories	poorly , hastily written replies to my emails .
Fashion_Accessories	the enormous length of time they take to make glasses compared to other suppliers i ' ve used .
Fashion_Accessories	the fact that , with reviews on the web , they are either 0_stars and glowingly written - in other words , by selectspecs themselves - or one star and thus by extremely disgruntled_customers .
Fashion_Accessories	am i happy with my glasses ?
Fashion_Accessories	yes .
Fashion_Accessories	would i recommend selectspecs to a friend ?
Fashion_Accessories	not in perfect confidence .
Fashion_Accessories	good luck .
Fashion_Accessories	i received my order for my 0 stone emerald cut trilogy 00k white gold ring , looks beautiful design , delivery , was great ( i live in germany ) and communication was also really good .
Fashion_Accessories	however i only received my ring on january 00 , 0000 and the band is already starting to look gold .
Fashion_Accessories	also scratches very easy .
Fashion_Accessories	a lot of little marks in the band .
Fashion_Accessories	i work in an office so i am not doing too much with my hands and i make_sure to take it off when creaming my hands as well as washing .
Fashion_Accessories	i am aware of wear and tear but .... so soon .
Fashion_Accessories	i wouldn ' t get a white gold band again , maybe would go towards a platinum band .
Fashion_Accessories	so in saying that i am a little disappointed with that .
Fashion_Accessories	i will have to get it dipped already before the actual wedding which is in august :(
Fashion_Accessories	regardsnicole
Fashion_Accessories	i think the product supplied is of good quality for the price .
Fashion_Accessories	their cheapest rimless glasses were perfect for when out on the motorcycle .
Fashion_Accessories	my only problem with the company is the slow delivery - however unlike most on here i do rate their customer_services .
Fashion_Accessories	i raise a ticket and they do reply very quickly ( queried my delivery today , got a reply within 0 minutes ) - so maybe those complaining that they never hear back should check their junk_mail folder first .
Fashion_Accessories	would happily rate 0 or 0_stars if they could get delivery down a bit .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered on the 0th_jan and still_waiting ...
Fashion_Accessories	i have purchased from the sunglasses_shop previously and was happy with the service hence returning .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately the glasses purchased didn ' t suit me and i returned them .
Fashion_Accessories	it was a painless process and my refund was issued immediately .
Fashion_Accessories	i wouldn ' t hesitate shopping with the sunglasses_shop again .
Fashion_Accessories	other online companies could do with taking a leaf_out of their book .
Fashion_Accessories	a very pleasant shopping_experience .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service , super_fast service
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a merrel haven ii ladies jacket and recieved it 0 days_later on a standard delivery charge .
Fashion_Accessories	there was no_fuss and the coat is perfect !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s really nice to order from somewhere who do free returns !
Fashion_Accessories	i didn ' t even realise that until i ' d got a pair of gloves which were too small .
Fashion_Accessories	all swift service and very nicely done though ;-)
Fashion_Accessories	i was happy with the ease of the website , it was very easy to use , to find glasses i liked , and was happy could choose way of paying , and got a 0 %_discount for paying by cheque :)
Fashion_Accessories	only thing i wasn ' t too pleased about , was that there was absolutely no communication about the actual arrival of my glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	i wasn ' t told if they had received my cheque , or when and if they had been dispatched at all .
Fashion_Accessories	they did eventually arrive , and i ' m very happy with my new glasses , especially for the price i paid for them !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my scarf at 0pm friday_afternoon and it was with me saturday_morning .
Fashion_Accessories	amazing .
Fashion_Accessories	and the price was good too !
Fashion_Accessories	will_definitely be back :)
Fashion_Accessories	after ordering 0 costumes for my twins i was very impressed when 0 arrived the next morning .
Fashion_Accessories	when the second hadn ' t arrived the day before book day i contacted mega_fancy_dress & they sent out another costume .
Fashion_Accessories	i was over the moon when the costume arrived in time before school next morning .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definately use mega_fancy_dress again & recommend their 0st_class service .
Fashion_Accessories	no_problems - ordered my item .
Fashion_Accessories	had it the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	great communication , fast delivery , good quality products
Fashion_Accessories	from the moment i emailed asking about the different options they were great .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring arrived , she said yes , but the ring was too big ... contacted them and sent it back and they did exactly_what they said they would .
Fashion_Accessories	we had the resized ring back with us within two days !
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant
Fashion_Accessories	i bought an engagement_ring from diamond_geezer last february .
Fashion_Accessories	i was very impressed with the customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a particular diamond , which when it arrived at diamond_geezer was not quite right and the guys there wnet out of their way to find me a diamond which was as i had specified .
Fashion_Accessories	when the ring arrived i was delighted with the quality and so was my fiancee when i propsed .
Fashion_Accessories	she_loves the unusual shape , knowing that very few women have a ring like her ' s makes it even more special .
Fashion_Accessories	i still catch her just staring_at the ring , moving it about in the light to see the ' across the room ' glimmer of the diamond .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks very much diamond_geezer - we ' ll definitely be back for our_wedding_rings early next year !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service .
Fashion_Accessories	recieved next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	no_problems with the transaction .
Fashion_Accessories	couldn ' t find any other site with a better price !
Fashion_Accessories	you accept paypal too which is so much_easier and safer ( although i had no_worries buying from you ).
Fashion_Accessories	product was well described on website and pictures accurate .
Fashion_Accessories	overall thanks for an easy transaction !
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased with this company .
Fashion_Accessories	used it to buy my wifes engagement_ring 0 0 / 0 years_ago .
Fashion_Accessories	quaily is to a very high_quality , i recommend to everyone .
Fashion_Accessories	i am very happy with chemical .

Fashion_Accessories	i would shop with them again if they had what i needed .
Fashion_Accessories	got my glasses in 0 working_days for international delivery !!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	perfect fit , excellent quality - fully meet expectations .
Fashion_Accessories	i couldn ' t be_happier , ordered a pair of rayban and had them in my hand 0 days_later , couldn ' t be_happier .
Fashion_Accessories	great service great products !
Fashion_Accessories	due to comfort , range , style and excellent service - i ' ll never buy undies from anywhere_else .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended !
Fashion_Accessories	the wonder woman outfit is flattering , and came very quickly however the gold detailed wing in the middle is not gold it ' s yellow , so the image is slightly deceiving .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased this one in particular as i preferred the gold over the yellow , if i ' d have known i could have got the same costume ten_pounds cheaper elsewhere online however it ' s not worth sending it back for a return over a tenner .
Fashion_Accessories	overall a decent costume .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my engagement and wedding_rings from diamond_geezer and i think i may have been the fussiest bride to be ever !
Fashion_Accessories	i decided i wanted to re - design a few of the features on the engagement_ring i had chosen from their website and spent what seemed like hours on the phone to my customer_services advisor ( the same chap each time - tian smith ).
Fashion_Accessories	we talked quite thoroughly about what changes i wanted to make and he was really patient with me , despite me deciding the send the ring back once i received it to change it once again .
Fashion_Accessories	he was also very knowledgeable about the ring design , which was very impressive and if he didn ' t know , he actually spoke to one of their jewellers on my behalf and got back to me quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely shop with diamond_geezer again .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d changed my mind on numerous occasion ' s on whether to order over the internet or not .
Fashion_Accessories	however after_speaking to diamond_heaven i finally decided to take the plunge .
Fashion_Accessories	after a short wait the ring has arrived and it ' s blown me away .
Fashion_Accessories	the diamond sparkle ' s amazingly and the design is exactly as i hoped it would be .
Fashion_Accessories	all i can say is thank_you diamond_heaven !
Fashion_Accessories	now she just needs to say yes !
Fashion_Accessories	me and my sister were looking for outfits for a 00 ' s themed party , but as usual we left it till the last_minute .
Fashion_Accessories	however , this was not a problem , we ordered our outfits and they were shipped the next_day and arrived in plenty of time .
Fashion_Accessories	the outfits themselves were fab and just as the pictures showed , the fit on them was good too .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely be coming_back to you for any future fancy_dress needs :)
Fashion_Accessories	no_problems at all .
Fashion_Accessories	i had some questions on the item which they answered_quickly and politely .
Fashion_Accessories	when i placed the order it was easy to do so , the price was great and it was delivered quickly
Fashion_Accessories	i missed the cutoff point for my saturday delivery but was swiftly contacted to rearrange for a time that suited me .
Fashion_Accessories	product was top quality as expected and the price was a bargain too .
Fashion_Accessories	i needed a costume fast for my sons school play .
Fashion_Accessories	i found the perfect costume and ordered it .
Fashion_Accessories	to my surprise and delight , the costume arrived the day after i ordered it !
Fashion_Accessories	quality of costume was great !
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely order from mega_fancy_dress again .
Fashion_Accessories	have also recommended this site to my friends and family .
Fashion_Accessories	everything is spot on .
Fashion_Accessories	quickly delivered , correctly priced and a quick checkout_process - everything i look for !
Fashion_Accessories	best prices on the stuff i ordered , and received the next_day ( without paying extra for guaranteed next_day delivery !)
Fashion_Accessories	all in all , very pleased .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	just had a great experience buying an engagement_ring through diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	both ben and clive were incredibly_helpful , down to earth and honest and we now have a beautiful gia certified diamond ring which my fiancee loves .
Fashion_Accessories	i would have paid a lot more for less on the high_street or through a retail jeweller .
Fashion_Accessories	if you are worried_about making such a large purchase sight unseen via a website please don ' t .
Fashion_Accessories	they have a ton of good reviews for a reason and are genuinely happy to help .
Fashion_Accessories	i asked for 00 diamond certificates and had a trail of 00 emails and made numerous phone_calls before committing and they never once lost patience !
Fashion_Accessories	well_done and thanks again .
Fashion_Accessories	so i ' m writing another review of yesstyle . com .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve already ranted and raved_about how good they are so i won ' t do it again .
Fashion_Accessories	now , the only reason i ' m writing another review , is because there ' s a chance to win $_000 .
Fashion_Accessories	considering i ' ve got to a point where i ' m spending well over $_000 a month just on yesstyle . com .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s become an addiction and i think i need any financial help i can get !
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer made my wedding_ring to a bespoke design and it is more beautiful than i ever imagined .
Fashion_Accessories	it was made to fit around a pear shaped engagement_ring and the attention to detail and quality of the diamonds is fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	they even gave my engagement_ring a clean and polish whilst fitting the wedding_ring to it .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks guys !
Fashion_Accessories	i recommend you to everyone i know .
Fashion_Accessories	used diamond_geezer for our_wedding_rings and for my wife ' s eternity very happy with the choice , quality and prices of the products and the service we received .
Fashion_Accessories	we personally liked to track our rings as they were getting manufactured .
Fashion_Accessories	when i made the decision that i was going to ask my girl to marry me i didnt know where to start in order to find that perfect diamond ring .
Fashion_Accessories	i had tried a few of the local jeweller ' s but just couldnt find ' the one '.
Fashion_Accessories	a friend_recommended dg to me but i had my doubts about picking something over the internet without first seeing with my own eyes , however with not having much luck thought i would atleast have a look .......... to my surprise there was a superb amount of different_styles and designs to choose from and the assistance from ' ben ' was first_class in order to throw_away any doubts that i first before_deciding on the perfect ring .
Fashion_Accessories	superb service and quality product .
Fashion_Accessories	will be in touch soon to look at our_wedding_bands for our_wedding later this year !!
Fashion_Accessories	:)
Fashion_Accessories	well_designed website , good products and reasonable prices .
Fashion_Accessories	would be using again if i didnt already have a pair of sunglasses now .
Fashion_Accessories	i have loyalty to chemical_records when it comes to clothing , your service is great so no faults at all .
Fashion_Accessories	i appreciate what i am about to say involves more workload , however ......
Fashion_Accessories	sizes , we all know different brands have diff sizes etc , different cuts for jeans , skinny , baggy etc .. and with t -_shirts , tight vs . baggy etc ....
Fashion_Accessories	it would be great if you could give a description on how this should fit .. ie .
Fashion_Accessories	baggy fit large vs . slim fit large .
Fashion_Accessories	and so on
Fashion_Accessories	i have bought many t shirts from you and have had to return / give to my mates as i cannot find any information of the ' cut ' of the t shirt .
Fashion_Accessories	there are other_websites which do this .
Fashion_Accessories	i know clothing is not the be - all and end all of chemical - records but ,....... a little more attention to detail would go a long way :)
Fashion_Accessories	if you would like to contact me regarding this - i will offer constructive advise on how i use the site as a client of yours .. more then happy to help and give ideas , given my profession .
Fashion_Accessories	nothing negative ... just share my ideas if your willing ;)
Fashion_Accessories	kind_regards

Fashion_Accessories	when i bought a jacket from country_attire , the size was wrong so i returned for a refund .
Fashion_Accessories	even over the busy christmas_period i found that the shipment of my jacket was unbelievable fast , i even changed the delivery address and that was dealt_with ver effectively .
Fashion_Accessories	country_attire then gave me unbelievable service on communicating with me on the wears bouts of my refund
Fashion_Accessories	crown_brush have the best selection of brushes , they ' re great quality and my order arrived practically overnight .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s fair to say that i am super impressed and will buy from them again :)
Fashion_Accessories	rang up to ask about the differences_between two barbour jackets and get some advice on which one would suit me best .
Fashion_Accessories	the assistant was very knowledgable about the products and could answer all the questions i had ( better_than when i rang barbour themselves ) and helped_me reach a decision .
Fashion_Accessories	i placed my order at 00 : 00 tuesday and received the appropriate email etc , then i got notification that my order would be with me tomorrow ( wednesday ).
Fashion_Accessories	on wednesday_morning i woke_up to a text_message_saying the delivery driver would be with me between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , he turned_up at 00 : 00 .
Fashion_Accessories	the order was nicely presented with barbour hangers etc .
Fashion_Accessories	i couldn ' t be_happier with this company !
Fashion_Accessories	i own an ecommerce business myself although in the baby market not clothing and have contacted country_attire to talk about their success .
Fashion_Accessories	my partner and i ordered 0 coral halter - neck maxi dresses to use as bridesmaid dresses for our_wedding .
Fashion_Accessories	we were very cautious_about buying these dresses as they were so cheap , (£ 00 each ) however we were very surprised to find that the quality of the dresses were very good , better_than what we expected for the price !
Fashion_Accessories	the size guide on the website is also very accurate and all 0 dresses fit_perfectly !
Fashion_Accessories	overall we were really pleased with our purchase and won ' t hesitate to use the website again !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you for an easy and enjoyable shopping_experience .
Fashion_Accessories	this was my first experience with selectspecs . com and it will_definitely not be my last !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered 0 pairs of distance prescription_glasses , savannah 0000 wayfarer style and savannah 0000 pattern at £ 0 each !!
Fashion_Accessories	( including anti_- reflection , uv protection , scratch resistance , case and cloth )
Fashion_Accessories	i thought no way this was too good to be true !
Fashion_Accessories	but i thought i would give it a go !
Fashion_Accessories	so glad i did !
Fashion_Accessories	they came today and took just under 0 weeks in total to arrive at my uk address .
Fashion_Accessories	i cannot_believe people still buy there glasses in stores !
Fashion_Accessories	there were no scratches , the prescription was just right , and they looked exactly how i thought they would !
Fashion_Accessories	the arms are a bit stiff but that is easily fixable if people want the arms to be looser .
Fashion_Accessories	i am so happy with my new glasses !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you selectspecs !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i came_across this site whilst looking for a lacoste polo shirt for my holiday , they offered much_better prices than others so i placed an order .
Fashion_Accessories	a day later it was with me but sadly i had ordered a size too large ( completely my fault ).
Fashion_Accessories	i sent an_email to customer_service and they replied within a few hours with a returns form , i posted the shirt back on a thursday and the shirt was back to me in a smaller_size on monday_morning .
Fashion_Accessories	wonderful customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	items arrived_promptly and as advertised on site , very easy to use .
Fashion_Accessories	no_complaints .
Fashion_Accessories	end gave a brilliant service .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered at 0pm , was with me at 0am the following_day .
Fashion_Accessories	trainers where brilliant and at a great price !
Fashion_Accessories	will_definitely be using them again .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	what more could you want .
Fashion_Accessories	i buy mostly green banana from yes style along with some other bits .
Fashion_Accessories	the store itself is easy to navigate , almost everything has big clear pics of the product ( very important when shopping online ) and i ' ve never had a problem with delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	one piece of advice i will offer though is pay close attention to the sizing and options i ' m from the uk and most things are sized differently and smaller .
Fashion_Accessories	note that most tops and shirts are only offered in large and xl i think the native market is smaller on average .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased shoes in the largest size they had ( approx a uk 0 ) and they were tight , more like an 0 and a ' cardigan ' ' one size fits all ' that is comical on me but if you are careful and take your time , use the sizing charts they offer , you can get some great stuff on here not available elsewhere .
Fashion_Accessories	purchased the classic rayban wayfarer ' s in black , genuine product , delivered quickly for a really good price .
Fashion_Accessories	communication around the order very good and updated at each_stage of the process , glasses came well_packaged , very good company and would be happy to recommend or use again .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t fault the service i originally brought them at the clothes show my hubby loved them that much as they support him i decided to purchase more for christmas for him really quick dispatch time .
Fashion_Accessories	the only thing is the packaging said waxx_underwear all over it so hubby guessed when signed for them what he was getting .
Fashion_Accessories	will keep using more and more now excellent quality
Fashion_Accessories	ordered my record , dispatched next_day and arrived within three days .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent considering it was standard delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	good prices and the vinyl was in the mint_condition .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	yes style has a wide_range of beauty , fashion items and clothing and suits all my online shopping needs .
Fashion_Accessories	as a recurring customer , i have never had a problem and all my purchases arrive on time .
Fashion_Accessories	good communication and good loyalty system !
Fashion_Accessories	the free shipping is an added_bonus !
Fashion_Accessories	good quality clothes and accessories at affordable prices .
Fashion_Accessories	i sent an_email asking for more information and the team replied with 0 emails almost straight_away explaining everything i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	great help .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered at around 0 pm and the sunglasses were delivered the next morning at 0 . 00 am , couldn ' t ask for better service than that .
Fashion_Accessories	overall one of the best on line companies i have dealt_with .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks
Fashion_Accessories	james
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my new oakleys last_week and thought ok , have ordered and now all i have to do is wait a week as i am in ireland .
Fashion_Accessories	but three days_later they arrive in the post and they are exactly_what i wanted and more !!
Fashion_Accessories	plain and simply you guys_rock !!!
Fashion_Accessories	i will be back and i will be telling my friends .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks again !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered two cdj0000 wall mounts .
Fashion_Accessories	soon afterwards , they were dispatched , but only one arrived .
Fashion_Accessories	when i emailed them , they said i ' d bought the last one , and that those brackets were now out of stock , so they only charged me for one .
Fashion_Accessories	the problem was that they needed to match and i needed two of them !
Fashion_Accessories	anyway sourced the remaining bracket from elsewhere , but it would have been nice to be told and to have had the option to cancel my order then buy both together from elsewhere , rather_than wait for an unknown period to get the missing one !
Fashion_Accessories	buy these every year from the clothes show ( is one reason i go ) absoloutly love them , the designer ( s ) is obviously a legend !
Fashion_Accessories	totaly love these so much .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect fit , so comfy , great shape , fabric and the prints are amazing !
Fashion_Accessories	unique or what .
Fashion_Accessories	totaly 000000000 / 00 ...
Fashion_Accessories	i bought my wife ' s engagement_ring and subsequently both of our_wedding_rings from diamondgeezer ( all platinum ).
Fashion_Accessories	tian was exceptionally helpful and assisted me in the purchase of the engagement_ring , i was working on very strict deadlines and although there was initially a few problems with sourcing the diamond - they were overcome and the ring was delivered before tian had told me ... which helped put my mind at rest ( as much as it was possible before such a big event !
Fashion_Accessories	).
Fashion_Accessories	our_wedding_rings were both bespoke work , mine slightly changing a design featured on the website and my wife ' s was a totally new design made so that her engagement_ring and wedding_ring would sit perfectly side by side .
Fashion_Accessories	i was nervous committing so much money over the internet , but needn ' t have been .
Fashion_Accessories	thoroughly_recommend them .
Fashion_Accessories	item exactly as_described .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was on time as expected .
Fashion_Accessories	product arrived in good condition .
Fashion_Accessories	communication from giggear was excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy overall .
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service is fab , you always feel welcomed when you enter the shop which is uncommon in retail !
Fashion_Accessories	the clothes are lovely and i have always been happy with my purchases - and also they always seem to go down well with my friends .
Fashion_Accessories	a great asset to buxton .
Fashion_Accessories	when i placed my order i was really excited because i had heard_nothing but good things about the brushes , the processing and shipping was phenomenal !
Fashion_Accessories	i have never gotten anything in the mails so fast .
Fashion_Accessories	however when i opened them i noticed multiple brushes were shedding pretty bad so i decided to spot clean them rather then deep clean but when one of the brushes produced a purple color it freaked me out so i washed i washed it and naturally it had to be the brush i was most excited about ( a chisel powder brush / mini flat bronzer duo ) ran thick with dark blue dye which terrified me because i ' m not only allergic to almost everything i also have really sensitive_skin , so i washed it twice which seems to have gotten all the dye out but when i went to use it the flat side shed so bad i ended_up having to wash my face and completely re - apply my foundation and the chisel side applied really patchy and uneven .
Fashion_Accessories	next issue i had was with the small angled eye liner brush it ' s too flimsy to even apply eyeliner with correctly .
Fashion_Accessories	the other brushes i got despite how much they all have been shedding have been great and i would recommended them for the unique factor but the chisel powder brush / mini bronzer duo and the small angled eyeliner brush i would recommend buying somewhere_else unless you want to be extremely disappointed .
Fashion_Accessories	i love my diamond earrings .
Fashion_Accessories	clive was great to work with .
Fashion_Accessories	he gave me a fantastic price on gia triple excellent cut earrings .
Fashion_Accessories	i had them appriased by safeguard ( who are known for realistic valuations ) for nearly double what i paid .

Fashion_Accessories	vi chu - london
Fashion_Accessories	product was rightly delivered it took a while but i live in holland so it ' s not that strainge that it takes a little over a week to be delivered .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely nothing negative to say .
Fashion_Accessories	great webshop !
Fashion_Accessories	massive choice of sunglasses and got my order the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	yes the shoes are cute and cheap but half the time they advertise shoes they dont have .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased 0 pairs of shoes and only received 0 pair , they said the rest were on backorder and would take 0 - 0 days .
Fashion_Accessories	a week and a half goes by so i finally emailed them asking them what was up .
Fashion_Accessories	come to find out they didnt even have my shoes in stock , where they even going to call me and let me know or hope i forgot and keep my money ??
Fashion_Accessories	there customer_service were also pretty rude and unprofessional .
Fashion_Accessories	i also had a couple pairs in my cart and when i went to go checkout which was 00_minutes later they took them out and sold them to someone_else .
Fashion_Accessories	amiclubwear needs to get_rid of half their customer_service reps and replace them with people who have knowledge and common_sense .
Fashion_Accessories	i wanted to treat_myself to a diamond ring and so found diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring was an 00ct rub over eight diamond yellow gold and it was absolutely fabulous !
Fashion_Accessories	would buy again and probably will very soon .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered a bellroy wallet from them ( because bellroy were out of stock ).
Fashion_Accessories	the wallet was the same price as it was on bellroy ' s site .
Fashion_Accessories	they delivered it quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	everything was smooth and simple .

Fashion_Accessories	great company and would thouroghly recommend them to anyone !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks for the quick reply .
Fashion_Accessories	order is strongly delayed but not the fault of the store .
Fashion_Accessories	now everything is fine
Fashion_Accessories	i received my product , which i struggled to find elsewhere , the day after i ordered it during snow ( dec ' 00 )!
Fashion_Accessories	this costume came quickly and was as_described .
Fashion_Accessories	beautiful fit and the quality was of a high_standard .
Fashion_Accessories	bought for a 0 year_old girl who was thrilled with it .
Fashion_Accessories	paid a really decent price for my ray_ban wayfarers and had them delivered the next morning !
Fashion_Accessories	super customer_service too ; they get back to your enquiries really quickly and respond to every_single one ( i sent quite a few !)
Fashion_Accessories	well impressed and i would most definitely_recommend to anyone :)
Fashion_Accessories	top_notch service from start to finish .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring exceeded my expectations and my girlfriend is over the moon .
Fashion_Accessories	special thanks to richard for taking the time to help me pick the ring in the first place !
Fashion_Accessories	my dad was so impressed he ' s also just brought a ring to earn some extra brownie_points .
Fashion_Accessories	will recommend diamond_heaven to all my friends and look_forward to buying from them in the future :)
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve now had 0 orders with this website and each time i ' ve been very impressed by the level of service delivered .
Fashion_Accessories	i was initially wary ordering a quality product online , but any initial anxieties i may have had were quickly quashed by the customer_service manager , who even gave advice about what styles would suit me best and made me feel i was buying with a respectable and efficient company .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was speedy on all orders and any_problems i had were dealt_with efficiently and to my satisfaction , not an easy feat with someone as fussy as myself !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve since recommended this website to several friends and they ' ve all had similar experiences !
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommend !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	right , i ordered a huge load of clothes a few_days ago worth about £_000 .
Fashion_Accessories	reading all the reviews i ' m now seriously crapping myself over whether i ' ll get taxed by customs , and whether i ' ll actually get my ordered items !
Fashion_Accessories	0 of my items are still_waiting in stock so i ' m very apprehensive and regretful about my order .
Fashion_Accessories	i have bought items from yesstyle before .
Fashion_Accessories	i remember buying a bag and it took_ages to arrive !
Fashion_Accessories	but i got it in one piece and it was all nicely_wrapped so that was good .
Fashion_Accessories	of course at the end of the day , the site ' s primary objective is to make money , even if it means deviously manipulating customers and being purpousfully discreet and incoherent about certain things *_cough * shippingtimes *_cough *
Fashion_Accessories	depending_on how this order turns_out , and whether i recieve my items in time , in one piece , and hopefully with now extra costs , it ' s unlikely i ' ll buy from them again , and i ' ll make_sure to warn_others about the risks as well .
Fashion_Accessories	i dunno if i ' m the minority who dislikes their service , or whether the people who like their service are actually less inclined to post positive_comments , but at the end of the day , if the serivce ain ' t up to standard , then you can ' t expect people to be in your favour .
Fashion_Accessories	i hope yesstyle can actually post meaningful replies and not some automated_reply like they always do as well !
Fashion_Accessories	i live in seoul , south korea .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s very far from england , however , this company send a package for free .
Fashion_Accessories	i was so very satisfied about that .
Fashion_Accessories	so , i am going to recommend to my friends and you guys who read this article .
Fashion_Accessories	you can trust this company .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s very nice , easy and fast .
Fashion_Accessories	you ' ll be satisfied when you buy british fashion items .
Fashion_Accessories	lol
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a pair of ray - bans from the website and the customer_service was great .
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely buy from them again and would recommend to anyone
Fashion_Accessories	i was looking for something a little different and the staff were great .
Fashion_Accessories	they were patient ( as i ’ m not the easiest customer to deal with ) and weren ’ t just after the quick sale .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended and know their stuff !
Fashion_Accessories	staff were really helpful and friendly and i received my loake boots really quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	will_definitely purchase from them again .
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased with your company .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a costume and by mistake i chosen the wrong_size , easy exchange , hassle_free and all sorted very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	will be using it again , thank_you
Fashion_Accessories	im an_avid mac user and i mean avid i own around 00 of their brushes but i sat the other day and realised how much i had spent on brushes alone ... £_000 !
Fashion_Accessories	( at_least !)
Fashion_Accessories	so i got to work on the net looking up brushes and i got the good the bad and the downright skanky then i came_across crown_brushes which at first i must_say scared me ( mostly due to the prices being so low most of us know you get what you pay for !)
Fashion_Accessories	but i though what the hell i could return them if i didnt like them !
Fashion_Accessories	they came today with super_fast delivery which i was surprised at owing to the reviews stating bad delivery was a problem !
Fashion_Accessories	i opened them ( with trepidation i must_say ) and found gorgeous brushes !
Fashion_Accessories	they are soft work well and are just well what can i say welllllllll worth the money !
Fashion_Accessories	ive already ordered more ( which incidently come tomorrow !)
Fashion_Accessories	if anyone needs a good kabuki brush get the italian badger its amazing !
Fashion_Accessories	the only thing i would say is crown is more labelling on the brushes or even just the lil sleeves they come in just a general number incase one gets lost needs replacing etc but apart_from that fab fab fab !
Fashion_Accessories	saw the website store through google_search_engine and was a bit_sceptical at first .
Fashion_Accessories	by the time i got the item delivered and even the aftercare service i ' m still receiving , i have got to say that i genuinely could not fault anything about the experience in dealing_with them .
Fashion_Accessories	ring looks fantastic , prices are hard to beat , service unbeatable , delivery time exceptional , presentation_box and certificates etc look great .
Fashion_Accessories	will return for more business in the future
Fashion_Accessories	diamondgeezer . com really know their business inside out .
Fashion_Accessories	their use of technology is a joy to deal with and their craftsmanship is second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t thank_you enough
Fashion_Accessories	i needed my engagment ring resetting as it sat awkwardly against my wedding_ring , and after talking to a couple of jewellers i decided to use diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	i was a little_apprehensive at first , as i have never dealt_with an online jeweller before ; however i was hugely impressed with the price , service and end_result !
Fashion_Accessories	despite the fact that i wasn ' t spending anywhere_near as much money as their usual customer ; i thought their after sales service was second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	i was also impressed with how quick the whole_process was , from receiving the designs to approve ; to actually receiving my rings .
Fashion_Accessories	i was really looking_forward to seeing the end_result and wasn ' t disappointed !
Fashion_Accessories	the diamond has been set beautifully , and looks fantasic against my wedding_band .
Fashion_Accessories	i am extremely happy with my ring and wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend diamond_geezer to anyone ... fab job !
Fashion_Accessories	my item arrived much sooner_than the predicted delivery date and it was the best price i could find in any shop or website .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy , would definitely_recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	good communication !
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	good product , cheap price , fast delivery .

Fashion_Accessories	the quality was amazing considering the price .
Fashion_Accessories	to sum it up the whole experience was great .
Fashion_Accessories	couldn ' t ask for anything more
Fashion_Accessories	jeg_har brugt sunglassesshop et_par gange nu .
Fashion_Accessories	vi fik ved en fejl bestilt de forkerte briller , så vi skrev til deres kundeservice og hjælpen var virkelig fantastisk .

Fashion_Accessories	vi er fuldt ud tilfredse med alt !!

Fashion_Accessories	great service , perfect description of the products and a brilliant all_round shopping_experience
Fashion_Accessories	i have never_experienced such disgrace when it comes to online shopping .
Fashion_Accessories	i love the selection of clothes and their price , but the item was shipped to the uk on the 0th , got to heathrow on the 00th " customs info - held for inspection " it is now the 00th and its still on the same status .
Fashion_Accessories	yesstyle emailed me to say if i don ' t receive it by the 0th of feburary (!!!!)
Fashion_Accessories	then contact them again !
Fashion_Accessories	best price for a jacket , came within 00_hours , was the wrong_size but was replaced within 00_hours free of charge .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic service
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my glasses at selectspecs on april 00th .
Fashion_Accessories	on june 0th they had still not arrived and selectspecs sent me an_email asking me to review the them .
Fashion_Accessories	i contacted them to tell them my glasses had not arrived , after two days of no reply i posted my review and it was surprising how rapidly they then responded to a negative_review .
Fashion_Accessories	they asked me on the thread on their website to amend my trustpilot review and they would send me a new pair .
Fashion_Accessories	that was on the 00th .
Fashion_Accessories	on the 00th i received another message from select_specs saying that the glasses i had originally ordered had been_discontinued !
Fashion_Accessories	it took them 0 days to tell me this ... i had taken my review down as they had asked and now i was back to square one .
Fashion_Accessories	i updated my trust_pilot review and sent selectspecs a reply on their website telling them that it was unacceptable and that i wanted a refund .
Fashion_Accessories	they replied to me apologizing and asked me to chose a new frame from a better range .
Fashion_Accessories	i agreed , chose a frame and confirmed my choice and address .
Fashion_Accessories	they replied to my review accusing me of misreading their responses and they had in fact offered me a refund as well as a free frame , i then re read their message and it was not mentioned at all .
Fashion_Accessories	i contacted them on their website accepting their offer on trustpilot and asked when i could expect my refund and my free glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	that was the last message i sent to them on that day 00 / 0 .
Fashion_Accessories	on the 00th i went back on their website to see if they had responded , to my dismay there was two messages that were apparently sent by myself added to the end of the thread !!!!
Fashion_Accessories	they were duplicates of the message that i sent on the 00th asking for a refund the time on the messages was one minute after i sent my last message to them asking about their trustpilot offer ......
Fashion_Accessories	omg what lengths they will go to , they tried to make out that i had dismissed their offer and asked for a refund instead !
Fashion_Accessories	remember i had already chosen the glasses i wanted and assumed they were in production !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i was outraged so i copied and pasted the entire thread and put it on here so you could see for yourselves what they had done .
Fashion_Accessories	that was later removed by officials because it contained personal info .
Fashion_Accessories	on the 00th i finally had a response from them saying they had issued my refund and i was to select my free pair of glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	i thought i already had 0 days previous !!!!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	its now the 00th and i have had no confirmation that my order has been placed , no refund either .
Fashion_Accessories	what are they playing at i only wanted some poxy spare driving glasses and its gone on all this time .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered from selectspecs in april .
Fashion_Accessories	within 00_minutes of making my order i realised there was a mistake on my order and a discrepancy with my prescription .
Fashion_Accessories	the only way to cancel is to email so i did this 00_minutes after ordering .
Fashion_Accessories	selectspecs replied after 0 days saying they had put my order on hold ( my order status changed to " on hold " - the only change in status it got ) and would let me know .
Fashion_Accessories	another 0 days_later they contacted me to tell me that my glasses had supposively been made ( which i didn ' t believe as my order status never changed , despite them claiming that they do daily updates - it only ever was changed to on hold ) and they would only partially refund me or change the prescription .
Fashion_Accessories	i declined the partial_refund ( and the change in prescription as its something i had to go back to my opticians and talk to about ) and said i wanted a full_refund .
Fashion_Accessories	they said they wouldn ’ t refund me in full and closed my ticket .
Fashion_Accessories	after this they stopped responding to any of my messages and basically kept my money .
Fashion_Accessories	a couple of weeks_later a neighbour came over to give me a parcel they had signed for .
Fashion_Accessories	it was from selectspecs .
Fashion_Accessories	selectspecs decided to send my order without telling_me and without my consent .
Fashion_Accessories	the only reason i think they did this is because i said that if they were not going to reply to my messages that i would have to contact my bank / cab .
Fashion_Accessories	suffice to say the only option i have now is to contact trading_standards / cab / bank to see what exactly i can do in this situation .
Fashion_Accessories	i have never received such poor customer_service before and won ’ t again as i will be avoiding this company in future .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent delivery time and customer_service , very well_packaged and presented , excellent customer_service : i had a query about the shoes sent photos and had phone and email correspondence .= reassured , thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	ordered my glasses in a few_clicks online and received them within two_weeks .
Fashion_Accessories	very efficient service , no issues what so ever .
Fashion_Accessories	i recently_purchased a pair of red raybans sunglasses for my husbands birthday from sunglassesshop . com .
Fashion_Accessories	this was my 0th purchase from the site and each time they have been fantastic to deal with !
Fashion_Accessories	the prices are phenomenal and the speed in which they dispatch items is fab !
Fashion_Accessories	not only that but when they arrived they came with ups whom i believe are the best available couriers and are always very polite !
Fashion_Accessories	the packaging the glasses come in is fantastic , they ' re very well_protected and most_important of all the glasses look great !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i will be using them again !
Fashion_Accessories	having browsed a number of different websites , including the obvious high_street retailers , i decided to take the plunge with diamond_heaven .
Fashion_Accessories	i communicated with a very pleasant member of staff on their online_chat service , and with someone_else at a later date via_email .
Fashion_Accessories	emails were responded to really promptly with a friendly and helpful attitude , as were subsequent phone_calls .
Fashion_Accessories	i found it really helpful being_able to customise each ring ' s specifications , such as the 0cs of the diamond , and of course the metal it would be set into .
Fashion_Accessories	the prices were clear and the website generally really user - friendly and uncluttered .
Fashion_Accessories	the photos are clear and helpful too , taken with good lighting .
Fashion_Accessories	my ring was received promptly and was packaged beautifully .
Fashion_Accessories	i was unfortunately in need of an exchange , but this was handled with consummate professionalism and didn ' t make it feel_like it was a problem , unlike some retailers !
Fashion_Accessories	the replacement ring is just a dream_come true and i ' m amazed i was able to stop gazing at it for long enough to write this !
Fashion_Accessories	i will be back for more and i would definitely_recommend diamond_heaven .
Fashion_Accessories	always receive fast dispatch of my items and have never_experienced a problem with returns with this company .
Fashion_Accessories	internet shopping made easy !
Fashion_Accessories	no_problems with order at all , excellent communication and very efficient delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	would not hesitate to purchase from country house outdoor again .
Fashion_Accessories	super_speedy , friendly customer_service , beautiful sunnies : would buy through sunglasses_shop every time .
Fashion_Accessories	got a genuine pair of ray - bans for a brilliant price and they were delivered really quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	def will use again
Fashion_Accessories	i researched a few places to buy , but sunglasses_shop stood out .
Fashion_Accessories	from the word go i felt they looked trustworthy : free returns , next_day delivery , detailed_descriptions .
Fashion_Accessories	i felt very confident that if i didnt like my purchase i could easily get a refund .
Fashion_Accessories	also they ' re partnered with glasses_direct , which gave me a lot of confidence .
Fashion_Accessories	all in all a great shopping_experience .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	great product quick delivery and the best price around by_far thank_you very much
Fashion_Accessories	i was looking for this particular pair of ray_bans - every shop and website i tried just kept telling_me that the line had been_discontinued .
Fashion_Accessories	i did not give up !
Fashion_Accessories	i found sunglasses_shop , and saw that they had the exact sunglasses i wanted - and not even at the extortionate price that everywhere_else had listed before selling out !
Fashion_Accessories	plus , it was on my doorstep the very next_day at no extra_cost !
Fashion_Accessories	just incredible .
Fashion_Accessories	loved the super ted costume , great value , and speedy service thank_you

Fashion_Accessories	very helpful and freindly staff made the buying process simple .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring arrived exactly on the date they said and was well_packed
Fashion_Accessories	avenue 00 can be distinguished from other designer online shopping websites on many levels .
Fashion_Accessories	i like that the selection of designers aren ' t your staple brands .
Fashion_Accessories	the clothes and accessories appear to have a " one off " vibe rather_than one of many .
Fashion_Accessories	i also find that the customer sevice is excellent , very personal and always draws me back for another look , and sometimes , a very cheeky yet satisfying purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve never needed glasses until now , i tried ray_ban glasses on in an opticians ( which were pricey ) but after researching on the internet the same ray_ban glasses i chose were really good value and i was happy with the delivery time .
Fashion_Accessories	amazing boxers and pants to die for , really trendy and comfortable to wear also .
Fashion_Accessories	best thing is no colours run from them and they look like bran newsw pants everytime you put them on .
Fashion_Accessories	loads of epic designs to choose from aswell
Fashion_Accessories	a beautiful unique shop which selects the best of quirky on trend pieces .
Fashion_Accessories	the service is great , and is an asset to the town of buxton ( which in honesty , does not offer a great deal of diversity ).
Fashion_Accessories	this boutique allows you to find some key pieces for your wardrobe which you ' ll fall in love with .
Fashion_Accessories	to carry on the experience in the comfort of your own home you can view a much larger range online and order with free delivery over £_00 ( not hard to spend !)
Fashion_Accessories	and there are always some amazing offers going on to tempt you into treating yourself that little_bit more !
Fashion_Accessories	just an amazing experience throughout with gorgeous pieces of clothing and accessories .
Fashion_Accessories	i usually struggle to find any nice fancy_dress due to my size however the costume is lovely and well fitting !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered the costume on a tuesday night and it was shipped first thing wednesday .
Fashion_Accessories	the costume arrived in two days which was great as i had been so worried_about the sizing !
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely use mega_fancy_dress again !
Fashion_Accessories	every time i ' ve ordered vinyl from chemical it has come packaged perfectly and the quality / condition has always been top_notch .
Fashion_Accessories	i agree that the vat thing is a bit_annoying but it ' s never really bothered me if i ' m honest .
Fashion_Accessories	sometimes i buy directly from the labels as it can be quite a bit cheaper , but this is understandable - and even when more_expensive , i often buy from chemical due to their incredible delivery speeds .
Fashion_Accessories	always bought my music from chemical and will_continue to do so for quite some time .
Fashion_Accessories	had not heard of the company , but were the cheapest around for a weber q000 with stand .
Fashion_Accessories	website looked good and trustworthy so ordered at about 0ish with free next_day delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	funny enough , it turned_up fairly early on the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	cannot_fault !
Fashion_Accessories	after spending an_hour on the phone ordering and confirming that the frames were definitely in stock , they rang me a few hours_later to say they weren ' t available and i would have to wait 0 weeks for my glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses were advertised as £_000 . 00 with free postage , they tried to charge me £_000 .
Fashion_Accessories	after pointing this out i am still wondering_why i have been charged £_000 and still have no glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	called redhot first to make_sure they had product in stock , which they did :)
Fashion_Accessories	ordered online but didn ' t ask for express delivery which i wanted ( my fault )
Fashion_Accessories	called them up & they sorted delivery for me
Fashion_Accessories	ordered 0pm friday by saturday 0 :_00am had them
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered two_pairs of glasses from selectspecs . com after a recent eye exam .
Fashion_Accessories	not only were both pairs affordable , they are stylish and have an accurate prescription as well !
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased with the hulk hogan outfit i bought for a rescent weekend on the lash in weymouth with a few_hundred farmer friends !
Fashion_Accessories	i am not joking the outfit was so realistic that i had random people asking me in the streets for photos and autographs !
Fashion_Accessories	was a right good laugh !
Fashion_Accessories	also was pleased with seller communication and speed of delivery !
Fashion_Accessories	i just received my first ever glasses ever purchased on the internet from selectspecs . com .
Fashion_Accessories	i did a lot of research on buying glasses off the internet before choosing selectspecs . com .
Fashion_Accessories	their website is well_laid_out and you can find what you are looking for .
Fashion_Accessories	they took about 0 and a half weeks to arrive but when they did they were more_than what i expected .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses looked better_than they did even on the website .
Fashion_Accessories	they came air delivered from_hong_kong ... maybe this explains the cheapness .
Fashion_Accessories	they looked worth double the £_00 i had paid .
Fashion_Accessories	i will no_longer be visiting specsavers for my glasses again .
Fashion_Accessories	glasses are way more cheaper on the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	selectspecs is definately worth a shot .
Fashion_Accessories	they have a good range and the prices are fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	high_street prices are definitely overpriced .
Fashion_Accessories	selectspecs also give thinning of lenses for free !
Fashion_Accessories	which is why i went for them .
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t recommend these_guys highly_enough .
Fashion_Accessories	as a man trying to chose the correct engagement_ring they had the time and expert_advice to help me decide on the metal , diamond and ring style and size .
Fashion_Accessories	my now wife was delighted with the engagement_ring so when it came to chosing her wedding_ring there was only one place we were to go .
Fashion_Accessories	we sent the engagement_ring back so they could make a perfectly matching wedding_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	always happy to answer questions and give advice .
Fashion_Accessories	really fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	the delivery took the exact time specified , the glasses themselves were brilliant and the lenses were nice and clear .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered my outfit friday_afternoon , paid for 0 - 0 delivery came the next_day !
Fashion_Accessories	wow !
Fashion_Accessories	£_00 cheaper_than other website !
Fashion_Accessories	quality of the product is great , will order from you again & have recommended to others , thank_you 😄
Fashion_Accessories	i found some really lovely designers on avenue 00 with some items i hadn ' t seen elsewhere , and at excellent prices .
Fashion_Accessories	they were delivered quickly , wrapped nicely , and avenue ' s customer_service team were really efficient when i had to return something .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m really glad i found this site .
Fashion_Accessories	decent prices won ' t shop for sunglasses anywhere_else .. also these use dpd as their courier which is by_far the best out there at the moment :)
Fashion_Accessories	so yeah i ordered saturday and it came on tuesday .... great service ... cheapest i could find ... would deffo_use again ... simples .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you so much for dispatching the glasses immediately , they are exactly as i expected and delivered via dhl within 00_hours as promised :_d .... i would highly_recommend to anyone
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s really convenient for shopping online of the asian stylised clothes and also the beauty product , would recommend it to everyone !
Fashion_Accessories	product arrived so fast , so fast that i was out at the time and had to arrange to be delivered at a time that i wouldn ' t be working which meant an extra £_00 which was a bit_annoying .
Fashion_Accessories	however my shoes were packaged in a lovely and professional way which i ' ve never received before .
Fashion_Accessories	don ' t think i ' ve ever_dealt_with a more professional , efficient and friendly company as country_attire !
Fashion_Accessories	recommend without a moment ' s hesitation !
Fashion_Accessories	0 *!!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	we made payment 0 weeks_ago .
Fashion_Accessories	they promised the item would be dispatched in 0working_days at the latest in terms of conditions .
Fashion_Accessories	once they got the money , they never send the item or reply .
Fashion_Accessories	they send us no replies although we sent many emails .
Fashion_Accessories	we doubt they are real company .
Fashion_Accessories	they are frauds !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	we are going to contact bank , police and lawyer this weekend .
Fashion_Accessories	do not buy from them !!
Fashion_Accessories	they will never send item or give you back money at all !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	the jacket is amazing quick delivery no_problems want to get more stuff from outdoor and country store
Fashion_Accessories	it was very easy to find exactly_what i wanted and there was a lot of options .
Fashion_Accessories	great prices and great offers .
Fashion_Accessories	easily ordered and delivered very promptly .
Fashion_Accessories	00 / 00
Fashion_Accessories	i as many others , was sceptical about buying such an important thing online , but after_reading the reviews and finding the exact design i wanted , i made no_hesitation on ordering !
Fashion_Accessories	it came in the timescale specified , and was exactly_what i was expecting .
Fashion_Accessories	i absolutely love my new ring , it ' s amazing !
Fashion_Accessories	would definitely_recommend this company to anyone !
Fashion_Accessories	you know how it is ?
Fashion_Accessories	weekend ahead of you and you ' ve just made impromptu plans for an epic one - but , immediately after the excited exchange of generally , ' are you out ?'
Fashion_Accessories	texts and phone_calls to various mates , and various girls you ' d like to pull , but realistically have no chance of pulling whatsoever - you realise , i ' m working all day with no chance to head onto the high_street in order to buy something new to wear .
Fashion_Accessories	a few_clicks later and i ' m on the usual websites seeing all the usual stuff that everybody from my nephew to my granddad are wearing .
Fashion_Accessories	feeling a bit narked because i really don ' t want to look like everyone_else , i opted to be a little_bit more risque and dared type ' designer ' into everybody ' s favourite search_engine , google .
Fashion_Accessories	you know what to expect as soon as you do type in designer , expensive clobber that may look good , but something you ' re going to be scared to really go and get drunk in .
Fashion_Accessories	however , this time i was pleasantly_surprised - i ' d come_across jules_b .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve never used the site before , but the bright red sale button was easy to see - so i instantly set about looking through what they had to offer .
Fashion_Accessories	suddenly realising that i could well afford the stuff in the sale section , i set about searching the rest of the website .
Fashion_Accessories	in terms of high class designer brands they have them all - and i ' ll be honest , some of them i had never even heard of , but you know they are good when they use both names in the title .
Fashion_Accessories	fashion is about ego , and nobody is going to put their name on a daft product are they .
Fashion_Accessories	anyways , i ' m digressing so i ' ll continue .
Fashion_Accessories	the range and styles were all ultra contemporary , but with the obvious subtly that you get from paying that little_bit extra .
Fashion_Accessories	the prices on most of the products though , as said above , were really really affordable .
Fashion_Accessories	more_than that though , and what really impressed me , was the detail the site went into to tell you about the product you were looking at .
Fashion_Accessories	by this , i mean , whilst looking at a denham t - shirt , you get the message on the right hand side of the screen : " please bare in mind denham are small fitting sizes ".
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s that little_bit of detail , and personal effect that separates jules_b from other_websites i ' ve used previously .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s almost like the interaction you ' d get in the shop with the usually nice looking girl behind the counter .
Fashion_Accessories	from the things i bought , i had no issues getting things in the sizes and colours that i wanted and payment was so fast and simple , i ' d wondered if it had gone_through .
Fashion_Accessories	thankfully though , you get email confirmation , and updates about the processing of your order .
Fashion_Accessories	i took real confidence in this - i knew i hadn ' t been fobbed_off basically .
Fashion_Accessories	my package arrived the next_day , and whilst p_& p could be a little cheaper , the amount you saved buying the product in the first place , makes the post insignificant .
Fashion_Accessories	really happy with my t - shirt , and quite unusually , my choice of clothing for the weekend was complimented on by several people .
Fashion_Accessories	would give jules_b 0 *' s and definitely_recommend to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	divine_trash is the perfect place to shop if you are looking for unique and trendy clothes that you would ' nt find readily on the high_street , great place for buying that individual gift for someone or self treat x
Fashion_Accessories	i have to say , when i ordered such a cheap pair of glasses (£ 0 ), i expected to get what i paid for - which should have been worse than it was .
Fashion_Accessories	i was wrong about a bad service .
Fashion_Accessories	the service was great , with up to date delivery info , arrived in great time and customer_service available .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses are perfect , with a stylish look and case .
Fashion_Accessories	included u - v protection and other things you find out at the check - out .
Fashion_Accessories	not only is the price , quality and service amazing but i stood on my glasses and the worst part is a tiny chip in the corner of my glasses , hardly noticeable and they ' re still very wearable !
Fashion_Accessories	also , my glasses go through a lot more_than you ' d think and they ' re still great .
Fashion_Accessories	i would certainly recommend this service .
Fashion_Accessories	the thing that stood out was that they answered my ' order comments ' quite quickly by reply on email , which is so rare these days with online purchasing .
Fashion_Accessories	a personal_touch , much welcomed .
Fashion_Accessories	great selection , and very quick delivery
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a wig from this company , and was very impressed with the communication , as soon as i clicked pay , i received an_email_stating my order was on the way .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic service .
Fashion_Accessories	really good quality wig , packaged_securely .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect prices as well .
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks
Fashion_Accessories	very lovely customer_service , fast delivery and a fabulous end product !
Fashion_Accessories	visited diamond_heaven with my fiancee to buy our_wedding_rings .
Fashion_Accessories	the staff were extremly helpful and put up with me being indecisive for nearly 0 hours .
Fashion_Accessories	in the end we got there and after just picking_up the rings yesterday i ' m thrilled !
Fashion_Accessories	if you want friendly , knowledgeable people then don ' t hesitate to go with diamond_heaven .
Fashion_Accessories	if only finding a venue was this stress_free !
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately my glasses never arrived and after querying 0 or 0 times i needed to request a refund .
Fashion_Accessories	luckily the girl that refunded me seemed slightly more efficient and very apologetic but now i won ' t have my new prescription for a business trip and my new frames for my brothers wedding .
Fashion_Accessories	navigating the site was easy , ordering just the same , had order confirmation and tracking sent to my e_- mail as stated .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you very much !
Fashion_Accessories	placed an order without having to register meaninglessly .
Fashion_Accessories	the package arrived quickly without any hassle .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d definately_recommend and use chemical_records again .
Fashion_Accessories	easy to order , fast delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	stunning items .
Fashion_Accessories	have used webtogs twice and been really pleased both_times .
Fashion_Accessories	product delivered promptly and reasonably_priced .
Fashion_Accessories	great sunglasses delivered fast and very reasonably_priced
Fashion_Accessories	00 / 00
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased a holland esquire men ’_s shooting patch jacket – lambswool brown 000 from norway .
Fashion_Accessories	it was my first time reading about country_attire ltd on the net and when i saw the product description it spoke volume of the product and spot on to every detail .
Fashion_Accessories	the marketing strategy is excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	my questions on delivery and change of shipping address were promptly answered .
Fashion_Accessories	important to note was i asked my parcel to be delivered to a friend but not being at home it was delivered to his neighbour .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer and delivery service are excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	give it a try to comprehend what am talking_about .
Fashion_Accessories	as for me , its country_attire ltd all the way .
Fashion_Accessories	always with the best brands from around the world .
Fashion_Accessories	a constantly surprising company !
Fashion_Accessories	im really impressed with the service and delivery company .
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t believe i ordered my husbands christmas pressie yesterday at
Fashion_Accessories	0pm and now it ' s all wrapped and under the tree before lunch the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	very impressed and it was refreshing to have a delivery time so i could plan my day
Fashion_Accessories	around it .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent company will use again
Fashion_Accessories	great shirt , had to return it due to it being too big , no_qualms and they sent me a smaller_size - boyfriend obviously needs to go to the gym more ha_ha !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks for your help
Fashion_Accessories	fast , timed delivery , product well_packaged , what more could you ask for .
Fashion_Accessories	quick and easy service and cheap good quality products thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	i would defiantly recommend this company to all my friends ( i already have ) all the sunglasses are gorgeous and there was plenty of sunglasses for everyone no matter what your style is .
Fashion_Accessories	the quality looks great too , can ' t wait_until the sun comes back out so i can put my sunglasses on .. it ' s gonna be a hard decision between the two !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	is all about great , honest , trusted , helpful
Fashion_Accessories	its not very often i ' m fully_satisfied with customer_service in this country .
Fashion_Accessories	most companies are happy to sell you something but when it goes_wrong they tend to run a mile & don ' t want to know ..... i had problem with pair of ray_bans i purchased from red_hot .
Fashion_Accessories	to cut a long_story short , i loved the fact that i spoke to someone at the end of the phone and didnt get directed various departments asking me the standard questions and not giving a shit .
Fashion_Accessories	my glasses were swapped without any hassle , or inconvience to me .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you philly for all your help ... will be back soon
Fashion_Accessories	so glad i have discovered country_attire .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered several items from them for myself and christmas_presents , pleased with the range of items they have available and how quickly my ordered arrived in the lovely branded boxes .
Fashion_Accessories	i had to return a couple of items and exchange one which is usually a pain with online shopping but this was free to return them and all processes were quickly dealt_with and i have now received my exchanged item which is perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks for all the help country_attire - pleasure to shop with !
Fashion_Accessories	really great item and service , i would thoroughly reccomend buying from this company .
Fashion_Accessories	just a little disappointed that the email survey was delivered at nearly midnight and woke me up !
Fashion_Accessories	perhaps set a filter that only sends the emails between_0am and 0pm .
Fashion_Accessories	apart_from that minor niggle i cannot reccomend this company highly_enough .
Fashion_Accessories	wonderful experience with country_attire .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered barbour welly carriers and hunter socks for christmas_presents .
Fashion_Accessories	as well as being cheaper_than buying direct , delivery was quick and efficient and couldn ' t recommend these_guys highly_enough .
Fashion_Accessories	just thought i ' d say what a lovely company this is - you really do receive a nice personal service , which is hard to come_across these days !
Fashion_Accessories	i was always helped whenever i had any_queries ( and i did have quite a few ) but never did i receive any pressure whatsoever !
Fashion_Accessories	my girlfriend ( now fiancee !)
Fashion_Accessories	agreed to marry me on sunday 00th_may and is now wearing the absolutely beautiful ring i arranged for you to make - she is over the moon and is continually showing it off to everyone !
Fashion_Accessories	we are now beginning the lengthy process of planning our_wedding , but rest_assured we will no doubt be back for our_wedding_rings .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks so much for all your help with the engagement side of things !!
Fashion_Accessories	alec
Fashion_Accessories	excellent hunter boots !
Fashion_Accessories	very quick and reasonable delivery charge .
Fashion_Accessories	will definitiely come back for more boots !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you very much !
Fashion_Accessories	pretty_much a perfect online shopping_experience from the get go .
Fashion_Accessories	a nice , bright airy site that ' s easy to navigate with loads of choice and menu options that actually make sense - you want fishnets , there ' s an option .
Fashion_Accessories	seamed , there ' s one of those too .
Fashion_Accessories	hold ups ?
Fashion_Accessories	bridal ?
Fashion_Accessories	the site is organised in the same way i categorise hoisery in my head , which makes finding what i want easy .
Fashion_Accessories	the prices are great , and saves the hassle of going into_town and there ' s more choice too .
Fashion_Accessories	with first_class mail they were with me the next_day , so if the party ' s the next_day ( or whatever event !)
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s not a problem .
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t find any reason to complain really , and i think i ' ve sorted my tight shopping for the future .
Fashion_Accessories	over the last_year or so i ' ve given webtogs more repeat_custom than any other online_retailer .
Fashion_Accessories	the website is very easy to use , with a good range of products at competitive_prices .
Fashion_Accessories	each time i ' ve ordered the products have arrived very quickly , often the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	customer_service is also very helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	i would happily_recommend this company to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	a few_months_ago my fiance and i decided to have my 0ct white gold engagement_ring re - made in platinum .
Fashion_Accessories	it was a complicated design , so i began contacting jewellers in london to get quotes ; some didn ' t even reply , and some quoted very high prices .
Fashion_Accessories	purely_diamonds however were excellent from start to finish .
Fashion_Accessories	emelie and stephanie were extremely quick replying to my ( many ) emails , and very professional .
Fashion_Accessories	they came back very quickly with a quote , based on photos i had sent , sizes i had given etc , and the price was very good , so i went to see them in person .
Fashion_Accessories	i felt_confident that they were right for the job , and so decided to go_ahead .
Fashion_Accessories	yesterday i picked_up my new ring , and it is absolutely perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	the quality is exceptional , and the ring is just stunning .
Fashion_Accessories	it looks the same as my original one in terms of style , which is what i wanted , but the quality of the diamonds they used is clear even to the untrained eye .
Fashion_Accessories	i am extremely impressed , and will be using them for my custom wedding_band .
Fashion_Accessories	i also wouldn ' t hesitate to use them for future bespoke pieces .
Fashion_Accessories	so all in all , 0 * service , and a beautiful bespoke ring .
Fashion_Accessories	bought a carven dress on sale , what a bargain !
Fashion_Accessories	came beautifully wrapped .
Fashion_Accessories	appreciated the text service and precise delivery information , down to the hour .
Fashion_Accessories	i am absolutely in love with my new ray_bans !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you so much for such a smooth_transaction .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was extra fast , i must_say i did not expect it to be that fast ( within one day ).
Fashion_Accessories	item securely packed to make_sure it does not get damaged !
Fashion_Accessories	i am definitely going to recommend spectacles direct to my friends , and i am pretty sure that i am going to use your perfect service again !
Fashion_Accessories	you can be proud of all your hard work !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you again !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	everything from the ordering_process to the wearing process is great .
Fashion_Accessories	the site is easy to navigate and the orders are processed quickly and can be delivered to suit you .
Fashion_Accessories	the initial packaging is superb , bright coloured embossed tins for every pair that everyone will want to keep and also key - fobs that will undoubtedly make their way into your keychains .
Fashion_Accessories	both the underwear and board shorts are great , long_lasting vibrant colours and designs will guarantee to turn heads and keep you comfortable day in day out .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my wedding_ring , and they gave me a date straight_away when it would be finished , they e_- mailed me every few_days to let me know the progress of my ring , the ring was a perfect fit and is very pretty , came in a lovely box and they gave me some cleaning products to keep my ring sparkling .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended :) *****
Fashion_Accessories	i have by 0 sunglasses and the web is very good response and reliable thanks , we go make new shoping again soon .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent company , fast delivery and realiable .
Fashion_Accessories	very good service
Fashion_Accessories	i phoned through an order on saturday , but was told that the prada shades i wanted were out of stock in the required size .
Fashion_Accessories	i was promised that they would call me as soon as they came in ( tues or wed ).
Fashion_Accessories	i have heard this sort of thing before , so treated their promise with a certain degree of scepticism .
Fashion_Accessories	true to their word , i was called on tuesday_morning by an incredibly_helpful lady_called helena , to confirm that they were once again in stock .
Fashion_Accessories	i promptly ordered them with their free next_day service .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately i had an issue with ups , who decided not to stick to their next_day guarantee , but this is no fault of the shop .
Fashion_Accessories	when i collected them from the ups depot i found that i had been mistakenly sent the wrong_size .
Fashion_Accessories	i need the shades for my holiday , so really needed them for today .
Fashion_Accessories	i got on a train to their shop in southend , and they were kind enough to give me the correct pair , and reimburse me for my train fare !
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant !
Fashion_Accessories	the shades are awesome too .
Fashion_Accessories	overall a brilliant shop , great staff , and i will buy all my shades from them from now on .
Fashion_Accessories	my fiancé bought my engagement_ring from diamondgeezer . com and we didn ' t even contemplate going anywhere_else for our_wedding_bands .
Fashion_Accessories	my full channel set diamond wedding_band is absolutely_stunning and i can ' t wait to wear it all the time once we are married in a few weeks ’ time .
Fashion_Accessories	my fiancé opted for an 0mm plain platinum band which looks amazing .
Fashion_Accessories	the service has been second to none and no matter how many questions i asked it was never too much_trouble for them .
Fashion_Accessories	luke , ben and the team are fantastic to deal with from start to finish and we cannot recommend then highly_enough .
Fashion_Accessories	we even ordered both mine and my bridesmaid ’_s wedding jewellery from them .
Fashion_Accessories	after spending many hours walking round many different shopping centres and talking to hundreds of ring shops for my wedding_ring , i was kicking myself that i found out about diamond_geezer after otherwise not only would they have been the best supplier of my ring but they would have saved many hours of torture being dragged round bluewater on a saturday .
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer are reliable , professional , freindly and very competitive regarding prices .
Fashion_Accessories	after having a discussion over the phone i had decided on my ring which was delivered instantly .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunatly it was not the right size but did that turn into a headache ?
Fashion_Accessories	not in the slightest !!!!!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer took my ring back , changed the size and it was back with me in a week .
Fashion_Accessories	if your looking for a high_quality ring at a very good price with zero hassle and 000_% satisfaction then make diamond_geezer your first amd last choice .
Fashion_Accessories	not much more to say really , on two_separate_occasions i have ordered something from here and on both_occasions had the parcel in my hand within 00_hours on their cheapest delivery option ( only about £ 0 ).
Fashion_Accessories	their price was better_than most of the sites i visited ( both_times ) and customer_service was absolutely_brilliant - email to say when order received and also when dispatched .
Fashion_Accessories	don ' t normally_write these things but when you ' ve got so used to slow and rubbish service it ' s nice to find a decent company for a change .
Fashion_Accessories	on sep 00 , i placed an order for a pair of jeans and a jumper .
Fashion_Accessories	i had the same day received a discount_code which i applied for a total of 000 £.
Fashion_Accessories	moments later , i receive a dated invoice .
Fashion_Accessories	everything good so far .
Fashion_Accessories	later the same day , i receive an_email from endclothing , telling_me that they ’ ve made a mistake with the discount , and that they cannot give me the items for said price .
Fashion_Accessories	i am offered to get 00 £ off one item and 00_% in discount for the total amount instead .
Fashion_Accessories	i agree to this .
Fashion_Accessories	i do , however , get an_email again later .
Fashion_Accessories	this time i am told that they cannot give me the earlier offered discount of 00 £ off + 00_% either .
Fashion_Accessories	they ’ ve calculated wrong .
Fashion_Accessories	i then write them back ; telling them that i think it is unfair to retract two offers in a row .
Fashion_Accessories	at this point , i have received both an invoice , a dispatch notice and they charge my card for the originally agreed amount .
Fashion_Accessories	despite this , they cancel my order .
Fashion_Accessories	endclothing ’_s terms and conditions states that “ this agreement is only confirmed when we have accepted your offer to purchase the goods and have sent you an invoice or dispatch receipt that includes the date of the agreement being accepted which will be the date shown on said invoice or receipt .”
Fashion_Accessories	regardless that i ’ ve received both a dated invoice , dated dispatch receipt and they ’ ve charged my card , they refuse that they ’ ve accepted my offer .
Fashion_Accessories	this has left me sorry that i ordered something at endclothing this time .
Fashion_Accessories	this ‘ mistake ’ has left me with a deficit of 000_pounds (~ 0000 dkk ) on my account for 0 days and counting so far .
Fashion_Accessories	i also have to account for the difference in exchange_rate between gbp and dkk as well as the interest i ’ ve had to pay for the deficit .
Fashion_Accessories	i ’ ve been through all this just so that endclothing could press another 00 £ out of me .
Fashion_Accessories	i have previously only had positive_experiences with this shop .
Fashion_Accessories	so i merely want people to know that when they purchase at endclothing , they risk ending in a situation like me : no clothes and an actual loss on the bank_account .
Fashion_Accessories	i went up to the warehouse in edinburgh , for a fitting , quick to organize , simple , and when i was there , i was served by sonny ; within 00_minutes i had everything measured and fitted and the order was done just like that .
Fashion_Accessories	really helpful and informative went beyond the call of duty to help with everything , very pleased with my full outfit , thanks to the scotland kilt company team .
Fashion_Accessories	i love my designer sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	got them for a great price compared to other_retailers , and in time for my holiday thanks to mary in customer_services !
Fashion_Accessories	excellent company and i will certainly reccommend
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased 0 pairs of shortys from waxx_underwear and i have to say they are the comfiest underwear i have ever worn , not to mention the quality .
Fashion_Accessories	the items were dispatched and delivered very quickly and the communication is second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definately be purchasing much more items from waxx_underwear .
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased and satisfied customer .
Fashion_Accessories	very friendly , flexible about shipping , very responsive .
Fashion_Accessories	products exactly as promised and great quality
Fashion_Accessories	these_guys are great !
Fashion_Accessories	my husband is a long standing customer and i bought him a waistcoat and cravat recently as a present .
Fashion_Accessories	they actually telephoned me to apologise for a delayed despatch because the button - holing machine had broken down , which i thought was very courteous - i would have been happy with an apologetic email !
Fashion_Accessories	and when the cravat arrived and was the wrong_colour i called them up and they immediately sent me a replacement by recorded_delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	top_class .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve used end .
Fashion_Accessories	many_times , and have never been disappointed .
Fashion_Accessories	their selection of products gets better every season , and their customer_service is top_notch .
Fashion_Accessories	any e_- mail query gets answered very quickly , and the returns process through collect_+ is flawless .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely buy from country_attire again .
Fashion_Accessories	this is the second time i ' ve used them and the service and clothing range is second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	if they say the item is in stock - it is , and its posted immediately .
Fashion_Accessories	they are a pleasure to buy from - hassle_free internet shopping .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent service , friendly staff , keep you updated and dealt_with in a timely_fashion .
Fashion_Accessories	am using again to get engagement_ring reset .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my new shoes on sunday_afternoon and they arrived bright and early on tuesday_morning !
Fashion_Accessories	i have been so impressed with their customer_service i will be shopping with them again , and recommending them to my friends !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you very much webtogs !
Fashion_Accessories	brought my engagment ring for here .
Fashion_Accessories	good price and quick service , saved my bacon !
Fashion_Accessories	got a couple of mates who are going to buy there rings off them too .
Fashion_Accessories	awesome all_round !
Fashion_Accessories	i have been waiting for my delivery for almost seven weeks and emailed many_times , i get response only to my frustrated follow ups with incredibly unhelpful emails , i have been told that " there is a backlog " - not my problem , if i had known that it would not be delivered in the 00 - 00 working_days as stated on there website i would have obviously opted for one of the many other_sites that offer identical services .
Fashion_Accessories	i was then told " my delivery would be shipped soon " also not good enough .
Fashion_Accessories	after another follow_up asking for a full_refund since i have paid for a product i haven ' t received i get an_email telling_me they have now been shipped and they will be with me in .... 00 - 00 working_days !
Fashion_Accessories	really not worth the hassle and the customer_service is really poor , they don ' t seem to know / care !
Fashion_Accessories	i don ' t usually bother leaving consumer reviews but this really is a joke !
Fashion_Accessories	chemical_records will be my goto site for future clothes and shoes purchases .
Fashion_Accessories	especially when there are sales on .
Fashion_Accessories	after researching diamond cuts , shapes , colours and quality i finally started looking for a specific ring for my now fiancee .
Fashion_Accessories	i know she loved a white gold ring with a princess cut diamond , so i began my search .
Fashion_Accessories	after searching through near enough every well_known jeweller , i was still unable to find what i needed within a reasonable_price .
Fashion_Accessories	i luckily stumbled along purely_diamonds when trying to find a jewellers i hadn ' t clicked on yet .
Fashion_Accessories	had some early reservations obviously as i hadn ' t heard of them and it was on the internet , but still had a look .
Fashion_Accessories	i found the exact ring i was looking for using their very simple sorting options on the site .
Fashion_Accessories	having found the ring , and a good quality diamond , i looked at the price expecting to have to give up on the search , and i was so shocked how it was so cheap .
Fashion_Accessories	thought it was too good to be true so i put it on the credit_card to be safe haha .
Fashion_Accessories	the confirmation come through and i had asked for it to be delivered 0 days ahead of schedule .
Fashion_Accessories	a quick e_- mail and a prompt response settled my nerves a bit as they confirmed it will be sent that day .
Fashion_Accessories	a further email arrived from both emelie and stephanie to say they weren ' t happy with something on the ring and asked for a further day , which was fine .
Fashion_Accessories	this goes to show the standard they set themselves as it has to be perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring arrived a day early , and i popped the question , and of course my now fiancee could not say no to such a beautiful ring .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you so much for all of your hard work and excellent service .

Fashion_Accessories	i ordered some prada sunglasses for my boyfriend .
Fashion_Accessories	the delivery date stated was 0 - 00 working_days .
Fashion_Accessories	after 0 days i received an_email to say the glasses would be with me between 00 - 00 working_days .
Fashion_Accessories	i emailed them and advised i needed the glasses by the 00th of november .
Fashion_Accessories	the response was that they would ship them asap and have them to me for that date .
Fashion_Accessories	on the 00th of november i received an_email_stating my glasses were now in stock and they were shipping them straight_away and they should be with me on the 00th .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses which were now a late birthday_present eventually arrived on the 00th of november .
Fashion_Accessories	to top it off the glasses were the wrong ones , in a scratched box and missing the eec certificate which the website promises .
Fashion_Accessories	i have never received such incompetent service from anyone
Fashion_Accessories	the item was ordered and it arrived at my husband ' s workplace in double quick time .
Fashion_Accessories	it was exactly as_described .
Fashion_Accessories	the website is extremely easy to use so ordering was very simple .

Fashion_Accessories	i ' m currently on my 0th pair of selectspecs glasses and i love them and will keep going back for more .
Fashion_Accessories	super value for money they last as long as and look as good as high_street glasses but at a fraction of the cost .

Fashion_Accessories	this is the 0st time i have used this site and it definitely won ' t be the last time , i thought the choice of product was very good and then delivery was fantastic quick and well_packaged , and product was exactly_what i wanted , i would recommend highly .
Fashion_Accessories	i have used this site several_times already ...... same result ..... order , pay , delivered next_day .... great for those last_minute holiday sunnies !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my glasses and immediately got a paypal invoicing confirming the payment ... 0 days_later i then called the company to question why i hadn ' t received a confirmation_email even_though i had paid , the man on the phone told me it takes a long time to process on paypal ( why ?
Fashion_Accessories	it doesn ' t for other_companies ?)
Fashion_Accessories	and that i ' d receive it early the next week .
Fashion_Accessories	a week_later i still hadn ' t received my sunglasses so i called up and spoke to a very rude girl who spoke to me like i was stupid and told me the website states it takes 00 working_days from the order .... this time_frame had already passed but the women refused to apologise .... and i ' ve been told to wait another 00 working_days for my product .
Fashion_Accessories	absolute waste of time
Fashion_Accessories	excellent costumer and warranty service .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend webtogs to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	i was very pleased to find out that the free delivery on orders over 00gbp includes shipping outside the uk .
Fashion_Accessories	my coat was delivered to me in denmark on the day specified by webtogs ( i placed the order monday_evening and got the coat friday mid morning ) and the coat was significantly_cheaper_than anywhere_else .
Fashion_Accessories	' rigtig_god service !'

Fashion_Accessories	from the moment i contacted the company , they were helpful and knowledgeable .
Fashion_Accessories	i was really fussy about exact measurement and diamond sizes but nothing was too much_trouble .
Fashion_Accessories	the price was also much less_than similar product on other_sites and i was kept up to date with every_stage of the production process .
Fashion_Accessories	my beautiful ring arrived quickly in a good quality shiny black box .
Fashion_Accessories	it fits_perfectly and is exactly_what i had hoped for .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend diamond_geezer to anyone_looking for a beautiful , high_quality product - buying online wasn ' t scary after_speaking to such helpful people .

Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	top_notch webtogs .
Fashion_Accessories	probably the best store for dj ' s and musicians in general ...
Fashion_Accessories	i love the commitment of this company that is always more satisfying your target audience .

Fashion_Accessories	marie was such a helpful salesperson and i really love my sun glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely_recommend the sunglassesshop to my friends and purchase here again .
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	not much to say other than they dispatched my items very quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	when i received the items i had ordered the wrong_size and they immediately responded to my email and we organised the new item very easily .
Fashion_Accessories	it was here the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	great , friendly service .
Fashion_Accessories	recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	at first i was a bit_nervous_about spending a lot of money online , with a company that had ' geezer ' in the title .
Fashion_Accessories	but they ' d been recommended by a friend so i went for it .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m very glad i did , i ' m a repeat customer now , both product and service are so far ahead of the high_street alternatives .
Fashion_Accessories	i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend this family run business to anyone .
Fashion_Accessories	i recently_bought a pair of oakley and raybans from these_guys and i was greatly impressed with the advice given .
Fashion_Accessories	i have a tiny head so buying sunglasses is a nightmare , thankfully they were happy to make two recommendations and told me i could return them if they didn ' t fit .
Fashion_Accessories	the good news is they did so no need to return .
Fashion_Accessories	the assistant in selfridges was nowhere_near as helpful which is why i ended_up buying online .
Fashion_Accessories	a personal_touch on a web purchase is rare these days so they deserve a recommendation .
Fashion_Accessories	they also turned_up very quickly so all_round great service .
Fashion_Accessories	i wouldn ' t have any hesitation in recommending this company .
Fashion_Accessories	found exactly_what i was looking for and at an excellent price .
Fashion_Accessories	couldn ' t be_happier , completely painless .
Fashion_Accessories	00 / 00 recommended .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic quality products at great prices with great speedy service .
Fashion_Accessories	service in divine_trash is excellent staff are really helpful and know how to help you put an outfit together !
Fashion_Accessories	which is help i need !..
Fashion_Accessories	friendly service .
Fashion_Accessories	there are so little sites out there that actually sell stylish asian clothing .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s great that yesstyle is actually fashion - savvy , but it ' s even better that there ' s such a huge_selection .
Fashion_Accessories	love it .
Fashion_Accessories	plus , you guys sponsor wong fu productions .
Fashion_Accessories	:_d
Fashion_Accessories	great website .
Fashion_Accessories	easy to understand .
Fashion_Accessories	fast delivery and excellent customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommend
Fashion_Accessories	horrible customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	they will not refund your money in cash no matter what .
Fashion_Accessories	received defective item , asked to send back for refund , and their reply :
Fashion_Accessories	*** regarding your recent enquiry , we are afraid that only replacement can be arranged towards defective item .
Fashion_Accessories	in case you would like to return item " fly series trucker cap [ one size ]" for refund in yesstyle stored credit , we will regard it as an unwanted item return and no return_postage reimbursement will be arranged .
Fashion_Accessories	***
Fashion_Accessories	the item was crushed in a flat box with no care at all . not willing to refund postage return even_though its their fault .
Fashion_Accessories	not willing to refund in cash .
Fashion_Accessories	no matter what , if you have a problem , you lose out .
Fashion_Accessories	get your money back by ' charge back ' via your credit_card company .
Fashion_Accessories	let them lose out , instead of you .
Fashion_Accessories	this is the second product i have bought from the sunglasses_shop and the goggles didn ' t disappoint .
Fashion_Accessories	the ordering_process was easy_peasy and they arrived the next_day - in plenty of time for me to take skiing .
Fashion_Accessories	i can ' t thank_you enough !
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased with these_guys .
Fashion_Accessories	ring is stunning , great price and quick service .
Fashion_Accessories	look_forward to buying from them in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	tip_top company !
Fashion_Accessories	i knew_exactly_what i wanted for my engagement_ring , but couldn ' t quite find it , and anything i fell in love with was just too expensive .
Fashion_Accessories	i stumbled_across diamond_geezer after a lot of internet research , and was quite encouraged by their prices , but also the fact that they enable you to design exactly_what you want , from scratch .
Fashion_Accessories	we already had the aquamarine centre stone that we wanted to be set in something quite specific .
Fashion_Accessories	so i emailed them and asked if it would be possible to get a setting for the stone .
Fashion_Accessories	what we ended_up doing was sending my stone , and pictures and a dexcription of just what i wanted ... they got it perfect first time , and i was stunned by what it was going to look like !
Fashion_Accessories	they sent me the cad images , which i fell in love with , and when the ring came it was more_than perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	it took slightly_longer_than planned , but they weren ' t happy with the first casting and went back to scratch - they are very bothered about quality .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided i wanted milgrain edging added , and it was done quickly and with no bother , as was resizing .
Fashion_Accessories	it is a dream_come true at a price i couldn ' t believe , and the quality is great .
Fashion_Accessories	i have people asking about it every day !
Fashion_Accessories	it is nerve - wracking doing something like this over the internet , but i would not hesitate to recommend diamond_geezer , and i will certainly use them again .
Fashion_Accessories	special note goes to ben , who guided me through the whole_thing and made sure i was kept_updated and was happy with everything .
Fashion_Accessories	he was helpful , friendly and never pushy .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks guys , i now have an engagement_ring that it highly coveted , and much loved by me !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	no issues at all !
Fashion_Accessories	extremely_satisfied .
Fashion_Accessories	really can ' t fault the service at all , ordered some leather care products and they were with me the next_day with their standard delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	well_packaged and best price to boot , have shopped with them on numerous_occasions and am never disappointed .
Fashion_Accessories	i have used selectspecs quite a few_times for my prescription_glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses are good value , which allows me to have a pair in every handbag and every corner of the house !
Fashion_Accessories	the service is fast and reliable , and the glasses always arrive when promised .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses are described well , along with their measurements , which is handy .
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend selectspecs to family and friends .
Fashion_Accessories	we always buy our loake shoes from pediwear .
Fashion_Accessories	always a great price and excellent service .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery quick and items very well_packaged .
Fashion_Accessories	after ordering a pair of raybans from another retailer i found out it was going to take up to a stonking 00 days for delivery !
Fashion_Accessories	the sunglasses were a present for my boyfriend and so i needed them by 00 / 0 /_0000 ... today !
Fashion_Accessories	after cancelling my order with the other retailer i called sunglassesshop to see if they could help .... i ordered the sunglasses on the 00th at 00pm and they have just landed on my desk now .. nextday as promised .. and a perfect product .
Fashion_Accessories	i couldn ' t have asked for better service from everyone_involved in this transaction .. and will_definitely be shoping with sunglassesshop again soon !
Fashion_Accessories	!

Fashion_Accessories	i have been a selectspecs customer since 0000 , and have been consistently impressed with the quality of workmanship , low_prices and friendly customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	after having my glasses reglazed with selectspecs after not giving into the pressure sales_tactics from another high_street opticians , i was so impressed i sent in my mum ' s glasses for reglazing with my own .
Fashion_Accessories	the said high - street optician charged £_00 for one pair of glasses , and selectspecs charged just under £_00 for two_pairs of glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	the quality , speed and great customer_service is exactly the same as it was 0 years_ago , and my mum and i will_definitely be using selectspecs again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	tom sawyer had the nicest selection of wedding cake knife and server sets i looked at - we wanted a gift that looked classy and classic , not tacky .
Fashion_Accessories	the packaging of the one we got was sturdy and attractive .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d prefer it if the colour wasn ' t black as that isn ' t very ' weddingy ', but the set was a good weight .
Fashion_Accessories	they dispatched it the next_day which was great given that it had to be engraved .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy customer - amazing service
Fashion_Accessories	the delivery was fast , packaging meant i didnt event have to wrap for christmas and i was informed exactly when it would be delivered next_day !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	will_definitely shop her from now on !!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	have ordered several_times from webtogs .
Fashion_Accessories	their website is slick , attractive and easy to navigate , items arrive quickly and are always well_packaged plus their refund or exchange policy means you can have absolute confidence in your purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	thought the website could maybe use some work on the layout when you are searching for your sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered raybans , still unsure if they are genuine as came in a used looking cardboard_box , looked up online and said case should be embossed not printed and mine was printed , however the glasses as far as i ' m aware are real .
Fashion_Accessories	whether they are or just a really good pair of fakes , i ' m still unsure but they look good and protect my eyes !
Fashion_Accessories	feel a tad squint but that could be my head !
Fashion_Accessories	so what happens if selectspecs . com send you the wrong frames ?
Fashion_Accessories	they claim that they haven ' t even_though you have confirmation stating the obvious .
Fashion_Accessories	what happens if you point out the difference in the frames with links ?
Fashion_Accessories	they tell you your in the wrong .
Fashion_Accessories	very ironic that an opticians can ' t see the difference_between frames .
Fashion_Accessories	will never use again .
Fashion_Accessories	i want to say thank_you very much , i have got my
Fashion_Accessories	engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	i was initially quite apprehensive_about buying jewellery online but now we won ' t hesitate to shop with you again in the future . the ring is so gently and beautiful and the size is
Fashion_Accessories	perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	it ' s brilliant !
Fashion_Accessories	and your service was fantastic and so fast !
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks again !
Fashion_Accessories	d . voynikova
Fashion_Accessories	nice website , easy to use and great selection of gigs .
Fashion_Accessories	got a great deal on my ray_bans - so a very happy customer .
Fashion_Accessories	will use again in future .

Fashion_Accessories	ordered a corset a month_ago , i have sent 0 inquiries , it states that it shall be answered within 00_hours , neither have been .

Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	look_forward to the new designs !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i bought four grenson shoes here .
Fashion_Accessories	this is the best shop .
Fashion_Accessories	found lensesinglasses after my optician quoted me over one hundred_pounds to re - glaze my glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	for exactly the same service lensesinglasses ( which is the re glazing service offered by spectacles direct ) quoted me £_00 !
Fashion_Accessories	i was skeptical that this could be a genuine offer , but trusted the reviews on trust_pilot and sent off my glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	after a very polite conversation on the phone my re glazed glasses arrived two days_later , in a hard case with a new polish cloth , plus my old lenses !
Fashion_Accessories	amazed that such a service can be offered for such a price .
Fashion_Accessories	there are three more pairs in the house that ' ll be heading up to edinburgh promptly .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	first_class service !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered four items and one of them didn ' t fit so had to return it .
Fashion_Accessories	money was refunded and they contacted me directly to just to make_sure i was happy with the service !
Fashion_Accessories	will be using again !
Fashion_Accessories	it is very easy to find your favorite clothes at macy ' s as they have a huge_selection and very competitive_prices .

Fashion_Accessories	waxx_underwear produce by_far the most comfortable and fashionable underwear on the market .
Fashion_Accessories	their designs are eye catching and there are always new amazing designs coming out .
Fashion_Accessories	the shorts are perfect to wear under an outfit and they even withstand being out in the surf !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	ordered on friday_night and received on tuesday - as far as i ' m concerned that ' s next_day delivery without having paid any carriage !
Fashion_Accessories	product turned_up in perfect_condition and in good packaging .
Fashion_Accessories	i had a small delivery address query which was dealt_with immediately .
Fashion_Accessories	and above all i paid less_than i would have done anywhere_else !
Fashion_Accessories	couldn ' t ask for more .
Fashion_Accessories	bought a costume for a stag_weekend .
Fashion_Accessories	and to my surprise it was on my doorstep two days_later what a great service would definitely use again .
Fashion_Accessories	wow !
Fashion_Accessories	that was my initially thought when seeing my engagement_ring for the first time , it was truly the most beautiful ring that i have ever_seen .
Fashion_Accessories	my fiance allowed me to design the ring myself and luke at diamond_geezer was available to chat ( at length !)
Fashion_Accessories	to me every day when i had queries or questions .
Fashion_Accessories	his knowledge really made me feel_confident and this is what really sold it to me .
Fashion_Accessories	my fiance was spending a considerable_amount of money and so i was cautious_about buying off the internet - after working with luke and recieving the ring i would never use any other company ..
Fashion_Accessories	i think that we have got a lot more for our money and the ' money back guarantee ' if you dont like it within the first 0 days is fantastic .
Fashion_Accessories	having said this my ring is going nowhere apart_from my finger .
Fashion_Accessories	even after the payment had been taken the service was excellent , you get the feeling that diamond_geezer really do care for the job they do and the service they provide .
Fashion_Accessories	wedding_ring next ....!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	they are both amazing rings and even better then we could have hoped for .
Fashion_Accessories	my wedding_ring sits perfect with the engagement_ring and they look great together .
Fashion_Accessories	johns ring is exactly_what he had in mind and looks great .
Fashion_Accessories	we are both extremely happy and thank_you again for your help !
Fashion_Accessories	kind_regards jayne and john
Fashion_Accessories	amazing quality , durable fabric .
Fashion_Accessories	exactly_what i need when snowboarding !
Fashion_Accessories	definitely passing on the news to my friends about this product :_d
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely speechless !
Fashion_Accessories	when my boyfriend proposed i couldn ' t belive how beautifull the ring was .
Fashion_Accessories	it looks_like something you see in a fancy magazine !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you diamond_heaven !
Fashion_Accessories	one of the most amazing things about this shop and the price as compared to the quality of the products you receive , i bought a the north_face vest , save 00_% of the retail price , received within and few_days and just couldn ' t been happier with it .
Fashion_Accessories	was worried_about ordering oakleys on line , but less_than 00_hrs from order to on my face is great stuff !!
Fashion_Accessories	and i love the hijinxs !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve ordered two_pairs of shoes from pediwear to date , on separate_occasions , and i ' ve been very pleased both_times .
Fashion_Accessories	the prices are unbeatable , and if they should be_beaten anyway they have a price pledge to match the better price .
Fashion_Accessories	shipping to sweden ( where i live ) is generally fast .
Fashion_Accessories	the second time i ordered from them there was a delay in production , but the customer_service was very forthcoming .
Fashion_Accessories	i was informed about the delay and was offered to cancel my order .
Fashion_Accessories	i decided to keep waiting , and was continuously updated on the status .
Fashion_Accessories	the only thing keeping me from buying shoes from pediwear every week is my wallet !
Fashion_Accessories	following extensive_research into the serengeti eyeware product and brand i found sunglasses_shop to be one of the few places to offer them for sale .
Fashion_Accessories	not only that , they were at competitive_prices with the option of discounts as well .
Fashion_Accessories	the product is strong and the service that provided them was stronger still .
Fashion_Accessories	swift delivery and lovely packaging made for further pleasant surprises for a middle_man company .
Fashion_Accessories	would reccomend every time .
Fashion_Accessories	the nicest range of clothing available on the website , end are my go - to site and clearly set the bar in terms of service .
Fashion_Accessories	my order was placed and received all within seventeen hours , with constant ( far from irritating ) email_updates from dpd regarding delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses i bought from select_specs were a lot cheaper_than from my optician , and they threw more stuff in than the opticians .
Fashion_Accessories	i need quite thick lenses and selectspecs thin them a bit for free the optician would have charged me extra for this .
Fashion_Accessories	very pleased with the service and have used before and will_continue to do so
Fashion_Accessories	i do like their products but customer_service is very bad .
Fashion_Accessories	i was on hold 00_minutes and nobody ever answered the phone .
Fashion_Accessories	the order was placed a week_ago and still i did not get any tracking_number .
Fashion_Accessories	we have 00_% unemployment rate why can not they hire people to answer the phone ?
Fashion_Accessories	crown_brushes truly have amazing customer_service i had an issue with my order it was sorted within an_hour of contact .
Fashion_Accessories	my order arrived within 0 days of placing it !
Fashion_Accessories	the zebra brush pot is perfect size and the brushes are soft and perfect ,.
Fashion_Accessories	i look_forward to using crown_brush again in the near_future !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !

Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve been using chemical for a couple of years now and i ' ve never had an issue with any of my orders .
Fashion_Accessories	orders are processed and shipped very quickly and always come exactly as expected , prices are also excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	my only_gripe is as someone has mentioned before about the vat and non vat prices being shown , but its not really an issue .
Fashion_Accessories	there have been times i ' ve been excited to find something at a really good price to then realise it wasn ' t the price with vat , but as explained , this isn ' t really chemical ' s fault .
Fashion_Accessories	i have recommended chemical to plenty of people and will_continue to do so .
Fashion_Accessories	generally my store of choice when it comes to clothing and vinyl .
Fashion_Accessories	ok , so i live in bristol but didn ' t need my goods in a hurry , so opted for the standard 0 working day delivery option .
Fashion_Accessories	my order was delivered within 00_hours of being placed , and was all correct and present .
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t recommend these_guys enough .
Fashion_Accessories	bought an engagement_ring last_year on the recommendation of a friend who had bought his engagement and wedding_rings from diamondgeezer .
Fashion_Accessories	luke was fantasticly helpful in working out the best ring to fit my budget and needless to say , the final result worked out for the best as i ' ll soon be shopping for wedding_bands !
Fashion_Accessories	below is my original feedback from 0000 .
Fashion_Accessories	however that relationship didn ' t quite work out , so i have enquired again about a new ring and nothing seems to have changed , customer_service still great !
Fashion_Accessories	fabulous company imo !
Fashion_Accessories	" diamond_geezer found me the perfect diamond and made a beautiful ring around it [ to my own spec ], as there was nothing i liked in the shops .
Fashion_Accessories	i am now hoping for a wedding_ring to match !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks to hannah , and in her absence luke , for their help , efficiency and reassurance during the not so long process .
Fashion_Accessories	i now recommend dg to any one who mentions rings !"
Fashion_Accessories	great service and a wonderful selection of products .
Fashion_Accessories	plus , the delivery was very quick and not outrageously priced !
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t wait to shop again .
Fashion_Accessories	i was a bit_skeptical_about ordering perscription glasses online after being told not to by my opticians .
Fashion_Accessories	but with an up to date eye_test and pd check ( provided by selectspecs ) my ray_ban new wayfarers were perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	the only_downside though is if you are ordering in a hurry , it took about 0 weeks for my order to go through but i wasn ' t in a rush to get them .
Fashion_Accessories	would buy another pair again from this company !
Fashion_Accessories	top quality item , arrived quickly and much cheaper_than the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended !
Fashion_Accessories	divine_trash is a wonderful shop lucy the owner and her staff are always friendly and welcoming and helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	if you need ideas on how to wear a look they always help with great advice .
Fashion_Accessories	the shop is really unique and all the fittings are vintage and handmade so its a real unique shopping_experience .
Fashion_Accessories	great pair of jeans exactly as they looked in the photos on their site .
Fashion_Accessories	arrived next_day as promised and packaging was excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	would recommend to others .
Fashion_Accessories	chemical_records is pretty_much the only place i buy trainers from these days - great selection , super - speedy_delivery ... a joy !
Fashion_Accessories	great pair of sunglasses purchased through groupon , saving me around £_00 !
Fashion_Accessories	quick delivery
Fashion_Accessories	sent my frames for a re - glaze over 0 weeks_ago .
Fashion_Accessories	helpdesk questions are not answered properly , ( no phone number to call )
Fashion_Accessories	expected dates for lenses to arrive / glazing to take place keep changing .
Fashion_Accessories	yet i am only told ' there is a slight_delay '
Fashion_Accessories	have been offered a 00_% refund off my order which has still yet to materialise .
Fashion_Accessories	have now been told my glasses will be out for delivery this week , and i really dont believe them .
Fashion_Accessories	i scoured the net for the glasses i wanted and sunglasses online came up trumps .
Fashion_Accessories	ordering was simple and they arrived in 0 days .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent frames and lenses that saved me a lot of money if i brought them on the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	i strongly_recommend !
Fashion_Accessories	this was my third purchase from diamond_geezer and i would not hesitate to order from them again .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent customer_service , brilliant self serve portal to check order status and frequent email_updates .
Fashion_Accessories	also if you are buying diamonds you get far more in depth detail here than you would on the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	so , i would like to start by saying that so far i feel_like i ' ve been a particularly awkward customer - ordering wrong sizes , wrong colours etc .
Fashion_Accessories	etc .
Fashion_Accessories	and the thing that has impressed me the most is how simple it is to return a product for an exchange - these_guys have it down to a tee , and i feel many other stores need to follow suite .
Fashion_Accessories	in my experience , the guys available on livechat have always been on hand to answer any silly and unnecessary questions i may have ( answers are usually in the product description ), and have been such an excellent help time after time - a real credit to end ' s excellent website .
Fashion_Accessories	the products speak for themselves , the buying team deserve a pat on the back , so enough said there .
Fashion_Accessories	to summarise : quality products , great customer_service , and an easy to use website .
Fashion_Accessories	keep up the good work guys !
Fashion_Accessories	chemicaluk has a fantastic selection of items which i have been unable to find anywhere_else in the uk .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service is brilliant , with quick responses and informative communication .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_defiantly be buying from the website again and will also recommend them to everyone i know
Fashion_Accessories	bought a pair of ray_bans from red_hot sunglasses they arrived very quickly , packed neatly , love them !!
Fashion_Accessories	thanks red_hot !
Fashion_Accessories	i payed £_00 for 0 pairs of underwear .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered 0 pairs of mediums all in the ' shorty ' style .
Fashion_Accessories	when they arrived they were 0 very different_sizes even_though they said they were all mediums !
Fashion_Accessories	paying this much money i would of expected all the mediums to be the same size !
Fashion_Accessories	not very happy to be honest !
Fashion_Accessories	i would buy from them again - very happy .
Fashion_Accessories	great service !!
Fashion_Accessories	really really quick delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	only one thing i would say is they need to sort out their website as its very slow !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	fast delivery , brilliant pricing .
Fashion_Accessories	i received a wonderful service .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my wedding_ring and after guessing with ring sizers i got it slighly wrong .
Fashion_Accessories	and upon sight realised the style was too chunky .
Fashion_Accessories	was i phoned the man could have been more helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	replaced it with a smaller thinner one and refunded the difference .
Fashion_Accessories	i was worried i would have had to pay extra to have the one i ' d already bought brought in .
Fashion_Accessories	0 years on my ring is still in pristine_condition .
Fashion_Accessories	at the time i had been worried that as cheaper_than high_street prices it would be lost in quality .
Fashion_Accessories	hopefully won ' r be back buy buy another wedding_ring !
Fashion_Accessories	but will_definitely use again and recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	i brought my girlfriend a set of makeup brushes and some makeup from crownbrush and they arrived within 0 days and got me lots of brownie_points , i would recommend them to anyone , the website was excellent and delivery was second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	my girlfriend has recommended them to all her friends and they are all now loving crownbrush .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you crownbrush you saved me :-)
Fashion_Accessories	this website offers a huge_selection of high_quality clothes .
Fashion_Accessories	i prefer shopping online as you can find unique clothes for very reasonable prices .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service is very good , and it is easy to tell that the company values each and every one of their customers .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m definitely going to be ordering from here again , thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	i heard about this from a friend so just browsed to their website with no_intention of buying .
Fashion_Accessories	then i saw a pair of ray_ban ' s i ' d been hunting for ages for i bought them straight_away .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived very quickly and in pristine_condition .
Fashion_Accessories	i now feel_confident on my stage shows .
Fashion_Accessories	fantastic quality , exceptional service and flawless knowledge .
Fashion_Accessories	for an online company had all the help i needed in buying something so important as an engagement_ring and wedding_rings .
Fashion_Accessories	and was extremely happy with the independant valutaion that came in .
Fashion_Accessories	its just a shame i will never see any of that profit .
Fashion_Accessories	selectspecs always get my order right and give good customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a woman ' s jacket from webtogs as a christmas_present .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately , a men ' s jacket was sent out by mistake ( though i did recieve it very quickly ).
Fashion_Accessories	after a quick phone call to webtogs on the saturday_morning before_christmas a women ' s jacket was dispatched ( even before they had received the returned jacket ) on the monday and i recieved it on the tuesday .
Fashion_Accessories	the cost of returning the men ' s jacket was reimbursed very quickly and webtogs were a pleasure to deal with .
Fashion_Accessories	i have to say you sometimes don ' t know how good a company is until something_goes_wrong ( and this was easy mistake to make ), but in this case webtogs performed excellently and are well worth using .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased a pair of shoes and bought the wrong_size .
Fashion_Accessories	i emailed them about an_hour after my purchase .
Fashion_Accessories	they didn ' t respond to me until 0 days_later saying it was too_late , 0 hours_later they sent me a tracking_number .
Fashion_Accessories	also it was $_00 to ship the shoes to the us so i can ' t return them .
Fashion_Accessories	fail .
Fashion_Accessories	where has this brand been all my life ?!
Fashion_Accessories	after hearing some brilliant reviews about crown_brushes and how reasonably_priced they were i was eager to try them .
Fashion_Accessories	to be honest i was a little_sceptical at first because of the price but wow , i ' m so glad i purchased some !
Fashion_Accessories	the quality of the brushes is amazing , definitely on par with mac and sigma .
Fashion_Accessories	they are so soft and i can tell that they will soon become my favourite brushes to use .
Fashion_Accessories	i especially recommend the c000 flat blender , c000 flat foundation and ss000 syntho dlx blending crease .
Fashion_Accessories	for anyone who is after mac / sigma dupes , i would highly urge you to try these , i promise you won ' t regret it !
Fashion_Accessories	also , i was so so thrilled at how quickly my brushes were delivered .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered them on wednesday_night and received them on friday_morning , couldn ' t ask for a better service !
Fashion_Accessories	had plans to attend a 0000 ' s weekend with my partner , but he had no costume .
Fashion_Accessories	so , on thursday_morning , i went in to different costume shops looking for one and found nothing suitable .
Fashion_Accessories	then i stumbled onto megafancydress . co . uk and found the perfect last - minute costume at a decent price .
Fashion_Accessories	the " next_day " delivery ( promising to get it to me by 0pm on friday ) was a good price , too , and so i bought it .
Fashion_Accessories	the costume arrived on time and looks very good .
Fashion_Accessories	high_quality , and very easy to take care of .
Fashion_Accessories	my only issue is that the costume isn ' t accurate of the time ( colours , emblems , etc ), but at the price i paid , it isn ' t even a big problem .
Fashion_Accessories	the costume still looked great and survived a weekend of travelling , photographs and re - enactments .
Fashion_Accessories	it is going away for the next time it is needed .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely use the website again , as the selection is amazing !
Fashion_Accessories	in fact , i ' m going to look now and see what else i can get ...
Fashion_Accessories	i had to send back the jacket i bought as it was to big for me and was the smallest size the jacket came in .
Fashion_Accessories	returning was easy and refund arrived very quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	will use shop again .
Fashion_Accessories	x
Fashion_Accessories	i had a problem with a product but thankfulyl this has all now been resolved appropriately .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks to jane and harriet
Fashion_Accessories	regards ,
Fashion_Accessories	holly
Fashion_Accessories	i used monnier frères to buy a present for a friend .
Fashion_Accessories	the customer support was really helpful and i love their product selection .
Fashion_Accessories	would use them again to purchase high_quality designer bags .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my wedding_ring from diamond_heaven .
Fashion_Accessories	i was a little_bit_worried_about it , because i ' d never bought jewellery online before , but diamond_heaven were the only people who seemed to have the style i wanted , at the price i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	the ring arrived within 0 weeks , looks excellent and is exactly_what i wanted .
Fashion_Accessories	thank - you .
Fashion_Accessories	seriously good service , excellent price .
Fashion_Accessories	nothing more to add : )
Fashion_Accessories	i have used my crownbrush concealer plate almost everyday since i purchased .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent for contouring and coverage - very impressed !
Fashion_Accessories	all the items here are well quality , highly_recommend customers to shop for their clothes !
Fashion_Accessories	:) .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ve never - ever - bought glasses online ... to me it was something you just didn ' t do , particularly with a prescription such as mine it seemed to me that i just * had * to go to the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	so i did .
Fashion_Accessories	when i found that the total cost of frames , thinned lenses and anit - glare totalled up to £_000 , i decided that maybe i should try online .
Fashion_Accessories	that ' s where fashioneyewear . co . uk came in to play .
Fashion_Accessories	they had the frames i wanted , at a reasonable_price - and beyond that i could get the lenses thinner than i could before !
Fashion_Accessories	in the end i paid arounf 00_% what i would have paid at a high_street store .
Fashion_Accessories	so , after_reading reviews and bracing myself , i placed my order last thursday .
Fashion_Accessories	and now , here i sit , exactly one week_later , with my new glasses perched proudly on my nose .
Fashion_Accessories	the fit is perfect and the vision with the lenses is crisp , clear and bright .
Fashion_Accessories	from the word go customer_services were excellent in advising me how the process worked - and even when there was a problem with my tracking link they looked in to it for me to make_sure that my glasses would be with me on time .
Fashion_Accessories	on the whole what initially seemed to be quite a daunting experience turned_out to be a great one .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely use this company again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered some hugo boss sunglasses from here on friday .
Fashion_Accessories	firstly , they were a bit cheaper_than in the store .
Fashion_Accessories	then i ordered the wrong pair by mistake .
Fashion_Accessories	these people took no time to correct my mistake and were very efficient at handling the whole_thing .
Fashion_Accessories	they shipped the same day and the sunglasses were with me on monday .
Fashion_Accessories	you cannot get better_than that .
Fashion_Accessories	i highly_recommend this site to all those who read this .
Fashion_Accessories	please dont hesitate .
Fashion_Accessories	you will regret it if you dont order as soon as possible ..
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you guys for the awesome pair of sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	perfect for the summer now ..
Fashion_Accessories	i had been messed about by various opticians and got fed_up with being charged over £_000 for glasses that i didn ' t help me see at all .
Fashion_Accessories	after finally getting a prescription from the nhs i decided i ' d look online and came_across selectspecs .
Fashion_Accessories	as i ' d been messed about by opticians in the past i thought i ' ll try the cheap glasses rather_than pay £_000 again in case the prescription is wrong again .
Fashion_Accessories	the ordering_process was very easy and within 00_minutes i ' d placed my order .
Fashion_Accessories	within 0 weeks i received my glasses and was pleasantly_surprised .
Fashion_Accessories	at such a low price i didn ' t expect much but the glasses are of a very high_standard ; much_better_than the £_000 pairs i ' d had in the past .
Fashion_Accessories	i can now see and it didn ' t cost me an extortionate price to do so .
Fashion_Accessories	i totally recommend selectspecs to anyone_wanting bargain high_quality glasses .
Fashion_Accessories	both my bother and i have brought many items from web togs , it ' s a wicked company , staff are great and the speed in which items are sent is impressive , i will be coming_back for more , keep it up guys and girls ......
Fashion_Accessories	james engtech and paul
Fashion_Accessories	i have ordered sunglasses , however , haven ' t received any confirmation e_- mail .
Fashion_Accessories	after 0 days the company asked me to send them my passport scan , utility_bill and copy of the bank transaction .
Fashion_Accessories	i send them the documents as they requested .
Fashion_Accessories	after 0 days they notified me the sunglasses were out of stock and asked me to wait another 00 days to get a fresh supply from the manufacturer .
Fashion_Accessories	since i don ' t believe them to actually get the sunglasses for me from the manufacturer i cancelled the order and i am waiting for the refund ...
Fashion_Accessories	found styles here that i couldn ' t find anywhere_else , for a price i couldn ' t beat anywhere_else .
Fashion_Accessories	prompt and safe delivery , couldn ' t have asked for any more !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my bag before 0pm on thursday & it arrived at lunchtime on friday .
Fashion_Accessories	good value for money .
Fashion_Accessories	i wasn ' t in when my parcel arrived and although the delivery note states you must be in to sign for the package , i left a signed note on the door & it was left safely for me so i didn ' t have to got to the sorting_office .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks !
Fashion_Accessories	despite ringing yesstyle , and emailing them , i still have no_idea why my parcel hasn ' t arrived yet .
Fashion_Accessories	they said their logistics team are looking into it , but still no word on it .
Fashion_Accessories	apparently it ' s been at heathrow customs since 00nd dec . more communication , and a prompt delivery would be helpful ...
Fashion_Accessories	i have ordered from crown_brush uk twice and both_times excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	great brushes , fast postage ( ordered on monday and delivered by wednesday ).
Fashion_Accessories	000_% recommended =)
Fashion_Accessories	i used the sunglasses_shop via a recent groupon offer .
Fashion_Accessories	i was slightly wary as i had never used them before .
Fashion_Accessories	after looking at the online store , i decided on a pair of sunglasses for me and promptly ordered this .
Fashion_Accessories	the ordering processing to me receiving the sunglasses was extremely efficient and quick .
Fashion_Accessories	unfortunately , when i received the sunglasses , i decided they werent for me , so i contacted the sunglasses_shop to arrange an exchange .
Fashion_Accessories	the service i received for this was excellent and my order was processed quickly , in time for me to receive my exchanged sunglasses for my holiday .
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend this shop to everyone , the service i received was immense ( special thanks to kim from customer_services who promptly replied to my emails and kept me up to date with the progress of exchanged order ).
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you :)
Fashion_Accessories	perfect sunglasses at a 00_%_discount price .
Fashion_Accessories	if the delivery could be arrived on next_day , shopping_experience will be perfect !
Fashion_Accessories	delivery speed is second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	always have more_than enough promo ' s in stock as well .
Fashion_Accessories	thumbs_up !

Fashion_Accessories	will most certainly be purchasing from here again !
Fashion_Accessories	well_designed website , and nothing us bad really .
Fashion_Accessories	when the item didn ' t arrive , country_attire sent a replacement which i received within 0 days .
Fashion_Accessories	excellent customer_service .
Fashion_Accessories	will certainly shop there again .
Fashion_Accessories	bought a pair of sunglasses that i ' d been looking at in store much cheaper , easy to find , good fast delivery and perfect item .
Fashion_Accessories	very impressed and would use again .
Fashion_Accessories	the site was so easy to use , delivery was super_quick .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a coat for my step daughter and the quality , fit etc is spot on , but i absolutely loved the packaging as so discreet !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	well recommended !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	and to top it off i was able to raise funds for my chosen charity through the easy fundraising site !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	outfit generally good apart_from problem with hat
Fashion_Accessories	i received confirmation emails and delivery was prompt .
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t fault them !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a barbour jacket , and it arrived the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	the courier ( dpd ) provided an allocated delivery slot , so i did not have to sit in all day which is excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	when the jacket arrived , unfortunately it was too smal , so i returned it requesting an exchange for the next size up .
Fashion_Accessories	i was emailed the same day as it arrived , to say a replacement would be sent out on next_day delivery , size and colour also confirmed !
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely fantastic !
Fashion_Accessories	i would recommend this seller .
Fashion_Accessories	they are friendly , helpful , reliable , and trustworthy .
Fashion_Accessories	not to mention efficient .
Fashion_Accessories	outstanding !
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	if only all internet sellers were like this .
Fashion_Accessories	fabulous !
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with the price , service and delivery , cheapest i could find the item anywhere in stores or on the internet .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely amazing company with great management and customer_service , i order quite a bit of product from them because one , im addicted to eye wear and two , because their shipping , service , and store is amazing .
Fashion_Accessories	i will never go anywhere_else to buy eye wear because of my experience with them !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	got my annual trip to ibiza in 0 weeks , and as always i ' m panicking about my fashion choices .
Fashion_Accessories	one thing i never get right is a decent pair of shades , and always buy some cheap local_supermarket knockoffs , then walk round ibiza looking like a blind man who has lost his stick .
Fashion_Accessories	well not this year , thanks to the sunglasses_shop i have a mint pair of ray - bans , and they where delivered next_day !
Fashion_Accessories	as i said sweet !
Fashion_Accessories	my husband bought my engagement_ring from the company and i wanted my wedding_ring to fit around it so we went back to them .
Fashion_Accessories	luke was absolutely fantastic and put up with me constantly being a pain and changing my mind about the size without complaint .
Fashion_Accessories	he also made sure that the ring was ready for delivery on a day i had off so i was in to receive it .
Fashion_Accessories	finished_product was high_quality and excellent value for money .
Fashion_Accessories	service from start to finish was amazing and i would definitely use them again .
Fashion_Accessories	i have made several orders through diamond_geezer ( engagement_ring , wedding_bands , diamond earrings and an_eternity_ring ).
Fashion_Accessories	i have been very pleased with all the items , the service and the price .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_continue to use diamond_geezer and recommend them to my friends .
Fashion_Accessories	so after my last review , i have finally received an e_- mail , but a displeasing one .
Fashion_Accessories	so after coming home from school today , i looked at my e_- mail to notice that one of my items was cancelled after 00 days of waiting for it to be in stock or not .
Fashion_Accessories	it is insulting to know that i have waited that long of time where if i had found out 0 days earlier , i still would have had enough time to order some clothing for a cheaper price and it was one of my prefered items which i felt i had to have .
Fashion_Accessories	in my opinion : shipped items is the quickest , but sucks since your size might not be on the ready to ship list .
Fashion_Accessories	0 - 00 days can suddenly turn into 00 days and 00 days might not even be in stock .
Fashion_Accessories	if you can risk that long , then the best to you .
Fashion_Accessories	=)
Fashion_Accessories	great value for money , my glasses were fitted with my new prescription and delivered back in the expected time_frame .
Fashion_Accessories	will_definitely be sending my second pair in the new year .
Fashion_Accessories	i was keen to order after_reading all the good reviews , however i was thoroughly disappointed with the service .
Fashion_Accessories	i placed my order on a saturday and didn ' t hear back for a couple of days that my order was out of stock .
Fashion_Accessories	i had to email the company to hear that the frames needed to be ordered in .
Fashion_Accessories	i think it was false_advertising to say they where in stock on the website .
Fashion_Accessories	since placing my order it ' s been three_weeks and i ' ve been chasing the order to find out when it would be back in stock , now the company has just replied_saying that they will process a refund as they ' re unsure .
Fashion_Accessories	this means they ' ve just been holding my money for 0 weeks .
Fashion_Accessories	everytime i email the company they take a good couple of working_days to reply when all i want to know is the status of my order .
Fashion_Accessories	i would avoid ordering from this company again .
Fashion_Accessories	they need to improve their customer_service and email response time .
Fashion_Accessories	so delighted with my order and service from web togs .
Fashion_Accessories	rang up for advice and this was given .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered 0pm and had my coat by 0 . 00am the next morning .
Fashion_Accessories	i do not usually bother with feedback but the level of customer_service i received was so high that i wanted to recommend it to others .
Fashion_Accessories	as it is all to easy to pick a bad web company .
Fashion_Accessories	rest_assured , if you order from web togs you will have no_worries !
Fashion_Accessories	great experience , cannot_fault the speed and efficacy of the company
Fashion_Accessories	i used diamondgeezer to purchase an engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	i thought the level of detail available on the website was fantastic having previously known very little about diamonds , i felt i understood the quality i was buying and was confident i was making the right decision .
Fashion_Accessories	the timescales for delivery were important to me and were spot on with no delay .
Fashion_Accessories	i will be using this site again for wedding_rings in the not to distant_future .
Fashion_Accessories	the spring collection are sooo tempting !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	the order process has now seem to be changed and whats more its faster_than previous so loving it !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	and more_importantly !!
Fashion_Accessories	the free shipping to europe had just made my day ... love you yes style .. thank_you soo much !!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i ' d thoroughly_recommend selectspecs if you ' re looking for a quick , easy and cheap pair of specs .
Fashion_Accessories	i found the whole ordering_process really simple and there is an easy way to track the progress of your order .
Fashion_Accessories	i had a slight problem which was easy to resolve and was sorted out really quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	had to return trainers i bought for my bf birthday as they were to small , the return and exchange was done within 0 days !
Fashion_Accessories	impressive !
Fashion_Accessories	they operate the way all online companies should ...
Fashion_Accessories	the service was very good , with next_day delivery provided .
Fashion_Accessories	the sunglasses themselves were great and came at a bargain price after entering a special voucher_code i found .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely buy from this site again .
Fashion_Accessories	sometimes i find myself ranting like a maniac salesman when i recommend webtogs to friends , but they deserve all the praise that ' s heaped on them .
Fashion_Accessories	and i am not a salesman .
Fashion_Accessories	customer_service is top_notch .
Fashion_Accessories	either on the phone or through e_- mails .
Fashion_Accessories	very friendly and professional .
Fashion_Accessories	shipping is almost instant .
Fashion_Accessories	i never had to wait more_than 0 days for the free delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	last summer i bought a pair of keen sandals which i loved so much i had to buy 0 more pairs for the family .
Fashion_Accessories	one of them were a half size smaller_than needed so i have sent it back for a replacement , but i made a few mistakes in the process .
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs customer_service again was excellent and they handled all problems with ease in a very professional_manner .
Fashion_Accessories	i used them recently to buy 0 pairs of women ' s boots , even_though i am male , winter is long gone and i am totally broke , but they had them at a price i could not pass on .
Fashion_Accessories	they will be great gifts .
Fashion_Accessories	i will be shopping at webtogs . co . uk again very soon .
Fashion_Accessories	i have already set my sights on a pair of walking shoes ( they will e_- mail me when my size is available ).
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs is without_doubt the best online_retailer i have come_across and i do quite a bit of online shopping .
Fashion_Accessories	wholeheartedly recommended !
Fashion_Accessories	nothing annoys_me more_than spending £££ s and having to wait 0 - 0 days for my purchase , great speedy standard delivery and happy with the product .
Fashion_Accessories	colouring of boots slightly different to website picture but love them regardless .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	brought my engagement_ring from diamond_heaven .
Fashion_Accessories	needed it for the coming bank_holiday and it ' s arrived in plenty of time .
Fashion_Accessories	i went for a round diamond in a platinum mount .
Fashion_Accessories	it sparkles so much , can ' t wait to see the look my girlfriends face !
Fashion_Accessories	great experience and couldn ' t thank them enough !
Fashion_Accessories	myself and my husband had our_wedding_rings designed by diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	i explained what i wanted and was quickly sent back mock up pictures of both rings .
Fashion_Accessories	the designer had understood perfectly and made small changes quickly and easily .
Fashion_Accessories	the whole_process - from design , picking our diamonds through to manufacture was made so easily and we were kept_informed at every_stage of the process .
Fashion_Accessories	when the rings arrived they were beautiful and the quality was second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	i had a full eternity_ring and when i needed it made slightly larger a few_days beofre the wedding , despite the fact that full eternity rings cannot normally be sized , the team at diamond_geezer organised a courier to collect the rings and then one of their master craftsmen managed to work against all odds to make it larger .
Fashion_Accessories	they then couriered the finished ring back to me with two days in hand for the wedding .
Fashion_Accessories	i cannot thank everyone enough .
Fashion_Accessories	i brought two chanel sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	customer_service is very nice .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery is very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	products are high_quality .
Fashion_Accessories	i love it .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you
Fashion_Accessories	how come there are no pictures of the dresses every time i go on the website all l get is a bold question mark instead of the pictures how on earth am l meant to select and buy the lovely dresses :-(
Fashion_Accessories	polite and knowledgeable_staff make ordering from webtogs a doddle .
Fashion_Accessories	their prices are very keen and their products first rate .
Fashion_Accessories	now i ' ve found them , i don ' t think i ' d go elsewhere for camping and outdoor_gear .
Fashion_Accessories	this is a great website to use .
Fashion_Accessories	very easy to navigate if you ’ re not a computer whizz kid with an enormous range of styles & designers .
Fashion_Accessories	you can even shop by your favourite celebrity so you can get the look of rihanna , beyonce or even johnny depp .
Fashion_Accessories	if that wasn ’ t enough , the glasses arrived within 00 of me buying them online in perfect_condition and i received 00_%_discount for referring a friend !
Fashion_Accessories	i couldn ’ t recommend redhot sunglasses highly_enough , they really are a cut above .
Fashion_Accessories	couldn ' t fault the service from start to finish .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was swift and uncomplicated .
Fashion_Accessories	reliable and thouroughly professional web_site and company for me .
Fashion_Accessories	really satisfied with my prescription_sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	they were really cheap but they look like high_street ones .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you and i will recommend this company to anyone who need new glasses :)
Fashion_Accessories	the sunglasses i chose are more_than i expected !
Fashion_Accessories	the quality is fantastic !
Fashion_Accessories	i ' m more_than satisfied .
Fashion_Accessories	i think those are the most beautiful sunglasses i have ever had !
Fashion_Accessories	based on my earlier experiences of online shopping , the quality of many products may be much lower in reality than what you expect .
Fashion_Accessories	but not in the sunglasses_shop !
Fashion_Accessories	their glasses are even more beautiful in reality than they were in the pictures !
Fashion_Accessories	that was a great surprise !
Fashion_Accessories	they were sent in a big hard box so they were safe while posting .
Fashion_Accessories	it also took only a short time to get here , which impressed me pretty_much - especially that the shipping is for free !
Fashion_Accessories	i don ' t have any reservations .
Fashion_Accessories	i highly_recommend sunglasses - shop . co . uk and i ' m sure i ' m going to buy some more products from them !
Fashion_Accessories	0 / 0 from me .
Fashion_Accessories	i received these today , and tried them out .
Fashion_Accessories	they are wonderful and soft .
Fashion_Accessories	what i like about them as_opposed to my previous set of brushes is that they are all different thicknesses so that they suit their purpose perfectly .
Fashion_Accessories	they move very well against the skin and work around the contours of your face so that makeup application is smooth and like a dream .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely_recommend this company to anyone_else looking for some quality , affordable brushes .
Fashion_Accessories	i will be ordering from this company again .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you , crownbrushes .
Fashion_Accessories	great speedy service , arrived extremely promptly and the item was perfect for what i wanted it for .
Fashion_Accessories	i spoke with luke at diamondgeezer and he was so helpful , we ordered our_wedding_rings and a special wedding day gift ( for the wife , some amazing diamond earrings ).
Fashion_Accessories	luke also threw in the resizing of the wifes engagement_ring ( which we had purchased from somewhere_else ).
Fashion_Accessories	all my further diamond purchases will be from diamondgeezer , well wehn i recover from the wedding cost :)
Fashion_Accessories	james
Fashion_Accessories	best sunglasses !
Fashion_Accessories	great service !
Fashion_Accessories	quick delivery !
Fashion_Accessories	i had my old oakley ' s stolen a few_years_ago and i ' ve been dying to get another pair but just didn ' t wanna risk spending so much if it happens again , so when i saw the deal going on and i managed to get £_00 off i was buzzing so i went for it and the pair i ' ve got now are much_nicer_than the other one ' s i had ..
Fashion_Accessories	i prefer mens ones as they look better on me .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely_brilliant :))))
Fashion_Accessories	i always use crown_brushes when buying new brushes .
Fashion_Accessories	i have bought on line and at the imats .
Fashion_Accessories	i am a makeup artist so it is important that i use the best products on my clients .
Fashion_Accessories	i have never had a problem with any of my crown_brushes .
Fashion_Accessories	they last for ever , they are very reasonably_priced and they do the job they are designed to do .
Fashion_Accessories	i am a very happy customer and will_continue to use crown_brushes .
Fashion_Accessories	thanks
Fashion_Accessories	alana
Fashion_Accessories	i was looking for a specific product that i could not find anywhere_else and yesstyle . co . uk had it !
Fashion_Accessories	the price was great as well and since i hadn ' t bought anything there before , i came here to check the reviews .
Fashion_Accessories	and trust me , they happen to be absolutely right !
Fashion_Accessories	i was so glad i got all the information about the shipping right away , the products arrived way earlier and they were perfect !
Fashion_Accessories	congratulations to the founder ( who even sends you a cute thank_you card with your parcel ) and his team for the great service the company is delivering .
Fashion_Accessories	the roman gladiator outfit was good , worth the money considering the price you pay to hire .
Fashion_Accessories	company was good also , i bought via their ebay shop .
Fashion_Accessories	dispatched my item quick , got a pdf invoice and tracking_number .
Fashion_Accessories	started doing my research into engagement_rings and soon realized that the high_street was a rip_off .
Fashion_Accessories	diamond_geezer website helped my understanding of what i was actually paying for then allowed me unbelievable choice in style cut and prices .
Fashion_Accessories	service was great .
Fashion_Accessories	can ' t be more positive really .
Fashion_Accessories	i saw the ray_ban 0000 000 / 00 tec sunglasses in some of the shops in york but they were from £_000 .
Fashion_Accessories	a price i was unwilling to pay .
Fashion_Accessories	i looked on web sites and redhotsunglasses were very well_priced and what made it more worth my while was if i ordered before 0pm they were delieverd the following_day and no extra_cost .
Fashion_Accessories	plus i got a cheeky £ 0 off if i liked them on facebook .
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend
Fashion_Accessories	compré el producto y a los 0 días lo tenía en mi casa
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered a gibson_les_paul studio in ebony on a wednesday_afternoon , maybe an_hour after ordering i received a phone call from giggear explaining the guitar was out of stock and asking if would i like to cancel my order , wait ( possibly 0 months due to manufacture ) or change my order .
Fashion_Accessories	i asked what options i had for changing my order , still wanting a gibson_les_paul , around the same price and as close to the studio specs as possible .
Fashion_Accessories	the help and advice i received was brilliant , being both informative ( down to listing specs and describing picups , sound etc ..) and helpful in so much as i could place another order that same day .
Fashion_Accessories	i felt i could ask questions without feeling i was being a nuisance , causing any bother or generally wasting their time , which is something i ' ve never_experienced when dealing_with guitar sales people before and i ' ve dealt_with an awful lot over the years i ' ve been playing , often never returning to the store ever again having been made to feel unimportant and that my custom doesn ' t really matter .
Fashion_Accessories	the shipping was extremely fast ( next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	shipped thurs morning arrived fri lunch ).
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend giggear to anyone and will_definitely return to them again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	outstanding general and customer_service !
Fashion_Accessories	a massive thank_you !
Fashion_Accessories	used sunglasses_shop for the first time to buy some wayfarers .
Fashion_Accessories	found the ones i wanted , but wanted to change the lenses to some darker ones .
Fashion_Accessories	they sorted it no_problems .
Fashion_Accessories	keeping me informed regarding delivery time .
Fashion_Accessories	definitely_recommend them for anyone_wanting quality sunglasses with excellent customer_service thrown in !
Fashion_Accessories	i buy clothes from jules_b online on a regular_basis and they always have prompt delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	i have contacted customer_services on several_occasions regarding sizing of items , and they were very helpful and i didnt have to wait for ages to speak to somebody either .
Fashion_Accessories	i cant_fault them atall !
Fashion_Accessories	really pleased with the service i got from diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	from discussing my requirements to the ongoing communication during the making of the ring , they were brilliant throughout .
Fashion_Accessories	and she said yes .
Fashion_Accessories	what more could i ask for ?
Fashion_Accessories	made an order for ski goggles which were the cheapest i could find online , arrived quickly and would not hesitate to use again .
Fashion_Accessories	very happy with the service provided and the speed at which it was delivered .
Fashion_Accessories	would happily use again !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered two fleeces .
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived in fair time , but were really really poor quality and way overpriced .
Fashion_Accessories	not fitting the '' exceptionally warm '' statement from them at all .
Fashion_Accessories	so i had to send them back for a refund .
Fashion_Accessories	i would of sent them back for an exchange but they had low stock_levels of anything_else suitable .
Fashion_Accessories	when i went to log in to their website to sort the return out , it turned_out they had deleted my account in a tech problem , so i then had to phone up and sort it that way .
Fashion_Accessories	so much for the '' hassle_free returns ''.
Fashion_Accessories	i was told they would sort out my account , but still after weeks it does not exist .
Fashion_Accessories	also , which is the most annoying thing , is they did not give me a full_refund , they told me they would deduct £ 0 . 00 from my refund , to cover the return posting cost , which is ok ,.
Fashion_Accessories	but they deducted more_than double that .
Fashion_Accessories	even_though the products were sent back for being poor quality and not fit for purpose or the silly high price and not fitting the description properly .
Fashion_Accessories	webtogs have been nothing but difficult , sly and untruthful about this whole affair .
Fashion_Accessories	all they have ever tried to do make excuses , prove me wrong and justify their mistakes with this order .
Fashion_Accessories	i can supply order number etc , as i suspect webtogs will attempt to get the honest and factual review removed .
Fashion_Accessories	this is my 0th purchase from pediwear stretching back 00 years .
Fashion_Accessories	all have been for loake shoes and i could not be_happier with the product and the service .
Fashion_Accessories	early purchases were all when i lived in the uk and speed was great .
Fashion_Accessories	i now live in new_zealand where the availability of quality shoes is very poor .
Fashion_Accessories	my current order , some loake buckinghams were dispatched promptly and i was able to track their progress .
Fashion_Accessories	when they arrived in nz they were held up with stephen at pediwear reassuring me that this can sometimes be the case .
Fashion_Accessories	they turned_up 0 days after i had emailed concerned they may have gone astray .
Fashion_Accessories	these_guys do online and customer_service better_than any other retailer i gave interacted with .
Fashion_Accessories	0_stars .
Fashion_Accessories	what a company !
Fashion_Accessories	just received the engagement_ring i ordered , had daily emails on the progress being made and the two calls i did make we ' re handled excellently .
Fashion_Accessories	i cannot recommend this company enough , it was even delivered a few hours earlier_than scheduled i will be using dg in the future for all my jewellery needs .
Fashion_Accessories	although i found the service fairly stress_free and the products were delivered in the promised time_frame , i don ' t think i will bother with yesstyle products again .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought 0 dresses and 0 blouses .
Fashion_Accessories	the three dresses are very good - the quality and finish is very acceptable for the price and i ' m_glad i bought them .
Fashion_Accessories	the two blouses were not so good .
Fashion_Accessories	one was made incorrectly so it would fit someone with a 00 inch rib cage , and after a couple of wears , the crouched collar began to split off from the shirt .
Fashion_Accessories	the other shirt was very sheer , the elastic in the shirt loosened off to the point that it is way to big and most of the dye came out after 0 wash .
Fashion_Accessories	as well as this , none of the products i received were produced by the brands that it said they would be , they were produced by cheeper brand_names - this doesn ' t bother me particularly , but for someone who did want a specific brand , maybe it would .
Fashion_Accessories	overall , neither a good , nor a particularly bad_experience , but i wouldn ' t bother buying from them again .
Fashion_Accessories	cheapest than all the other recordstores , quick despatch & nice catalogue !
Fashion_Accessories	keep it up !
Fashion_Accessories	stephanie and emelie were alwasy quick to reply to emails and more_than happy to answer whatever questions arose .
Fashion_Accessories	it was easy to organise a time to view the products and stephanie was very helpful providing good advice on all matters related to buying the perfect ring .
Fashion_Accessories	i can say that my fiance is more_than happy with her absolutely beautiful ring and can ' t stop looking at it !
Fashion_Accessories	the stones and band were beautifully_presented in a box and came with all the valuation and certification documents expected with such a great product .
Fashion_Accessories	i would highly_recommend purely_diamonds and their product and would buy from them again .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you for making the process so simple and the end product so exceptional .
Fashion_Accessories	i was initially really pleased with the prices and selection on fashioneyewear .
Fashion_Accessories	so much so that i purchased both my wife and i , new spectacles both on the same night .
Fashion_Accessories	after less_than 0 days the pattern on my wife ' s very expensive burberry frames seemed to be peeling away .
Fashion_Accessories	this was due in part to the poor workmanship and manufacture of the burberry frame manufacturer themselves .... who would of thought that frames of this expense were wrapped in a cheap vinyl ??!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i spoke to them on the phone when first noticing this and their response on the phone was ' sure , no problem ... send them back and we ' ll refund the cost ', to which my response was an amenable customer ..' look , there is no need for a refund , just credit my account or call me and we ' ll chose another frame '.
Fashion_Accessories	upon_receipt of my frame i received a phone call from harry , who first of all started saying that he cannot refund the cost of the lenses in these glasses ?
Fashion_Accessories	a little_confusing , so are they saying that i buy the frames and lenses separate ?
Fashion_Accessories	it says on the site that lenses are included , so in my opinion if you refund the frame you refund the ' included ' lenses too ?
Fashion_Accessories	( maybe some_confusion , here ... i did actually pay extra to have them thinned down , on their recommendation i may add !).
Fashion_Accessories	during this call i gave them a model number for an_alternative frame , without this vinyl which is susceptible to peel .
Fashion_Accessories	i was promised a call by harry later that day ... it never happened .
Fashion_Accessories	i tried to call the following_day harry was off sick and spoke to someone_else who did not seem interested and said ' you ' re best to call back when harry is back off sick '.
Fashion_Accessories	then finally today ( the day following ) i called in the morning and asked to speak to harry who was in a meeting at the time , but to be fair called me back later .
Fashion_Accessories	upon picking_up this call he advised me he is willing to give me £_00 credit !
Fashion_Accessories	.... for a pair of spec ' s that cost me £_000 . 00 !!!!
Fashion_Accessories	i said i wasn ' t happy with that , and his response was that his offer was ' very generous ', considering i had the glasses reshaped ?
Fashion_Accessories	anyone who wears specs will know this is necessary .
Fashion_Accessories	so far i have left the ball in his court , and i feel that as a consumer my statutory rights have not been honoured by this business , according to ' the sale of goods_act 0000 '
Fashion_Accessories	this item is not of satisfactory quality , nor has the product lasted a reasonable length of time ( less_than 0 days ).
Fashion_Accessories	i look_forward to their response with baited breath .
Fashion_Accessories	i have bought spectacles on line over seven times from different websites , and this is the first time i have been let_down and will not trade with them again unless they reach a mutually acceptable conclusion with myself .
Fashion_Accessories	i purchased a diamond ring for my fiancee from diamond_heaven , money was astonishingly less_than high_street prices !
Fashion_Accessories	i was orginally worried_about buying online but , after_speaking to the customer_service staff i felt much_better .
Fashion_Accessories	standard delivery was a bit longer_than i had until the big day , but diamond_heaven managed to get it to me in 0 days !
Fashion_Accessories	amazing !
Fashion_Accessories	i asked the question and she said yes :) i made a mistake on the ring size however diamond_heaven managed to alter this for me so i wasn ' t left with a problem .
Fashion_Accessories	all_round service was great and so was the product .
Fashion_Accessories	will look_forward to dealing_with them again .
Fashion_Accessories	wishing you all the best in the future
Fashion_Accessories	order received very quickly .
Fashion_Accessories	fast turnaround of refund when returning an item .
Fashion_Accessories	great communication from sinead in the returns team too .
Fashion_Accessories	keep up the good work !
Fashion_Accessories	customer_service is excellent , knowledge of products second to none .
Fashion_Accessories	i will always use diamondgeezer and also recommend the site to friends and family .
Fashion_Accessories	its a place to come to get that something different , that something special .
Fashion_Accessories	i love waxx_underwear i used to sell them in a shop i worked at called isis in saltaire .
Fashion_Accessories	i bought them for my boyfriend and got him loads .
Fashion_Accessories	when the shop closed_down and i found you online i was buzzed cos now i could look at all the patterns .
Fashion_Accessories	thay wash well the designs are awesome and well worth the money .
Fashion_Accessories	i would even like to get a stall and just sell waxx_underwear .
Fashion_Accessories	love them xxx
Fashion_Accessories	i don ' t usually_write_reviews but felt i needed to this time !
Fashion_Accessories	i was a bit_weary at first but so glad i took a chance !
Fashion_Accessories	the customer_service i received from nicola was fantastic , replying to my queries about the sunglasses straight_away and was so helpful when i needed to change the delivery address .
Fashion_Accessories	ordered saturday_afternoon and would have received them monday but due to change of address got them tuesday .
Fashion_Accessories	the sunglasses are perfect and i even received a 00_%_off my next order .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely use rhs again !
Fashion_Accessories	00 / 00 !
Fashion_Accessories	sadly i was plagued with issues from the start , however it was then turned around by their customer_service to rectify the issues .
Fashion_Accessories	now a happy customer
Fashion_Accessories	do not use this company
Fashion_Accessories	do not use this company
Fashion_Accessories	do not use this company
Fashion_Accessories	ordered the same t - shirt from a reputable company and repertoire fashion just in a different_colour .
Fashion_Accessories	the item from repertoire fashion was oversized [ was meant to be a large more like an x - large ] as i had bought the t - shirt 0 weeks previous they just sent me a email_stating i couldn ' t return or ! exchange !
Fashion_Accessories	[ which i wanted for a correct fitting one ]
Fashion_Accessories	obviously deals with the knock offs and error items .
Fashion_Accessories	do not purchase from this company unless you are certain what you will recieve .
Fashion_Accessories	now im 00 quid down and look like a idiot in my oversized tshirt [ when i decide to open the packaging ]
Fashion_Accessories	**** reading a few reviews on here seems to be correct what i ' m saying .
Fashion_Accessories	they deal with the sizing errors and stock the reputable_companies wont take *********
Fashion_Accessories	******************************
Fashion_Accessories	if you had contacted us when you order first arrived we would have been more_than happier to either exchange it or refund it for you .
Fashion_Accessories	our returns_policy_states that you 0days to return items for a refund or exchange , unfortunately as you had the garment for 0 weeks we will not be able to exchange or refund it for you .
Fashion_Accessories	*******************************
Fashion_Accessories	how unprofessional
Fashion_Accessories	do not use this company
Fashion_Accessories	do not use this company
Fashion_Accessories	i have had the mis fortune of dealing_with select_specs recently and frankly i am less_than impressed .
Fashion_Accessories	i initially placed an order for a pair of sunglasses , i was told fully 0 week_later that my glasses were out of stock ( why were they on the website and why did it take a week to tell me ) so i ordered a different pair .
Fashion_Accessories	over 0 weeks went by and i still had received or heard nothingm after several attempted emails i finally found out that my replacement choice was also out of stock and that i can expect a delay of at_least a further 00 days taking my total order time to nearly 0 weeks !!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i cancelled my order and promptly received a refund .
Fashion_Accessories	recently i wanted some new driving glasses so i thought i would give select_specs one last shot so i ordered a bog_standard pair of plastic glasses on 00nd may .
Fashion_Accessories	it is now 0th_june and my order still states ' awaiting update '.
Fashion_Accessories	despite 0 emails i have no_idea where or when my glasses will turn_up if at all .
Fashion_Accessories	whilst select_specs are cheap it appears to be at the cost of both customer_service and delivery times .
Fashion_Accessories	these_guys only offer support via_email so no phone numbers and in my experience anything up to several days can go by before you get a response .
Fashion_Accessories	if you are happy to wait over a month for your glasses and have no need to contact customer_services then give them a go otherwise go elsewhere , you may pay a little more but at_least you will get your order on time .
Fashion_Accessories	after i received the glasses , i find several defects !!!!
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	first , the frame legs are not at the same height , if i put the frame on the table , the right - side leg will incline upward !
Fashion_Accessories	second , there are 0 small scratches on my top prescription ( index 0 . 00 ; elite coating !)
Fashion_Accessories	right - side lens !
Fashion_Accessories	recent update ,
Fashion_Accessories	00 days latter , the glasses are sending back with lenses replaced and frame fixed .
Fashion_Accessories	overall , i am quite happy with it !
Fashion_Accessories	i bought a shirt for my boyfriend , the delivery was nice and quick , and the size was perfect thanks to the size guide .
Fashion_Accessories	he has worn it a lot since getting it so thankyou !
Fashion_Accessories	royal_mail really let the delivery down , but webtogs did everything in their power to get the order to me .
Fashion_Accessories	customer_service is excellent - couldn ' t ask for more !
Fashion_Accessories	if only the same could be said for royal_mail !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	overseas shipping is very fast .
Fashion_Accessories	good stuff .
Fashion_Accessories	as a whole is excellent .
Fashion_Accessories	for some advice from the chap running the web_site ( i have a round face ) and must_say , i am delighted with his recommendation !
Fashion_Accessories	also pointed me in the right_direction for a gift .
Fashion_Accessories	delivery was exceptional , an_email outlining a 00 minute delivery window - great stuff .
Fashion_Accessories	exceptional quality but we ' d expect nothing less !
Fashion_Accessories	all in all , great service , great product , great delivery - cant recommend highly_enough
Fashion_Accessories	fair price .
Fashion_Accessories	great sale .
Fashion_Accessories	fast delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	good communication with customer .
Fashion_Accessories	i was quite dubious_about ordering from a site i hadn ' t ordered from before but they were fab .
Fashion_Accessories	i loved the glasses and the fact they had a promotion for 00_%_off raybans was absolutely ideal .
Fashion_Accessories	i will_definitely be using this website again in the future .
Fashion_Accessories	really nice collection of sleeves and cases , easy checkout and fast free delivery .
Fashion_Accessories	pat says now case is super quality and really funky .
Fashion_Accessories	would recommend .
Fashion_Accessories	i spent a lot of time researching where to buy my wedding_ring online and i couldn ' t find better prices than at purely_diamonds .
Fashion_Accessories	it was so refreshing to get such helpful and reliable customer_service from stephanie and emelie , all my emails were answered_quickly , profesionally and nothing was too much_trouble .
Fashion_Accessories	i couldn ' t decide which width of wedding_ring to order and i was a little_apprehensive_about ordering something before seeing it ; so they happily sent me 0 silver sample rings to try at home with my engagement_ring and it also meant i could show it to friends and family .
Fashion_Accessories	i ended_up picking the thicker width that i probably wouldn ' t have choosen if i couldn ' t have tried it on first .
Fashion_Accessories	my ring arrived in a lovely presentation_box in less_than 00 working_days by special delivery and i am so delighted with it .
Fashion_Accessories	i have been very impressed with the service from start to finish , i will_definitely be shopping here again and would recommend purely_diamonds to anyone without_hesitation .
Fashion_Accessories	stacey , oxfordshire
Fashion_Accessories	they had the raybans i wanted for my winter sun holiday ( why is it so hard to find sunglasses in the winter even_though it ' s really sunny outside !).
Fashion_Accessories	i was a bit_worried at first because i ' d never_heard of the site .
Fashion_Accessories	but i need not have been nervous .
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses arrived quickly , were very well_packaged and i ' m thrilled with them .
Fashion_Accessories	i will be recommending .

Fashion_Accessories	the guy on the phone ( mike or matt ?)
Fashion_Accessories	was brilliant .
Fashion_Accessories	i ' ll definitely be back for more .
Fashion_Accessories	hopefully there will be a january sale !
Fashion_Accessories	recently ordered a necklace and two_pairs of earrings and i am very pleased with my order .
Fashion_Accessories	items were cheap but the quality suprised me - it is really good !
Fashion_Accessories	the postage was very quick and the team answered all the questions i ' ve had .
Fashion_Accessories	truly recommend to order some pieces , you won ' t be disappointed !
Fashion_Accessories	monnie . pl
Fashion_Accessories	waxx_underwear have been my favourite for years i buy them for everyone there designs never fade and they always look sexy fresh and new !
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered an engagement_ring for my now fiancé . i had very little knowledge of diamond standards and pricing . the agent i spoke too helped_me navigate the website and got a design and ring that was perfect . there were regular_emails and calls to ensure that i was updated on the progress . the ring arrived on schedule and was very descreet perfect for the surprise . the whole packaging was fantastic and the aftercare service with valuation was amazing . i dealt_with one individual agent throughout who made the experience very personal and special . would use again and again and would recommend highly !
Fashion_Accessories	thanks alot .

Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	i had a vodafone vip voucher that entitled me to 00_%_off all sunglasses , but the pair i wanted for my girlfriend weren ' t in stock .
Fashion_Accessories	i emailed nicola at the customer_services team , who let me " pre_- order " the pair we wanted so we could get the discount before the voucher ran out .
Fashion_Accessories	they shipped the sunglasses as soon as they came in stock , which arrived on saturday_morning after being shipped at 0pm friday , all free of charge !
Fashion_Accessories	the glasses themselves are excellent and i ' d recommend this company to anybody looking for competitively_priced designer sunglasses .
Fashion_Accessories	just an amazing shop from the service to the website layout to the stock listing .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely no flaws what so ever .
Fashion_Accessories	always had excellent customer_service and excellent delivery time and speed .
Fashion_Accessories	bought the items as a present for my husband - quality is excellent just as much as the service received !
Fashion_Accessories	free delivery and the items arrived the day after i have ordered them !
Fashion_Accessories	needed a pair of prescription_sunglasses quickly , ordered on wednesday and had them on my desk on tuesday .
Fashion_Accessories	don ' t be put off by their not so fancy website , the customer_service and product is great and as_described !
Fashion_Accessories	i very rarely feel the need to comment on the websites i have bought from over the years , webtogs inspired some feedback !
Fashion_Accessories	a great site , easy to use , excellent deals and genuine bargains to be had .
Fashion_Accessories	even_though i did not end up keeping my item ( the size was wrong ) the service i received throughout was exceptional , very speed delivery , accurate order and ease of return .
Fashion_Accessories	many_thanks
Fashion_Accessories	leanne
Fashion_Accessories	i received a very personal service from diamond_geezer .
Fashion_Accessories	they gave me advice on what kind of wedding_ring would match my engagement_ring .
Fashion_Accessories	they were also very helpful when i needed my ring re - sized - the service was so quick and i had my ring back within a few_days .
Fashion_Accessories	on another occasion they repaired my damaged engagement_ring free of charge , and again the service was so quick .
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended !

Fashion_Accessories	i was browsing on the internet when this website came up " sunglasses_shop ", the prices were reasonable and with a 00_%_discount for your first order i couldn ' t resist but to buy a pair for my holiday !
Fashion_Accessories	they arrived today and i was certainly satisfied with my purchase , the company and the delivery time .
Fashion_Accessories	next - day delivery was ideal for my situation as i was leaving england for a holiday to dubai just 0 days after i ordered them .
Fashion_Accessories	every other website was offering more_expensive sunglasses and the delivery time was ridiculous and wasn ' t free .
Fashion_Accessories	my ray_bans were delivered to me .

Fashion_Accessories	they offer a very good and reliable sevice at a reasonable_price .
Fashion_Accessories	i got a pair of prescription designer_glasses which were less_than half the price i would have paid on the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	when i noticed a deep scratch in my supposedly scratch - resistant lenses after no obvious impact , i simply contacted selectspecs and they asked me to send them back for inspection , and quickly got back to me to say they ' d re - glaze them for free .
Fashion_Accessories	in my view , superb service and exceptional value for money .
Fashion_Accessories	i required some oakley frogskins for a naked sledging expedition i had planned , nothing worse than getting a sun glare from the ice .
Fashion_Accessories	well the chaps at redhot helped_me right out .
Fashion_Accessories	the purchase was simple and easy from the comfort of my home .
Fashion_Accessories	the delivery was fantastically fast !
Fashion_Accessories	i took my sledge out with the afore mentioned glasses and they held up well .
Fashion_Accessories	jolly good show team redhot !
Fashion_Accessories	keep up the good work !
Fashion_Accessories	both my boyfriend and i ordered sunglasses from the website at christmas which were cheaper_than anywhere_else and arrived within a day or two of ordering .
Fashion_Accessories	i recently wore my glasses for the first time and noticed a manufacturing_fault on them .
Fashion_Accessories	i contacted customer_services and sent the glasses back the next_day .
Fashion_Accessories	a new pair of glasses were sent out to me by ups the same day they received the old pair .
Fashion_Accessories	i was also refunded the postage i paid to send the glasses back .
Fashion_Accessories	i also had quick responses to all of my emails .
Fashion_Accessories	i was very impressed with the level of customer care / service .
Fashion_Accessories	i would definitely_recommend the site .
Fashion_Accessories	brilliant british company
Fashion_Accessories	wow
Fashion_Accessories	my purple rumours waistcoats and scrunchies arrived and i ' m incredibly happy with them !
Fashion_Accessories	the craftmanship is amazing , the quality of the material is second to none , the service was perfect .
Fashion_Accessories	all e_- mails were replied to promptly and pete was so helpful .
Fashion_Accessories	thank_you so much !
Fashion_Accessories	been a customer for a few_years , always swift delivery even with the cheapest option !!
Fashion_Accessories	highly_recommended !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	the website is ea breeze to use , ordering was a pleasure , and customer_service were quick to reply to the questions i had .
Fashion_Accessories	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use them again .
Fashion_Accessories	i phoned up a day before after seeing a john partridge jacket online and country_attire said that i could make appointment and they would put the jacket aside for me .
Fashion_Accessories	i phoned the shop to say i was going to be late by 00_mins and they said that they had sold it on line that night !
Fashion_Accessories	make_sure before you go the shop you phone first !
Fashion_Accessories	purchased a set of essential brushes recently from crown_brushes .
Fashion_Accessories	they are reasonably_priced and have extreme good quality .

Fashion_Accessories	brilliant customer_service , i put the wrong area code on my form and they re - sent out my glasses asap .
Fashion_Accessories	all done very quickly by email and i received my replacement pair within a few_days .
Fashion_Accessories	000_% ordering from then again .
Fashion_Accessories	very affordable and stylish .
Fashion_Accessories	okay , so here goes :
Fashion_Accessories	despite reading mixed_reviews on various sites i ' ve been unfortunate enough to have the worst experience i have ever had dealing_with any company .
Fashion_Accessories	i want everyone to know that i have never left a negative_review for any past purchase and i hope that selectspecs sort themselves out so this never happens to anyone_else .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my prada glasses some 0 weeks ( plus ) ago and paid instantly as required .
Fashion_Accessories	i assumed the order was all going to plan until i logged_into the site to check on progress some two_weeks_later .
Fashion_Accessories	upon doing so i had a message advising that these frames were on back order and wouldn ' t be received for around 0 - 0weeks , a time i couldn ' t live with .
Fashion_Accessories	after countless " tickets " and subsequent messages back and forth they finally told me that they were available in a slightly different_colour , to which i agreed and asked them to tweak my order .
Fashion_Accessories	they then advised that my glasses would be shipped within ten_days ( they told me this on nov 0th )..... its now nov 00nd and i ' ve not received any glasses and i ' m awaiting a response back as to where they are .
Fashion_Accessories	i have to say i don ' t hold out any confidence of them arriving , nevermind if they ' ve managed to get my script ' correct etc .
Fashion_Accessories	selectspecs genuinely need to invest in a small contact management team / call_centre and there is nothing more frustrating than trying to vent your frustration and sort an order than the lengthy and drawn out process of emails .
Fashion_Accessories	absolutely_terrible service and company , they haven ' t got a clue_what they are doing and in my opinion should be investigated by trading_standards !
Fashion_Accessories	!
Fashion_Accessories	after having numerous bad service from hof and barbour themselves to find a particular barbour jacket , country_attire was a breath of fresh_air .
Fashion_Accessories	i ordered my product the day before and had it the next_day - even with a free gift !
Fashion_Accessories	i had a question about coat liners and spoke to a representative on the instant chat functionality within_seconds .
Fashion_Accessories	will recommend to all my friends and definitely visit again !

Fashion_Accessories	the service we received from diamond_geezer was amazing .
Fashion_Accessories	luke was particularly helpful and so friendly .
Fashion_Accessories	the whole_process was so easy and the ring far outweighs my expectations !
Fashion_Accessories	it is beautiful and so much_nicer_than any we saw on the high_street .
Fashion_Accessories	the price paid could not be rivalled ( especially after receiving the valuation !).
Fashion_Accessories	i got the ring of my dreams that i really thought we could afford !
Fashion_Accessories	i have recommended diamond_geezer to all of my friends .
Fashion_Accessories	i knew what i bought , but the price were cheaper and though the parcel was shipped from the uk to sweden it came here in a few_days .

Fashion_Accessories	i had known about spectacles direct for a while but my eyetest wasn ' t due for another couple of months .
Fashion_Accessories	i waited til then to get my prescription from my optician and took it over to spectacles direct the next again day .
Fashion_Accessories	i was picky and chose frames which needed to be ordered in specially for me , i also needed my glass bottle bottom - like lenses to be thinner so suit the frame a little more .
Fashion_Accessories	none of this was a hassle , even with my requests !
Fashion_Accessories	my glasses arrived within 0 days and they are just perfect .
Electrical_goods	thanks to trustpilot that i found digitalrev , and thanks to digital_rev that sent me a quality product in time .
Electrical_goods	i bought a dj set amp and speakers and wires included which is amazing for such a low price and amazing sound for such a great bargain and very quick delivery and they also kept me up to date where my delivery was by giving me a tracking_number .
Electrical_goods	i ordered a roberts revival radio on the 00st november_0000 as an anniversary gift and was told via_email and phone that it would be arriving on the 00rd .
Electrical_goods	on the 00th , i emailed them and asked where it was and they replied_saying that it would be delivered the next_day - unfortunately i would be out on this day , and emailed them saying so ; also saying that i would be available on the 0th and 0th of december .
Electrical_goods	customer_services replied_saying that they have let their couriers know i am available on the 0th and 0th - which is not what i said !
Electrical_goods	- i was then told it would be delivered on the 0th .
Electrical_goods	i stayed in all day , no - one rang the doorbell or called my mobile , and then when i went out at 0pm i noticed they had left a card saying ' sorry you were out '.
Electrical_goods	i complained ( to hispek ) and asked for a refund on 0th_december , and received no reply .
Electrical_goods	i called the courier company who told me that since they had tried to deliver it three times ( due to their own incompetence , and inability to ring my doorbell or mobile phone ) that i had to go and pick it up .
Electrical_goods	this cost me £ 0 on train fares and an_hour of my time , plus the two days i stayed in waiting for it .
Electrical_goods	do not buy from this company if there are other_companies with around the same prices .
Electrical_goods	not worth the hassle .
Electrical_goods	the item arrived the after delivery .
Electrical_goods	this is my second purchase from hifiheadphones . co . uk and they havent disappointed .
Electrical_goods	i was very impressed when buying through hifiheadphones as i had a few problems with my credit_card - due to me living outside the uk .
Electrical_goods	i was contacted directly by customer_services and the problems was sorted quickly and painlessly .
Electrical_goods	i also made a slight error when ordering some extra ear buds for my earphones .
Electrical_goods	i was advised of this and my order was corrected .
Electrical_goods	overall i am extremely happy with my first purchase at hifiheadphones and will be a repeat customer .
Electrical_goods	i have watched countless digitalrev videos on youtube .
Electrical_goods	reviews , tips and tricks , and laughed out loud at kai .
Electrical_goods	i was looking for a great deal on a camera .
Electrical_goods	digitalrev were selling the d0000 for much less_than i could find anywhere_else .
Electrical_goods	the camera and tripod arrived very quickly and were very well_packaged .
Electrical_goods	i now have ebay bubble rap sorted for the next 0 years :)
Electrical_goods	i would definitely_recommend buying from digitalrev !
Electrical_goods	amazing friendly service , great product , fast delivery , lolly pop , what more could you want ?
Electrical_goods	it ' s so refreshing to see a business that genuinely seems to want to make customers happy and not just make money .
Electrical_goods	would use / recommend again - no questions_asked .

Electrical_goods	had my doubts about ordering prior , so did my research before purchasing - one of those ' prices are too good to be true ' situations .
Electrical_goods	anyway , i finally bit the bullet and purchased a 000d + 00mm_lens on a sunday_evening .
Electrical_goods	everything arrived , at the price advertised , the following wednesday lunch time .

Electrical_goods	i needed a simple , but , high_quality , audio interface for my portable setup .
Electrical_goods	after taking advice from [_private data_removed_], i opted for the apogee duet 0 ( cheaper_than the motu unit i was originally looking at !)
Electrical_goods	and all i can say is thanks !
Electrical_goods	it works really well in conjunction with my neumann and the quality rival my rme " main studio " interface .
Electrical_goods	i would not hesiatate to buy again .
Electrical_goods	easy to use site , fast delivery , painless transactions
Electrical_goods	if anything the camera i ordered arrived too soon !
Electrical_goods	too soon for me to even decide on a lens and order it online , so for a while i had a camera and had no lens ... which , of course , is a good thing .
Electrical_goods	as i am a student studying photography , the canon_00d i ordered was the perfect price .
Electrical_goods	thank_you for being so wonderful , trustworthy , and fast in the process of myself buying a camera from you .
Electrical_goods	ef - m 00 - 00mm at a very good price .
Electrical_goods	i was a little unsure_about customs_charges ( some other reviews said they ' d been stung ) but i was one of the lucky ones .
Electrical_goods	all good and all above board .
Electrical_goods	i recently_purchased a cd / mp0 / usb / digital radio alarm clock from hifi - tower . co . uk / i can ' t fault this company in the slightest .
Electrical_goods	i made the purchase through their ebay shop .
Electrical_goods	the description of the item was absolutely perfect , the images of the item were clear and easy to see and the price was very reasonable .
Electrical_goods	imagine my surprise when , only 0 days after the purchase i received a huge box in the mail .
Electrical_goods	the box contained lots of air bags around the box of the item which was very well_packed .
Electrical_goods	i couldn ' t be_happier with my item or with hifi - tower . co . uk .
Electrical_goods	i promise i ' ll buy from them again in the future .
Electrical_goods	i use production_room a lot and the staff are top_class and have an endless amount of info between then if ur un shore in a peace of kit there more that happy to take time to discuss ur options they ask u wat ur wonting to do and wat ur trying to achieve then they will prompt u in the right_direction they never
Electrical_goods	try to sell u something you don ' t need and they always work with in ur budget and find u the best that u can afford
Electrical_goods	i would alway send my friends there if they ask me were to get the best kit from .

Electrical_goods	found extera direct whilst searching for a supplier for legacy system phones , not only could they supply these at a fantastic cost but also supply us with our other telephony needs at a much reduced cost .
Electrical_goods	with an excellent next_day service , could not fault them , would highly_recommend them .
Electrical_goods	they are more_than capable of handling orders for a multi national company .
Electrical_goods	the website has a wide_range of products , with excellent reviews and infomation written about each product .
Electrical_goods	the ordering , payment and delivery was simple and quick .
Electrical_goods	i bought a panasonic 00 -_000mm lens for £_000 less_than the typical selling price .
Electrical_goods	the lens was shipped from_hong_kong in only 0 days !
Electrical_goods	i didn ' t have to pay any additional import or vat ( uk ) charges on top of the advertised price .
Electrical_goods	all in all in very happy !
Electrical_goods	the shopping_experience at digitalrev was the best i have experienced so far , i received my package really fast considering it was coming from_hong_kong , and was shocked when i got it from the dhl guy , it was wrapped with so much bubble_wrap that it took me a while to open it .
Electrical_goods	the packaging was so good that if it fell from the airplane i don ' t think anything would happen to my precious lenses !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	before purchase there was a long description about each product and a lot of awesome drtv videos as well to see what you want to buy in action .
Electrical_goods	and not to forget the price that was way cheaper_than other_retailers or online stores .
Electrical_goods	all in all , i ' d give you 000 starts if i could , but here the limit is 0 !
Electrical_goods	good job guys !
Electrical_goods	keep up the good work and thank_you !
Electrical_goods	i received my lens through the post after 0 days of ordering it , very good service and would definitely use digital_rev again in the future !
Electrical_goods	god quality , price and delivery
Electrical_goods	order myself a canon_00d with 00mm canon lens , 00gb sd_card plus gift pack .
Electrical_goods	canon has been wonderful so far , as have the lens and the flash card .
Electrical_goods	the gift pack is a little underwhelming , but the microfibre cloth is a must as always .
Electrical_goods	once i placed the order there was a days delay when i had to call to verify it was the correct address , but after that it was no hassle .
Electrical_goods	would buy here again !
Electrical_goods	read a lot of reviews before buying with dr , great reviews , colleague fo mine used them a few_months before and he was super pleased with their service - as am i .
Electrical_goods	everything packaged up really well and safe , everything delivered in 0 - 0 days and most_importantly all promises were honoured .
Electrical_goods	definitely using them again
Electrical_goods	0nd purchase in less_than a year .
Electrical_goods	item was purchased on sun and arrived on thursday .
Electrical_goods	would have been wednesday if dhl done their job properly .
Electrical_goods	great company
Electrical_goods	i was slightly sceptical having never ordered from digitalrev before but i shouldn ' t of been .
Electrical_goods	i bought a camera on a sunday_afternoon and it arrived on the thursday - all the way from_hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	i also contacted them to ask a question and got a very quick rely .
Electrical_goods	i will be shopping with digitalrev again !
Electrical_goods	they have excellent prices and amazing customer_service .
Electrical_goods	what else could you want ?
Electrical_goods	looked around the internet and digitalrev had the best price going .
Electrical_goods	ordered just after christmas and received package only 0 days_later .
Electrical_goods	amazing .
Electrical_goods	this is my first dslr and i ' ve enjoyed it , digitalrevs youtube vids are definitely handy in picking the best camera and tips on getting started once you have it .
Electrical_goods	i bought a tamron lens on tuesday and with me lunch time today ( friday ) from_hong_kong to somerset in 0 days .
Electrical_goods	amazing service , extremely fast delivery , quicker_than the quoted delivery date .
Electrical_goods	i would recommend using this company to anyone .
Electrical_goods	the products are genuine and a lot cheaper_than buying from the uk and also arrive within the same timescale .
Electrical_goods	in december i purchased some aiaiai headphones from hifi_headphones - excellent product with great sound , unfortunately in january the sound started to crackle and the sound quality diminish .
Electrical_goods	i contacted hifi_headphones service dept and was dealt_with by steve - i returned the faulty set and they released a replacement set of headphones within the day of receipt - no questions_asked
Electrical_goods	unfortunately the same_thing happened in feb - again i contacted steve and they were sympathetic and advised that this occasionally happens with this brand , albeit , not very often .
Electrical_goods	they did however offer me the chance to change my headphones choice and i opted for some sennheiser ' s - again no questions_asked
Electrical_goods	the ease at which hifi_headphones dealt_with the faulty product and their flexibility was impressive - so many companies assume that the customer has misused a product when it breaks , it is refreshing to find a company so willing to help !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	i ' m not someone who normally writes on review sites but i thought that in this case i ' d make an exception - i 000_% recommend these_guys and hope that their impeccably high standards of customer_service continue and become a bench mark for other_companies trading online .
Electrical_goods	great site , i ' ve known about then for a while now and when i was looking to replace my covers on hy sennheisers they were the peeps to go to .
Electrical_goods	ordered on sunday_afternoon and took recorded_delivery and they were at my door tuesday_morning !
Electrical_goods	outstanding .
Electrical_goods	ordered an seagate external hd .
Electrical_goods	it ' s been around 00 days .
Electrical_goods	never received the product , trying to communicate with pixmania and the partner but no one is actually willing to help .
Electrical_goods	they just provided me with a tracking_number yesterday - which says that it was delivered and signed by someone called gareth .
Electrical_goods	now my question is who the hell is gareth ?
Electrical_goods	had an amazing experience before with pixmania , but after this last purchase , never again ever .
Electrical_goods	do not recommend anymore .
Electrical_goods	hi å purhased å hdmi projector which was sent out the next_day ånd recieved the day after which å thought was great , the item was great value for money which i couldnt find one the same spec any cheaper , overall am exstreamly happy ånd will use hifi again thanks
Electrical_goods	disappointed in the clear disparity between pixmania . co . uk and pixmania . ie ( uk site is unilaterally cheaper , offers package deals , and free postage ).
Electrical_goods	camera i wanted was still cheaper_than amazon . co . uk , though , so i bought it anyway and it did indeed arrive in time but the packaging was flattened quite badly .
Electrical_goods	the camera was fine inside but , as the camera was a gift , it was an annoyance to hand my friend something in that condition .
Electrical_goods	brilliant online store , picked_up a pair of soundmagic e00 ' s , came the next_day .
Electrical_goods	hell , i even got a free lollypop in the parcel .
Electrical_goods	regarding the site - everything is clearly_labelled on the navigation panel so the user knows exactly where to look for the exact pair of headphones they want .
Electrical_goods	i found it really easy to find the perfect headphones for me .
Electrical_goods	( by the way i recommend the soundmagic e00 ' s over the beats by dre in ears any day )
Electrical_goods	i will tell everybody i know to use this site when their current headphones need replacing , the variety is amazing and beats any store ive_seen .
Electrical_goods	0 / 0
Electrical_goods	what i got for the price i got it at didn ' t compare to anything_else i looked at online or in shops .
Electrical_goods	and the time for it to be delivered was faster_than i expected .
Electrical_goods	will be using the site a lot more in the future
Electrical_goods	i bought a large sony tv from this online shop .
Electrical_goods	i was looking for something in / near london which can deliver at home for free .
Electrical_goods	i found it by google_shopping : it had the best price ( about £_000 less_than other better renowned shops and £_000 less_than sony online itself ) + no charge for delivery .
Electrical_goods	i was called 0 days after for arranging the delivey and they came as agreed 0 days after ... no fuzz , no problem , amazing tv !
Electrical_goods	0 star !
Electrical_goods	omgggg ordered my canon_000d on friday and got it on mondayyy !!!
Electrical_goods	so happy with their services .
Electrical_goods	would recommend ditigalrev anytime anyday !
Electrical_goods	;)
Electrical_goods	there was a problem with my order addresses , they gave me an_email to let me know .
Electrical_goods	i got a reply almost_instantly and the guy ( jon ) was friendly , polite and efficient in sorting my problem and my order was dispatched that day .
Electrical_goods	will_definitely buy from them again .
Electrical_goods	yet again the service from hifiheadphones was spot on .
Electrical_goods	quick responses to email queries and sound_advice regarding their products .
Electrical_goods	will_continue to highly_recommended this company to friends and family .
Electrical_goods	first purchase fome dr . best price by miles and flawless service .
Electrical_goods	i will be back .
Electrical_goods	buy with confidence .
Electrical_goods	a ++++++++++
Electrical_goods	i bought a complet set for discos and partys it is great stuff will recermended to uthers
Electrical_goods	great company - i had slight problem with an order and they resolved the matter instantly and with great courtesy .
Electrical_goods	would recommend them 000_%
Electrical_goods	looked everywhere for prices on the sigma 00 - 000 f0 . 0 apo ex dg os lens and dr was by_far the cheapest even compared to second_hand lenses in the uk .
Electrical_goods	ordered from dr on sunday_evening with a little niggle because of ordering from hk ; i need not have worried because the online tracking_information from dhl was faultless and the sms updates were brilliant .
Electrical_goods	estimated_delivery was friday - sat and les arrived 0 days early on the wednesday to my delight !
Electrical_goods	brilliant service , no customs fees etc and lens is perfect , wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend dr to others !
Electrical_goods	i chose the soundmagic pl00 headphones after_reading hifiheadphones top 00 list of recommended headphones .
Electrical_goods	price was competitive but not the cheapest .
Electrical_goods	however , i wanted to ensure i did not get fakes , which appears to be a potential problem with headphones manufactured in china ( google " fake headphones " for more info ).
Electrical_goods	i got good vibes about this company from other reviews so paid the higher price to ensure i got a good pair .
Electrical_goods	the phones are great , once you get the correct bud attached for your ear size .
Electrical_goods	purchasing experience was great to
Electrical_goods	had an issue setting it up and their team sorted me out over the phone in under 00_minutes !
Electrical_goods	i ' ve just spent £ 0000 on digitalrev . com ( here ' s to what it would have been in the uk ) and with spending such amount i done my research .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve watched a lot of the digitalrevtv videos on youtube . com and found them to be the overseas company i bought with because i felt i knew them through kai etc .
Electrical_goods	there is one catch .
Electrical_goods	digitalrev promise customers in the uk that import_tax / duty will be paid by the company ( which is true ,) however , digitalrev actually de - value the price of your order .
Electrical_goods	as i said my order came to £ 0000 and once i had received my order i notice that the invoice slip on the package said £_000 . 00 .
Electrical_goods	this means that the uk customs have every right to open your package ( as with any package coming through our borders ) but because the value of the package has been de - valued uk customs will add import_duty / tax to your order - which must be paid by you .
Electrical_goods	in the small_print digitalrev do say they will be billed - but they also say when the package is with the courier ( in most_cases dhl ) the sole responsibilty lies on the new owner .. which is me .
Electrical_goods	and let ' s try getting a foreign company to fork_out customs you ' ve just had to pay .
Electrical_goods	dhl can turn_up at your door demaning x amount and if you refuse - the package simply will be returned to digitalrev .. get your money back ?
Electrical_goods	no you refused to take it in !
Electrical_goods	i was also asked to confirm details before the shipped ( which i found unusual but i did anyway ) and everything was fine .
Electrical_goods	i ordered sunday_evening gmt and it arrived friday_morning .
Electrical_goods	dhl_express live track is great for updating where your package is .
Electrical_goods	great customer_service on the phone ( when you eventually get through ... must call before 00am gmt )
Electrical_goods	the bottom_line : if your afraid to buy from overseas - keep it that way or take a huge chance .
Electrical_goods	there is no uk warranty with any products bought although you do get 0 year digitalrev warranty .
Electrical_goods	i will buy from them again - they are not the cheapest hk website , but i do trust them enough to purchase items again .
Electrical_goods	was abit worried with dealing_with a company in hk that i have never dealt_with before , but i had nothing to worry_about .
Electrical_goods	i made my purchase of a lens on a sunday_night from the uk and had trouble with payment .
Electrical_goods	it was my bank lloyds that put a block on the payment due to fraud .
Electrical_goods	a after a quick call my bank lifted the block a and payment went through .
Electrical_goods	monday_morning i got a email a and a text_message informing_me that my order had been dispatched plus a tracking_number via dhl .
Electrical_goods	every time the package changed hands i got a text .
Electrical_goods	could track it from hk to germany to leeds ( uk ) then to courier to my house .
Electrical_goods	the lens was delivered by midday on wednesday .
Electrical_goods	unbelievable service from other side of the world in 0 days wow !
Electrical_goods	highly_recommend digitalrev will be dealing_with again
Electrical_goods	ordered a lens on monday_morning via the website and wednesday_morning it was in my hands !
Electrical_goods	this is simply oustanding speed , value was good , brand_new lens and i simply cant speak highly_enough of digrev !!
Electrical_goods	they use dhl who i always find are good , they also wrap your item in a ton of bubble paper for protection !
Electrical_goods	!

Electrical_goods	i found the cdj player i was after on ebay and saw that bop_dj had the player i was after .
Electrical_goods	i shopped_around for the same product and found bop_dj to be realistically priced and all the required infomation on the page was there so i knew_exactly_what i was buying
Electrical_goods	after buying the cdj i noticed it put next_day delivery , being it was during xmas i thought it would not be with me for a while , more like after new year , but i recieved it this morning and i am more_than happy with it !

Electrical_goods	my third purchase from digitalrev , and my first lens purchase .
Electrical_goods	super_fast delivery as always considering it was travelling from china to uk , with good tracking and clear website updates .
Electrical_goods	items arrived in perfect_condition .
Electrical_goods	sony website allowed me to register the lenses despite me expecting them to fail due to being grey imports ( maybe they aren ' t grey imports after all !
Electrical_goods	), but doesn ' t matter as digitalrev provide a 0 year_warranty regardless ( although i ' ve not had a chance to test this aspect thankfully ).
Electrical_goods	i was worried as the item was stop on entrance into uk , but once sent them my invoice there was no_problems and it arrived within 0 days of ordering from hk .
Electrical_goods	crazy !
Electrical_goods	great service , defo_recommend ....
Electrical_goods	this was my first purchase from digitalrev . com and i have to say that i will_definitely be shopping here again in the future .
Electrical_goods	at first , i was not completely convinced to buy from digitalrev , as they were based in hong_kong ( china ), however being a fan on their youtube_channel for a while now , and also seeing that others were faithfully investing thousands of £££ on this website , i purchased my first dslr .
Electrical_goods	the whole shopping_experience was extremely fluid , and the delivery ( free ) was even better !
Electrical_goods	i purchased my dslr on friday 00th_january (~ 00pm - order was not processed until saturday_morning ).
Electrical_goods	it was in my hands by monday 00th .
Electrical_goods	i mean , how ' s that for free shipping ?!
Electrical_goods	i would very highly_recommend this website to anyone_wishing to save some money on photographic / cinematic products , as i saved around £_000 -£_000 myself .
Electrical_goods	miles smith - 00 - england
Electrical_goods	i ' ve been using the irish site for the past two years , ordering on over 00 different occasions and i have never once had a problem with delivery times , item damage or anything_else that would have annoyed me .
Electrical_goods	either i ' m just very lucky or obviously the only people normally reviewing pixmania on here are the only ones with a problem .
Electrical_goods	if that ' s the case , then considering that they probably have a huge customer base due to their prices , they are doing exeptionally well , keeping more then the majority happy .
Electrical_goods	:) i feel_safe when shopping there .
Electrical_goods	only problem i find is that stupid zen sh_* t . but easily removed .
Electrical_goods	supper fast , good quality .
Electrical_goods	only positive things to say !!!
Electrical_goods	and lolly was nice_touch .
Electrical_goods	only point i would like to make and this is more for hifiheadphones knowledge is that maybe you could add a way letting your customers know when an item is back in stock .
Electrical_goods	i was after a particular item and it would of been great if i could receive and email when item was back in stock .
Electrical_goods	but that is not a criticism .
Electrical_goods	great service .
Electrical_goods	easy to place and order , good communication between vendor and myself and fast delivery .
Electrical_goods	excellent
Electrical_goods	having used many professional digital audio outlets for many years , i can recommend andy and rob at production_room without reservation .
Electrical_goods	customer_service at the absolute forefront , they have been massively helpful and have always gone above and beyond to ensure that i am able to make the best decisions on the best equipment at the best prices .
Electrical_goods	i initially wrote digitalrev a bad review as i was experiencing some issues with their warranty policy , however after being in contact with their customer_service manager kathy all my issues have been resolved .
Electrical_goods	i cannot express how good the customer_service is at digitalrev - some of the best i ' ve experienced while shopping online .
Electrical_goods	i would suggest that before buying with digitalrev you make an effort to understand the warranty terms and what sort of product you are buying - if you are aware of this they you will have no_problems , they are great to deal with .
Electrical_goods	if you are reading this , thank_you kathy for fixing my problem .
Electrical_goods	with it being so close to xmas and it being such a high profile purchase i was pleased with the speed of delivery from_hong_kong and the quality of the packaging .

Electrical_goods	hifi_tower have been a great friend to me for the past 0 years .
Electrical_goods	i purchased a full dj system through them .
Electrical_goods	the prices for speakers & amplifiers might put you off as they are great value but the power from the systems is fantastic .
Electrical_goods	hi fi tower have made my career as a road dj simpler and profitable .
Electrical_goods	great company and well recommended .
Electrical_goods	this was my first time ordering from digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	they offered the camera i was looking for ( canon_000d ) significantly_cheaper_than other online stores and so i was wondering what the ' catch ' was .
Electrical_goods	happily , there wasn ' t one !
Electrical_goods	camera arrived in 0 days ( very fast considering it came from_hong_kong to the uk ) and i was kept up to date on the delivery .
Electrical_goods	very happy customer .
Electrical_goods	the delivery was amazingly quick and i could also track it all the way across_europe also the customer_service was helpful and nice and the prices were amazing compared to some competition !
Electrical_goods	second time i have used digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	i recommend you to all my photography friends and so far we have all been impressed .
Electrical_goods	the 00 - 000 l f0 is a great lens , so glad i am now an owner of one !
Electrical_goods	thanks again :-)
Electrical_goods	so i came_across digitalrev when i was trying to find some good user reviews on youtube for dslrs - being a complete newbie and all ... this was a couple of years_ago and i remember watching a video that said the rebels were good beginners cameras , of which i made a mental note .
Electrical_goods	fast forward to present time , i found myself trawling to find the review i watched , only to find a new model had been released and reviewed - and i just had to have it in my life now that i had the funds !
Electrical_goods	then i found out that digitalrev have their own website and online store - i was impressed to say the least !
Electrical_goods	the price of the camera was so much cheaper in comparison with uk prices , which was hard to resist !
Electrical_goods	after_reading positive_reviews i went_ahead and purchased it , i wasn ' t disappointed .
Electrical_goods	it arrived in approximately 0 days all the way from_hong_kong , the delivery man managed to find me all the way up in the hills i live on , and despite the snow , he was not giving up trying to get to the house !
Electrical_goods	he told me about his epic tale as he passed over my camera .
Electrical_goods	it was very well_packaged and i was happy with it !
Electrical_goods	i did previously try purchasing it via their ebay site until i realised that they didn ' t cover import taxes on those purchases , so i cancelled my order so that i could purchase it via their website .
Electrical_goods	it was all handled very smoothly and their team were very helpful with my request .
Electrical_goods	now i am the proud owner of a new canon_000d woop !
Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	thanks to digitalrev i was able to purchase my first dslr and take my first step into photography .
Electrical_goods	i bought an entry level canon dslr ( the 000d ) at a price i found nowhere else !
Electrical_goods	i was also lucky to afford an extra lens within my budget , that ' s how good the price is !
Electrical_goods	shipment is also very fast , considering it comes from_hong_kong .
Electrical_goods	item arrived today very pleased with it and with the delivery speed .
Electrical_goods	i saw on their website audio - technica ath - ck0 in - ear headphones in blue .
Electrical_goods	i therefore assumed that this would be what i was buying .
Electrical_goods	knowing the quality of audio_technica headphones , i went_ahead and bought them .
Electrical_goods	when i recieved my invoice , it said the exact_same_thing .
Electrical_goods	after a speedy_delivery , i opened the packaging to discover that they were in fact ath - ck0ns headphones , with a 0 . 0m cable , and a neck strap for ipod shuffles .
Electrical_goods	angry , as this wasn ' t what i ordered , i rang customer_services , where the patronising salesman ( who told me that sometimes in life young_man , you just have to live up to your mistakes ...) told me that they aren ' t legally bound to put the correct product code in the title , and that i wouldn ' t get my money back .
Electrical_goods	i am going to be contacting_trading_standards as a result .
Electrical_goods	it ' s a pity i have to rate them so low because i have bought things from them before , and they have very quick delivery , and a good range of products .
Electrical_goods	i bought 0 0000 tone arms
Electrical_goods	they shippped very quickly , and were original techinics spares ... not copies
Electrical_goods	very happy with them
Electrical_goods	thanks
Electrical_goods	gs
Electrical_goods	digital_rev !!!
Electrical_goods	wowwwwwwwweeee !!

Electrical_goods	not only was it cheap !
Electrical_goods	it had free awesome postage !!
Electrical_goods	thanks very mooch
Electrical_goods	the staff are very knowledgeable , friendly and provide and excellent service .
Electrical_goods	will use again .
Electrical_goods	my first order from digitalrev was of a canon_0d body - they offered me the cheapest price i could find on the internet as well as a years international warranty ( with themselves ) and the item came from across the other side of the world in 0 days - with free delivery and a £_00 ' first order discount '.
Electrical_goods	further i haven ' t incurred any customs_charges what so ever , which is great .
Electrical_goods	overall i am very impressed with their prices and their services .
Electrical_goods	they have a good range of stock always available and postage has always been free for me .
Electrical_goods	i was unsure using digitalrev for the first time - for a purchase over £ 0000 - but i am glad that i did .
Electrical_goods	can ' t fault them on anything so far and i ' ve made a few orders now .
Electrical_goods	thank digital_rev , you ' ve saved me many a penny over the price of things in the uk and i shall continue to use you .
Electrical_goods	the canon 000ex rt i bought arrived within two days of me ordering it and was perfectly packaged and at a great price there is nothing i could suggest to improve .
Electrical_goods	great job !
Electrical_goods	superb customer_service , they helped_me , with some delivering issues in the matter of seconds .
Electrical_goods	superb products quality .
Electrical_goods	best place to buy quality products for bargain prices .
Electrical_goods	thank_you !
Electrical_goods	the cameras that digitalrev sell are probably one of the cheapest on the internet today .
Electrical_goods	the service was brilliant and delivery even better .
Electrical_goods	the camera came well_packaged and from_hong_kong to my door within 0 days .
Electrical_goods	would definitely_recommend these_guys to anyone_looking to grab themselves a bargain !.
Electrical_goods	i recieved item very quickly , everything i needed was included in the package ,
Electrical_goods	excellent item too ( auna miami nights speaker package ) maybe a little too powerful for a bedroom dj !
Electrical_goods	thanks and merry_christmas , paul .
Electrical_goods	i was gutted when my auna speaker blew out at a party , when i wasn ' t even playing at a very loud volume .
Electrical_goods	i rang hifi_tower later that week and they gave me permission to try to fix the speaker ' s fuse myself .
Electrical_goods	i couldn ' t and so i sent it back to them .
Electrical_goods	within 0 working_days they emailed me saying that they couldn ' t fix it and said that they would give me a full_refund .
Electrical_goods	i think that ' s very good customer_service , given that they also allowed me to try and fix it myself and i am sure that other_companies might have tried to weedle their way out of a refund .
Electrical_goods	i am thusly going to buy my next speaker system from hifi_tower as well ..
Electrical_goods	item returned with out any_problems wish all companies were like this
Electrical_goods	i ordered a pair of earphones from hifiheadphones . co . uk .
Electrical_goods	unfortunately the earphones i received were faulty , which was annoying but that wasn ' t their fault .
Electrical_goods	the returns_procedure was slick and fast - couldn ' t have done anything better .
Electrical_goods	can ' t fault the service .
Electrical_goods	took 0 working_days from order to front_door in london .
Electrical_goods	parcel tracking is great .
Electrical_goods	product arrived well_packed .
Electrical_goods	i have to admit i was slightly worried when i placed the order purely due to the fact they ship from hk but all was good .
Electrical_goods	the prices are great , but don ' t expect uk stock and uk manufacturers warranty .
Electrical_goods	my nikon_d0000 ' body only ' arrived in the standard 00 - 00 kit_lens box so it wasnt a ' sealed ' box .
Electrical_goods	the separate nikkor i ordered however came completely sealed as you would expect for a new item .
Electrical_goods	you get a 00 month digirev warranty .
Electrical_goods	i just hope i never have to use it as i ' m not sure it will be as simple to use as a uk nikon warranty .
Electrical_goods	as long as you are aware of the above points and buy on this knowledge you shouldn ' t be disappointed with these_guys .
Electrical_goods	in that respect pretty faultless and puts more local suppliers delivery costs and lead times to shame .
Electrical_goods	i bought a cctv unit .
Electrical_goods	i sent the sales_team some questions_regarding a product before i bought it , then had the answers within a few hours .
Electrical_goods	the product arrived the next working day .
Electrical_goods	absolutely superb service and quality .
Electrical_goods	very good seller and fast delivery and equipment for work immediately after connecting
Electrical_goods	i still cant_believe_how quick my order came ... 0 days from_hong_kong to surrey !!!
Electrical_goods	!

Electrical_goods	bought a sigma 00 - 000 os in nikon mount and at first was a bit_worried_about spending so much on an item coming from overseas especially when 00_% of it is glass .
Electrical_goods	i read the hundreds of positive_reviews about the lens and the company so decided it was worth saving the £_000 against the current amazon price .
Electrical_goods	all i can say is that the service from this company is unbelievable .
Electrical_goods	i ordered late on a thursday_night and received the item first thing tuesday_morning .
Electrical_goods	i was able to track the item and by the time it arrived there were 00 steps shown on the tracking screen .

Electrical_goods	i was recommended to use digitalrev by a photographer i trust , but honestly i was dubious ordering from abroad but i have no_complaints , the order got to me faster_than it would if i ' d ordered from the uk and i was kept up to date of the progress of the order and shipping .
Electrical_goods	the camera performs beautifully , i got the g00 to take places i cant take my dslr but still have full control over exposure and shoot in raw and i ' m satisfied this will do the job .
Electrical_goods	only_niggle the charger was european so cant be used in the uk .
Electrical_goods	also ordered a spare battery haven ' t used it yet but the price was right and a funky neck strap for the camera
Electrical_goods	will_definitely buy again from digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	super_fast delivery !
Electrical_goods	ordered on friday got it on tuesday even with the item on hold for inspection in uk .
Electrical_goods	wasn ' t sure about few things and got a super_fast reply !
Electrical_goods	i used pixmania to recently purchase a new laptop .
Electrical_goods	i had been to local_stores and visited some of the larger chains that offer value for money in computers and electrical appliances .
Electrical_goods	i found pixmania to have a wider choice and better value for money .
Electrical_goods	i ordered the laptop and had it very quickly within 0 - 0 days of ordering .
Electrical_goods	i am very happy with the product and the service offered by pixmania was excellant .

Electrical_goods	bought a camera from here at a much cheaper price than anywhere on the internet .
Electrical_goods	was kept_informed at every_stage of the delivery , which arrived a lot sooner_than i was expecting which was excellent .
Electrical_goods	can ' t fault them at all .
Electrical_goods	i recieved my camera safe and sound .
Electrical_goods	plenty of bubble_wrap used to ensure i recieved it in great condition .
Electrical_goods	great price for the camera which was a lot lower then the prices in the uk , and was worth not having the uk shop warranty and uk nikon charger for .
Electrical_goods	the only thing i could recommend would be that you might want to think about printing english manuals and putting them in with the cameras .
Electrical_goods	it was easy enough to download off the web but for a little extra_cost to you might increase your sales .
Electrical_goods	you sent out a uk adapter so why not do that little extra ?
Electrical_goods	overall great experience and will be using you again .
Electrical_goods	aaron

Electrical_goods	not only did the filter get to me ontime , one of the people actually cycled to my house ( in brighton ) to delivery them in person to make_sure i got them and knew how to correctly install the filter .
Electrical_goods	not only this but i have just ordered some new eartips for the same headphones and again the customer_service has been perfect .
Electrical_goods	one of the best companies i have ordered anything from , never shopping anywhere_else for my headphone needs
Electrical_goods	ben
Electrical_goods	amazing service !
Electrical_goods	just got my tokina 00 - 00 !!!!
Electrical_goods	thanks !!!
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	i have used this company many_times .
Electrical_goods	easy to place orders , no nonsense and secure_payments .
Electrical_goods	delivery is always quick and on time .
Electrical_goods	main_reason i am leaving this review though is because of their customer_service !
Electrical_goods	by_far the best customer_service i have ever received .
Electrical_goods	i had an issue with an amplifier that i bought and not only did they offer to replace / repair it , they also offered to refund me partially if i chose to repair it locally ( which i did ).
Electrical_goods	they are polite , quick to respond and provide information fully .
Electrical_goods	it was a pleasure to deal with nice after - sale customer_service .
Electrical_goods	p . s the prices are very competitive .
Electrical_goods	i brought a panasonic 00 " plasma hd 0d smart_tv .
Electrical_goods	great tv !.
Electrical_goods	within 0 days the tv broke had to wait over a week for a new one caus it was over the holiday period , the whole reason i had purchaed the tv at that time !
Electrical_goods	anyway got it replaced , quite rude on the phone , i had to email and hassle alot to make_sure the tv was getting replaced asap !
Electrical_goods	they told me they would give me 0 set of free 0d glasses as a sorry , witch are only worth £_00 when i had speent £_000 on a tv , 0 pair was pretty poor but .... they never even sent them to me !!!!!!!!!
Electrical_goods	even after i emailed them over 0 times asking about it , they did reply the first few_times but never after that and i never got the glasses !
Electrical_goods	not following through with there statments and not replying to paying customers is not on !!
Electrical_goods	i do feel a bit conned by them and would never buy from them again !
Electrical_goods	and i would advise you not to buy from them !!
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	fast + clear communication .
Electrical_goods	the rumours of a lolipop were true and it was even better_than i ' d dared hope
Electrical_goods	top_notch service and very helpful to me when i lacked sufficient knowledge .
Electrical_goods	i would highly_recommend hifi - tower to anybody , cant knock them 0 *!
Electrical_goods	initially never_heard of the site but thought i ' d try it .
Electrical_goods	i ordered a slush machine which works_perfectly , was cheaper_than other_sites and even had free delivery .
Electrical_goods	received item quickly with updates via_email as well .
Electrical_goods	i would recommend this company to anyone .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve used hifiheadphones several_times but on another account , and all i can say is they ' re excellent .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve had some problems with previous headphones and each email i sent was replied to quickly , and every time the problem has been resolved very quickly with no_fuss ; great customer_service , the best i ' ve ever_experienced .
Electrical_goods	i do all my headphone and accessory shopping here now , and i take every opportunity to recommend them to friends .
Electrical_goods	and their little touches are fantastic , such as including a lollipop in the packagining , love it !
Electrical_goods	after a few review about lenses , i decided to go for canon 00 - 000 mm lense .
Electrical_goods	i found if i buy this lens in digitalrev , it costs me cheaper at_least £_000 with amazon and other_websites .
Electrical_goods	it arrived as it was estimated .
Electrical_goods	the packaging was fantastic .
Electrical_goods	overall i am quite happy with the result .
Electrical_goods	well_done digrev .
Electrical_goods	from now i will buy all of my camera acc .
Electrical_goods	from u .
Electrical_goods	you ' re always greeted as you walk in .
Electrical_goods	they do their best to beat_competitors prices , and have always suceeded ( and often undercut them ).
Electrical_goods	the staff are friendly and helpful , and the showroom is well looked after , with demonstrations of pretty_much anything that ' s newly_released .
Electrical_goods	they are always my first choice for anything music related .
Electrical_goods	ordered my 00d and l_lens on sunday_evening , had issues with my bank but at last the funds were released to digirev and boom !!
Electrical_goods	i am writing this review with my order nicely_wrapped and padded sat by my side .
Electrical_goods	will_defo use again and again .
Electrical_goods	i had no_problems with this website .
Electrical_goods	the site didn ' t make it clear my parcel was going to come from_hong_kong , only found out with the tnt tracker , so i had my concerns .
Electrical_goods	but it was dispatched quickly and arrived on the date shown .
Electrical_goods	it was well_packaged with lots of bubble_wrap .
Electrical_goods	i would recommend this website and i would use this company again .
Electrical_goods	everything was perfect , but i was given an plug adapter that was actually for shavers .
Electrical_goods	this adapter was extremely dangerous , i could literally hear it buzz and could see electricity running up and down it , in future , digital_rev really need to look at into their plug adaptors ( chinese to british ).
Electrical_goods	someones going to get hurt .
Electrical_goods	i recently_purchased a nikon_d0000 .
Electrical_goods	the price was far better_than anything_else i could find by over £_000 .
Electrical_goods	communication was great and the delivered product was exactly as_described and excellently_packaged .
Electrical_goods	the only down_side was delivery took 0 days from placing the order .
Electrical_goods	however this is not the end of the world and the plus points certainly outweigh this .
Electrical_goods	definitely a 0 star company .
Electrical_goods	placed my order on the 0th_december and still not received , despite a dispatch email being sent to me on the 00th_december .
Electrical_goods	it shouldn ' t take that long to despatch in the first place !
Electrical_goods	it ' s my sons_birthday today and so can ' t give him a couple of the items on the order , and am worried it ' s not even going to arrive for xmas !
Electrical_goods	they have no telephone_number on the site and after_reading the reviews on here i ' ll be surprised if they bother to reply to my email .
Electrical_goods	the items are not unique to the site , so in future will_definitely be avoiding this company , wish i ' d read the reviews before i ordered !
Electrical_goods	rang me up to check size , double_check delivery location .
Electrical_goods	great service , pity i couldn ' t go in person this time to their great shop and audition room
Electrical_goods	my order came faster_than predicted !
Electrical_goods	i ordered on a wednesday and had my camera on the monday !
Electrical_goods	it was cheaper_than anywhere_else on the internet and i ' ve had no issues with the camera itself yet !
Electrical_goods	all_round excellent service !
Electrical_goods	i have been extremely happy with hifi - tower ' s products .
Electrical_goods	all 00 of my speakers have been working extremely well for the last 0 months .
Electrical_goods	until one started_playing up .
Electrical_goods	i emailed they ' re customer_service .
Electrical_goods	i received a fast reply .
Electrical_goods	my issue was resolved extremely fast with no hassle what so ever .
Electrical_goods	very good value , extremely well_packaged and excellent tracking service .
Electrical_goods	would definitely_recommend and will be doing_business with digitalrev . com again .
Electrical_goods	thank_you :)
Electrical_goods	i ordered some soundmagic pl00 earphones yesterday at 00 : 00 expecting to receive them next week , only to find the postman at 0am today on a saturday handing them .
Electrical_goods	i couldn ' t of got into_town as quick and they ' ve arrived just in time for some serious exam revision .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve bought headphones before from them and returned them with no_problems .
Electrical_goods	fantastic people , great service , and a pat on the back to the royal_mail too .
Electrical_goods	my order arrived earlier_than they promised , only three days after i ordered !
Electrical_goods	if you log in to the website you can see exactly_what your package is doing , fantastic service .
Electrical_goods	usually when you find a website that sells cameras seemingly below rrp you raise an eyebrow and wonder where the corners have been cut .
Electrical_goods	i ' m familiar with digitalrev ' s youtube account however , and thought to give them a try .
Electrical_goods	ordering was super easy and arrived within half the estimated shipping time .
Electrical_goods	perfect_condition , and the price was phenomenal .
Electrical_goods	i ' ll be checking digitalrev first when considering a camera or a lens in future .
Electrical_goods	rock on .
Electrical_goods	i made an error when i wrote my order , so i received a mail from darren ...
Electrical_goods	i paid postage as request , but at this time i don ' t receive any answer or pack !!
Electrical_goods	i hope it will arrive soon ...
Electrical_goods	always pleasant to receive a shipment from_hong - kong is less_than 0 days !
Electrical_goods	arrived before delivery dates mentioned , wrapping protecting perfectly the product .
Electrical_goods	the fujifilm fx00 is fantastic !
Electrical_goods	ordered a samson ps00 pop filter just before_christmas , paid for next_day delivery - item was as_described and came the next_day !
Electrical_goods	pleased with the service , no_hassles , would use and recommend !
Electrical_goods	was buying 0 pairs of headphones as a first time customer .
Electrical_goods	these were to be sent to a different address than a credit_card .
Electrical_goods	no_worries !, i was contacted by polite and knowledgable sales
Electrical_goods	person and all was sorted .
Electrical_goods	delivery went_smoothly and i ' m enjoying
Electrical_goods	my headphones now ;) thanks , hifiheadphones , will deal again .
Electrical_goods	great prices , really strong customer_service and super_fast delivery !
Electrical_goods	very impressed !
Electrical_goods	will_definitely buy from again !
Electrical_goods	like a lot of buyers i had hesitations from buying such expensive goods from an online_retailer that to be honest i had never really heard off .
Electrical_goods	well i can_assure anyone that chooses to shop at creative audio will be afforded the best service and support expected from a reputable high end retailer .
Electrical_goods	shopping online can be a rather faceless business .
Electrical_goods	i phoned the guys at ca and had a chat before ordering .
Electrical_goods	not only that , they gave me the best deal i could find for my preferred cyrus set_up .
Electrical_goods	spoke to martin and he was more_than helpful and knowledgable .
Electrical_goods	my order arrived in 0st_class packaging and on the day i specified .
Electrical_goods	a month later i ordered a few upgrades to my system and again martin was very helpful .
Electrical_goods	i had some issues with my rega turntable that wasn ' t purchased from creative audio but martin even took the time to offer his advice on that certain issue .
Electrical_goods	unfortunately the cyrus stream x0 didn ' t really suit my needs and was probably an error on my part for not researching it enough .
Electrical_goods	however i phoned martin and he said there would be no problem in returning it .
Electrical_goods	the next_day i had the return invoice .
Electrical_goods	retailers often overlook their after sales commitment and service but im pleased to say that creative audio embedded the expectation of the quality of the cyrus system i purchased into their service .
Electrical_goods	no_quibble returns are a very important factor in my purchases from retailers online .
Electrical_goods	to sum it up i have no_hesitation in recommending creative audio and future customers shouldn ' t either .
Electrical_goods	for cyrus in particular they will be my preferred dealer even_though i may never get to walk through the doors of brick and mortar store !
Electrical_goods	these_guys are fantastic .
Electrical_goods	i ordered the new nikon d000 with 00 - 00mm kit .
Electrical_goods	it arrived a day early and wrapped in a lot of large bubble_wrap .
Electrical_goods	it was about 0 / 0 of a foot in depth so as expected i had a little trouble actually getting through it .
Electrical_goods	at_least i know that the equipment is safe .
Electrical_goods	i didn ' t communicate with anyone directly so i can ' t comment on that !
Electrical_goods	for the product itself .
Electrical_goods	it is just what i needed and came with a 00 month warranty .
Electrical_goods	overall they are perfect !!
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	0 star service as usual , delivered in good time , best prices i have found and items arrive in perfect_condition , what more could you want ?
Electrical_goods	delivery was done on time and everything was as_described .

Electrical_goods	i bought an new pair of akg headphones from them that for a very reasonable charge arrived the next_day .
Electrical_goods	after deciding that this model was not right for me i sent them back for a different ( but similarly priced ) model .

Electrical_goods	great company !

Electrical_goods	i sent the stuff back and in 0 days had the new base and my phone is up and running once again .
Electrical_goods	i love the phone and can alternate between viop calls and the land_line .
Electrical_goods	this is by_far the best customer_service i have received in a long time .
Electrical_goods	would recommend them to anyone .
Electrical_goods	good company - lots of selection variety and good communication_throughout the sale and after .
Electrical_goods	i originally thought on first try that the headphones i bought were faulty and contacted the company , they were most apologetic and informed me of various ways to return the product .
Electrical_goods	they also said they would reimburse any return_postage_costs , where a lot of companys in that situation won ' t and the onus is on the customer to fork_out for shipping .
Electrical_goods	later found headphones to be working fine so it must have just been a glitch .
Electrical_goods	overall very impressed with the information , standard of customer care and ease of ordering from this company .
Electrical_goods	great delivery service , well_packaged item .
Electrical_goods	kept_informed , and when i needed some information the customer_service was brilliant .
Electrical_goods	would definitely use again .
Electrical_goods	many_thanks
Electrical_goods	i ordered the vision ego starter_kit .
Electrical_goods	it was really good .
Electrical_goods	i previously tried the mini e_- cigs from another site and these far surpassed them .
Electrical_goods	i had a small issue with one , but one call to daz and the problem was solved .
Electrical_goods	as i am new to vaping i appreciate daz ' s honesty and recommendations .
Electrical_goods	currently considering some mods and daz has been brilliant in explaining them to me so i can make my own decision on what to buy .
Electrical_goods	would recommend to anyone who vapes
Electrical_goods	items arrived quickly and in perfect_condition .
Electrical_goods	i followed the suggestions in award winners section and got a pair of soundmagic headphones for less_than some other well_known makes , so thank_you for saving me some money too .
Electrical_goods	i highly_recommend hifi_headphones !
Electrical_goods	i bought my canon_00d from digitalrev . com as it was the cheapest online price i could find for a brand_new piece of kit .
Electrical_goods	their products are from the asia / pacific market so when my camera arrived from_hong_kong ( within a few_days of ordering , for free !)
Electrical_goods	i was very pleased .
Electrical_goods	the only down - side was that all the manuals were in dual chinese / japanese but when i contacted customer support they offered to send me a photocopied manual in english .
Electrical_goods	customer support very helpful - overall a site i would come back to for future_purchases as the prices are fantastic !
Electrical_goods	it gives me satisfaction .
Electrical_goods	just try it !
Electrical_goods	i placed my order on monday night and received it wednesday_morning around 00 am !

Electrical_goods	would definitely use them for all my camera purchases .
Electrical_goods	i ' m from malta and got the headphones in just three days .
Electrical_goods	they were packaged very well and when i needed assistance prior to purchase , the staff were more_than willing to help me out .
Electrical_goods	also the headphones i got , sennheiser hd 000 , are amazing !
Electrical_goods	i was interested in purchasing an ableton push controller for my studio but i hadn ' t used one and wanted to experience it before purchase .
Electrical_goods	so i went the shop and they kindly set me up with the push and an ableton session and let me play with it to my hearts content .
Electrical_goods	after about an_hour i decided i wanted to go through with the purchase at no point was there ever any pressure on me to decide and buy .

Electrical_goods	superb , fast , excellent and friendly service - would totally recommend .

Electrical_goods	i have purchased two_pairs of headphones and some other smaller items from hifiheadphones .
Electrical_goods	their prices are always either the best available or pretty close .
Electrical_goods	you get piece of mind knowing you ' re getting exactly_what you wanted and delivered at lightning speed - without paying over the odds .
Electrical_goods	so i still check else where , but always buy from hifiheadphones .
Electrical_goods	a generally great service .
Electrical_goods	the site , product descriptions , range of products and prices were all fantastic , cant_complain_about a thing .
Electrical_goods	good communication via_email_updates .
Electrical_goods	i would definately use the site again and have recommended them to family and friends .
Electrical_goods	the cheapest prices online from somewhere actually trustworthy .
Electrical_goods	delivered ridiculously quick .
Electrical_goods	ordered on tuesday_evening .
Electrical_goods	on my desk at work thursday_morning .
Electrical_goods	uk_based companies aren ' t even that quick .
Electrical_goods	myself and my family have used pixmania numerous_times i ' d would highly_recommend shopping online with them .
Electrical_goods	their prices are very competitive compared to other online and retail_stores and also they deliver electronic_goods of any sizes to ireland .
Electrical_goods	this something many other international sites will not do !
Electrical_goods	there customer_service is also very good , with them getting back to me about a query about a product within 00_hours and providing the information i needed on the product .
Electrical_goods	really quick and easy to order and payment was simple .
Electrical_goods	delivery was quicker_than i had expected which made it all the more exciting when i opened it .
Electrical_goods	the service to get my item a few hours_later on a saturday was fantastic and the phone call to customer_service was brilliant too - really helpful .
Electrical_goods	will be ordering all headphones from here forever more .
Electrical_goods	i would deal with pixmania again , found it a great site .
Electrical_goods	however a few little details left me giving it 0_stars .
Electrical_goods	firstly i was trying to see what details were required for my credit_card and the numerous options present on the page was somewhat confusing and when i thought i was just checking the validity of my credit_card , it went through as a payment .
Electrical_goods	i think it was not easily possible to cancel without contacting the sales_team which i thought was too much hassle .
Electrical_goods	since i was there to buy i didn ' t think much of it .
Electrical_goods	but still i would much rather prefer a details page of what i ' m buying , charges and a final button asking my confirmation of purchase instead of jumping straight_away .
Electrical_goods	another thing , i thought pixmania . ie was an irish company , when i got my product it was french ... the box and product labels .
Electrical_goods	in most_cases i wouldn ' t mind but i have no_idea with the label on the back of my product means , take it off before use or what ?
Electrical_goods	another issue , i assume has nothing to do with pixmania is the courier service .
Electrical_goods	ups .
Electrical_goods	they managed to miss my package at the depot on the day of delivery around 0 pm , then they reattempted to deliver at 0pm and that wasn ' t successful ?
Electrical_goods	i didn ' t realise they sent deliveries that late .
Electrical_goods	if i had i would ' ve used my home address .
Electrical_goods	i put my work address since i assumed morning delivery and i might miss it while at work .
Electrical_goods	then it was finally delievered the next_day and the only way i knew it was received was because i signed_up for sms alerts on the ups site .
Electrical_goods	the box was just left in a store room by a staff_member .
Electrical_goods	all it had was the store ' s name and address on it .
Electrical_goods	my name was nowhere to be found .
Electrical_goods	this is delicate electronic equipment .
Electrical_goods	i read on pixmania delivery info that the package should be opened and checked on delivery to see if it was damaged or defective , since accepting it or signing it without doing that would deem it was delievered in working condition and i wouldn ' t have much ground to return it or get a refund .
Electrical_goods	now how can i do that when they don ' t come on time , don ' t deliver it to the right person or even have my name on it ?
Electrical_goods	ridiculous .
Electrical_goods	i went through all that hassle just so i can receive it in my hands and not wait extra days or have to travel to pick it up somewhere .
Electrical_goods	saved around £_000 -£_000 buying from digitalrev rather_than the uk and i recieved my camera in around 0 days although i did order on a sunday .
Electrical_goods	there were no import fees to pay and the parcel was very well padded and protected in transit .
Electrical_goods	great company and also great communication .
Electrical_goods	a +++++
Electrical_goods	very fast delivery .. that is great
Electrical_goods	ordered a lens at 00 / 0 and received it 0 days_later at the 00th full bubble wraped ( it took me like 00_minutes just to cut away the bubble_wrap to get to the lens box )
Electrical_goods	excellent prices and will do bussiness again for sure !
Electrical_goods	it took only 0 days for the lens to reach me to the uk .
Electrical_goods	it had fully detailed tracking from dhl and i saved £_000 or more from uk prices !!
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	thank_you digital_rev
Electrical_goods	on time and nicely_packaged yaya
Electrical_goods	i ordered the canon_000d 00 -_000mm kit_lens on sunday_night and it arrived from hk to uk on wednesday_afternoon - even uk companies don ' t deliver that fast !
Electrical_goods	astonishingly speedy service !
Electrical_goods	i ' ve used the camera for a week now - no issues noted .
Electrical_goods	top quality product so far .
Electrical_goods	one year ' s warranty came as standard .
Electrical_goods	no import taxes to worry_about .
Electrical_goods	have no_problems recommending digital_rev !
Electrical_goods	i first came_across this website after watching a youtube video that said hifiheadphones was the best company in the uk for headphones and earphones .
Electrical_goods	they were right !
Electrical_goods	the site offers a lot of support for people who are unsure on what to purchase .
Electrical_goods	for example , the sales and expert_advice phone number and the forum in which you can talk to fellow audiophiles .
Electrical_goods	the delivery was quick and the emails with information on my order were friendly and didn ' t feel automated .
Electrical_goods	also , i mustn ' t forget the lollipop they include in your package .
Electrical_goods	that strawberry chupa_chups really made my day .
Electrical_goods	0 / 0 , excellent service , definitely my new go to website for earphones and headphones .
Electrical_goods	we bought a lens for our camera , delivered very quickly , even faster then we expected , packed very well and with extra care .
Electrical_goods	over all amazing experience .
Electrical_goods	the item i bought from music matter was advertised as ex - demo .
Electrical_goods	i never buy second_hand stuff when it comes to electronics however i thought i ' ll give it a try (£ 00 cheaper_than bnib ) and was really positively_surprised when the item arrived .
Electrical_goods	it came with all the original bits and pieces and packed in the original box .
Electrical_goods	i ' d never tell that it ' s an ex - demo as it looked like brand_new .
Electrical_goods	delivery next_day included
Electrical_goods	thanks a lot guys :)

Electrical_goods	awesome .
Electrical_goods	ordered an electrical item on the site , order went through fine , but then i received an_email claiming i had to phone up and answer some security questions because i was paying by credit_card .
Electrical_goods	i did so , answered what was asked , was then told that my order would be canceled and i would have to order again and pay by bank_transfer because of a " security issue ".
Electrical_goods	when i asked what the issue was exactly i was transfered to another operator and when i explained things to him he answered with " no , the order has gone_through now , it ' s being_processed and will be shipped out today ",
Electrical_goods	either end of the transaction was fine , but the security faff in the middle was entirely unnecessary and felt very amateur .
Electrical_goods	delivery was efficient and the package arrived adequately wrapped and protected .
Electrical_goods	my 00d is exactly as i thought it would be and i really can ' t faulter digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	i would most definitely be a returning customer :)
Electrical_goods	one problem was the bag fell_apart on first use but either quick and reliable delivery .
Electrical_goods	will use this company again , very happy with the service .
Electrical_goods	so pleased with my new scales , they come within two days of ordering and at half the price , the customer_service was great will_defo do business again many_thanks
Electrical_goods	i called pmc at 000pm with an urgent request for a new printer as one bought through amazon was falsely advertised and was not a network printer .
Electrical_goods	i received the new printer the following_morning ( brother multifunction laser_printer ).
Electrical_goods	excellent customer_service .
Electrical_goods	excellent printer .
Electrical_goods	amazing website fast delivery
Electrical_goods	i was very impressed with the way the product was packed .
Electrical_goods	i could see that , someone had put a lot of time .
Electrical_goods	make_sure that protect would not be damaged .
Electrical_goods	also it was handled by delivery service with great care and there was not a mark on the box .
Electrical_goods	i will be buying from you again excellent service " and response from yourselves .

Electrical_goods	thanks .
Electrical_goods	on time delivery , good price as well , i am enjoying it
Electrical_goods	i ordered a canon_000d from digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	the order and payment process was really simple .
Electrical_goods	i was advised that my camera would be delivered in around a week but it arrived 0 days early !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	it was packaged so well that you could have dropped it from the top of the eiffel tower and it would still have been in perfect_condition .
Electrical_goods	i absolutely love my camera and will_definitely use digital_rev in the future .
Electrical_goods	hunting_around for a specific canon lens .
Electrical_goods	digitalrev was by_far the cheapest and i received it a couple of days_later .
Electrical_goods	can ' t fault them .
Electrical_goods	i cannot emphasise enough how good the packaging is and how fast the shipment is aswell .
Electrical_goods	seriously think no more when it comes to photography equipment and not only .
Electrical_goods	best prices only by_far beats any competition .
Electrical_goods	a five_star company overall !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	website easy to use and helpful friendly staff over the phone .
Electrical_goods	delivery came next_day as promised .
Electrical_goods	our greenstar elite juicier is great !
Electrical_goods	needed a good juicer for health reasons and not disappointed !
Electrical_goods	easy to use and clean , simple to assemble and disassemble and the juice is delicious .
Electrical_goods	pulp comes out very dry so good to know that all the nutrients and goodness is in the juice and not in the waste product !
Electrical_goods	at first i was hesitant to buy from this site as it is a hong_kong based company .
Electrical_goods	and let me tell you now ... do not let that stop you .
Electrical_goods	i ordered on a friday_night , my order arrived on the monday_morning .
Electrical_goods	i ' m convinced that they hired superman for the deliveries !
Electrical_goods	the prices they offer for such equipment are mind boggling .
Electrical_goods	i bought a canon_0d , a canon 00mm 0 . 0 and a 00gb cf card .
Electrical_goods	if i bought them here it would have cost me around £ 0 , 000 , but from digitalrev the whole order came to £_000 and there were no surprise extra costs !
Electrical_goods	this makes me feel all warm and happy inside .
Electrical_goods	to sum it up , digitalrev is a very professional and attractive company , and i will 000_% be purchasing all my camera_equipment from there in the future .
Electrical_goods	00 / 00 well_done digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	you deserve an applause .
Electrical_goods	bought from them in the past , decided to buy another camera .
Electrical_goods	very small amount of time to arrive in the uk .
Electrical_goods	heavily wrapped in bubblewrap .
Electrical_goods	a company clearly so loving of their customers to ensure it will arrive safely .
Electrical_goods	i imagine the overuse of bubblewrap can ' t be cheap either .
Electrical_goods	a fantastic price x quality service , together with a fast and flexible delivery and good communication .
Electrical_goods	i recommend to everyone .
Electrical_goods	bought a technical 0000 mk0 from the guys at bopdj , and all i can say is that the customer_service was second to none !!!
Electrical_goods	i had the turntable in 0 days !!
Electrical_goods	for me being in australia that is unbelievable .
Electrical_goods	i will be using bopdj again and would recommend their services to anyone
Electrical_goods	i ordered the camera on friday 00th_april and it arrived on wednesday 00th_april after having some problems verifying payment ( it wasn ' t actually sent until monday ).
Electrical_goods	the only_gripe i have is that the charger is japanese instead of british but for the price i could buy 0x british chargers with the 0d + 00 - 000l kit_lens package and still be better off than just the body only from jessops !
Electrical_goods	a ++++++++++++++++
Electrical_goods	i first contacted the company after a recommendation from avforums .
Electrical_goods	i was extremily happy with the call .
Electrical_goods	i was able to explain my thoughts to a member of staff who knew what they were talking_about .
Electrical_goods	rather_than ' hard sell ' they explained some options and let me make an informed_decision .
Electrical_goods	the ordering_process was simple and the headphones were as the member of staff described excellent .
Electrical_goods	while the price for the um0 ' s were slightly_higher_than other_companies were selling them for i feel this was worth it for the excellent customer_service shown .
Electrical_goods	the delivery was also quick !
Electrical_goods	great site , a lot of choice and found exactly_what i was looking for , quick delivery and great service .
Electrical_goods	would recommend !
Electrical_goods	excellent communication ; super_fast delivery ; free lollipop ; would recommend to anyone .
Electrical_goods	order received , happy with product , good price .
Electrical_goods	i was a little_worried when i saw the low price compared to other_sites but reading all of the positive_reviews on lots of external websites made me confident that i could trust digitalrev . com i was not disappointed and the camera lens came through on time and well_packaged .
Electrical_goods	i am looking_forward to getting some good shots with it and will be using the website again .
Electrical_goods	i have made 0 orders with uk automation and the service was fantastic .
Electrical_goods	the status of the order is always clear to me , i know exactly_what is happening to my order .
Electrical_goods	the delivery was surprisingly fast .
Electrical_goods	i would love to see more variety of zwave products and having a slower / cheaper delivery option .
Electrical_goods	after doing all the searches digitalrev . com came up as the cheapest supplier for the sony rx000ii .
Electrical_goods	what clinched it for me was that they took care of the customs issues that can plague a purchase from overseas and delivery was included in the price .
Electrical_goods	having established that , i checked reviews and they were exemplary .
Electrical_goods	i bought the camera bundled with an sd_card and extra battery .
Electrical_goods	payment was easy ( through paypal ).
Electrical_goods	and within a few_days the package arrived .
Electrical_goods	the camera was very securely_wrapped ( and i have a big store of bubble_wrap for my future ) and came to me without a hitch .
Electrical_goods	i love the camera .
Electrical_goods	it ' s a delight to hold and use .
Electrical_goods	i ' m learning and i do wish sony could write better manuals but that ' s sony not digitalrev . com .
Electrical_goods	i would definitely buy from them again without_doubt .
Electrical_goods	after many weeks of hovering over the place order button and the internal struggle of do or dont , i ordered my canon_0d with the canon 00 - 000 mm f0 lens on the friday_night after the help of some liquid courage .
Electrical_goods	digital_rev were in contact from the saturday_morning confirming delivery details etc , my order was shipped on the monday night and arrived in london at my office by 00 am thursday .
Electrical_goods	all the way through i was kept well informed via the online tracking and my 0d arrived very well_packaged and i absolutely love it and the 00 -_000mm .
Electrical_goods	i would not hesitate to order from digital_rev again as the customer_service , delivery and products are top_notch .
Electrical_goods	at first i was somewhat dubious ordering speakers , amp etc online for such a cheap price ..... however i was not disappointed .
Electrical_goods	my order arrived within 0 days with no_problems whatsoever . there was a slight technical fault with one of the speakers i ordered but the customer_service team were genuinely fantastic , they sent a replacement the day after i reported the problem and were always courteous and very fast with their responses .
Electrical_goods	all in all hifi - tower are a great company who seem to actually care about not only their reputation but also their customers also . would recommend to anyone and have since placed a second order due to such fantastic prices and hassle_free internet shopping_experience . massive thumbs_up from a happy customer in nottingham !
Electrical_goods	i ' m a long - standing fan of digitalrev and it ' s the only place i go to for my photographic equipment .
Electrical_goods	the prices are always pleasant and the shipping is so quick !
Electrical_goods	i love this website !
Electrical_goods	keep up the great work .
Electrical_goods	the wifiplug works fairly well and does the job , but the " developer api " touted as a feature may as well not exist .
Electrical_goods	i was excited to find a smart socket which an api i could build upon , but unfortunately there is close to zero documentation .
Electrical_goods	i managed to get it working and am successfully communicating with my wifiplug , but not before spending about 00_hours reverse - engineering the sample code and java library ( complete with comments in * chinese *) given to actually glean some useful_information .
Electrical_goods	if you ' re considering getting the wifiplug in order to do some " serious " home automation , look_elsewhere .
Electrical_goods	if you ' re just after a nifty gadget to remotely turn appliances on / off from an iphone , the wifiplug will do the job .
Electrical_goods	additionally , it is worth_noting service from the wifiplug company was great - almost instant shipping .
Electrical_goods	having looked around for some time i was unsure_about buying from digtialrev .
Electrical_goods	although i can see they are a reputable company , the idea of having a problem and having to sort it out worried me .
Electrical_goods	to that end i did buy my 0d mk iii from john_lewis .
Electrical_goods	but ….
Electrical_goods	that was a frustrating process and it took me 0 order submissions and 0 phone_calls to have the damn thing arrive over a week_later .
Electrical_goods	eventually the camera did arrive and i decided i wanted some new lenses as well .
Electrical_goods	the recent uk debacle pushed me to take the plunge and buy from digitalrev and i am really glad i did !
Electrical_goods	the digitalrev order process was quick and easy .
Electrical_goods	the items arrived incredibly well package and significantly quicker_than the paid for expedited service from the uk .
Electrical_goods	it is no wonder uk market is struggling with fixed minimum pricing model , crazy taxes , unwillingness of any uk retailer to budge from fixed prices ( or even a throw in a token freebie ), coupled_with sloppy service , especially_considering the savings to be had vs the low risk .
Electrical_goods	until the uk wakes up to the fact there is a global market and the fact that no amount of minimum price fixing is going to resolve that , i will_definitely be buying from you guys .
Electrical_goods	bottom_line , don ’ t let the scare stories about the grey market put you off buying from digtialrev !
Electrical_goods	the product i perchased had a fault , so i emailed the support_team the night it broke , they promtly responded the next_day telling_me they have already put it through as a replacement .
Electrical_goods	> great response time
Electrical_goods	> friendly / helpful service
Electrical_goods	> awsome prices
Electrical_goods	an excellent service , very helpful and informative , very happy with the headphones i bought from them
Electrical_goods	i highly_recommend digitalrev . com , speedy_delivery and the prices are very reasonable .
Electrical_goods	that is all
Electrical_goods	thank_you for providing decent products at awesome prices .
Electrical_goods	postage was quick .
Electrical_goods	cant_wait to order from you guys again .
Electrical_goods	looking at getting the 00 - 000 f0 . 0 mk ii l_lens in the next couple of weeks .
Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	top_class all_round
Electrical_goods	excellent service , quick delivery .
Electrical_goods	delivery was very quick , price cannot be matched for the service you receive .
Electrical_goods	to top it all off the selection of headphones they offer can ' t be matched .
Electrical_goods	also i always look_forward to the lolly they send in the package , just a nice friendly touch !
Electrical_goods	i bought a samsung pc monitor ( s00b000h ) from pixmania .
Electrical_goods	it is initially for dual screen purposes with my laptop but the future plan is to build a stationary pc , this is the first component .
Electrical_goods	i was so impressed with the screen quality that i am now thinking of purchasing a larger screen (~ 00 inch ?)
Electrical_goods	to utilise as a replacement tv as i have a sound system that i use for audio purposes anyway .
Electrical_goods	i highly_recommend pixmania ' s service , it took only 0 working_days for my monitor to be shipped from belgium to ireland , and i then received the monitor by 00 . 00 the next morning by local post .
Electrical_goods	packaging was in perfect_condition with only one scrape on one side of the box ( as if someone pushed a sharp edge against it , but it really wasn ' t bad .).
Electrical_goods	to be honest i have received parcels from local businesses that were in worse condition .
Electrical_goods	i bought a wide angle lens ... my first !
Electrical_goods	wasn ' t entirely sure if it was the right one for my canon .. chatted to an operator on the online support feature who assured me the product i was buying was the correct one .
Electrical_goods	sooooo i went and purchased it .
Electrical_goods	it was a christmas_gift to me , from my dad .
Electrical_goods	delivery service was over a week ...
Electrical_goods	i had it in a number of days ... all the way from honk kong , how quick was that !
Electrical_goods	and free too !!
Electrical_goods	the tracking online was perfect , right up to the point my dad signed for it while i was viewing the tracking in work ... sufficient and spot on !
Electrical_goods	i have previously bought my canon prime lens from dr and i certainly will be back for more photography gear when i ' m ready for my next adventure !
Electrical_goods	thanks guys .. love you !
Electrical_goods	united_kingdom customer ( very happy ).
Electrical_goods	ordered from this company twice now and both_times the service has been flawless and the products fantastic .
Electrical_goods	to be honest , i was worried first about how and when the offer is going to come to uk .
Electrical_goods	i ordered my camera + lens + battery grip on wednesday from_hong_kong and i received them on monday ( less_than one week )
Electrical_goods	great service .
Electrical_goods	the product was in great condition , the packaging was perfect .
Electrical_goods	keep it up .
Electrical_goods	i orderd an l_lens from digitalrev on the 00st of december , never expecting to get it before_christmas .
Electrical_goods	i was told that i would get the lens between the 00th and 00th which is a good delivery time anyway considering the package had to be shipped all the way from_hong_kong to london .
Electrical_goods	however much to my extremely pleasent surpirse the lens arrived on the 00rd of december !
Electrical_goods	0 - 0 day international delivery !
Electrical_goods	due to this , i suspect digitalrev may have access to a teleporter .
Electrical_goods	i will have to keep ordering from them to confirm .
Electrical_goods	been looking for olympus tg000 black for a while , could not find anywhere on net who had it . i hate preorderig cameras as retailer charge you upfront and takes time delivering it .
Electrical_goods	spoke to tekshop and they said they don ’ t change upfront for back orders .
Electrical_goods	once i placed the order for olympus tg000 black , i did check with my bank and they didn ’ t charge me .
Electrical_goods	took three_weeks but finally got the camera .
Electrical_goods	even_though it mentions on their site the price might change on back order , thank_god on my order it didnt .
Electrical_goods	happy customer overall .
Electrical_goods	great camera , extremely fast delivery
Electrical_goods	my english is not so good but i would say that the trade was very fast and very easy as also the communication and the shipment to germany .
Electrical_goods	bought a camera and accessories .
Electrical_goods	the price was really excellent and the delivery was on time with no hassle .
Electrical_goods	used to use a different supplier but that is likely to change now .
Electrical_goods	i was very pleased with my purchase and can strongly_recommend bop d . j .
Electrical_goods	thanks
Electrical_goods	really great service , it amazes me that it takes less time for digitalrev to send my parcel all the way from china than it does to get a letter from royal_mail !
Electrical_goods	lol
Electrical_goods	saved a hundred quid , cant_believe_how fast it arrived , tracking was great , product great .
Electrical_goods	only difference is that the charger is 0 prong but came with an adaptor - which is actually quite handy as i already have a uk one , so i can use this to take on hols !
Electrical_goods	ordering was simple and straight_forward .
Electrical_goods	price was and is phenomenal .
Electrical_goods	bearing in mind or was a bank_holiday weekend , i got my package within the week '
Electrical_goods	customer_service was actually helpful
Electrical_goods	all in all bloody bodaciois !

Electrical_goods	happy and satisfied buyer .
Electrical_goods	i have bought 0 sets of headphones from hifiheadphones . com and i can_honestly say that i have been blown_away with their service both_times .
Electrical_goods	the first set were faulty and were replaced immediately , accompanied by several emails to keep me informed as to the progress of the replacements .
Electrical_goods	i recently decided to upgrade to a better set and phoned the company 0 days before a long_haul flight to see if there was any chance of having then delivered quickly .
Electrical_goods	the headphones arrived the following_day and agin , the communications were excellent .
Electrical_goods	i have used the forums to learn about different brands and decide which type suited me best and have nothing but good things to say about the high_level of knowledge and willingness to help among all members of staff .
Electrical_goods	absolutely my favourite online comany bar_none !
Electrical_goods	hi
Electrical_goods	i needed a printer in a hurry .. printer got delivered next_day .. happy with service
Electrical_goods	i have bought several items from this company , so i ' m not that surprised .

Electrical_goods	ordered 0 items on thursday_night , which was processed the next_day , arrived the next friday , packages in perfect_condition so as the items inside .
Electrical_goods	there were so many people saying bad things about pixmania and their delivery / customer_services so i was confused whether to order there or not , but so far , haven ' t had a single problem with them , they ' re great at what they ' re doing and they have my trust .
Electrical_goods	will surely buy more things from pixmania in the near_future because they know how to provide good services for amazing prices .
Electrical_goods	delivered on or before estimated_delivery date good service love it !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	these days i find that i tend to stick to be same old websites for my shopping needs and was a little_hesitant to try uk juicers .
Electrical_goods	the website is clean and informative .
Electrical_goods	the layout is easy to get around .
Electrical_goods	most of all though ... they delivered in every way you would hope for .
Electrical_goods	not only that , but their prices for the item i was looking for saved me £_00 !
Electrical_goods	i ' m not a big vegetable / juicer but i ' m trying to change my years of bad habits .
Electrical_goods	and when i want my next bit of kit to help me on my way , i ' ll definitely be checking uk juicers first .
Electrical_goods	i was hesitate when ordering pricey stuff from hk ( i ' m in the uk ) but finally , i placed my order .

Electrical_goods	i saved £_000 from ordering from dr so it ' s an amazing experience !!

Electrical_goods	the camera quality is superb and it is also inexpensive .
Electrical_goods	will recommend spycameracctv to all .
Electrical_goods	really impressive service - the staff were both incredibly friendly and knowledgable recommending what i actually needed , rather_than talking me into an unnecessary purchase .
Electrical_goods	great online service where you can get some advice before you make the trip to the store .

Electrical_goods	so from_hong_kong to the uk in about 0 days , fully tracked and no duty to pay .
Electrical_goods	dispatch was almost immediate .
Electrical_goods	no hassle or worry .
Electrical_goods	i was told by their customer_service before placing the order that digitalrev has a warehouse in the uk so that was why there was no duty , this was clearly nonsense but they must have foot the bill as it came through with no_problems .
Electrical_goods	the phone is perfect .
Electrical_goods	i haven ' t used their warranty and hope i don ' t have to but so far they have proved to be a superb company .
Electrical_goods	found the website through some searches online .
Electrical_goods	the website is really well_presented and easy to use and the prices are incredible !
Electrical_goods	had a problem at check out but it turned_out to be my bank - even so their support services responded very fast with some excellent advice .
Electrical_goods	delivery was fast and well_packaged !

Electrical_goods	i was looking for a set of decent , entry level headphones .
Electrical_goods	i ' m sure most people that come_across this site are / were in the exact_same_boat as me and are worried_about fake items .

Electrical_goods	my first time with dr online shopping and it has been awesome !
Electrical_goods	thanks !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	made the order at 0 :_00pm sunday_night
Electrical_goods	received an_email at 0 :_00am monday_morning saying the item had been dispatched
Electrical_goods	parcel was on my doorstep at around 00 :_00am tuesday_morning ... marked air mail from_hong_kong !
Electrical_goods	( and wrapped in a good 0 square metres of bubblewrap )
Electrical_goods	how is that even possible ?
Electrical_goods	did you guys send it over on a harrier jump jet or something ?
Electrical_goods	amazing .
Electrical_goods	ordering was easy .
Electrical_goods	free delivery as well but when i saw it was being dispatched from_hong_kong my heart sank a little as i assumed it would take ages to arrive .
Electrical_goods	i needn ' t have worried though as my camera was with me only 0 days_later which i thought was amazingly fast .
Electrical_goods	packaged really securely .
Electrical_goods	excellent service !

Electrical_goods	brilliant products awesome price .
Electrical_goods	delivery abit slow but cant_complain
Electrical_goods	as per the title - delivery from_hong_kong was swift and precisely tracked .
Electrical_goods	i was text messaged to inform me of delivery , which was bang on time .
Electrical_goods	my only minor reservation is that there was no user manual supplied with the camera - however a link to said manual was provided for direct download from canon ( not necessarily the fault of the supplier here - but having looked at the same camera in a shop locally it had the printed manual in the box ), but no great trauma to download ( in fact slightly more useful as it is now stored as a pdf on my phone and can be with me wherever i go ).
Electrical_goods	overall a big_thumbs_up - will wholeheartedly_recommend and would buy from digitalrev again myself .
Electrical_goods	great contact with customer .
Electrical_goods	extremelly fast_shipping .
Electrical_goods	in the future i will definatelly buy stuff from this web_site ! thank_you !
Electrical_goods	ordered a high end dslr lens on a thursday_evening , was here by the tuesday , impressive as came from hk not uk .
Electrical_goods	arrived very well_packaged with 00m of very carefully_wrapped bubble_wrap , box and item in pristine_condition .
Electrical_goods	and all of this for less_than half the price of the same item from the lowest cost uk store , amazing really !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	not only did digitalrev have the best price available on the camera i wanted ( eos 0d ) but their service was exemplary .
Electrical_goods	i ordered the camera late monday night , had an_email the next morning confirming dispatch and the camera was in my hands by thursday lunchtime !
Electrical_goods	throughout the whole_process i was able to track the progress of the delivery using the dhl_tracking site .
Electrical_goods	i am amazed that dr can get a camera to me from_hong_kong in less time than it takes a shop not 00 miles_away to get anything to me at all !
Electrical_goods	ok so the item is a ' grey ' import but the dr warranty that is included seems pretty comprehensive and as what i ' ve bought is a quality product i ' ve got no_qualms .
Electrical_goods	the manual was in japanese - no big deal as you can dl the manual from canon and i prefer it on my ipad anyway !
Electrical_goods	also the battery pack has non uk connections but dr include an adaptor and the supply itself works across multiple voltage systems - all good !
Electrical_goods	i ' d very happily_recommend digitalrev and will be back for more when i need the equipment .
Electrical_goods	see post title .
Electrical_goods	nuff_said .
Electrical_goods	i really rate these_guys , they know what they ' re talking_about , are happy to help and actually seem to enjoy talking to customers to make_sure they end up happy ... when was the last time you can say that about any shop ?
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	its not often that i want to spend money with somebody , but rest_assured i ' ll be coming_back to hifiheadphones for anything audio related in the future .
Electrical_goods	if you see things slightly_cheaper elsewhere don ' t even be tempted - you will not get better service anywhere_else !
Electrical_goods	thank_you guys

Electrical_goods	needed to get some decent quality / sized speakers for a full set - up , stumbled accross hifi - tower on ebay and thought for the money they seemed pretty reasonable , especially the postage and handling charges .
Electrical_goods	it seems i underestimated the size of the equipment , i got far more for my money than i realised .
Electrical_goods	for the money , amazing speakers .
Electrical_goods	the system incuded 0x 000 watt pa speakers , and a skytec 000 amp .
Electrical_goods	one power_cable , 0 heavy duty spekon audio cables and delivered amazing results from day one .
Electrical_goods	very easy set_up and nothing complicated .
Electrical_goods	the only thing i can think of is the power_cable had a eu 0 pin plug and there wasn ' t an adaptor in the box .
Electrical_goods	i had a conversion plug around anyway , so didn ' t bother me at all .
Electrical_goods	first rate product and very quick dispatch - ordered on thursday , turned_up the following_tuesday .
Electrical_goods	very good product , very fast post . many_thanks

Electrical_goods	let me just start with what impressed me the most - a million layers of bubble_wrap surrounding my product .
Electrical_goods	this was by_far the most secure packaging i ' ve even seen , drop proof and bullet proof .
Electrical_goods	there was so much bubble_wrap that after unwrapping the package i am left with a fair - sized roll of it to use as i please .
Electrical_goods	next , even_though digitalrev are not the cheapest on the web - definitely more_expensive than valuebasket or even the local hong_kong electronics market - the product i purchased was surprisingly affordable .
Electrical_goods	digitalrev are a well_established and reputable company , so there is a strong confidence factor when buying from them .
Electrical_goods	my item came with 00 - month global warranty , which is very reassuring to see .
Electrical_goods	overall very pleased with my purchase , would recommend and buy again .

Electrical_goods	having recently been looking around for a fair while for 0 x technics sl0000mk0g ' s .
Electrical_goods	i managed to locate some @ bopdj . com .
Electrical_goods	i immediately made a call and spoke with conor , who was extremely_helpful and knowledgeable .
Electrical_goods	he advised me exactly_what was available , the price , condition etc .
Electrical_goods	i then opted for 0 0nd_hand decks , and just as conor had stated they were received a few_days_later in " mint " condition .
Electrical_goods	i agree with many of the other posts here and i am more_than happy recommending conor / bopdj to my friends .
Electrical_goods	i will certainly be back for more from bopdj .
Electrical_goods	when i contacted them asking about when they ' d next be in stock , i received an accurate quick reply .

Electrical_goods	thank_you
Electrical_goods	i was skeptical to use a site where the camera ' s were much cheaper , i thought ..
Electrical_goods	why !?
Electrical_goods	two people i work with recommended the site to me , one of which has bought quite a few expensive items from dr himself .
Electrical_goods	i thought i ' d go_ahead , as the camera i wanted was £_00 cheaper_than amazon , or £_00 more with an extra lens !
Electrical_goods	so i went with that !
Electrical_goods	i think they do make up for their price cuts , with other little items like memory_cards , which seem to be more_expensive on digital_rev than amazon !
Electrical_goods	so they probably make their money back there .
Electrical_goods	i was concerned_about warranties and grey goods issues , however my camera ( a fuji ) has come with a worldwide warranty so there is no issue there , and also if your model doesn ' t , digital_rev provide a warranty and pick_up / fix in your own country - rather_than you having to send back to hong_kong !
Electrical_goods	shipping took two days !!!
Electrical_goods	which was bloody amazing .
Electrical_goods	i don ' t know how it got here so fast !
Electrical_goods	i ordered on sunday morning , and it was here by tuesday !
Electrical_goods	overall , i ' d highly_recommend dr to others and will use again myself for sure !

Electrical_goods	when i decided on the product , the price and the estimated deliver - by date of the product were fantastic so i decided to buy from digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	the product arrived really well_packed and a couple of days before the estimated deliver - by date .
Electrical_goods	it was brilliant , exactly as_described and i ' ll be buying all of my camera products from here from now on .

Electrical_goods	i had been looking to purchase a new canon camera for months and after browsing online i found a selection of online stores .
Electrical_goods	i ' m always a bit_wary of buying expensive goods online so went for digitalrev as they had the best reviews .
Electrical_goods	they were brilliant at keeping me informed of my order and its expected delivery date , and it arrived very quickly and right on time .
Electrical_goods	the camera is perfect and i can recommend digitalrev to everyone !
Electrical_goods	after recieving my item from hifi_tower and unfortunately realising the item was damaged i contacted the servie immediately .
Electrical_goods	they were extremely_helpful and provided me with excellent customer_service .
Electrical_goods	their communication was effective and rapid and provided me with a replacement item free of charge .
Electrical_goods	prior to this , when i purchased the item from hifi_tower the service was excellent and i recieved my item very quickly .
Electrical_goods	it ' s not very often that you receive such excellent customer_service within this day and age and it was very refreshing to find a business that still does !
Electrical_goods	i would 000_% reccoment this company to anybody looking for a similar service .
Electrical_goods	0 *!
Electrical_goods	the simple guides to the headphones were really helpful to a novice like me and made me pay the couple of quid extra to use this company rather_than other larger ones , in short , i got quick registration and payment , emails to let me know when the order was received and dispatched , a punctual delivery and well_packaged items .
Electrical_goods	i couldn ' t ask for more_than that .
Electrical_goods	the lollipop at the bottom of the box is fantastic innovative marketing - whoever thought of that deserves a healthy bonus !

Electrical_goods	they had a lot of foam around the box to make_sure that it wasn ' t damaged even if it fell off the truck !

Electrical_goods	it was a real treat .. the headphones are amazing and the best place ive bought headphones from so far !

Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	ordered on monday_afternoon - expected delivery 0 - 0 weeks , thursday midday got a call that courier will be within an_hour with a parcel , jaw drops to the floor .
Electrical_goods	as usual with digitalrev everything in pristine_condition .
Electrical_goods	the lens itself ( sigma 00 - 00 f0 . 0 ) is fun - f_*** g - tastic , extremely sharp and fairly quick on canon_0d , no_problems with mounting lens hood - there is distinctive click when it catches on , the image quality knocks to the floor even at wide end full open .
Electrical_goods	absolutely a must have if you don ' t mind carrying mid - heavy lens .
Electrical_goods	it goes perfectly in a set with my 00 - 000l , thought the gap between 00 and 00 can be a dis qualifier for many i absolutely can live without it on a crop camera .
Electrical_goods	purchasing using digitalrev was very easy and simple .

Electrical_goods	review of products ;
Electrical_goods	canon_000d - by_far the best £_000 - odd i ' ve spent in my life .
Electrical_goods	despite being a die - hard viewfinder user i ' ve really loved using the live - view mode , and the autofocus in video has really excelled .
Electrical_goods	for all those who turn their noses up at it ' s apsc size and toy - like features , it ' s so small i take it absolutely anywhere , opening up opportunity for amazing snaps which would have been lost when lugging around a bulkier ( however superior ) camera .
Electrical_goods	i took it into college for my last few_days and several friends got to use it .
Electrical_goods	they all , without_fail , fell in love with it , the touchscreen , the joy of using it , ergonomics .
Electrical_goods	i ' m blown_away .
Electrical_goods	00mm 0 . 0 stm ' pancake lens ' -
Electrical_goods	by_far the best accompanying lens for the camera , compliments it ' s form - factor beautifully .
Electrical_goods	great for the ' one camera one lens ' philosophy , if you had to choose just one lens for this cam it would be this .
Electrical_goods	it doesn ' t off - balance the camera when it ' s on the neck - strap , very sharp and fast 0 . 0 aperture .
Electrical_goods	build_quality is 00 / 00 , although i ' m disappointed by the motor noise .
Electrical_goods	compared to the 00 - 00 kit_lens which is actually completely silent and lightning_fast , the 00mm pancake stm motor makes considerably more noise , which is disappointing since i wanted to use it for video , and unavoidable due to it ' s focus - by - wire .
Electrical_goods	very best quality cables and fast delivery !

Electrical_goods	i will_definitely_recommend digital_rev for anyone who are willing to buy " gray market " camera products which saves you decent amount of money when compared to uk prices .
Electrical_goods	i also thought of buying nikon_d0000 ( 0year warranty ) from digital_rev but was able to get a similar deal from another trusted seller who is providing " 0year " seller warranty ( not nikon ) that gives longer peace of mind :) but anyway that ' s a personal choice and will look_forward to buy from digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	the deliver was quick , product as_described .
Electrical_goods	very good service overall .
Electrical_goods	i recently_bought my first juicer from uk juicers and i have to say the service was excellent .
Electrical_goods	i had my juicer within 00_hours ( i had ordered on a bank_holiday ) and in that respect i have no issues_whatsoever with the company .
Electrical_goods	in fact , i am planning to buy my next juicer from them again .
Electrical_goods	the only issue i am having is with the juicer itself .
Electrical_goods	it is the lequip xl and while i am aware that it isn ' t the best in the market , i didn ' t expect it to be the way it is .
Electrical_goods	it produces a lot ( i mean a lot ) of foam and i don ' t like that .
Electrical_goods	i know i have nothing to compare it with , but foam is foam .
Electrical_goods	and i had done a a lot of research before i got this , so i expected a centrifugal juicer to do this , but omg .
Electrical_goods	the pulp is on the wet side ( again , i ' m aware i have nothing to compare it with ), but still ....
Electrical_goods	i ' m happy i have a juicer and i guess its better_than not juicing at all .
Electrical_goods	what i really wanted was the omega 0000 , but my bank_balance was saying ' not just yet love ' , and i made my peace with that which is why i went with the lequip .
Electrical_goods	besides , it is my first juicer ...
Electrical_goods	i will be using uk juicers to get the omega as i have no issues at all with the service .
Electrical_goods	it ' s excellent .
Electrical_goods	ordered the goods on monday , goods delivered tuesday before 00 . 00am .

Electrical_goods	ordering from digitalrev is painfree and simple , products arrive from_hong_kong in 0 - 0 days , without hassle , and there ' s no horrible uk pricing as its nearly direct from the manufactures , i love using digitalrev and they always keep my custom .
Electrical_goods	great communication emailed when item was dispatched a choice of what courrier i would like and arrived fast , as for the product it was as good as listed .
Electrical_goods	im going to keep this review sort and simple and not concentrate too much on the product itself ( canon powershot g00 ), as anyone who is going to purchase this camera would have already done there research and know what this camera is all about , & btw the camera is lovely best image quality and control i have ever_seen on a compact , it is definitely an_alternative to a dslr without the bulk .
Electrical_goods	as for the service from digitalrev , it was absolutely incredible i ordered thursday_night and received the camera monday_morning all the way from_hong_kong to the united_kingdom .
Electrical_goods	everything was in 000_% in order and the product was very well_packed .

Electrical_goods	very quick with processing of order and despatch also .
Electrical_goods	would definitely_recommend to friends .
Electrical_goods	i have been mulling over the idea of ordering from these_guys for about 0 months and i finally did it .
Electrical_goods	and wish i had done so sooner .
Electrical_goods	my canon_00d left hk at 0000 on 0th_may and arrived in the uk at 0000 on the 00th_may .
Electrical_goods	the slowest part of the whole experience was when the uk took over and did what uk does best for its inhabitants , it makes you wait and wait .
Electrical_goods	its delivery date was expected on 00th - 00th_may .
Electrical_goods	i called dhl on saturday as they had it since 0000 on 00th and they said you wont receive it today as its a saturday and missed cut_off ...
Electrical_goods	but they guaranteed it for monday ...
Electrical_goods	it was packaged beautiful and wasn ' t a white box as i was expecting coming from hk but a proper branded canon_00d ..
Electrical_goods	digitalrev are an amazing company and they covered all customs and duty charges .
Electrical_goods	cant_fault you guys and will order again ...
Electrical_goods	camera is now on charge and i am waiting ( impatiently )
Electrical_goods	will explain my experience of dr to you , it ' s worth pointing_out i have used them a few_times , so i will start by saying , if you receive the item you ordered , then you ' re probably going to make a saving on the uk high_street price .
Electrical_goods	cant speak for how the warranty will work out , but if it ' s anything like the customer_service , i wouldn ' t hold your breath !
Electrical_goods	i ordered a rather expensive lens to the tune of £ 0000 and a filter for £_00 .
Electrical_goods	usual order tracking applied and quick delivery .
Electrical_goods	problems started when i opened the box and discovered there wasn ' t a lens in the box .
Electrical_goods	immediately took photos of everything i received and off to their help portal i go .
Electrical_goods	log a case detailing everything i received and uploading photos .
Electrical_goods	get the usual automated " we received your query email " and thought i ' d await a reply .
Electrical_goods	i get a reply the next_day from " jasmin " ( not sure they are using real names ) saying we need to investigate .
Electrical_goods	ok i thought , 0 days_later their still investigating .
Electrical_goods	so i call , i ' m told it ' s with their shipping department ( seems to be a favorite phrase of theirs ) and i " just need to wait " - blood starting to boil , no sign of a replacement or a refund anywhere in sight and out for pocket by £ 0000 .
Electrical_goods	next_day i call again and ask whats_happening , i ' m told " still investigating and that team doesn ' t like to be hassled or pushed " ( i ' m sorry but i don ' t like paying for something and just receiving a very expensive box !)
Electrical_goods	anyway , they told me i needed to speak to dhl , ok i thought , so off to dhl i go , explained to a lovely dhl lady in the uk , she advised that as far as their concerned they have delivered the package they were asked to deliver and that they have completed what they are obliged to do ( fair do ' s i thought , they are just the courier )
Electrical_goods	as i was speaking to the dhl lady she told me i was expecting to receive a camera to the value of £_00 ( what ?!?!
Electrical_goods	noooo !)
Electrical_goods	she looked into it further , and she sussed out what dr do , is deliberately devalue the order and order contents to dhl so they don ' t get hit with import_tax / duty .
Electrical_goods	however , look at the website and they say they pay for import_duty and insurance directly with dhl , this just isnt true .
Electrical_goods	and because they have declared a lower value to dhl , they will only insure the contents to the value which was declared .
Electrical_goods	anyway , back off to dr i go , dr are still continuing to blame dhl , in fairness , dhl have done everything they can and have been sooo much more helpful than dr , dr are just not interested and i keep on getting fobbed_off with excuses and each time i speak to them it ' s still at " investigating " but no sign of a refund or replacement in sight .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve no doubt they are hoping i ' ll just go away quietly , it ' s worth pointing_out ive ordered previous items from dr and always recieved , but it ' s when you hit issues you need to be prepared to fight and then some .
Electrical_goods	unfortunately for me i ' m still fighting , i suspect because they are other side of the world , it ' s not as if i can just turn_up at their offices and kick a stink up so they just dont really give you much time of day / help or confidence in their trying to resolve my issue .
Electrical_goods	i ' m not saying dont use dr , i ' m saying , be aware of the duty import ( if customs open your package , they will see its been devalued on the paper work by dr ) and if you have a faulty or missing item how do you get your money back or a replacement shipped .
Electrical_goods	i ' m now going down the route of disputing the transaction with by bank , i used by debit_card to pay , if you are going to buy from these people , please_please_please use a credit_card as you get more cover then a debit_card .
Electrical_goods	the delivery time was incredibly quick ; 0 days to bristol , uk !
Electrical_goods	the product was well - packaged and was exactly as_described .

Electrical_goods	it arrived on my desk in leeds from_hong_kong in just 00_hours .
Electrical_goods	unbelievable !
Electrical_goods	on top of that , it was expertly packed .
Electrical_goods	if it was dropped by the courier it would have probably bounced back into his hands it had that much bubble_wrap around it .
Electrical_goods	if only everyone took this much care in shipping their items .
Electrical_goods	sceptics have no fear .
Electrical_goods	i couldn ' t have asked for a better service .
Electrical_goods	i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend digitalrev to anyone and will_definitely use them again .
Electrical_goods	very impressed and will_continue to use digitalrev for the majority of my camera_equipment .
Electrical_goods	we ordered the samsung_galaxy_s0 in october_0000 - as soon as it arrived and ever since it has rebooted every 0 or 0 minutes .
Electrical_goods	digital_rev ' s customer_service was appalling .
Electrical_goods	we had to pay to courier it back to hong_kong to be ' fixed ' only to find out that after a month and a half when it was returned to us , they had done no such thing .
Electrical_goods	they couldn ' t even give us a technical report as to what they did to the phone .
Electrical_goods	needless to say we are currently fighting for a refund , but with no success .

Electrical_goods	the item arrived in the uk from germany in 0 days , so can ' t fault the delivery speed .
Electrical_goods	however , the mounting bolts that came with the brackets are too short to reach the vesa screw holes on my panasonic viera tv .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve had to go to my local diy shop and find new bolts to fit ( which aren ' t cheap ).
Electrical_goods	expressed an urgent order and got it to me next_day .
Electrical_goods	very happy with them .

Electrical_goods	i ordered a bundle package from the uk website .
Electrical_goods	a canon s000 + underwater housing + care package .
Electrical_goods	the price was the best i found on the net after doing a lot of hunting_around .
Electrical_goods	the reviews gave me so much confidence placing an order with digitalrev and the fact the the shipping with free and the price still lower_than any other site i was amazed to find that my package was being sent from_hong_kong !

Electrical_goods	package was well wrapped and the product is great .
Electrical_goods	i would recommend this company to anybody and would definitely use them again .

Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	thanks digitalrev !
Electrical_goods	:)
Electrical_goods	have bought several products from pixmania , including cameras , phones & laptops , and delivery is always fine , as is payment etc .
Electrical_goods	would always recommend to friends & family looking to purchase electronics , as i know that they won ' t have any_issues .
Electrical_goods	great selection , reliable delivery ( i used standard ), and excellent prices .
Electrical_goods	a phenomenally priced package with some killer gear .
Electrical_goods	really is a wonderful site and the delivery was smooth and perfect .
Electrical_goods	well wrapped too .
Electrical_goods	ordered a nikon 0000 and sigma lens on sunday_evening .
Electrical_goods	i had the bubble_wrapped package in my hands by friday_morning .
Electrical_goods	considering it came from_hong_kong to the uk i was very impressed .
Electrical_goods	the camera itself is perfect and the price was much cheaper_than competitors even with the current cash back offer .
Electrical_goods	would definitely use again .
Electrical_goods	it was fast delivery , great ordering updates .
Electrical_goods	i needed to change something on my order address and it was done by submitting a form quickly .
Electrical_goods	the websites status tracking is superb !
Electrical_goods	after having a bad_experience once while shopping with digitalrev , i had decided tyhat i won ' t be coming_back anymore .
Electrical_goods	to my surprise and delight , kathy , the customer_services associate got in touch with me and reassured me that i will not have to face any more grief .
Electrical_goods	and indeed i did not face more issues .
Electrical_goods	she helped_me sort out the problems and overcome them while shopping with dr .
Electrical_goods	she has been prompt and crisp with her communication as against some others who would beat around the bush .
Electrical_goods	it has been indeed a wonderful experience shopping with .
Electrical_goods	with this i have been left with no option other than to take back my own words and rephrasing them as i will be back with digitalrev !!!!!
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	lindy produce some great products which are very durable and get the job_done .
Electrical_goods	the whole range of products that they supply have served me well over the years .
Electrical_goods	very satisfied customer and will_definitely continue buying their products .
Electrical_goods	i had read all the positive_reviews for digitalrev before i bought my canon_000d and i was wondering_if i would have had the same experience .
Electrical_goods	now without making it too repetitive i am going to agree as yes it was a good service , the camera came intact and great value as it was the cheapest price i could find on both the high_street and internet ( i spent months looking ) but what struck me the most was that the package came even earlier_than it was supposed to !
Electrical_goods	( a day early )
Electrical_goods	extremely competitive price , faster_than_expected delivery , products as ordered - what more can you ask for !
Electrical_goods	first of all the price was fantastic !
Electrical_goods	00 £ cheaper_than any over website for a canon_000d .
Electrical_goods	fantastic costumer_service , i gave them a call about a few things for example import_duty ( which there isn ' t any ) and they where friendly pleasant and very helpful !
Electrical_goods	.
Electrical_goods	the delivery is fantastic aswell , free and came in 0 days from_hong_kong to london with full dhl_tracking .
Electrical_goods	the packaging was brilliant , i would feel_safe chucking the box down a flight of stairs with the camera in it .
Electrical_goods	it was that well_packaged !
Electrical_goods	and the camera it ' s self works_perfectly i am very pleased !
Electrical_goods	hats of to digital_rev !
Electrical_goods	perfect !
Electrical_goods	the site was friendly enough and the prices were good , but what made them stand out was that when i opened my new amp ( yamaha rxa - 0000 ) they had made their own 0 page or so a0 booklet to go with it to help with setup and explain all the basics of home av and other related things ( speaker placement , calibration , etc ).
Electrical_goods	i didn ' t need the document , but the fact they ' d gone_through this extra level of effort ( and that it was genuinely well written and amusing ) ranks them highly in my book .
Electrical_goods	i did a lot of research before selecting an established uk brand of vhf mics .
Electrical_goods	despite large sales , i was unimpressed so i sold them on ..
Electrical_goods	i then widened my scope and found the auna fu - 0 - w vhf mics online .
Electrical_goods	i was originally attracted to the white finish option ( we have a white baby grand piano in the club ) .. so i ordered them .
Electrical_goods	delivery was quick and the packing excellent .
Electrical_goods	on testing , one of the mics was superb and the other was very muffled .
Electrical_goods	one phone call to hi -_fi tower in the uk instigated a quick search for a replacement mic but in the end , a whole new system was shipped out .
Electrical_goods	this one was perfect .
Electrical_goods	my only_niggle is that the plug is european ( with an adapter supplied ) so it ' s not neat and the adapter cable is only one metre long .. so it doesn ' t reach the floor .
Electrical_goods	on the positive side , the mics use 0 x aa batteries and they seem to last for ages .
Electrical_goods	i bought re - chargeable duracell batteries with a charger so the cost savings are obvious .
Electrical_goods	the switches on the mics offer easy operation .
Electrical_goods	off ..
Electrical_goods	standby and on .
Electrical_goods	simples !
Electrical_goods	but in summary , for the money , this dual vhf radio mic system offers the best sound quality i have ever heard .
Electrical_goods	very friendly service , available by phone before i ordered to answer a couple of questions .
Electrical_goods	headphones arrived the day after i ordered them , really pleased .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve ordered two computer setups from pixmania in the past 00 months and on both_occasions both were very reasonably price and were delivered on time if not even before i was expecting them , site is a breeze to use .
Electrical_goods	also they are one of the only online stored that i have shopped from that offer next_day delivery to ireland , the first order i placed was on 00nd of december_0000 and i had it on the 00rd which is amazing considering the time of year .
Electrical_goods	all i have to say is i would recommend them to friends and family alike .
Electrical_goods	products much cheaper_than in the uk ; was dispatched almost_instantly and had great tracking the whole way to point of delivery .
Electrical_goods	no_complaints ; will_definitely use again .
Electrical_goods	fast service and no_problems receiving exactly_what i ordered .
Electrical_goods	despite ordering from across the pond , the air mail arrived quickly and i ' m enjoying the accessories that were shipped .
Electrical_goods	they even included a chupa chup with my package , which i thought was a nice_touch .
Electrical_goods	as a leeds college of music student , and regular gigging musician ( keyboard player ) i was looking to broaden my musical horizons by buying some quality monitors to mix recordings with ( and go in to a more producer style role ).
Electrical_goods	as soon as i entered the store i got a great vibe from the staff and the layout .
Electrical_goods	i was greeted as i went in , but i wasn ' t treated like some easily fob - able beginner ( which is a real gripe of mine when i normally enter music shops ).
Electrical_goods	i was allowed to look round in my own time , and when i asked to hear some monitors the guy there even set me up three pairs of speakers to put against each other , and when i explained my needs to them they immediately pointed me in the direction of the best value , yet quality monitors - over the more fashionable lower quality ones i was looking at .
Electrical_goods	needless to say i bought a pair of yamaha hs00 ' s that day , and i would buy all my other equipment from there , as this is a company that i truly feel i can trust in .
Electrical_goods	plus to top it off they offered me student_discount , i didn ' t even need to ask .
Electrical_goods	really great guys !
Electrical_goods	thanks !
Electrical_goods	!
Electrical_goods	item arrived within a couple of days .
Electrical_goods	amazing price as compared to elsewhere .
Electrical_goods	very well_packaged .
Electrical_goods	would recommend and use again !
Electrical_goods	had reservations_about using them as was not familiar , but couldn ' t find the item reasonably_priced anywhere_else .
Electrical_goods	i ordered it , had good communication , rapid dispatch and well_packaged .
Electrical_goods	would definitely use again .
Electrical_goods	very fast_shipping , and the lens i bought was extremely well_packaged and arrived within 0 days , from honk kong , to ireland !
Electrical_goods	second time i have used digital_rev and i will be back !
Electrical_goods	have needed something like this for years , love it .
Electrical_goods	warm the house up for when you get home !
Electrical_goods	boil the kettle in the morning from bed !
Electrical_goods	great customer_service too !
Electrical_goods	finding a store in leeds that supplied and had an alesis dm00 drum_kit in store proved nearly impossible .
Electrical_goods	but the production_room not only had them in , they guaranteed to match the best price in the u . k .
Electrical_goods	however , in the same week as i was looking to buy the kit , another music shop were offering a fully equipped bundle .
Electrical_goods	this didn ' t phase the guys at production_room .
Electrical_goods	true to their word , not only did they match the bundle price they also provided better equipment with the bundle .
Electrical_goods	what more could i ask for ?
Electrical_goods	oh_yeah , even with the convenient parking right outside the front_door , the sales staff helped_me with it to the car !
Electrical_goods	a grade , 0 star service .
Electrical_goods	production_room is the only place i will shop for all my music needs now .
Electrical_goods	first off - many people have mentioned that there is an_email that ' s being sent out and if you select that you had good service they direct you here and if not then it directs you to them .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve not had this email yet but would like to review them here honestly .
Electrical_goods	i purchased a gopro hero 0 black edition from them .
Electrical_goods	saved_myself £_00 - 00 !
Electrical_goods	i didn ' t realize they it was a grey import until i told a friend about the website who then told me it was .
Electrical_goods	i never really paid much attention to the site as i enjoyed watching their videos on youtube and also seen these reviews about them .
Electrical_goods	i tried to cancel it but couldn ' t because of the status it was at .
Electrical_goods	it advised to contact customer_services but they ' re open from 0am until 00am gmt which isn ' t ideal .
Electrical_goods	i left it .
Electrical_goods	i placed the order at around midnight of 00 / 00june .
Electrical_goods	i received an_email the next_day to say it ' s been dispatched .
Electrical_goods	coming from_hong_kong i imagined that it ' s going to take at_least the timescale they advised which was roughly 0 days .
Electrical_goods	on the morning of the 00 / june i had checked the tracking_info from dhl and it was in the country already !
Electrical_goods	after checking again it advised it was with the courier company and shortly_after it was advised attempted delivery was made .
Electrical_goods	barely 0 working_days ?
Electrical_goods	wow !
Electrical_goods	you must_admit this is impressive .
Electrical_goods	i got the item .
Electrical_goods	it has a slip in it from digitalrev which is a warranty card .
Electrical_goods	i noticed on their site that they provide a warranty .
Electrical_goods	this is great news however it isn ' t ideal because of getting quotes for repairs or having to send the unit back to hong_kong however it does gives piece of mind .
Electrical_goods	i ' ve had a play around with the product and it ' s pretty good .
Electrical_goods	it ' s genuine as i did a software update and had to enter my product serial into the gopro website which verified it .
Electrical_goods	the package was also very well wrapped - loads of bubble_wrap .
Electrical_goods	i can ' t fault the service received from digitalrev and dhl .
Electrical_goods	i hope that whoever is reading this is able to make a suitable decision on whether they would purchase from digitalrev but if i can get some cracking deals again then i most_likely would order again .
Electrical_goods	people have good and bad_experiences with every company out there but most of the time you don ' t hear about all the good stories .
Electrical_goods	thank_you digitalrev and dhl .
Electrical_goods	i ordered a nikon lens very late in the day - a week before_christmas and it arrived in no time at all .
Electrical_goods	the package was traceable , too and arrived and well padded .
Electrical_goods	thank_you for such great service !
Electrical_goods	fab prices , excellent services , fast delivery time . good commomication through out all .
Electrical_goods	many_thanks
Electrical_goods	s . e
Electrical_goods	ordered my canon_00d thursday midday and it arrived on the monday !
Electrical_goods	very happy , no_problems , would recommend .
Electrical_goods	so i was a bit_skeptical_about ordering an import because of the warranty not being valid , but after_discovering digitalrev supply their own i thought i would take the plunge .
Electrical_goods	i ordered over a weekend period so expected some delay , but got the package on the monday before 00am which was impressive seeing as it had come from_hong_kong and was free .
Electrical_goods	you can track your goods via dhl ' s website too , helping those eager beavers out there , oh and no import charge either .
Electrical_goods	after unwrapping what seemed like an entire roll of bubble_wrap ( always useful to have ) i found my lens box with not so much as a dent on a corner , obviously inside was my lens and we all lived happily ever after from then on !
Electrical_goods	i got all of my equipment form production_room and i really enjoy coming in and talking to the staff , they always know what they are selling and will give the best advice possible .
Electrical_goods	and i really like the chat option online .
Electrical_goods	ordered at around 0pm and received my delivery early the next_day .
Electrical_goods	fantastic service !
Electrical_goods	this company really cares_about its customers fast response to all emails , great delivery times and carefull packaging .
Electrical_goods	i wish them all well and reccomend them to everyone .
Electrical_goods	0 moths ago i bought a really good pa system from hifi - tower .
Electrical_goods	less_than 0months later it stopped_working properly ( possibly my fault for having it too loud ).
Electrical_goods	i let them know about the problem i had and they gave me a variety of different_ways they could deal with the problem .
Electrical_goods	they replied to every_single one of my emails .
Electrical_goods	they said they would replace my old speaker system with a new pair but later informed me that they did not have any left in stock but immediately returned all of my money to me without me having to ask them .
Electrical_goods	i felt that they were a very good , honest and trusting company and felt that i had been treated very fairly .
Electrical_goods	eventually i decided to spend the money on a more_expensive system and they gave me a very nice discount to apologise for the inconvenience .
Electrical_goods	overall they do sell very good quality speakers and their customer_service is out of this world !
Electrical_goods	great customer_service .
Electrical_goods	fast delivery - it took just a couple of days to arrive .
Electrical_goods	will order again .
Electrical_goods	well_done digitalrev .
Electrical_goods	i am very surprised : i read all these reviews saying they delivered within 0 days etc .
Electrical_goods	i ordered a camera on 00 march and received notification that it is dispatched and expected to arrive on 0 april .
Electrical_goods	i thought that ' s a joke but it isn ' t .
Electrical_goods	i am really pissed_off as it was not mentioned to me that delivery will take almost a month !
Electrical_goods	i wrote to them and complaint and was ignored .
Electrical_goods	not acceptable in my view !
Electrical_goods	went for next_day delivery and items arrived on time and in good order , including a lollipop that i gave to my girlfriend .
Electrical_goods	will check here first for my next headphones order .
Electrical_goods	i recently_bought a nikon d000 from digital_rev .
Electrical_goods	i was a bit_unsure at first , but read loads of reviews and decided to go for it .
Electrical_goods	it came within about 0 days of ordering .
Electrical_goods	i saved £_000 by not buying it in the uk .
Electrical_goods	there were no_hidden_costs or extra import taxes etc .
Electrical_goods	the box came well_packaged , with layers of bubble_wrap .
Electrical_goods	i will_definitely be importing with digitalrev again .
Electrical_goods	delivery was free and arrived on the third working day from order .
Electrical_goods	friendly , quick , responsive staff and excellent product .
Electrical_goods	recieved a text_message and an e_- mail when my order had shipped telling_me when it would arrive .
Electrical_goods	would definitely use again .
Electrical_goods	trustworthy , professional company .
Electrical_goods	< 0 < 0 < 0
Electrical_goods	unmatched customer_service .
Electrical_goods	the best i ' ve seen in my life .
Electrical_goods	fast , reliable and keep you updated all the time .
Electrical_goods	i was in doubt about ordering some speakers from this company .
Electrical_goods	i contacted someone within the company and they reassured me that the speakers are good quality so i ordered and the person whom i wrote to was correct and very helpful
Electrical_goods	overall i will rate 0_stars ( more if i could )
Electrical_goods	i will buy again !
Electrical_goods	the item arrived the day after i ordered it .
Electrical_goods	the customer_service was very helpful and i got all the information that i needed .
Electrical_goods	i can only recommend this company to others .

Electrical_goods	fast delivery , great price , very well_packaged , and considering it came from_hong_kong the delivery was amazingly fast .
Electrical_goods	they give you a tracking_number and it is easy to use and can track your package all the way and request a txt when your parcel has been delivered !
Electrical_goods	keep up the good work .
Electrical_goods	specifically wanted some krk vxt0 monitors and stands and dv000 were sold out .
Electrical_goods	found this website ( they need to advertise it more !)
Electrical_goods	and i asked if they would price_match thomann ' s cheaper price for these monitors and they did without any hassle ( unlike most other_companies ).
Electrical_goods	ordered over the phone which took 00mins with a very polite woman the other end .
Electrical_goods	dpd ( the delivery company they use ) gave me an_hour time_slot for next_day delivery , which they turned_up in ( love dpd ).
Electrical_goods	all in all , first time ordering from them was immense , would use them again , dv000 always seem to be out of stock on what i want unlike these_guys .
Electrical_goods	i will edit this review if the speakers go faulty or anything and let everyone know how they dealt_with it :)
Electrical_goods	james .

Cell_phone_Recycling	none of the reviews were good , all where people who had sent the phones but no money and no contact .

Cell_phone_Recycling	discovered them through money saving expert .....
Cell_phone_Recycling	the paid the most , really quick and and efficent , and kept there word on the value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant
Cell_phone_Recycling	somehow my phone was overlooked and i had to chase for payment a couple of days_later , but they responded within hours and sorted it all out the same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	second time i ' ve used these_guys and they ' ve always been great .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the easiest service i have ever used :
Cell_phone_Recycling	typed in the phone model and got an instant price
Cell_phone_Recycling	filled in a form ( pre_- filled the second time you use the service )
Cell_phone_Recycling	printed the postage label
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted the phone
Cell_phone_Recycling	the money was in my account within 00_hours .
Cell_phone_Recycling	flawless , and so much_easier than ebay !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent them my blackberry_curve 0000 that was , aside from a couple of minor_scratches to the case , as good as new and in full working order .
Cell_phone_Recycling	envirofone told me that i would receive £_00 . 00 for my phone and so i sent it to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	shortly_after , i received an_email_saying that they had tested my phone and were only able to give me £_00 . 00 as they claimed my phone had a missing button .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i asked them to send the phone back to me as i was 000_% sure that , prior to me sending it , the phone had no buttons missing or even any loose ones , plus i ' d wrapped it thickly in bubble_wrap and such before sending it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	upon_receiving my phone back from them , i inspected it to find the camera button on the side of the phone had been completely removed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this button had shown no signs of being loose or even damaged before i sent the phone ; it had a rubber cover that was seamlessly fit into the phone ' s rubber rim , but the phone was returned to me with a perfectly cut rectangle where the button used to be .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely not recommend envirofone to anyone , it seems they ' ll do anything to give you less money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really fast service , recieved the freepost_bag the next working day sent it saturday and recieved the money in my bank_account on the tuesday_afternoon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really pleased and very easy simple service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great stuff !
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent it off and within a couple of days a cheque arrived through my door .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick easy and fast service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely a good company to trust and the money was good
Cell_phone_Recycling	it would have been quicker for me to request a cheque and get that processed by my bank !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s 0000 - how is it taking 00 days to complete an online payment ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	telling customers that bank_transfers are the fastest method of payment is false_advertising .
Cell_phone_Recycling	' we ' re really busy in january ' is not acceptable - you know you ' re going to be busy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	employ more resource .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s not rocket_science .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d be less upset if , before i ' d posted my ipad , you ' d told me there was a delay in payments .
Cell_phone_Recycling	still , i ' ve got until the 00th of the month now to review you all over the place ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	checked online to get the best price for my iphone_0s and although enviro phone weren ' t the highest price , they had the best reviews .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would rather go with enviro phone at a lower_price but have the trust that i will get the money !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	super easy to process and they send full instructions .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you can check the progress online and on the same day they received my phone , i had an_email promising me the price they offered .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was transferred super_fast .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' m pleased ( but not shocked ) to say that my experience this time was just as good - from initial_enquiry to payment was 0 days .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i only wish i had more phones to sell as i know where i would be sending them too .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thankyou very much !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used enviro phone on many occasions and would highly_recommend the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s fast , easy and hassle_free with most transactions completes within a week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my experience using mazumamobile stands out as being one of the smoothest business transactions i have ever_encountered .
Cell_phone_Recycling	their website was incredibly easy to use ; the terms and conditions were written in plain_english , with no_hidden ' stings ' or catches .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once i had agreed to sell my old handse , t an envelope arrived the next_day , containing a pre_- paid postage bag and fool proof instructions .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the day after posting i received an_email from mazuma , confirming_receipt of the handset , with a further email a short while later confirming that payment had been credited to my specified account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fantastic service , that can ' t be_faulted .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i know that there is plethora of other_sites offering a similar service , and some that may offer a few_quid ( single figures ) over the price quoted with mazuma ; however , i chose them due to word - of - mouth recommendations and also from checking independent review sites such as this .
Cell_phone_Recycling	all in all i am very happy to have a reasonable sum of disposable income for a 0 year_old handset that i have been itching to get_rid of since the first month i had it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend this company to anyone in a flash .
Cell_phone_Recycling	three days was all it took to turn my unloved nokia into cleared funds .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s such a shame that i love my new handset ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	effortless process , took my slightly worn iphone_0gs and paid a very reasonable amount - more_than i expected .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent on monday , was paid by tuesday - no_quibbles .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after seeing the mazuma advertisment , i thought i ' d go on the website & see what it was all about , i found the 0 old_phones i had lying_around at home on a list which also tells you how much they ' ll pay you ( you even get paid for non - working mobiles ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	didn ' t believe what was advertised because quite_frankly its ' s hard to trust most companies in the u . k through personal experiences ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	anyway , decided what the hell , never going to use the phones again so i put the imei numbers of both mobiles on the website , within a few_days i got an acceptance letter & a bag to put the phones in , i sent the phones & a few_days after that i recieved a cheque for the amount they offered ... nice .
Cell_phone_Recycling	still_haven ' t cashed the cheque but i would refer mazuma to anyone ... btw all this took no more_than 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i strongly_recommend fonebank . com if you want to sell on a previously loved phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was very easy to do - i selected my phone model and printed out an order form .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i packaged up my phone and posted it with the order form , 0 days after fonebank received my phone i had money in my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	good good good good good good good good good good goodgood good
Cell_phone_Recycling	not as high a price as some other_sites but guaranteed amount paid and very quickly the money was in my bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very easy , efficient and smooth from start to finish with good communication .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant company , ill never use anybody_else if i sell another mobile phone . sold my nokia n00 0gb for a staggering £_000 , i couldnt_believe the price i was offered and withing 0 days , i had posted the phone and the money was in the bank !
Cell_phone_Recycling	my friend sold his n00 to envirophone and was offered £_00 for it , bearing in mind it worked_perfectly as did my phone , and once he sent it off he received a cheque about 0 days_later for £_00 !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	they said it was scratched heavily so wasnt worth £_00 , absolute_rip_off_merchants . all in all , if your selling a mobile phone , use mazuma , and dont forget to use quidco for an extra 00p cashback !
Cell_phone_Recycling	a day after i requested for the free post bag , in came through in first_class mail .
Cell_phone_Recycling	went to the post_office and the next_day they recieved it and checked it by 0pm and a few hours_later they submitted the cheque and it came this morning .

Cell_phone_Recycling	they send me a prepaid pack next_day and within 00_hours of me posting it , i received a confirmation and payment straight into my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely flawless !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will highly_recommend mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	after a day walking through the christmas masses only to be told by cex that they would only give me half the value priced on their web_site i was dubious when mazuma made me such a great offer plus didn ' t want the box , charger and accesories and i got to keep my sd_card bonus !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they sent me the envelope within a day of which i sent back at 0pm by 00am the next_day they had recieved it tested it and confirmed transfer of the money to my account what more can you ask for .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will most certainly be using them again happy days !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma was quick and effective in all area ' s of the process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they are great at answering any_questions through their brilliant email customer care team and my payment was made in just hours them reviving the mobile !
Cell_phone_Recycling	great job mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you want to sell your old phone i would use fonebank !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i did i found it easy and it was very quick and staight forward and they offered the most amount of money as have every time iv had a quote from them
Cell_phone_Recycling	there are many different companys online now offering a service simuler to mazumamobile however i would stick to mazumamobile for its quick reliable service i would definitely_recommend to friends and family
Cell_phone_Recycling	went on the website and confirmed which phones i had ( 0 x n00 0gb ) and jiffy_bag arrived the following_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted the items on a saturday_morning and by the monday had an_email_confirming they had the phones and later on that day another email to say the order was complete .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was made later on that day with another email to confirm this .
Cell_phone_Recycling	overall the service was very quick and easy and i feel i definately got top price for my phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very pleased with their service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	what a great company , the customer_service has easily surpassed all other_companies i have seemed customer_service from this year .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick and easy , once the satchel arrived you just put the phones in and less then a week_later the money was in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the second time i have gone_through mazuma and this experience was just as smooth as easy as the the first .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had the postage package sent out to me which i used to send my phone to them to complete my end of the deal .
Cell_phone_Recycling	within a couple of hours , the transaction to my bank_account was confirmed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have sold you 0 phones in the past_year , the last 0 being a friends .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this time i thought i would get quotes from other phone_recycling websites but you not only came up with the best deal but you are the only phone_recycling site that will pay you even if the phone is not working which myfriends phone was not .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks again and i will only ever use your site for phone_recycling .
Cell_phone_Recycling	also now you have added a bac payments system the payments are alot quicker it doesn ' t take more_than 0 working_days to go through the whole_process of selling a phone to you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recommend mazuma to any body who has a phone which the no_longer need or no_longer works , if they don ' t have internet access then i offer to do it for them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	more_than happy to recommend mazuma , they dealt_with my " non - working " iphone with speed and efficiency .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received my cheque in the post within days of posting my mobile !
Cell_phone_Recycling	compared to topdollar mobile , i am still_waiting having posted my old phone to them a week_ago !
Cell_phone_Recycling	well_done mazuma , i will be recommending you to my friends and relatives .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very pleased with the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy will_definitely use again
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used envirofone every time i have needed to sell my old handsets .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the process is very easy and quick and i find they always offer competitive_prices .

Cell_phone_Recycling	it was really easy to do , the freepost_bag turned_up very fast , posted it and received emails keeping me up to date then my money came through v fast !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	really easy to use and really fast payment ( i posted my phone and the money was in my account the next_day ) i am very happy would definitely use mazuma again and recommend to my friends .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i also like that this is a charity organisation to help people in the developing world .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good job .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use this service again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma has a very simple , easy to use website that makes it great for trading in your old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the delivery bag and money / vouchers are sent out really quickly and you get an_email_confirming each_step of the way so you know whats_going on with your phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	for all the phones we have traded in so far mazuma have offered the highest price compared to the other recycling websites and we also really like the option of recieving the money in argos_vouchers - you also get a bit extra if you opt for vouchers instead of cash .
Cell_phone_Recycling	overall they offer a very very effective fast service without any complaints !
Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely be using them the next time i upgrade !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	they ' re very quick and delivering exactly_what they say .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they are helpful and maintain contact from start to finish .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend and would use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my iphone_0g to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i requested a postage pack and it was with me the very next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent the phone via special delivery so to ensure that it got there ( with insurance !)
Cell_phone_Recycling	and was paid almost instantaneously upon_receipt of the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would highly_recommend mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my experience was a pleasure !
Cell_phone_Recycling	stuff arrived through the post the next_day and when i was late sending my phone they gave me the option of extending the time with no extra_cost .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the cheque for my phone arrived about 0 days after i sent it off !
Cell_phone_Recycling	fantastic !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a bit_worried_about sending my mobile off , so i thought i would use mazuma_mobile because they seem to have a lot of adverts on the tv so i thought they must be a good company !
Cell_phone_Recycling	and they really past my expectations !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i orded my selling pack on boxing_day so i thought it would take a few weeks with it being xmas , but my order was approved the day after boxing_day and my pack arrived the day after that .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone and my vouchers arrived a few_days_later !
Cell_phone_Recycling	with mazuma the only thing you have to worry_about is what to spend the money on !
Cell_phone_Recycling	great company i am going to use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i just need to find some old_mobiles now ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	after purchasing a new phone i decided to look_into selling my old_mobile phone and was happy to accept an offer to exchange the phone for £_000 by cheque from mazuma_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i requested they send me the relevant documents which i received less_than 00_hours_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i immediately posted my phone in the envelope which they provided and waited_patiently .
Cell_phone_Recycling	over a week passed and i heard_nothing more from mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i checked my account on their website which stated ‘ awaiting delivery ’ which i found quite worrying so i called them and they confirmed they were still_waiting for the phone to be delivered but i was told it could take up to 00 working_days so i waited about another 0 weeks and still heard_nothing .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i called them again and they confirmed they had still not received it but emailed me a form for claiming lost postage from royal_mail .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i filled in the form then got a reply a few weeks_later
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am extremely upset and angry with this situation , firstly that my item has gone_missing and i strongly suspect it has been stolen somewhere along the chain of delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was told that i should have sent it by recorded_delivery , but why should i ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	i thought royal_mail was a well respected and integral part of our economy and infrastructure which could be trusted to deliver my item safely .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have both sent and received many items for years now and have never had a reason to doubt the royal_mail .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have also sent a phone to mazuma_mobile and received money from them before so i had no reason not to trust them at that point either .
Cell_phone_Recycling	besides which , sending an item by recorded_delivery only shows that you posted an item on a certain_date and would certainly not stop the item from being stolen anywhere on its journey .
Cell_phone_Recycling	what was my compensation for this ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 first_class stamps to the value of about £ 0 !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am most unhappy as this still leaves me out of pocket by around £_000 which is owing to me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	incidentally i have also experienced another incident in the last_week or so with royal_mail who were given the responsibility of delivering my xbox_000 console , my christmas_present that my girlfriend ordered for me from a third_party retailer on amazon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	royal_mail were supposed to deliver the item to my home address of 00 queenswood road but instead delivered it to number 00 fen grove , the road adjacent to mine .
Cell_phone_Recycling	furthermore , whoever delivered the item saw there was no one in and left the item on the doorstep all day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	luckily the residents were honest and knocked at my door at around 0 . 00 pm that evening to hand me the £_000 xbox .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i could not understand the mix_up as my name and address were clearly printed on the front .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i suspect it was simply gross incompetence of the person delivering the xbox .
Cell_phone_Recycling	these incidents have made me lose all faith in both royal_mail and mazuma_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will not be using mazuma_mobile services anymore and will certainly not be recommending them to any of my friends .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will also be a lot more reluctant to trust royal_mail in delivering my post !
Cell_phone_Recycling	full_amount paid same day that they received my phone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was really easy , they sent me a box to put the phone in , i sent it and a week_later the money was in my account !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website was easy to use and the price offered was good didnt have to worry_about charger or original_packaging .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to use and quick payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cheers mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	completed all required info on website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent special delivery as 0 phones worth £_000 , cost £ 0 to send but worth it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent on monday , received tuesday_morning .
Cell_phone_Recycling	bank_transfer tuesday_afternoon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so simple , so quick !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ll admit .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i did have reservations_about the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	friends were full of advice ( unsolicited , and no experience of actually using mazuma ), but i decided to take a chance .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i applied online , got my pack through the post the next_day , i packaged my phone following the instructions and sent it off special delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was expecting to get emails the next_day giving me a " revised_offer " once they has my phone as a " ransom " , but nope .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got an_email_saying it has been received , another saying processing and then another , the same day saying order accepted and that my chosen method of payment ( argos_voucher ) would be with me shortly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it arrived at 00am the next morning .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had no_problems using the voucher at all , and now my old phone is now a shiny_new games console for my son .
Cell_phone_Recycling	literally couldn ' t be more pleased with the service from beginning to end , and have already_recommended mazuma to friends and family .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve sent four old_phones now , ranging_from £ 0 ( old_school nokia ) and £_00 ( galaxy_s0 ), pack sent out quickly , email confirmation as soon as the phone gets there - money in the bank within two days , can ' t say_fairer than that !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i could have got more ( 00 - 00 %) selling privately ... but simply couldn ' t be bothered !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve run out of phones , but would use them again definitely .
Cell_phone_Recycling	adam
Cell_phone_Recycling	i tracked my order at 00 . 00 with royal_mail and was informed by them that it had not yet been received by mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	an_hour later i received an_email off mazuma informing_me that my phone had arrived and been processed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a couple of hours_later i received a second email informing_me that the money would be in my account by midnight , so as soon as i arrived home i checked my balance and sure enough my money was in .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it took less_than half a day from them receiving my phone to me having the money in bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	absoultely incredible service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will be recomending them to anyone who will listen !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick to despatch the free delivery envelope & also to transfer the money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i liked that i could track the exact progress of everything as well .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone by special delivery on tuesday , arrived with them around 00 :_00am after which i received an_email telling_me it had arrived .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then received another email at 00 : 00 , stating the phone had been processed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	then received another email at 00 : 00 , stating payment had been made directly into my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then checked my account balance and sure enough the money was there .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not the top price quoted but i had heard terrible things about the company that did quote the top price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	well worth going with mazuma , the price they quoted was the price they paid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was told 0 expect delivery of payment 0 - 0 working_days after the phone was received , to my sunrise the cheque fell through the door 0 days after posting the phone , i could of got more money from other_websites but no more_than £ 0 and i have used mazuma b0 even the last time i used them payment was quick , can ' t fault them so far , would definitely_recommend 0 *
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am very impressed with the service provided .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was sent instantly as promised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service , would use again and would def_recommend !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick and simple and the best thing is that the money was in my account within 0 day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	valued my mobile , had a great valuation .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the freepost_envelope was here straight_away !
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my mobile to mazuma and had the cheque straight_away too !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	you know when you think " they can ' t be that good ".
Cell_phone_Recycling	well they can !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my mobile to them 0st_class recorded .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received an_email two days_later confirming they had received my phone and were testing it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	moments later got an_email_confirming it had passed_testing and that they were processing the payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the payment was there within 0 hours .
Cell_phone_Recycling	what more can you say ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cannot_believe_how quick they turned around the payment time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	much_quicker and much_better_than competitors ( that includes experiences with competitors ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	you would expect there to be a catch , they don ' t offer as good prices ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	wrong !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they offered as good , if not better_than , others in the mobile recycling field .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fantastic service guys , keep up the good work !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phone ( special delivery ) on the saturday and by monday lunch time , i received an_email to say that the money had been transfered into my bank_account .

Cell_phone_Recycling	all went_smoothly and i was over the moon with how much i got and it was paid straight into my bank , now that ' s what i call efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma x
Cell_phone_Recycling	this site gave me the most money for the phone and were up front with how much they were going to give .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they also would not charge if they had to return the phone for some reason , which is not true of other_sites .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was transferred the day they received the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	all_round great service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	im glad i found this website ,
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was about to post my phone on ebay but luckily i found this .

Cell_phone_Recycling	00_minutes after that , i received an_email to say that my order was complete and a cheque was being dispatched that day .

Cell_phone_Recycling	it would have been even quicker_than that had i opted to have the money paid directly into my bank !!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve already_recommended mazuma to a friend !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was looking all over the web to try and find the highest price a company would by my used phone and out of them all moneyforyourphone . com was the highest price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they sent me a free post bag i could send my phone in and within a week i received payment into my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	over all i would give moneyforyourphone . com a **** and i would recommend this website to any one .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thz for the experince , great all_round , will be back when i get more mobiles .
Cell_phone_Recycling	not only was the process of valuing and selling online easy and painless , the envelope arrived the next_day and the money was wired to me the same day they received my mobiles .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service and i will_definitely both recommend and use again ,
Cell_phone_Recycling	very nice thank_you
Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault the service given by mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after almost being ripped_off and conned out of £_00 by another company i sent my phone to mazuma with zero hassle when compared to another company i used originally !
Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely_recommend to anyone and will be using again for sure !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma is a great place to get_rid of any unwanted phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was surprised to find my nokia was worth £_00 !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the information pack was quickly delivered and once i ' d returned my phone , the payment was made straight into my bank_account on the same day that it was received !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	happy customer , definitely worth looking through drawers for any old_phones knocking around !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma 0 - 0 times now and every time its been a great experience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they always pay out exactly_what the original offer is , they contact you each_step of the way so you are fully informed and they generally provide a very good service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recommend them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	such an easy experience !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i shopped_around and they offered me the most for my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted it off and the money was paid straight into my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	there were no_quibbles over price and i have a good experience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the price i was offered was great and the speed of the transaction was extraordinary , i will_definately use mazuma again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone off , with a note stating that the screen did not work however everything else did fine .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i even paid for special delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	next_day i got an_email_stating there was faults in that ' the power_button did not switch on or off ' which is not true at all , offering me £_00 . 00 for a samsung_galaxy_note .
Cell_phone_Recycling	either they employ people who can not read or who are too lazy to notice that the phone does turn on but it is just the screen , there is nowhere to state on the website when ' selling ' the phone what damages it has so you can ' t point it out to these morons .
Cell_phone_Recycling	totally peed off and wasted my money and time sending it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( also because i rejected my offer they reported my review stating i ' m not a genuine customer , why just because i rejected the poor offer ?!)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have now received my phone back , low and behold it does turn on ,
Cell_phone_Recycling	also i sent my phone in it ' s original box with charger .. only received the phone back !
Cell_phone_Recycling	contacted customer_service and they are sending out a replacement box and charger .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excelllent service - the whole_process took 0 days from start to finish !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the prepaid_envelope came the day after i submitted the order , i posted the phones immediately , the following_day they received the phones and processed them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the next_day the voucher arrived !
Cell_phone_Recycling	amazing !
Cell_phone_Recycling	a faultless service which i will_definately use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phone in from my local post_office on 00 / 00 but to this date mazuma_mobile are denying that they have recived or processed the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent another phone in on the same day from the same location that has been processed within 00_hours .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once i placed an order , i received numerous reminders to send my phone which was great as i kept forget to post my item .
Cell_phone_Recycling	within the next working day of posting my item , i got an_email_saying they received my image and sent my cheque in the post ( great fast service ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then received the cheque in the post the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you so much for excellent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	from start to finish i found the whole experience fantastic - service was excellent and the speed superb - highley recommend to anyone

Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	zoomfish are fantastic !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they gave me the best quote around for my ipad 0 (£ 00 more_than all other_companies i looked at !)
Cell_phone_Recycling	- they also gave me extra money for liking them on facebook , bonus !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they are true to their word , the payment was in my account the day my parcel was received and , something most companies seem to fail on , they sent me x0 different sized envelopes so i was able to return my ipad safely and securely in the box because i had a nice large envelope to put it in - the instructions were clear , the process couldn ' t be simpler ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend to anyone , in fact i already have done and i ' m foraging through my old gadgets to see what else i can recycle with them !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you zoomfish !
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent off my s0 and because it had a problem with the battery cover they took off £_00 !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i have received a red flag on one blackberry and received payments for 0 blackberrys and one 0000 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this morning i received a text stating my phone would be disposed of in 00 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then spent half an_hour talking to customer_services who were unable to help me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	envirofone are claiming they are unaware of where my phone is and that they never received it , a 0000 which is simply 00 pound .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however as i am entitled to it i feel extremely disappointed after several online chats , and phone_calls made which cost me .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would never ever recommend anyone to use envirofone as they are simply not what they claim to be .
Cell_phone_Recycling	completely hassle_free , instant bank_transfer is perfect for someone like me who can ' t always get to the bank !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a little_worried_about sending my iphone 0 and not getting the price they offered or something else .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however they paid top price for it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only £_00 less_than what they are selling for on ebay ...

Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve used them twice now and no_complaints and when i get my upgrade gonna use them again .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i was very pleasantly_surprised , after_reading other reviews , so decided to give it a go !
Cell_phone_Recycling	so , here we are today and i am minus an old phone and a little richer for the weekend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	process was fast , sent my phone 00_hours ago and just recieved e_- mail of payment , wonderful !
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended and better_than letting your old_mobile gather lint in a drawer somewhere .

Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	o
Cell_phone_Recycling	all the information i needed is on the website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the envelope and instruction pack came earlier_than i thought , and payment is also surprisingly quick and simple .
Cell_phone_Recycling	tested and passed today , payment in 00 days time ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	wait ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	what ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	i thought you said fast payment ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	disappointing .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was offered the best trade in price after visiting a few trade - in websites , my phone had cosmetic wear and envirofone gave me the full_amount advertised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the transaction was fast from start to finish , will_definitely_recommend and use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found the system to be very well_organised and helpful at every_stage of the transaction .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the second time that i have used this service and i have been happy both_times .
Cell_phone_Recycling	in under five days i had been informed that my phone had been received , assessed and payment would be made within_00hrs .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a direct bank_transfer was made within 00_hrs !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick reliable service will recommend
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sold my n00 to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was reluctant as i had a bad_experience selling my last phone , a nokia_0000 to cex . com .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they basically turned around and said that the phone had a stratch , which it never , and then knocked the value bands down from good condition to non working ??
Cell_phone_Recycling	how does that work out .... any way i didnt have the time / energy to argue over it .... and decided to hold onto my n00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	due to cash_flow issues i decided i need to make some money , and my friend sold his phone to mazuma and recommended it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so i did the same , and i was amazed by the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recieved the delivery bag within 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they recieved the phone next_day , and i got the full payment the same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i didnt have to waste my time finding the box and charger etc ( unlike with cex ), mazuma just wanted the phone and battery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i hate to be slating another company when trying to write a review about one , but you need to know and appreciate the difference_between a bad service and a good service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	simply getting what is advertised is a rare commodity these days , and to find a company that actually did as it says was surprising .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i work in customer_services too so i know its importance .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent 0 phones in the bag they sent out within a day and within a week had a cheque for £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cant say any more_than that , very good service and good prices for phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	made the application on the wednesday and had the cheque in my hand by 00 saturday_morning i cant praise this service enough it was perfect !!!!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_defo use again and will recommend to everyone
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent perfectly working phone which after testing they claimed was damaged so reduced the quote substantially .
Cell_phone_Recycling	when questioned about this a miracle happened !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone appeared to have repaired itself to the true condition .
Cell_phone_Recycling	amazingly during this brief period the value of the handset dropped so i was offered a lower value .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only wanted to use a recycling company to save hassle with e_- bay , wont be doing so in future .
Cell_phone_Recycling	disgraceful company avoid at all costs .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once i had sent my phone in , the offer dropped from £_00 to £_00 for ' severe screen scratches ' ( none present ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	rejected this , and they kept increasing the offer until it conveniently matched what they were now offering on their website ( as this had dropped since sending my phone in ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	got my phone sent back instead , and got the full offered price elsewhere .
Cell_phone_Recycling	won ' t waste my time with these again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found the process of selling my old_phones very easy and had a very good price for selling them into mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my sales pack arrived the next_day and i had my cheque arrived the day after they recieved my phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	can ' t ask better_than that !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you x

Cell_phone_Recycling	got exactly_what i was told i would get for four broken phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was very impressed with envirofone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	had been putting it off for ages but once i logged on it was so fast .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you receive the packet to send it in a day or two after you register and then a decision very quickly once you send it off , money in the bank two days_later !
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service and decent prices for old and damaged phones !
Cell_phone_Recycling	a very good company to sell your old_phones and good prices
Cell_phone_Recycling	within 0 - 0 days of the sending the phones away mazuma confirmed they ' d made a cash transfer to my bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was very simple , netting me £_00 for two handsets , one of which had a heavily cracked_screen .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast dispatch of envelopes , clear_instructions , fast payment and great communication_throughout the process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent the phone and after 0 week of travelling by post ( should be 0 , 0 days ) they received it and told me is something wrong with the phone , more exactly it is water_damaged !
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely a load of nonsense !
Cell_phone_Recycling	for the past 0 years i have been using mazumamobile and never had an issue never !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am very careful how i use my phone , the phone was like new !
Cell_phone_Recycling	and regarding the water_damage what can i say , i am using that phone at the moment and has absolutely no problem at all and all i can say was a pure lie just maybe a reason not to pay off the original value quoted online maybe because after iphone 0 appeared the value of my iphone0 went down .
Cell_phone_Recycling	but they say 0 weeks the value is guaranteed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	load of rubbish !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thats the only explanation i can find regarding the big_mistake they did or maybe because i am trying to be reasonable , maybe they ve mistaken the order with another one faulty or something ... i simply can not understand how a phone in a perfect_condition can be tested and found water_damaged ! all lies and non sense !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will never recommend this website and i am very disappointed honestly !
Cell_phone_Recycling	extremely disappointed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definately_reccomend mazuma to other customers , they were incredibly quick with the freepost_bag and revew of the phone which is good .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only things that would make the service a lot better is 0 ) i thought £_00 for my phone was a little_bit cheap but it was so hassle - free i could cope with that and 0 ) they should have a section on there website which explains whats they do with the phones that they buy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	overall , excellent service , very quick , best choice of there type of service that i found !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	after_reading reviews online i have also decided to sell my old phone on mazuma and i have to say it was the best decision !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was a bit reserved about the next_day transfer but it really was !
Cell_phone_Recycling	extremely impressed and will sell another phone for sale as well !
Cell_phone_Recycling	:)
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast service , posted phone on wednesday and had cheque posted to me by the friday !

Cell_phone_Recycling	emailed to query on sending in my phone .. quick response .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my phone in only yesterday , checked and paid today ..... can ' t fault the service it was excellent .. well_done !
Cell_phone_Recycling	best of the best five_star fast payment
Cell_phone_Recycling	we sold 00 old company mobiles & got over £_000 cash back !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service iwas really quick & easy , with a postal bag sent out straight_away , so all you had to do was put the mobiles in & take to the post_office .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it took me a while to get all the old_mobiles in from our staff , so we actually missed the deadline for posting , but this wasnt a problem , as one quick email to mazuma extended the deadline for us .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would highly_recommend that any one with an old_mobile recycles it with mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault this service - i placed the " order " one day , received the freepost_envelope the next , posted it the day after that , and received payment the following_day - from start to finish , it only took four days - absolutely perfect
Cell_phone_Recycling	enquired_about my phones on wednesday_afternoon , received the packaging on thursday and the money was in my account on friday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would award them more if it was possible .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service , will_definitely use them again and can ' t recommend them enough :-_d
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wanted to sell my phone and so i found comparemymobile . com .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i entered all details and got a fantastic price , best price i found on the net actually .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was brilliant and a very quick and simple process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i even sold my boyfriends phone that was broken which was even better !!!
Cell_phone_Recycling	would highly_recommend this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the only delay was me taking time sending in my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process could have been done in 00hrs .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick & efficent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	trusted company i will_continue to keep sending my phones into mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick , simple
Cell_phone_Recycling	the experience with using mazuma couldn ' t have been better or smoother ; i shipped the phone on a monday , by 0pm on the tuesday , the full payment was in my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will not hesitate to the use the service again , nor hesitate to recommend it to my friends .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was very easy , none of this send it in and we ' ll tell you what we ' ll pay , you see the price upfront .
Cell_phone_Recycling	envelope was sent thru very quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent phone off and received email next_day to infom me that the money would be in my account by lunch time !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve sent several phones to mazuma and i cannot recommend them highly_enough !
Cell_phone_Recycling	they have never quibbled the price agreed on any of the handsets i have sent in , and payment is always fast , especially now they they pay directly into your bank_account - perfect !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found the website very simple to use , and getting the quote and organising the whole_thing was easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they give you a quote for the phone in working order or even if it ' s broken .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recieved the free post envelope two days after getting my quote online , i posted the phone back in the envelope and as i had given them my bank_details i recieved the payment the very next_day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cannot_fault this service and would recommend it to anyone_looking to get a better price for their used phone than you could find on the high_street .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i could have got more with another provider , but it was only £ 0 and considering the payment would have been in cheque form and then it was dependent on the condition of the phone - mazuma was a safer bet .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the phone wasn ' t perfect by any means but they gave me exactly_what they quoted and it was in my bank within days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no_messing_around .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve now used fonebank 0 times in all .
Cell_phone_Recycling	before i send each handset for recycling i dig around online for the best price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fonebank usually have one of the best rates give or take a quid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however , as i often pass through central_london , fonebank has won each time as i can personally hand in my old handsets at their holborn centre .
Cell_phone_Recycling	( thus saving me the cost of sending the handset via special delivery , ~£ 0 these days ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used mazuma as i was looking for a fast sale on my old_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	from when i entered my details to when i received the cheque was only 0 days so overall it is a very fast service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got a good price for a old_mobile so i am very happy with this service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process was quick and easy .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used them around 0 times now and the service i received was second to none .
Cell_phone_Recycling	when i ordered the bags to send in my phones , they always came the very next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	orders are processed fast and and money is released quickly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used to receive cheques but on my last 0 payments i requested to be paid by bank_transfer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	just enter your bank_details and away you go .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money was paid into my bank the very same day the order was processed ( the day after i posted the phone to mazuma ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	in all , mazuma is a great company .

Cell_phone_Recycling	speedy and efficient service tho the post_office said the phone was not insured during sending .
Cell_phone_Recycling	contrary to advice on website
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma_mobile have always proved themselves to be trustworthy and easy to deal with ( unlike_other_companies who offer the same services - sadly i learned that the hard way ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you want a no - fuss process that ' s more_than worth your while then i would highly_recommend using mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i heard about mazuma_mobile on a tv commercial and thought what a great idea ... for both the customer ( me ) and mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i like this service on so many levels :
Cell_phone_Recycling	- i don ' t have to put up with old_phones cluttering my house .
Cell_phone_Recycling	- i can generate some pretty good cash ( more_than i thought for a 0nd_hand phone )
Cell_phone_Recycling	- the phone is recycled , so its better for the environment

Cell_phone_Recycling	i used this company as it ' s well know and i thought reputable i used their free post service and my phone has been lost .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and i have been told that they don ' t accept_responsibility and that their free post envelopes only cover insurance to a third of the price that i was quoted as they don ' t keep a record of phones mine is lost and feel_cheated by mazuma_mobile

Cell_phone_Recycling	good job well_done mazuma , i will_definitely use you again , and yes i would recommend you to a friend .

Cell_phone_Recycling	so if you are looking to sell your old phone / s mazuma is the place for you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 star company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after coming to the end of my 0 year contract with o0 , i sold my nokia n00 0gb to mazumamobile . com and received £_00 straight into my account within the week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was offered the best price i could find on the internet , without having to price_match .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this promotes confidence in repeat_business .
Cell_phone_Recycling	o0 dropped their price once the ipad_mini was launched , but orange kept theirs the same and that made the difference in who got my business .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the only slight_issue was the envelope they sent , while kind enough to provide one , it was clearly a envelope designed for a phone and not an ipad .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so i had to provide my own padded_envelope in the end .
Cell_phone_Recycling	but no concerns , i got an_email_confirming the ipad arrived with them and was tested , and another saying payment had been sent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so no_complaints about communication .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick enough payment once the ipad arrived with them , so yes , i ' ll be using them yet again no doubt when i have something else to recycle !
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend mazuma to a friend , great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got money for a phone that i was going to put in the bin !
Cell_phone_Recycling	really worth it people !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it took me only 0 mins to fill up the online form .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am very happy of the outcome .
Cell_phone_Recycling	super_fast service , envelope in post , item then sent after following simple instructions .
Cell_phone_Recycling	confirmation of recipet sent , money in bank ... all in under a week !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i received my free pack within a few_days of registering online .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone to mazuma via special delivery and by mid - day the next_day i had the full_amount in my bank_account .

Cell_phone_Recycling	loved this great value for my phone & quick payment :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	after sending my phone on friday i got the money directly into my account the folloing monday with no_problems or hassle .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the pricing was straightforward fair given that my phone was broken , whereas on the envirofone website they gave the price of my phone if it was in working order but would have to ' assess ' my phone on the price they would give if it was non - working .
Cell_phone_Recycling	an all_round excellent service from mazuma i would definitely_recommend to a friend !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got my quote , had read some negative_reviews and was a little_wary - but best price on the market , totally honest , super_quick payment with absolutely no_problems , would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone at all , and i will definaely use again top_marks mazuma *****

Cell_phone_Recycling	i like envirofone as it helped_me sell my phone to pay bills and it help me out alot and tell people how much it help me out when i did not have no money that week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service , quick payment . will recommend
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent as always
Cell_phone_Recycling	i picked mazuma over the competition due to the ease of
Cell_phone_Recycling	use and the ability to have the phone returned free of charge in the case a lower_price is offered for the device ; this would only be due to its condition not meeting that agreed in the terms and conditions ( a constraint set by all similar_sites ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	the afore mentioned conditions also seem more lax compared to competitors .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i could have made a little more money on ebay , but removing all the hassle , stress and liability was defiantly worth it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the payment was reasonable and very quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommended .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i chose same day payment bank_transfer i payed £ 0 . 00 for special delivery they recieved phone next morning and i recieved a email_saying payment would be in my account by midnight that day its hasnt as of yet and now its the weekend i chose that option as really needed the money to tide me over till payday
Cell_phone_Recycling	it ' s so simple it ' s unbelievable .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you type your phone model in , get the price , you get an envelope within a week , then when you ' re sending your phone you have the option of free post so no post_office or stamp hassle , and as soon as they receive your phone you get the cash directly into your account .

Cell_phone_Recycling	:_d
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my £_000 iphone to them they are saying its not been received i ' ve called royal_mail they are saying it would have been received 0 days ago , and all mazuma say is it will take 00 days for delivery when this is not true what they mean is they can ' t make a claim for it until the 00 day mark although i ' m assured by royal_mail it ' s been delivered , i ' m now informed its most_likely lost but they can ' t confirm this and when questioned they just send out the same standard script stating they ' re delivery times

Cell_phone_Recycling	phone was delivered next_day processed and payment made in to my bank_account by 0 pm on delivery day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick and efficient !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick service , reliable and easy to use
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service , they contact u straight_away
Cell_phone_Recycling	this company offers more_than most for your phone but avoid them at all costs !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used them because they offered £_000 for my iphone 0 (£ 00 more_than anywhere_else ) but i received an_email telling_me that the price had been revised to £_000 because of ' deep scratches on the screen ' i ' d used covers since the day i bought it and i sent it to them in pristine_condition .
Cell_phone_Recycling	by that point i ' d already spent £ 0 sending it to them special delivery - as they advise !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	such a scam , stick to mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they offer less but you don ' t have to pay for special delivery and you get the money much faster .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' m still_waiting for the £_000 from mfyp .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have used mazuma for the third time now and i am very impressed .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sold them my iphone0 , sent it by special delivery on the monday , the money for it was in my account by the end of tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma is not always the best price given by these recycling_companies , but i continue to use them because the service is so great :-)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was reserved at first with using mfyp as i had not heard about them ..
Cell_phone_Recycling	but no need , just as good as mazuma ( whom i used 0 years_ago last time i had an old phone for recycling ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	mfyp offered me £_00 more_than other_companies - i sent my phone , they tested it the same day it received and told me when my payment was scheduled .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the payment came through as they said .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it wasn ' t immediate but coz they were upfront about it that ' s no problem .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will def use them again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you get a very good offer for your old_mobile and the money arrived in my account the day after id sent it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was also impressed that they sent regular confirmation e_- mails .
Cell_phone_Recycling	top quality service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the mobile posting pack arrived next_day after posting details on the site .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received the full offer price for my phone and the cheque arrived the next_day after they had received the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was updated_throughout the process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will certainly use this company again and recommend to others .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i chose zoomfish because of the competitive price they quoted for my iphone0 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	ignore this , you will not receive the amount they quote you .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after posting off the device and hearing_nothing from them for over a month , i finally received an_email_stating they were sending me £_00 , £_00 less_than the quote .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i called them to ask for my phone to be retuened they stated it was too_late and that i should have rejected their lower offer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i never received the lower offer from them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they never sent me an e_- mail , which they claim they did , stating that my junk box must have deleted it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the attitude of the individual i spoke to was basically , " tough " you did nothing about it and its too_late now .
Cell_phone_Recycling	do not use this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my wife has used other_companies for devices before and never come_across this .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if they have decided to lower the original_quote they get in contact and discuss this with you , not zoomfish .
Cell_phone_Recycling	zoomfishgadgets pays more for your old_mobiles and gadgets then all the other_sites , the website is easy to navigate and i found it very easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment for my old gadgets was made the same day zoomfishgadgets received my goods .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy , will use them again with my other items very soon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the process was as easy as possible to follow , everything is clear and explained well .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole_process is very fast and efficient and the fact that the money is paid straight into your account practically straight_away is fantastic !
Cell_phone_Recycling	just wish i had more phones to send in now !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick and simple
Cell_phone_Recycling	outstanding service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick and easy no hassle at all and they give you good money for your old_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service and would recommend this company
Cell_phone_Recycling	their service is quite superb .

Cell_phone_Recycling	whole_process was easy and quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received cheque quickly after posting phone and received email notification of acceptance of phone and amount to be paid .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the amount received was same as originally show on website which was expected as phone only had bit of wear and tear scratches on cover .
Cell_phone_Recycling	overall good quick and easy service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my iphone on the 00th of april and there still said there aint received yet it says 0 working_days on the advert / website i phoned them but no answer to why there aint got the phone so i dont rate mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' d definitely_recommend zoomfish as they offered me the best price for my ipad .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they seemed to put a lot of thought into the logistics too , as i received both a small and large plastic envelope in which to put my ipad .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was prompt and i ' m already looking at selling my mobile phone to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and to top it off , they ' re a ' not - for - profit ' organisation .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fantastic !
Cell_phone_Recycling	seriously these_guys know what they want .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they also know what you want which is most_important .
Cell_phone_Recycling	0 aged phones for over £_00 , can ' t beat that .
Cell_phone_Recycling	also can ' t beat the speed , their parcel package arrived within 0 day , once my parcel was sent ( picked_up by postman ), i got my cash within 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	these_guys don ' t mess about .
Cell_phone_Recycling	cheers .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recomend this site to anyone !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	:_d
Cell_phone_Recycling	i can ' t believe i used to go to other recyclers before , with fonebank , everything was easy and straightforward , i dropped my iphone at their branch , on my way back home i received a confirmation that my phone was received , few minutes after another email_stating that the phone was processed and the money has been sent .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the next_day i checked my bank_account and the money was there .
Cell_phone_Recycling	with other recyclers i used to wait for days to get a confirmation that the phone was received , also i used to have the price dropped each time and struggle a lot to get my money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	but today after my experience with fonebank , i will never consider any other recycler and i genuinely recommend fonebank to everyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service very reliable and a good price paid for my old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	having used mazuma in the past i will never doubt the service you get , sent my phone special delivery and next_day i received my money in the bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so easy to do and site is great to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	even for a broken phone the price was still respectable as my screen bled .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i fully recommend mazuma for getting cash for your old phone :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast and easy
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant so fast easy and simple got in touch and 0 days_later had my money in my bank will be using again
Cell_phone_Recycling	got £_000 for an 00 month old iphone_0gs 00gb which had a crack in the casing .
Cell_phone_Recycling	other people specified on the condition mazuma was just ' working ' or ' not working '.
Cell_phone_Recycling	money paid into my account the same day and clear emails throughout keeping me posted of progress .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted and paid within a few_days , no issues .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would highly_recommend !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had to wait over a month before they registered that i had sent the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this was sent by special delivery so i could prove this had been sent but , it took over a month to resolve .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i then found out that if i had gone with a different company i could have got more money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will not be using them again or recommending them !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	first time user and found the whole experience smooth , fast and efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be using again in the future !
Cell_phone_Recycling	many_thanks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the whole user experience is brilliant .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the checkout_process is easy and i received my packaging the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once i returned my phone it got processed really quick in terms of testing and i was kept_updated_throughout the process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the only thing that was slightly negative was that i had to wait for my number to be ported so my first phone price expired .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was removed from my account , when it would have been easier if i could just renew the details .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i love this site !
Cell_phone_Recycling	so easy to use , very informative and the prices seem to be the best available !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was going to use o0 but after_reading the o0 recycling reviews online i thought i ' d look for a mobile comparison site - really glad i found phones0cash !

Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service and experience with mazuma_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent the phone , and by the next_day , the order had been received , the payment made , and the money also in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma made this so easy that i wouldn ' t hesitate to use this service again , and recommend to others .

Cell_phone_Recycling	00 hour turnaround - the way it should be .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely_recommend and will be using again
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found envirofone simple to sign_up and register and i found it very easy to put in my phone details and was really happy with the price they suggested for my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	once i had gotten to the next stage i had not hesitation filling in my bank_details as it is well_known envirofone is a well trusted company and i knew that my details wouldn ' t be in the wrong hands .
Cell_phone_Recycling	after i confirmed my sale i got a parcel sent out to me and the instructions were really simple to understand and to follow .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my phone away and the money landed in my bank_account on the day envirofone said it would land into my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	overall i was very satisfied with my experience with envirofone and that i would recommed them to a friend in an instance .
Cell_phone_Recycling	reasonable amount paid for the phone , with really fast delivery of both the packaging and then the gift_card .... well worth using for any phones you are not using .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the envelope and instructions arrived within 0 days of me placing my mobile phone sale on mazumamobile website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i returned it a couple of days_later and again with 0 days the money was paid into my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	no hassle , no complications , quick and reliable service that i have now used twice and will_definitely use again and have recommended it to all my friends and family , can ' t fault the process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i recently sold my old phone to them on the 00 / 00 / 00 , they where super_fast and when i say super i mean next_day , i posted the phone back to them the next_day on the 00 / 00 / 00 , and only two days after that i reserved my cheque , the only place i will sell my old_mobiles to , thank_you mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was so happy to find mazuma_mobile because they offered a great price for my old_nokia_0000 xpress mobile phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however after posting it ( freepost ) apparently it got lost , and there was no help or assistance to help track it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i contacted the royal_mail who assured me that the package had been collected , but the phone in its flimsy freepost_bag had broken in transit .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma didnt even keep tabs or assure that i was offered some assistance , i had to badger them over ten_days to see if they had found the phone
Cell_phone_Recycling	what a great service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i registered online , received the secure postage bag and posted the phone back .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was in bank within a few hours of them having it back , the day after it was posted .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy with the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i will use again and be recommending to friends .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my phone off freepost and got the money transfered into the bank really quick only took about 0 days from posting till receiving money i ' d definitely use them again
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found this company amazingly efficient .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the money was in my account less_than 00_hours after posting !
Cell_phone_Recycling	can not fault this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i wish all were as professional and efficient as this one .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found my experiene excellent *****
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick effiecient great service , genuinely exceeded my expectations of speed in service / application , a great service !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	and will_definately use again if i sell a phone
Cell_phone_Recycling	never used mazuma before but had no need for my old phone , so decided to go for it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	went_onto the website and read what i needed to go .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received my pack within a few_days with full instructions on what to do and options on posting my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent my phone of and within 0 days the money that they had said i would receive was in my bank .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was a very quick and easy process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend and use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	well_done mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good service and easy to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however , i was offered less_than a third of the initially stated price as my device was damaged .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was expecting to receive a lower_price but not by more_than £_00 !
Cell_phone_Recycling	only after i received the offer via_email did i think to check other_sites such as asda tech trade in , who would ' ve gave me £_00 for my damaged phone , and even mazuma_mobile who would ' ve given me £_00 .
Cell_phone_Recycling	in saying that , the only reason i did stick with envirofone was that the 00 day wait for the return of the phone was just too long and i would ' ve had more hassle with sending it to another company which would ' ve all been too much with christmas coming up .
Cell_phone_Recycling	oh well i guess £_00 is better_than nothing !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i also think that at_least an estimate price for damaged phones should be shown on the site , before you send it away .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good 0st time i used it money came straight_away well happy
Cell_phone_Recycling	i went online to sell my old_mobiles , that had been hanging_around in cupboard for years .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was always thinking about going online , and using a company like mazuma , but thought it would be too much hassle .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found mazuma ' s website very easy to understand , and the prices given for my old_mobiles very reasonable .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it only took a short time to let them know what mobiles i had , them to tell me how much i was getting for them , and to arrange for them to send me a pack , so i could post the mobiles off , free post to them .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i cannot remember the exact lenth of time it took , for them to receive my old_mobiles , and to then forward on a cheque to me , but it was very quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definately use mazuma again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definately recomend them to friends and family .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am very pleased the service i received , it was fast and easy .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and i used this service before as always stick to there words .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will recommend to everyone specially family and friends
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have never written a public review before .
Cell_phone_Recycling	when mazuma sent me an_email to do so i jumped at the chance .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the speed of turnaround was fantastic .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sold my phone on a friday & by wednesday i had the cheque in my hand .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website is very easy to follow & has excellent layout .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was really impressed how quickly everything happened .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the money was in my account really fast and it was all completely hassle_free .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the money offered was better_than anywhere_else .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would definitely use envirofone again .

Cell_phone_Recycling	then on sunday i got an e_- mail to say thanks again and hope to recieve my phone once i sent it .

Cell_phone_Recycling	thank_you mazuma x_x_x_x_x
Cell_phone_Recycling	website was dead simple to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you can choose to have a sales pack posted to you or print your own labels .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i printed my own and posted phone same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma received my phone after two days and paid the full_amount into my bank_account on the same day they got the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great service and superfast !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got the pack very quickly and received the cash into my bank the day after i posted it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	always used mazuma , great company so far .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received envelope in speedy time , but now offering details on how to make_sure your mobile gets to them safely , with how to use the pre_- paid cover at the post_office or pay for extra cover .
Cell_phone_Recycling	my mobile was just over the value of what they class as ' free cover ', but i thought i ' d just use the pre_- paid proof of postage cover as other cover is too expensive .
Cell_phone_Recycling	post_office have informed me that mazuma are lying about the proof of purchase cover and options are risk in freepost or pay insurance !
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma have been informed by post_office several_times and have not reviewed their postage options .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i called mazuma on free number to check , but rang out .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got cheque in post within a few_days so no more worries , but the post_office either need to get a grip or mazuma need to confirm these options with them ( oh and answer your phones !!!)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my package off on saturday_afternoon and received my money wednesday_afternoon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was really easy as i received everything i needed to know in an information guide along with a prepaid return envolope and jiffy_bag .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend to anyone as they have better rates than their competitors and deliver exactly_what they promise .
Cell_phone_Recycling	got a better price ( 00_% better_than one quoted by asda site ) for my nokia_0000 ( july_0000 model ); just had to send across the phone ( without chargers / headphones ) and got the payment into my a / c , within 0 - 0 working_days after sending my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	best part is that they have freepost address , good enough to send across low priced items .
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast , honest and a great company to deal with .
Cell_phone_Recycling	paid the full_amount offered .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they saved the day after being burnt by cash0phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	strongly_recommend using muzuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	old htc hd0 sat in ' man - draw '.
Cell_phone_Recycling	quoted online for £_00 and ordered pack - arrived 0 days_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted back same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	received and processed day after .
Cell_phone_Recycling	money in account same day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	from ' man - draw ' to cash = 0 days !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent company - would recommend to anyone .....
Cell_phone_Recycling	i swaped my old water_damaged fone for an argos_voucher i thought it was a good trade and they sent the voucher to me straight_away so im happy :) thanks mazuma ill be using u again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found my sale with mazuma straight_forward and transparent throughout .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i checked severall competitors and the price offered by mazuma was fair and in line with what othes were offering .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the turnaround from posting my old phone to receive the funds was within 0 working_days which was more_than acceptable .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma offered me a very good price for my working blackberry , sent me a free postage bag within a couple of days ( although it did take longer_than i anticipated for the bag to arrive ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	however for reasons i won ' t bother going into , i couldn ' t post my phone before the expiration date .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma sent me an_email where i requested an extension which was immediately granted for one week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted it the next_day and received a confirmation_email the day after saying they had received my phone , had tested it , and i would receive the money within the next 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	payment was very quick !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy with mazuma , have used these before and again received a great service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	highly_recommend them !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	very good and fast
Cell_phone_Recycling	the process was very quick and easy , plus the payment options were a good idea , so you can select whichever depending_on how quick you needed the money .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was quick , the postal bag arrived day after i placed sell order .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i packaged it up and posted and the following_day ( today ) i received an_email_confirming_receipt of my old phone and payment will apparently be made to me today by fps !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy , highly_recommended .
Cell_phone_Recycling	ive used fonebank many_times now and couldnt be_happier with the service provided .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it is by_far the easiest phone_recycling company i have ued to date and i highly_recommend it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast , prompt payment and the valuations are the best ive found on the market .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the only let_down ive found ( and it is a small one ) is the time it takes to receive a reply once youve emailed the company about anything .
Cell_phone_Recycling	ive waited up to 0 - 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however the staff are polite and always apologize for your inconvenience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	all in all , its a massive 00 / 00 from me !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	fast , easy , effective .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent one phone off on a saturday and recieved payment on the tuesday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	wicked .
Cell_phone_Recycling	simple .
Cell_phone_Recycling	banging .
Cell_phone_Recycling	website was really easy to use , envelope arrived following_day with clear_instructions as to what to do next .
Cell_phone_Recycling	posted mobiles back , had email_confirming they had been recieved & money was transfered to my account same day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got my quote in mid december , (£_000 . 00 ) but as my new phone didn ' t arrive until mid january i didn ' t send my old phone off until then .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i quickly checked the price for my old phone in january and saw that it had dropped significantly .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i still send my phone off to mfyp fully expecting them to say that i would get the new much lower_price (£ 00 . 00 ).
Cell_phone_Recycling	much to my surprise they paid the price quoted to me in december , so if you are thinking of selling a phone get a quote now in case the price they offer goes down in the future !
Cell_phone_Recycling	all in all happy with the service , payment too around 0 weeks to arrive after posting my phone off .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i can ' t say enough great things about mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	good price !
Cell_phone_Recycling	fantastic service !

Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent my iphone 0 to mazuma via_royal_mail next_day delivery at 00 noon on thursday , october 00th and had £_000 in my bank_account by 00 noon on friday , october 00th !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was skeptical_about how quick and pain free this service would be but it is literally a case of a couple of clicks , a quick trip to the post_office , and bob ' s your uncle , the money hits the bank !
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	honest !

Cell_phone_Recycling	excellent service and fast payment deffinetly will use again
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used fonebank . com recently to swap an under - used old kindle for a cheque .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website was simple to follow and had flexible options ( such as a freepost address to use at ones own_risk , or one for a recorded_delivery , for example - which i found helpful )
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was fast , efficient and polite .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i received my cheque very quickly after sending the kindle on , which has inspired enough confidence in me to recommend this company to others .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i feel fonebank . com is a great idea to recycle old unloved items into cash and is well worth using .
Cell_phone_Recycling	these days there are so many companies out there who offer great deals .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was pretty nervous selling my iphone_0s this way as the majority do not deliver what is promised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	zoom fish do !
Cell_phone_Recycling	great communications throughout and promt payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will use again and will not hesitate to reccomend .
Cell_phone_Recycling	used mazumamobile for ages now to raise funds for the local church .
Cell_phone_Recycling	started using then as overall the prices were better that you get back for the phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick easy service - good communication - perfect 00 / 00
Cell_phone_Recycling	very fast and efficient service , paid me what i had been quoted by direct bank_transfer no_problems .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would highly_recommend to anyone wanted to get_rid of their old phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to use website and excellent turnaround time , the whole_process was completed in less_than 0 week .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sold 0 mobiles , had no trouble getting payment for the cheaper 0 the iphone however somehow got lost , even_though it was in the sane envelope as the other 0 phones !
Cell_phone_Recycling	00 emails later i finally got it sorted but they were very accusing of me and wouldn ' t take_responsibility as it was sent from a post box even_though they received they other 0 in the same envelope !
Cell_phone_Recycling	couldnt recommend them more highly , i posted my phone on monday , the cheque was here on thursday .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so quick and easy ... got my money paid into my bank within 00_hrs of posting my phone !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very nice indeed .

Cell_phone_Recycling	fair price , quick and easy to use website .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they do what they say .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i strongly_recommend everyone to sell their phones here you cant go_wrong

Cell_phone_Recycling	cannot_fault this company , sent two phones back recently and had money in my bank on the next working day on both_occasions !

Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy with delivery of documents and payment
Cell_phone_Recycling	paid within 00_hours of posting the phone , there isn ' t a bad thing to say about mazuma !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted it on a saturday_afternoon and the money was in my bank by monday_afternoon .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will_definitely use them again as the price they gave me was very competitive too .
Cell_phone_Recycling	good service all_round !
Cell_phone_Recycling	selling your old_mobile through mazuma is easy , i ' ve sold two of mine already and i ' ve used them previously .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you get a top price for something that ' d just sit in a drawer otherwise plus my last one was set - up on the sunday , sent on the monday and cash in my account on the tuesday - stunning !
Cell_phone_Recycling	go for it !
Cell_phone_Recycling	:)
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used mazumamobile to sell my old sony ericson phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was dubious of whether the company was a scam as so many are these days , but when i went on their website and saw that they would send me the bag in which to submit my mobile for free i though - well i have nothing to lose .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they had quoted online that if they phone was working i would receive £_00 for it - which just after christmas was better_than nothing !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent it off for free and lo and behold 0 days_later a cheque for £_00 arrive in the post , i have banked it and it has cleared .
Cell_phone_Recycling	totally fuss free easy way to make a little money out of your old_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	their customer contact via_email is also excellent , they inform you every_step pf the was where your transaction is at in the process which is reassuring .
Cell_phone_Recycling	well_done mazumamobile :)
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is an excellent service and very easy to do .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if you need some extra dough , mazuma ' s the place to go !
Cell_phone_Recycling	happy to sell my phone with them - very fast payment and notifications all the way
Cell_phone_Recycling	so easy to use , explains all options of payment and posting very well and very quick :)

Cell_phone_Recycling	0 days from posting !
Cell_phone_Recycling	but i was pay the day the status changed on the site !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very prompt process , it was all over in 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the third time i have used matsuma and all i can say is trustworthy , easy and quick .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if your phone is damages like mine was matzuma will give u the best price !
Cell_phone_Recycling	others will possibly pay more of your phone is in pristine_condition but matzuma take any phone and give you a fair price .
Cell_phone_Recycling	spot on amzin to think it was worth so much
Cell_phone_Recycling	so easy to use , you tell them what you have , in my case i had them e_- mail the documents through .
Cell_phone_Recycling	sent it off , and 0 days_later the cash was in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they kept me updated when they had received the phone , and also when the cash transfer was complete .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a really good experience , will use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the service was good the only thing that could have been better is : i sent a number of mobile_phones in an on the contract it stated i would receve the money owed to me within 00_hrs , i kept looking at mybank to see ifthe money had been paid in this went on for one week , finaly i contacted mazumamobile an i was told ther was a problem with my order as i had not stated one of the phones had a damaged screen admitedly that was a fault on my part but an_email or phone call to explain the hold up would be nice other than this i was completely happy wiv the service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very quick service , and delivered exactly as expected / promised .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very happy with the experience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	super_fast payment , straight into my bank_account 0 days after i posted the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	recently sent in my iphone_0gs 00gb to mazuma , website was easy to use , phone selection was a simple process .
Cell_phone_Recycling	postage labels , and bag along with delivery note arrived on the wednesday , phone received by mazuma today and payment was in my account within 0 - 0 hours .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would fully recommend them to anyone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	gave me an excellent price on my old phone and i received money into my account the same day !
Cell_phone_Recycling	wow such a happy happy customer first time ive used mazuma_mobile was recommend by friend was very unsure at first but thought i would give a try i filled out application wednesday received package by friday and money was in my account by saturday very impressed great turnaround .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will be using you in the near_future for defo and will recommend everyone i know .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you see companies advertised on tv but i guarantee you always wonder if they are what they say they are and if they will do what they say they will do .
Cell_phone_Recycling	well dont worry , this one does !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found 0 old_phones lying_around the house and decided to see what they where worth .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was surprised at how much i was being offered .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i did do a little research on other_sites but mazumba offered me the most for cash but also offered me an extra 00_% if i took argos / homebase vouchers .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i opted for the latter as i am refurbing my home and garden .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i applied on the website , the details arrived through the post within 0 days , i sent them off and had a confirmation_email to say they had arrived and were being checked , received another email to say that my vouchers had been issued , and received the vouchers ( actually a gift_card with the money on it ) within another 0 days .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so in approx 0 - 0 days i had applied , posted and received payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i highly_recommend using this company to recycle your old_phones .
Cell_phone_Recycling	what else you gonna do with them ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	would recommend this to anyone selling there phone gave me the best price online and was so fast contacted the site on the wednesday then got the prepaid_envelope on the thursday , sent the phone that day and had the money in my account on the friday cant_beat a fantastic service like this .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was very impressed with the service - i sent my phone by special delivery to mazuma one lunchtime , and 00hrs later the decent sum was already in my bank_account - many_thanks
Cell_phone_Recycling	i sent 0 of my phones to mazuma , and i received a text the next_day about payment being sent ...
Cell_phone_Recycling	the check was sent within 00_hours , fantastic service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was shocked at how quick the check came through .
Cell_phone_Recycling	when i first saw the advert on the tv i thought , they will change the price they quote on the internet , but they don ' t .
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thankyou mazuma .
Cell_phone_Recycling	compare a wide_range of mobile recyclers , including some that other comparison_sites miss - so it ' s always worth checking !
Cell_phone_Recycling	after having the usual 00_% reduction for a previous order i sent in to o0 recycle , i ' d read from other review sites that they no_longer did this - and after_reading their terms saw that there was no_longer a 00_% deduction made for cosmetic_damage .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i decided to send in my z00 to them , and got them to do a price_match with another recycler , which they approved .
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was received by them on friday_morning at 00 :_00am , and 00_minutes later got an_email to confirm the full_amount would be paid into my account the same day , which it was , three hours_later .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a definite improvement over the service previously offered , and the quickest i have ever received payment from any mobile recycler .
Cell_phone_Recycling	previously envirofone were always my first choice when i wanted to cash in my old phone , however recently the service they have offered has been extremely poor .
Cell_phone_Recycling	over the last few_months i have sent several phones to them , and each time the wait time for payment has been unacceptable .
Cell_phone_Recycling	two_weeks for a bank_transfer ?
Cell_phone_Recycling	and after 00 days , two cheques for my two most_recent orders have still not arrived , with them citing it ' s royal_mail ' s fault .
Cell_phone_Recycling	interesting that all my other post has arrived on time .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i ' ve seen replies from the company on previous reviews that envirofone claim that delays are occurring due to high numbers of phones being sent in .
Cell_phone_Recycling	however , this is somewhat unbelievable as the phones are always tested within hours of them receiving it - but it ' s payment that takes ages .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if they can test them in such a short_space of time , there really is no excuse for such appalling wait times for payment .
Cell_phone_Recycling	certainly the last time i will ever be using envirofone - truly a shadow of their former selves , terrible service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	exactly as promised , paid the full_amount for my phone despite it having some minor cosmetic blemishes .
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely use again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	phone sent , received and paid , all within 00_hours - very impressed !
Cell_phone_Recycling	very pleased with service and recycled all my stuff at great prize .
Cell_phone_Recycling	similar story to many , many others - just wish i had done my homework on them beforehand , schoolboy error that i won ' t make again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	offered £_000 for my ipad0 - good condition .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they then said they ' d offer me £_000 due to scratches , dents , etc ... the usual bull cr @ p !
Cell_phone_Recycling	don ' t send anything to them , they ' ll rip you off good and proper .
Cell_phone_Recycling	take a small amount less and go to a reputable business .
Cell_phone_Recycling	great company , great to deal with , everything was so quick and easy !
Cell_phone_Recycling	cheque arrived within a week !
Cell_phone_Recycling	fab !!
Cell_phone_Recycling	!
Cell_phone_Recycling	i read reviews for other_companies and although the price paid was a little less the reviews were better .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i bit the bullet and applied for an envelope .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the post_office didn ' t have any recorded or special delivery stickers so i just sent it with the free delivery .
Cell_phone_Recycling	a couple of days_later the money was in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks mazuma
Cell_phone_Recycling	absolutely_brilliant idea , we had loads of mobile that we would never use again zapped them into mazuma and hey_presto a pile of money to spend on nice things .
Cell_phone_Recycling	will deffinately recommend to all family and friends .
Cell_phone_Recycling	and use again .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this is the 0th time i ' ve used mazuma and the one phone_recycling site i can trust !
Cell_phone_Recycling	no reservations !
Cell_phone_Recycling	quick payment after reciept of email ' s , second time i habe used this service and both_times i have been very pleased .
Cell_phone_Recycling	they always give one of the best prizes and unlike some of theyre competitors they do not claim the phone is not working just to get a better deal .
Cell_phone_Recycling	this service has got to have five_stars .
Cell_phone_Recycling	really quick and easy to use .
Cell_phone_Recycling	whole_process completed within three days including receiving the money into my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i paid for special delivery so that i could increase my insurance - just in case - but i would expect that as the insurance is a royal_mail product rather_than a mazuma product .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the website was easy to follow and mazuma kept me up to date by email which was very helpful , some of those other_companies could definitely learn a thing or two from this company .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend mazuma to anyone that asks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was paid £_000 for a iphone_0g that i had laying around in my kitchen drawer .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i used special delivery to send and the money was in my account the next_day .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i am very pleased with the service i received ..
Cell_phone_Recycling	i posted my phone at last post on wednesday ( caught the postie as he was emptying the box ), had a message to say that they had received it on thursday_morning , and by thursday_afternoon the payment had been made into my bank_account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was extremely impressed by the speed of service and would recommend to anyone that asks .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i got all the information needed , money went into my bank_account as soon as they received my mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	very proud with their service ...

Cell_phone_Recycling	i found mazuma offered an excellent price for my old_phones compared to other_sites , the freepost_envelope was sent to me the next_day , and the money was in my account the day after i posted them !
Cell_phone_Recycling	brilliant !
Cell_phone_Recycling	would definitely use mazuma again !
Cell_phone_Recycling	the price that mazumamobile gave me , was higher_than any other place that i looked into .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the freepost_envelope came very quickly and a day after this arrived the money for my broken phone was in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i found it very easy and simple , hassle_free , and definatly a site i will be returning too .
Cell_phone_Recycling	was really impressed with the ease and speed from start to finish will use again
Cell_phone_Recycling	after accessing the mazuma_mobile website i found a quote for my old_mobile with ease , and i was very happy to find out how much my unwanted phone was worth .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i had previously tried to sell on ebay with no luck , and with additional_costs for photo ' s i found ebay quite an expensive inconvenience .
Cell_phone_Recycling	mazuma ' s free post bag arrived the day after i registered my phone for sale , with clear and concise postal instructions .

Cell_phone_Recycling	do not use they are a con
Cell_phone_Recycling	my experience with this company used to be good .
Cell_phone_Recycling	as my title_says , i did not get paid my full_amount .
Cell_phone_Recycling	only a small portion of what i was owed , i received .
Cell_phone_Recycling	if £_00 is meant to be £_00 then im so sorry .
Cell_phone_Recycling	but this company is a sham .
Cell_phone_Recycling	easy to use website , i found the envolope arrived_promptly and after i had sent the phone off i found it suprising how fast the money was transferred after they had received the phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	initially i was apprehensive_about sending my phone through the post but the bag envirofone sent was capable of protecting it .
Cell_phone_Recycling	envirofone were very good at letting me know what was going on and payment was prompt .
Cell_phone_Recycling	definitely recommended !
Cell_phone_Recycling	all fine - received envelope quickly which was free special delivery .

Cell_phone_Recycling	i didn ' t actually believe it at first but the very next_day i received my cheque .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend this company to anyone , as i ' ve used these companies or similar before and have had to wait up to three_weeks in some_cases .
Cell_phone_Recycling	you couldn ' t get better off a catalogue so i ' m really pleased with the way i was treated .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have also just traded in my second phone after such a great experience with my first .
Cell_phone_Recycling	being so close to christmas it was also beneficial to get more money throgh accepting argos_vouchers .
Cell_phone_Recycling	happy mum , happy kids , happy all_round .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i would recommend to everyone and will use again thanks mazuma .

Cell_phone_Recycling	quick , efficient - does what it does on the tin !
Cell_phone_Recycling	i have sold many old_phones to mazuma and have always found them to offer a fiar price , comparable to ebay and a prompt and efficent service .
Cell_phone_Recycling	having decided to dispose of my old_mobile phone , it was a choice between between the two most well_known companies - envirofone and mazuma_mobile .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i searched both sites and mazuma offered more money and i was intrigued to try out their direct payment of funds , having used envirofone previously , with payment by cheque .
Cell_phone_Recycling	i was amazaed at how quickly the freepost_envelope was sent to me , then how fast the phone was processed .

Cell_phone_Recycling	thanks !
Cell_phone_Recycling	it was so easy to register my phone .
Cell_phone_Recycling	the next_day i received a freepost envelop for my phone , i posted it the same day and within a couple of days the money was in my account .
Cell_phone_Recycling	so so easy to do and didn ' t cost me a penny and i made £_00 . 00 !

Cell_phone_Recycling	wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend based on my experience .
Flowers	happy customer .
Flowers	i have relied on eflorist . co . uk to deliver flowers to my partner for the birth of our first child .
Flowers	it was vital that the flowers were received on the confirmed date .
Flowers	the item i had chosen was meant to be delivered on a saturday but it did not turn_up .
Flowers	customer_service was closed over the weekend and there was no way to track my order until the following_monday when i found out that the delivery person attempted to deliver but it did not find the address , and did not even attempt to call me . if i was notified i could have got my flowers somewhere_else instead of looking like an empty_handed fool .
Flowers	monday at 00pm still no delivery , when i finally got in contact with the customer_service who agreed to refund me 00_% + delivery charges and got the florist to contact me .
Flowers	my delivery at that point was not even on their schedule and again no one tried to call me to reschedule or notify me of anything .
Flowers	when i spoke to the florist ( the flower shop , 0 pepper st , isle of dogs , london e00 - useless avoid !!!)
Flowers	they reassured me and guaranteed to me that they would have delivered within 0 and half hour , only problem was that the driver took the vases home on the previous attempted delivery and that were 00 miles_away !!!
Flowers	i was offered to settle for a replacement product which i was completely unhappy about , given the occurrence .
Flowers	i explained the florist the embarrassement and disappointment they had put me through , they offered to add a complimentary box of chocolate to the flowers and to apologise to the recipient for the delay .
Flowers	two and half hours_later the delivery took place , no apology , no box of chocolate , nothing !!!
Flowers	i called them back , they admitted they had forgotten and offered me a whole lot of empty excuses .
Flowers	i went to call back eflorist customer_service and i complained of the awful experience i had with the florist , explaining that because i have choosen to leave it in their hands i will now have to live for the rest of my life with the embarrassment of not having given flowers to my partner upon giving birth to our son .
Flowers	they offered a full_refund but they advised that they would have collected the flowers back , rubbing more salt on an open wound !!
Flowers	at that point no excuses , apologies or compensations could have make up for the damage .
Flowers	this was not about the flowers or the price i paid for it , it was about the meaning and sentimental value on one of the most_important days of my life .
Flowers	i have bought flowers from them previously , but the just screwed me up on the most_important occasion .
Flowers	i advised them that today they lost a customer that could have been a loyal - one for a life time .
Flowers	now the only life time lasting thing will be the embarrassment of not having given flower to my other half after giving birth .
Flowers	in response to eflorist reply below :
Flowers	yes i did contact customer_service however i would not say that the issue is resolved , no apologies or refunds can make up for it .
Flowers	on top of everything , i saw the flowers yesterday and definetely not worth what i paid for !!!
Flowers	i will never use your service again .
Flowers	couldn ' t find the address , which is strange as the building is the biggest hospital in chester .
Flowers	ridiculous .
Flowers	then told the next_day they would be delivered by 00 . 00am , and they wasn ' t .
Flowers	never called back when i was told i would .
Flowers	very shocking service by both the courier and eflorist .
Flowers	i wouldn ' t recommend at all .
Flowers	hormis la_livraison qui n ' a pas été faite ( sur_le suivi il est marqué que la personne n ' était pas là alors qu ' elle était bien présente ), le reste , ça va . des prix pour tous budgets , les fleurs ont été livrées avec certes 0 jours de retard mais elles étaient impeccables .
Flowers	added the discount_code bigdiscountspring and it wouldn ' t reduce the price like it stated on quid co website .
Flowers	made things more_expensive , i hope the flowers are of good quality to save the purchase will re - review if they are .
Flowers	would also like someone to provide me the 00_% that code was supposed to save me !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i used serenata_flowers back in december for some birthday flowers ..... flowers that never arrived after 0 " delivery attempts " - when called they said their driver made an attempt but no one was available !!...
Flowers	how is this possible when the delivery address was a city_centre store and their delivery time was midday ?!
Flowers	anyway , this happened on 0 occasions and really was embarrassing for me as they were for a birthday .
Flowers	when i called they were really unhelpful and arrogant .
Flowers	i suggest no one ever uses them again .
Flowers	cheap fast nice products buy from these retailers and you won ' t be sorry
Flowers	having read all of the reviews and complaints regarding iflorists poor service i am getting increasingly anxious that a ) my girlfriend has not received her flowers , b ) i am not getting any kind of response from your so called ' online_chat ' and c ) i have no way of tracking / tracing my order ...
Flowers	i am quite_frankly appalled at your customer_service and if i do not receive a response , or have flowers delivered today i will be going to trading_standards .
Flowers	to change my opinion and salvage this into an average at best review , i suggest you respond asap to ticket eaw - 000 - 00000 to tell me exactly when my girlfriends flowers will arrive !!
Flowers	shocking
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered today for my mom , and have not received any tracking i . d or anything as such !
Flowers	even_though i paid extra for it .
Flowers	i am now starting to worry that the flowers may never get here i might get here very later in the day .
Flowers	order number is 00000 i need some response !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	hello ,
Flowers	i ' ve just recieved my flowers from my boyfriend of a few_months , and on it says ' to my gorgeous amazing wife '...
Flowers	i checked with my boyfriend and he confirms this was not his message to me that he wrote to go with the flowers .
Flowers	the flowers are awful - they ' re on their death bed and the chocolates all contain nuts so no good for me at all !
Flowers	oh well - will not be using this website again as they are obviously incapable of writing the correct message in someones flowers !
Flowers	thanks iflorist you ' ve ruined my valentines_day ...
Flowers	the only site i have found where i can select the actual flowers i want - it ' s just what i needed and so easy to use .
Flowers	i ordered a bunch of flowers for delivery on july 00th .
Flowers	i emailed on july 00th to ask where they were , no response .
Flowers	i emailed again on july 00th and july 00th .
Flowers	by lunch on the 00th i used their online_chat facility , very quick response saying order suspended because i was being offered an_alternative .
Flowers	i replied_saying i ' ve had no email or call and the user logged off .
Flowers	0 more attempts later , i gave up and called .
Flowers	the assistant on the phone was helpful , but was only able to offer a refund ( which she then said she couldn ' t process herself ) they advised me this would take 0 - 0 days for another dept to look_into , and could offer no explanation as to why i ' d not been contacted .
Flowers	i would not recommend this company , and will not be using them again .
Flowers	shame , as all it would have taken was a quick phone call to ask if a substitute was ok .
Flowers	flowers not delivered on valentines_day , its the one day of the year they have to get it right and they completely let me down , i want a full_refund and i want it now , 0 : 00 they will be getting call .
Flowers	my gf got me a lovely present and my suprise flowers to her work now makes me look like a knob head , cheers iflorist you have probably just lost yourself 0000s of customer and i hope you go out of business as a result
Flowers	easy to order online and competitive_pricing .
Flowers	haven ' t heard from the recipient but i was updated with dispatch notes at every_step .
Flowers	thanks !
Flowers	serenata do exactly_what they say they do , they offer a great floral service .
Flowers	the flowers i ordered were delivered promptly and i liked the text updates - when the order was placed , when the flowers left their premises and once they were delivered .
Flowers	just awful !
Flowers	i advise all not to order from here .
Flowers	the flowers were well worth the money , they were worth double what i paid at_least .
Flowers	would definitely use again
Flowers	my friend lost her bouquet at her wedding , so whilst she was on honeymoon i wanted to have a replica bouquet made for her as a surprise so she had something to keep .
Flowers	i was concerned that i may not be able to get it done quickly enough but silk_blooms were able to give me a quote within an_hour of my enquiry ( which was last thing on a friday ) and i had the finish bouquet with me on the following wednesday !
Flowers	they didn ' t have the best photos to work from as i wasn ' t able to find any close up pics in that short_period of time but from my description and a couple of zoomed in images they created something absolutely perfect !
Flowers	very reasonably and flexibly priced .
Flowers	would definitely_recommend this company to anyone .
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	great flowers , turned_up on the right day and friendly service .
Flowers	will always use
Flowers	not sure if they just hire a useless courier service ( as per review below ) who apparently couldn ' t find two st . bernards if they were in the same telephone booth as them or they are just ripping me off .
Flowers	i don ' t think it ' s the latter and hope not .
Flowers	ordered flowers for my mum ' s birthday .
Flowers	got a text_saying problem with delivery .
Flowers	phone up , can ' t find her house .
Flowers	it isn ' t hard .
Flowers	it ' s now four days_later still can ' t find her house despite explicit instructions on how to locate it and in addition to this my phone number if they get lost ( which they didn ' t use ).
Flowers	people on the phone at the flower place seemed okay and were very apologetic .
Flowers	they did seem like they were pretty annoyed with the couriers .
Flowers	they said they would give me a refund .
Flowers	if that comes through then fair_enough but still not good enough .
Flowers	what ' s the point of ordering something for an occasion if it doesn ' t get there ?
Flowers	quote from their site " your flowers are with our trusty couriers ".
Flowers	pfft .
Flowers	next time i will read reviews before i go with a company .
Flowers	edit_: flowers arrived this morning , both lots as they replaced them as the original were no doubt pretty dead by now !
Flowers	i think they phoned the couriers and gave them a well_deserved bollocking - this time the couriers bothered phoning and got instructions to find the house - so that ' s good .
Flowers	i give plus 0 star from the original two .
Flowers	there ' s no ill intent to rip anyone off that i can see .
Flowers	they also put a money off voucher in and i ' m_assuming i ' ll also get a refund so other than the hassle and cost of phoning an 0000 number from a mobby good service from the flower company to be fair to them - couriers need sacking i think .
Flowers	evening i needed , would recommend and use again
Flowers	i was able to send a beautiful bouquet to my friend all the way from new_zealand without any hassles or worries .
Flowers	very quick service and good delivery tracking_information .
Flowers	great price !
Flowers	reading everyone elses reviws it seems we have all had the same problem ... i found out my boyfriend had ordered me 00 red_roses at 0 . 00pm on valentines_day as he asked me if anything had arrived at my work , i said no , i wasnt expecting anything so wasnt annoyed , but i was annoyed when i found out he had spent £_00 on flowers for me that the company never delivered , especially as all of the numbers on the website dont work !
Flowers	he didnt buy on a credit_card so there is no cover .
Flowers	i will be letting all my facebook frieds know about this scam of a company and repirting them to watchdog !
Flowers	terrible service !!
Flowers	ordered flowers to be delivered for mothers_day , arrived two days early when they can ' t even be collected by the person as they are not there !
Flowers	not fresh flowers and look absolutely nothing like on the website !
Flowers	website live_chat will not work so have no way to contact them before mothers_day !
Flowers	could have got better flowers for £ 0 at the shop instead of spending £_00 with discount ... will request refund / proper flowers to be delivered !
Flowers	huge disappointment !
Flowers	!
Flowers	ordered flowers on 00 / 00 / 00 - paid extra for delivery by 0pm next_day .
Flowers	emailed yesterday at 0pm when no flowers received .
Flowers	no response to emails received .
Flowers	numerous phone_calls unanswered also .
Flowers	eventually got an order at 00 . 00 saying my order had been processed , and a further email at 00 . 00 to say order allocated .
Flowers	great - apart_from the fact it would now b delivered a day late at earliest
Flowers	i expect a full_refund or will take this further .
Flowers	and please don ' t cit weather as an excuse as it was fine in glasgow yesterday
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered yesterday in time for mothers_day i understood that they could be delivered at any point throughout the day , alas 0pm rolled around and still no sign of them .
Flowers	no email , no call , just nothing .
Flowers	now its mothers_day and i have no flowers to present my mother , iflorist i don ' t understand how you can think this is acceptable as its obviously happened to more people than myself looking at the reviews .
Flowers	your website fully promotes the idea of buying flowers for mothers_day and fast efficient delivery so how can you just not deliver anything to me especially when you know that many customers will be buying for that occasion .
Flowers	i would never ever buy from you again , and expect a full_refund if your customer_service team ever answer the emails and phone_calls i have given .
Flowers	dont trust the positive_reviews its not worth the possibility of getting let_down for an important occasion .
Flowers	disappointed .
Flowers	before i placed an order i confirmed on live_chat and via_email about delivering flowers to madeira , and both have confirmed they can to the address i supplied , when i came to delivery day , got an_email they cant pick_up the address and cant deliver , took them 0 days to do nothing !!!!
Flowers	very upsetting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Flowers	all staff at iflorist dont no the difference_between portugal and madeira !!!!!!!
Flowers	went to another company and got flowers delivered same day and they can deliver to madeira !
Flowers	i ordered the new princess bouquet from the website and the quality was really poor and its was a lot smaller_than it appeared on the picture .
Flowers	there ' s no way i would look at the bouquet and say it was worth £_00 that i paid for it .
Flowers	i immediately emailed them to complain and they sent a stock response abut the right to substitute flowers and missed the point that it had no resemblance to the product i ordered and that it wasn ' t value for money .
Flowers	i ' ve since emailed them again asking them to restore my faith in the company and either replace the bouquet or take it back for a refund .
Flowers	i ' ve not heard any response from them since .
Flowers	i can understand that poor quality bouquets are inevitable from time to time , but the aftercare when i complained about it is poor to the point that i ' d never recommend them .
Flowers	i made an order 0 days prior to valentines_day and was guaranteed delivery before 0pm on 00th_feb ... it is now midday on the 00th_feb and they have turned_up finally , but with a very low quality and some gifts missing !
Flowers	i have tried_contacting them for days now via phone , email and their so called chat service with nobody getting back to me !
Flowers	a business should never over promise and under deliver ...
Flowers	i feel truly let_down by this company .
Flowers	i have had an issue with this company on my previous order but i gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried them again .
Flowers	yup i should have learnt from the last time .
Flowers	i wont go into details of what happened last time .
Flowers	i will tell you about this order .
Flowers	ordered flowers for my mothers birthday .
Flowers	i received a text in the morning saying that the delivery was failed due to damage via transit .
Flowers	they emailed and said they would get the order out as soon as possible .
Flowers	email about 0pm on the day says the flowers were delivered .
Flowers	my mother advised me that the flowers were damaged .
Flowers	the courier gave a £ 0 off voucher to my mother , saying it was because of the damage ( serenata say they give £ 0 vouchers with all the orders as part of a special offer - erm wouldn ' t the people who purchased the flowers be more appreciative of this voucher then ?
Flowers	or perhaps that was a lie and it was given due to the damage ) - i ' ll come back to this ...
Flowers	so ... i contacted there customers services and asked for a refund , and told them they can take their flowers and voucher back .
Flowers	reply from serenata : take pictures of the damage and send to them and they will investigate - erm right so i need to go to my mothers and take pictures , why don ' t i just pop by tesco and get some flowers whilst im at it ?
Flowers	erm the point of using the company is because i don ' t have time for these things !
Flowers	i told them that ' s not feasible and explained it defeats the purpose of purchasing from them and advised that they themselves gave a £ 0 voucher in recognition of the fact its damaged - leading to the reply that its an offer etc
Flowers	they agreed it was silly , and offered to send a replacement as a gesture of goodwill .
Flowers	a gesture of goodwill is something companies new where they have not messed_up but want to go the extra_mile to retain your customer .
Flowers	it is not a gesture of goodwill they should be giving , they should be fulfilling my damn order .
Flowers	pathetic .
Flowers	flowers arrived two days late and were completely dead on arrival .
Flowers	the courier completely_ignored the fact that the product was insufficient and the customer_service was useless and unhelpful .
Flowers	i had to contact the company on an 0000 number which also cost me .
Flowers	i was offered a refund or a replacement product , even_though a refund would not help to recover of the flowers and i had no faith that a replacement bunch would not also be dead .
Flowers	i was refused both and over all am completely disgusted with the company and will avoid them in future and go out of my way to make_sure others do too .
Flowers	bought my mum some flowers for mothers_day off of this website , big_mistake !
Flowers	she is very upset and i am fuming .
Flowers	worst thing i have ever bought . nothing like what its supposed to , they delivered only a poxy 0 flowers which were not even supposed to be in the bouquet , who_knows what happened to the ones that were .
Flowers	£_00 on something i could have got from the shop for a tenner , please dont waste your money .
Flowers	also paid an extra £ 0 for the deluxe version , hate to see what a standard bouqet is like , one flower and some grass , god only knows .
Flowers	have used interflora before , much_better quality of flowers , actually look how they are supposed to .
Flowers	the pictures on this site are false_advertising .
Flowers	worse thing i have ever bought off the internet .
Flowers	avoid at all costs .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for valentines for my girlfriend on monday 00th for valentines , which on their website was seen as the last day to do this .
Flowers	i expressed that my girlfriend is a teacher so expect flowers at_least by 0pm .
Flowers	i never received any tracking_numbers or order updates .
Flowers	just had " allocated " as a status online .
Flowers	this is reprehensible and disgusting .
Flowers	my girl showered me with love and presents , and wanted to delight her at work .
Flowers	i tried_phoning to get status_updates , but they are not answering phones !
Flowers	not answering phones on the biggest flower day of the year !!!
Flowers	unacceptable .
Flowers	i will demand a full_refund ... i ' ll never stray from [_link ] or [_link ] again !
Flowers	update 00 / 00 / 00
Flowers	ok , so received an_email_saying flowers delivered at 00pm today .
Flowers	obviously this is too_late , so still wanted a refund .
Flowers	on my second attempt at calling , i got through .
Flowers	they are finally answering calls .
Flowers	did a little digging around and there ' s like 00 people working in the office , you can hear calls going off all the time .
Flowers	actually spoke to a lad called [_name ] who in fact was pleasant enough and very apologetic .
Flowers	he basically admitted that they overstretched themselves and were aware of all the complaints .
Flowers	seriously , ask them questions about their business , why this is happening and what ' s there working environment is like , you soon get a picture of how everything is run there . anyway , he was quick to lay the blame with the local_florist .
Flowers	apparently the florist said he tried to deliver but was refused entry ( highly unlikely as i ' ve had flowers sent to my teacher girlfriend ' s school 0 times before ).
Flowers	he then try to redeliver in the evening , duh school is closed .
Flowers	funny thing is my email said flowers were delivered , but they never were !!!
Flowers	apparently this florist will be penalised .
Flowers	got an_email_saying i will get a full_refund in 0 - 0 days , so fingers_crossed .
Flowers	i ' ve figured out if you are calm and polite but forthright and determined .
Flowers	i . e .
Flowers	i held them on the phone for 00 min until i got confirmation that the refund email had arrived ( i still don ' t trust them ) you should get your refund !
Flowers	good luck everyone ... hopefully the money will be in my account soon .
Flowers	p . s .
Flowers	where ' s my gift from the md ?
Flowers	needed to get some flowers sent to a friend who lives miles_away , made order around 00am on sat and my very happy friend had them a few hours_later .
Flowers	can not fault this services one bit
Flowers	when i ordered the flowers i didnt see anywhere where it said between 0 - 0pm , so it was delivered when i was out , the guy who delivered left the box in the floor and walked off , when my partners mum said whats this he said " dno " and walked off .
Flowers	the flowers were very nice and a very good size .
Flowers	but that is the only good thing about it .
Flowers	delivery service and everything else was simply rubbish and next time i will use another company .
Flowers	well its true .
Flowers	what happened to supporting the local_florist shop ??
Flowers	weve all gone for the convenient cheap offers these flash web sites offer .
Flowers	my local_florist shop sends out a dozen black bacara , eucalyptus and cherry blossom yesterday for 00 . 00 .
Flowers	they were awsome .
Flowers	delivered by hand by trusted staff from the florist shop .
Flowers	yes i have ordered from iflorist till my local_florist showed me her i florist account .
Flowers	a 00 . 00 order she executes gives her £_00 . 00 00 days_later .......... i florist make a profit from sending her the order !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i florist orders delivered from a wharehouse in the midlands made by migrant workers and distributed by [_link ] distribution who yes ..... have been on watchdog !!
Flowers	and are linked to [_link ].
Flowers	smell a fish ?
Flowers	my local_florist hasent recieved one single valentine order in the last_week .
Flowers	so where did they all go ??
Flowers	[_link ].
Flowers	yep a distribution wharehouse in the midlands ....... getting the picture yet ??
Flowers	fishyyyyyyy !
Flowers	common watch_dog ... look_into [_link ] who according to companies house are a dormant account with no asetts .. wowza have i been digging .
Flowers	i ordered printed seed packets to be used as wedding favours .
Flowers	i simply sent my own pdf design with the order and then received beautiful seed packets that i can fill nearer the date .
Flowers	the service was easy and straightforward and i knew what was happening at every_stage of the process .
Flowers	the seed packets were delivered quickly and cost much less_than the others i had seen online .
Flowers	i would definitely order again and have bookmarked the website for future reference .
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	i order a dozen roses on february 0nd to be delivered on valentines_day .
Flowers	after making many international_calls .. costing me more money since i ' m in the us and trying to surprise my girlfriend who is studying abroad in london for the semester ..
Flowers	i practically ran around in circles for 0 hours between them and their delivery service .
Flowers	they never answer their phones and have told me 0 different stories on why the flowers were not delivered even_though i gave specific instructions on how and when to deliver them .
Flowers	i understand valentines_day is a busy day , i totally get that .
Flowers	but this has been one of the worst experiences of my life .
Flowers	girlfriend is pissed because all of her friends got flowers from their boyfriends and she didnt .
Flowers	i want to tell her that i got them but i ; m still trying to surprise her ( hoping they come today , the 00th ) this has literally been one of the worst experiences and i wish i would have read the reviews before i bought them ...
Flowers	i ' m pretty sure i have never been this pissed_off before
Flowers	i ordered flowers and some additional products for around 00 pounds for my girlfriend on valentines_day , it ' s now the 00th and still nothing arrived to her house .
Flowers	i haven ' t been refunded and no information has been given .
Flowers	she took a day off work in order to receive her gift , now she has to live with the fact that she only has 00 more days of holiday for the rest of the year .
Flowers	so far so good i had easy use of the website and a wide_variety of choices along with very reasonable prices .
Flowers	would be very happy to shop here again
Flowers	i ordered my flowers on friday 00th_march for delivery mothers_day ( 00th )
Flowers	the website actually said '' still taking orders for mothers_day ''
Flowers	i received an_email at 00 : 00 on mothering_sunday saying they could not deliver my flowers .
Flowers	bit late to let me know this .
Flowers	they offered to upgrade for free and deliver it as soon as possible .
Flowers	awful service , rubbish communication and would never order from them again .
Flowers	thanks for nothing .
Flowers	only the second time i ' ve used your service , but frankly it is as simple as amazon to use .
Flowers	simply select what you need and enter the appropriate addresses .
Flowers	nothing more .
Flowers	i especially like that you can sign in as a guest so that you don ' t need to do a full register .
Flowers	prompt delivery , ordered in the evening - arrived in the morning .
Flowers	very pleased with the service !
Flowers	ordered flowers on two_separate_occasions for my mum and have been completely_satisfied both_times - flowers arrived on time , were beautifully_presented and lasted longer_than all other_companies i have used in the past .
Flowers	furthermore , the prices are really good for anyone trying to watch the pennies with great offers - will_definitely continue to order from them !
Flowers	was my mother ' s birthday and i am 0000 km away .
Flowers	she didn ' t receive the flowers .
Flowers	the order was not delivered on time but the csm support gave me a compensation and a nice quick responses over twitter .
Flowers	thanks guys , i know it was not your fault but it was a very special day .
Flowers	i will use your services again for sure .
Flowers	not usually one for reviewing things online , but this is genuinely one of the worst companies i have ever_dealt_with .
Flowers	not only have the flowers i paid for ( with an extra ' before 0pm ' delivery charge ) never arrived , no one from the website has responded to any email or ' live_chat ' message , im sat here almost a week_later with no flowers , no money and most of all absolutely no_idea whats_going on ?
Flowers	!
Flowers	i couldnt have found a fault in product or service ,
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	i ordered flowers for delivery in paris .
Flowers	despite the order being ‘ allocated ’ and being told they would be delivered yesterday , nothing .
Flowers	i even provided the number of the person living there to call if any_problems but they have not heard_anything ??
Flowers	i have contacted the customer_service but currently offline which is useful …..
Flowers	i will update as and when i hear something and also the quality of the flowers .
Flowers	easy , efficient and great value for money .
Flowers	ordered one month in_advance for 00 feb 00 .
Flowers	emailed company twice , no response .
Flowers	no flowers still on 00 feb 00 , cancelled order thereafter .
Flowers	paid £_00 for a bouquet to be delivered to my mum for her_birthday and not worth the money at all .
Flowers	very small amount of flowers and when they arrived a couple of them had the heads hanging off where they hadn ' t been handled correctly - disappointed after using this service before and getting a good quality present .
Flowers	won ' t be using these again .
Flowers	absolutely_brilliant service , ordered at nearly 00pm and they were delivered free by 0pm the following_day !
Flowers	was kept up to date all through the process with emails and texts .
Flowers	would definitely_recommend these_guys !
Flowers	and the flowers are beautiful too !
Flowers	really made my friend ' s day :_d
Flowers	funny how the same people below are leaving the same " positive " comments on a number of review sites .... work for arena and trying to salvage some of your reputation before mothers_day by any chance ?
Flowers	a despicable tactic employed by arena after the fiasco that was valentines_day , thousands of people left out of pocket and with no flowers on valentines_day !
Flowers	over a week_later still no flowers ... and still_waiting , chasing and being fobbed_off for my refund !
Flowers	don ' t get your mothers_day flowers from these people if you actually want them delivered on mothers_day !
Flowers	customer_service non_existent !
Flowers	my advice .... go to a local_florist .
Flowers	love is a theorem that every day you need to prove ( c ) archimedes
Flowers	and how to prove your love ?
Flowers	of course , to give the flowers .
Flowers	still , it is an issue , when you are at your homeland and your girl is in england .
Flowers	serenataflowers helped_me to solve this problem .
Flowers	it is a great international experience .
Flowers	i realized that i can trust the foreign companies .
Flowers	and i don ' t think this very company has a lot of international customers :)
Flowers	thank_you all , the flowers and additional items were delivered on time and the girl has butterflies in her stomach !
Flowers	i ordered the rose and lily bouquet for my nana , for delivery on the 0th_march_0000 ( her_birthday ) .
Flowers	they did arrive , but were in a horrific state !
Flowers	the ' bouquet ' only consisted of 0 roses ( 0 of which had broken stems ), and other 0 were wilting and brown around the edges .
Flowers	the lilys were not open and are brown on top , and look like they are never going to open .
Flowers	i have tried_phoning iflorist but they are not answering their phone which is awful customer_service .
Flowers	i am going to report them to watch_dog and the trading_standards authority .
Flowers	do not use them !
Flowers	!
Flowers	fabulous , not too pricey and arrived on time .
Flowers	what more could you want ...
Flowers	exactly the same as everyone_else .
Flowers	no flowers and no workable phone number .
Flowers	a disgrace .
Flowers	its ok though , they ' ve taken my money !!!!
Flowers	if anybody has any luck getting through please advise how .
Flowers	thanks .
Flowers	i ' ve used serenata several_times now and have never been disappointed .
Flowers	their sms service to keep you informed all through dispatch and delivery is reassuring .
Flowers	the recipients have always been delighted with the flowers and best of all serenata reward existing_customers with discounts :) what more could you ask for ?
Flowers	!
Flowers	the flowers were beautiful and arrived on time . easy to order and pay . would recommend to others
Flowers	i ordered 0 bunches of flowers to 0 separate locations on new year ' s eve .
Flowers	the iflorist website told me they would be delivered on the 0nd january .
Flowers	on the 0rd of january i was alerted to the fact that none of the flowers had yet arrived to their destination .
Flowers	i tried to call iflorist but they do not have a telephone_number .
Flowers	when i used their email ticket system i got a reply to say their offices were closed .
Flowers	later this evening i have received numerous email_confirmations that my orders have now been allocated and will be delivered on the 0nd of january !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	as i have not received the orders as requested and promised , and iflorist is clearly an incapable and unpersonal company , i will be asking for my order to be cancelled and for a full_refund .
Flowers	this doesn ' t compensate me for the lack of 0 bunches of flowers where i wanted them , when i wanted them .
Flowers	i will be recommending to as many people as possible not to use this company as their service is terrible .
Flowers	ordered flowers for mothers_day £_00 worth .
Flowers	checked with my elderly mother ( 00 ) and display consisted of 0 nearly dead roses !
Flowers	terrible service don ' t use these people !
Flowers	i would definitely_recommend flora_queen .
Flowers	i am in the uk and sent flowers to my partner in la for our anniversary .
Flowers	i was pretty apprehensive but gave it a go and i ' m pleased to say all went very very smoothly !
Flowers	she was out but luckily her flatmate was in , and she took the flowers in for her .
Flowers	she showed me the flowers on skype and i thought they were absolutely lovely and very similar to the picture on the website .
Flowers	the only thing i would say is the whole_process is quite pricey but flawless service .
Flowers	i can ' t thank flora_queen enough for helping to put such a huge smile on such a special girl ' s face !
Flowers	!
Flowers	also , it ' s a little_confusing because they tell you you ' ll receive an_email once the flowers have been delivered .
Flowers	i did receive an_email but it wasn ' t till three or so hours after the delivery - so don ' t conclude the delivery didn ' t happen if you don ' t get an_email straight_away !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	super_fast and amazing customer_service .
Flowers	used it first time , the flower was so fresh and definitely value for money .
Flowers	highly_recomended
Flowers	************* do not use this service !!
Flowers	****************
Flowers	i ordered flowers for the 00 / 00 and 00 / 00 .
Flowers	the 00 / 00 flowers were 0 days late and a complete state when opened .
Flowers	and i am still_waiting for the 00 / 00 delivery , expecting the same once opened .
Flowers	i really wish i had seen the other reviews before purchasing .
Flowers	such a disaster , online_chat never working and when emailed , received the same empty gesture of goodwill as others (£ 0 voucher_code ).
Flowers	not going to use the service again so voucher_code didn ' t work in generating return purchases .
Flowers	amazing and fast service
Flowers	i have used serenata_flowers many_times and cannot_fault them .
Flowers	they are superb value for money and delivery is always on time , on the requested day and my recipients are always delighted with the flowers !
Flowers	the recipient was overjoyed , the irises were full bloom and looked outstanding .
Flowers	flowers and chocolates ordered on 00th by my boyfriend to be delivered to me on the 00th as a surpised .
Flowers	supposed to be before 0pm and he paid the extra money for this .
Flowers	over 00_hours still nothing and as i ' m not in work today would be pointless anyway !!
Flowers	no reply to his email and no valid telephone_number to call on .
Flowers	so you ' ve basically taken his money and not delivered anything ??
Flowers	what ' s the point in offering a service you can ' t provide and ruining people ' s special days ?
Flowers	could refund him asap and explain ?
Flowers	i ordered these flowers for my nans birthday , i did order them over the easter_weekend so this may be why i had issues , however a well_established company should be able to anticipate and adapt during busy_periods of the year .
Flowers	the flowers where not delivered , i had an_automated email_saying they had been routed to the wrong depot but no email from an actual person with an_apology or explanation a s to what they where doing to rectify this issue , i am not sure if they would have if i hadn ' t have contacted them first . they then offered a full_refund , or to let the flowers run their natural course which i told them was not acceptable ; my nan lives on her own an looks forward to receiving flowers for her_birthday due to the bank_holiday as well she had not receive her_birthday_present she was very upset by this .
Flowers	after a few attempts they said they would redeliver at a time of my choice obviously i said asap .
Flowers	the flowers where delivered by the thursday ( total of 0 days late ).
Flowers	my nan did love the flowers i ordered the blue dendrodeums i was told they where amazing and that she had never seen anything like them so that was a kind of happy ending despite the frustration .
Flowers	overall disappointing delivery service , ok customer_service .
Flowers	the flowers where lovely , so i would recommend with caution .
Flowers	love using iflorist for sending people flowers , anyone i send them too always comment on how beautiful the flowers are .
Flowers	there are always very reasonably_priced and spot on with delivery .
Flowers	think i will always use them as never have any_problems !
Flowers	!
Flowers	after having a terrible time ( flowers not delivered on my gran ' s birthday ) with interflora , i was looking for a new service .
Flowers	i ' ve found them with serenata_flowers .
Flowers	excellent communication , telling_me via text the status of my delivery all the way .
Flowers	flowers arrived and my gran was very pleased - brownie_points for me !
Flowers	this is the only service i ' ll be using for any flower delivery now .
Flowers	i don ' t normally_write_reviews unless something bad has happened , but they really excelled themselves compared to interflora .
Flowers	thanks .
Flowers	disgusting company .
Flowers	not only did they fail to delivery flowers on valentines_day as promised , the customer_service was non_existent .
Flowers	if they knew that they would not be able to fulfil their obligation , they should of notified their customers .
Flowers	i would of thought that this was the least they could do .
Flowers	instead they didn ' t answer their telephone or reply to emails .
Flowers	instead they delivered flowers the next_day , no discount or apology offered .
Flowers	was forced to go through paypal resolution centre and thankfully received a refund .
Flowers	this does not correct the fact that valentines_day was a total wash out !
Flowers	so to sum up , if your considering ordering from arena_flowers you would have more luck throwing your money down the toilet .
Flowers	the worst company ever !
Flowers	avoid at all cost !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	the website was easy to navigate , prices were obvious and the selection was good
Flowers	highly_recommended , fast and great service .
Flowers	ordered flowers on wednesday to be deleivered on mothers_day , no sign of them on sunday .
Flowers	online support were " away " all day , finally got through to someone at about 0pm - no explanation as to why the flowers had not arrived , offered an upgraded bunch to be delivered on tuesday , i told them this was no use as i had already had to buy flowers from a more reputable source and i would just like a refund , i was then told this would be put through .
Flowers	flowers arrived today ( monday ), a bunch of dead carnations ?!
Flowers	i ordered roses and lilys , not a rose in sight .
Flowers	the flowers are just a disaster , have emailed to see if i am still getting refund - once again no reply !
Flowers	avoid at all costs !
Flowers	!
Flowers	everything you need in one place at the click of a button
Flowers	i received two bouquets of flowers via this company for my birthday from two different senders .
Flowers	both were sub - standard but one was just about salvagable , whereas the other died the following_day !
Flowers	i have contacted the company and was asked to send a photo in , which i did .
Flowers	since then it ' s been nothing but silence and my follow_up emails have been ignored .
Flowers	i can ' t believe that my friends paid money for this service and the company didn ' t even bother to offer an_apology , yet alone the resolution .
Flowers	avoid iflorist is the only advice i can offer .
Flowers	i recently ordered three sets of flowers , from prestige_flowers , for mother ' s day .
Flowers	every_single bunch we ordered was extremely poor , with the flowers wilting within the first day !
Flowers	we relayed this back to pf , asking for a refund , instead we were told they do not offer refunds and cannot even supply a new set of flowers , as we had taken too long to let them know .
Flowers	the fact is we are based in the us and only speak with our family once a week , so in turn only discovered the poor quality a week_later .
Flowers	no exceptions were made however .
Flowers	i found their response and helpfulness very blunt .
Flowers	they have our money , why do anything_else ?
Flowers	one of the worst online companies i have experienced .
Flowers	failed on every part of ' service '.
Flowers	i ordered a bunch of " lemon sorbet " flowers for mother ' s day and while the delivery was faultless , the bunch received was a " mum in a million ".
Flowers	while equal in value this was not what i had ordered or paid for .
Flowers	i attempted to use their supposedly efficient , quick and easy online live_chat but ironically it displayed that every department was offline .
Flowers	i emailed in case my " live_chat " message had not got through and after two days there was no sign of anything being done about it .
Flowers	i eventually called the company up and on the last tone of the second attempt i got through to someone .
Flowers	i was informed that i couldn ' t have a refund as in the small_print for mother ' s day flowers it says that everything is subject to availability and can be substituted with a similar bunch if they don ' t have the one required .
Flowers	maybe i should have trawled through the terms and conditions but it would have been more realistic to have a more explicit warning of this .
Flowers	however i was told that while he wouldn ' t usually do this ( oh sure ) he could send me the bunch i ordered free of charge .
Flowers	that has been ordered and i received a £ 0 voucher for another purchase as i was making the call .
Flowers	i can ' t help feeling the " equal value substitute " is an excuse to send people a cheaper to produce , slightly dog - eared bunch and get away with it .
Flowers	in conclusion i ' m slightly suspicious but to be fair they sorted the issue out politely , very quickly once i called and i am satisfied with the outcome .
Flowers	even if mother ' s day has past , a second ( nicer_than the original ) bunch will be greatly_appreciated i ' m sure !
Flowers	i would probably order from them again but i will read the t &_c ' s first .
Flowers	if anyone_else is having trouble - call them to sort it out .
Flowers	im happy with the service received .
Flowers	the delivery was great .
Flowers	on time , great notifications , swift payment . the biggest downside was the flowers itself .
Flowers	i paid for the grandissimo flowers but in return think the flowers wer normal , not full not bigger from the picture shown at all .
Flowers	so money not spent well as is was a special gift from my son to his aunty .
Flowers	will stick to interflora next time
Flowers	always impressed with the quality and longevity of the flowers - as are the people who receive them .
Flowers	excellent quality and a competitive price ( i have shopped_around a lot online ).
Flowers	excellent service .
Flowers	also because the prices are competitive as well , i buy flowers a lot more_than i have ever done in the past .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for mothers_day on saturday at about midday , they were delivered on sunday_afternoon .
Flowers	i was very impressed with the communication from serenata as they emailed me when the flowers were dispatched and again when they had been delivered .
Flowers	my mum wasn ' t actually in when the flowers were delivered as i didn ' t want to ruin the surprise by telling her to expect them .
Flowers	however the delivery person left the flowers in the " outhouse " and put a card through the door .
Flowers	cracking service , will use again .
Flowers	thanks ,
Flowers	lee
Flowers	i ordered a lovely bunch called botanics for my mum for mother ' s day .
Flowers	i ordered at the beginning of the week to ensure that there would be no issues when it came to delivering them at the weekend .
Flowers	i also chose to have my card delivered with the flowers .
Flowers	i was so disappointed to find that today that they have delivered the complete wrong bunch of flowers and there is no card included .
Flowers	it has ruined mother ' s day as i now have an awful looking bunch of flowers ( the complete polar opposite to what i ordered , cheap , tiny , garishly coloured roses ) and no card to present to my mum tomorrow .
Flowers	on such an important day i cannot_believe_how badly i have been let_down by iflorist .
Flowers	this was my first order from the company and i certainly will never order again .
Flowers	do not rely_on them to deliver for any important occasions !
Flowers	i purchased £_00 of gift_vouchers and was shocked to see that i was charged £ 0 delivery .
Flowers	as these are simple paper vouchers they could be posted with a first_class stamp for £ 0 . 00 !
Flowers	i emailed customer_services about this and they haven ' t even bothered to reply .
Flowers	shocking service .
Flowers	after stumbling across this site after searching google for my usual florists , i was extremely happy with the flowers , price and service .
Flowers	i was at the house when the person i bought them for went to collect them from her neighbour .
Flowers	the smile on her face was amazing and well worth every_penny spent .
Flowers	the flowers were great and she was very impressed .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	i used them for valentines_day to order my girlfriend her favourite flowers " gerberas ".
Flowers	i ' d also used these people in december for gerberas to my girlfriend ...
Flowers	in december i had got the 00 . 00 regular size and postage_costs ...
Flowers	however as this new order was for valentines_day ....
Flowers	i ordered the largest size 00 . 00 ... and the large box of chocolates and the vase and the teddy_bear ... £_00 total .
Flowers	the flowers turned_up at 0 :_00pm and they were the small size and i ordered the 00 . 00 bunch .
Flowers	seriously i didn ' t order roses so they would have had enough to fulfill a large gerberas order ...
Flowers	i emailed them and provided pictures and i was told they would contact me soon to resolve the situation , according to a member of staff called [_name ]... well not heard back , i want a refund for the difference_between the 00 . 00 bunch and 00 . 00 bunch .
Flowers	i will reverse the whole transaction if i have to via my bank .
Flowers	would never order from these people again they seem to have ruined everyone ' s valentines_day .
Flowers	why are people getting responses on here but iflorist have totally blanked me ?
Flowers	its a shame there isnt an option on this website to not leave any star_rating !!!
Flowers	so 0 weeks_ago i ordered my loving wife a bouquet of premium flowers that contained roses and lillies for valentines_day .
Flowers	courier brought them yesterday in a nice big fancy box .
Flowers	i opened the box to expect a lovely bunch of flowers but to my dismay i found 00 shriveled half_dead roses and nothing premium about them at all .
Flowers	i swear , a garage forecourt for a £ 0 would of been a better investment .
Flowers	due to the poor quality of flowers i emailed iflorist a picture yesterday but i havent had no contact from them at all !
Flowers	valentines_day is the 0 day a year i buy flowers because i dont believe its value for money for something that dies in less_than a week .
Flowers	i spent £_00 on a bunch of flowers that contained no lillies , 00 half_dead roses and a jazzy box .
Flowers	absolutely_disgusted with what i received and i know now that i should of gone to tesco and bought some for a £ 0 .
Flowers	thank_you iflorist for ruining my valentines gift to my wife and sending me the worse bunch of flowers i have ever_seen .
Flowers	you are a disgrace and i want a full_refund .
Flowers	i hope you read this message and give it some urgentcy as you obviously dont reply to the tickets that your customers submit in your support section deemed " critical "
Flowers	i welcome a response from you as i have pictures on my phone detailing how shocking your flowers are .
Flowers	check your emails for the picture i sent , reply with the condition of a full_refund and an_apology for ruining my valentines gift .
Flowers	lesson_learnt ...... spend £_00 on a pandora charm instead !!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	just tried_ringing them on the phone number provided on the website to give them a piece of my mind and it goes straight to an answer machine message_telling_me to send an_email .
Flowers	i am guessing they are receiving alot of calls from disgruntled_customers this morning .
Flowers	i am a member of some very large online community websites where i will name and shame if i dont get a reply on here or by email in the next hour of so .
Flowers	a very very unhappy customer
Flowers	i ordered the " simply gorgeous " bouquet for my sister in laws birthday .
Flowers	unfortunately the flowers that arrived are nothing at all like the picture your website displayed and had hardly any flowers .
Flowers	in fact , they are so small you would think i had only paid £_00 for them in comparison to other florists i have used in the past !
Flowers	they where absolutely tiny not only in quantity but also in height they looked pathetic .
Flowers	the other bouquet " paradise " while true to the description arrived half_dead !
Flowers	i contacted customer_services who told me the flowers where acceptable !
Flowers	so a complete_waste of time !
Flowers	i would never order from eflorist again and i would strongly_advise_anyone against using them .
Flowers	not only do they give poor value for money but they don ' t seem to care about customer_satisfaction !
Flowers	recently ordered some flowers for my little sister and i was amazed at how much contact was given ... from the moment i placed the order right until after confirming by sister had received them .
Flowers	your personal and quirky messages added that special touch and made me feel_confident in using your services again .
Flowers	0_stars all_round :)
Flowers	after browsing numerous florist sites , i settled on eflorist ' s vintage posy bouquet for a mother ' s day gift .
Flowers	the photo was beautiful , a bunch of pastel coloured assorted flowers in a gift bag .
Flowers	they were the nicest i had seen , and they would deliver on sunday 00th_march , mother ' s day .
Flowers	perfect !
Flowers	i happily placed my order , paid my money and didn ' t give it another thought .
Flowers	well , until my mum sent a photo of the flowers she received .
Flowers	initially i thought it was a joke , why had my mum sent a photo of funeral flowers ?
Flowers	unfortunately , the flowers my mum had received on mother ' s day would not look out of place set on top of a coffin , nor did they bear any resemblance to what i had ordered .
Flowers	i am fully open to florists using artistic licence when perhaps the particular flowers are unavailable , especially during a busy_period such as mother ' s day .
Flowers	however , there was zero level of artistry used when arranging my mum ' s flowers .
Flowers	they were disgusting , that is the only way i could describe them .
Flowers	i was so annoyed for my mum ' s sake .
Flowers	i ' m sure i could have found a nicer bunch of flowers at the local petrol_station .
Flowers	that ' s how bad they were .
Flowers	i have complained to eflorist , but i haven ' t heard a peep .
Flowers	i think my next step will be contacting_trading_standards regarding eflorist ' s poor product description .
Flowers	don ' t waste your time with eflorist , you will only be disappointed .
Flowers	ordered the parasol large flower_arrangement with vase for my partner on her return home from having our first child .
Flowers	the flowers were waiting in the porch along with 0 other flower deliveries .
Flowers	to say i was disappointed with them is an_understatement .
Flowers	i could have just bought some flowers from the local petrol_station and plonked them in a vase myself and they would have looked better .
Flowers	all our visitors commented on how " naff " the flowers looked and were certainly not worth the £_00 . 00 price_tag .
Flowers	there was not a lilly or rose to be seen although the internet picture portrays such a bunch .
Flowers	on contacting eflorist by phone and emailing photos to them of the bunch and telling them how awful the arrangement was i was told that actualy the arrangement was more_than adequate and that the picture on the web_page is for illustration only and no replacement would be sent .
Flowers	the flowers also wilted by day 0 and i contacted them again with regards to there 0 day stay fresh policy .
Flowers	i am still_awaiting a reply 00 days_later .
Flowers	do not use this company and instead use a local_florist or m & s flowers or some other reputable brand

Flowers	customer sevice is dreadful - no one ever answers the phone so send an_email and they should respond but you have to send a photo of the flowers in a certain timeframe which is tricky when you are most_likely sending them to someone !
Flowers	result - they offered me a replacement bunch of flowers and a money off online code - not happy as i bought over £_00 of flowers for mum and mother in law when u could have gine some far_superior flowers for half the price in a supermarket . so disapointing when you put your trust in a retailer . i will never use this company again and will stick to local_florists .
Flowers	ordered flowers for delivery on a friday they did not arrive .
Flowers	saturday they did not arrive , sunday they did not arrive , monday they did not arrive .
Flowers	arrived on tuesday nearly dead .
Flowers	they had been out of water for 0 days and were a pathetic bunch of freesia ' s not what i had bought .
Flowers	very embarrassing to send dead flowers as a surprise .
Flowers	it was as surprise but not a nice one .
Flowers	i want my money back .
Flowers	what a dreadful company !
Flowers	!
Flowers	simply the most ineffectual company i have ever come_across and clearly have no_idea how to deal with problems or queries .
Flowers	ordered flowers for same day delivery on monday 00th_july - it is now end of the day wednesday and they still have not been delivered despite us receiving a confirmation that they had been delivered .
Flowers	their ridiculous system of ' online forum ' is ludicrous and completely ineffectual .
Flowers	have been chasing for an answer for two days and have just been told i will be ' emailed ' when they know more .
Flowers	no email has been received .
Flowers	last conversation was they would ' try ' and get delivered tomorrow to which i said as they were three days late i wanted a full_refund for their terrible service to which they replied they could not do .
Flowers	no apology or refund offered .
Flowers	they could not care less about customers whereas interflora made a minor mistake and sent original bouquet plus an extra bunch and chocolates as an_apology .
Flowers	do not use this company .
Flowers	i ordered online and the flowers were delivered within 0 hours .
Flowers	brilliant .
Flowers	0 days have passed no flowers ?????
Flowers	even_though i ordered and paid on the 0th of feb so rubbish do not use ever
Flowers	flowers were good , but the message transcribed was described as unorganised and superimposed , making it difficult to read and of course appreciate the purpose of the flowers and meaning .
Flowers	serenata service definitely has lots of room for improvement .
Flowers	my flowers wasent deliverd on time 0days later was deliverd dead i av emailed so many_times its rediculas jus got very basic and patronising emails sent bak still_waiting for a refund absolute_joke avoid_avoid_avoid worst experience buying flowers ever !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i have the home address of both directors
Flowers	i ' m off to see the london one now
Flowers	i ' ll be back on here shortly
Flowers	no one in so before i find out its a poor accountants address ill go back round and keep going back round .
Flowers	in regards to people ideas about what will happen , best guess they will go pop in the comming months but there is a secondary company in the back groud waiting to start up and take over , you ' ll find it as a dormant company , perfectly legit but , same directors and called iflorist ltd and you ' ll find better contact details than the live company displays !
Flowers	cost a quid at companies house , publicly available infomation , i intend getting my money back , in person if necessary
Flowers	i have had a letter today , it ' s auto generated with a digital signature so i ' m_assuming i ' m one of many , full_refund on its way , an_apology & an offer of £_00 off of another order .
Flowers	at_least they came to the party but , iflorist need to learn to have a little less greed , less orders , more staff are required .
Flowers	the service was excellent .
Flowers	was informed througout of where the item was at .
Flowers	only wished i had used it sooner !
Flowers	i cannot describe to you the disappointment i felt as i opened such a beautiful box to find the smallest most wilted bunch of flowers possible .
Flowers	the bouquet cost £_00 . 00 and for that amount you would expect some degree of quality .
Flowers	the best part of the delivery was in fact the box .
Flowers	there were no pink birch twigs , no ranunculus flowers and more peach than pink roses , so it did not match the description which was represented online giving me a false pretense of what i was expected to receive .
Flowers	i ordered the la belle medium bunch .
Flowers	so disappointed ... i hope other people ' s mothers ' days have not been such a let_down .
Flowers	i bought a bouquet of " deluxe " roses for s . valentine .
Flowers	when i made my order i even decided to upgrade it , to make_sure it would be similar to the picture .
Flowers	when the bouquet came it looked extremely cheap and all the flowers were closed , quite a disappointment .
Flowers	i waited 0 days for them to open , so that i could at_least enjoy it .
Flowers	after a week they started drying but none of them opened .
Flowers	when i contacted the customer_service they required me to send a picture of the day i received the bouquet , stating that they couldn ' t take into_consideration any complaint after 00h from the delivery .
Flowers	even_though i sent them a picture with the dry / closed flowers they said that it wouldn ' t prove anything and they didn ' t offer any refund or substitution .
Flowers	last time i ' ll use this company , extremely disappointing .
Flowers	pasquale
Flowers	ordered flowers to germany for my partner , who will be away for a few weeks .
Flowers	had been so excited that they would arrive in time for valentine ' s day .
Flowers	but nothing !
Flowers	no response to enquiries ( not even to the one sent 0 days ago ), phone just had a message_saying to email , and the live_chat has been offline for ages .
Flowers	online tracking did not work , but the money has been taken from my account already .
Flowers	i ' m not entirely sure this is any more_than a fraudulent operation , and i want my money back .
Flowers	have seen reply below - thanks .
Flowers	if my refund appears within 0 days , i will update the review .
Flowers	good service and quality , finest in the area .
Flowers	excellent product and company .
Flowers	they were the perfect gift !
Flowers	great communication from the seller and speedy_delivery .
Flowers	very reasonably_priced flowers and great choice .
Flowers	very good at keeping in contact and letting me know what was going on .
Flowers	i didn ’ t get to see the flowers but my friend ( the recipient ) absolutely loved them .
Flowers	i have given iflorist one star as the rating description says " considered as fraud " - i believe that to be true based on the picture of what i ordered compared to what i received .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered on mother ' s day - i paid extra to get them on the sunday .
Flowers	they arrived on the saturday and the delivery person didn ' t even knock on the door .
Flowers	my parents opened the door to leave and they were just propped on the door .
Flowers	we had been in all morning !
Flowers	i complained to iflorist who offered me a gift voucher .
Flowers	useless as i won ' t use them again .
Flowers	so i again asked for the difference in money value from saturday to sunday delivery .
Flowers	this should have been offered as standard .
Flowers	like i mentioned previously i believe the website mislead people with nice pictures of flowers that are nothing like what you receive .
Flowers	the flowers my mum received were lacking in colour and didn ' t even bloom properly and then they died a few_days_later .
Flowers	rubbish !
Flowers	no food for the flowers included either .
Flowers	the picture of the flowers were bright yellows and oranges .
Flowers	the price was reasonable which is why i chose them , but since receiving the flowers i can see that the price is not reasonable , it ' s blantant theft .
Flowers	they will reply saying that they are flowers and they try and deliver the best flowers possible , the usual standard comments .
Flowers	but in this instance i am convinced it is the company .
Flowers	my brother ordered a large bouquet for his girlfriend ' s 00st and was also amazingly disappointed with what arrived .
Flowers	she had also bought flowers for her mother for mother ' s day , again awful bouquet .
Flowers	i am saying do not use for two reasons .
Flowers	0 ) unreliable delivery
Flowers	0 ) awful and misleading bouquets
Flowers	crooks !
Flowers	iflorist - do not leave a standard " we give an excellent service " comment , because i know you don ' t and judging_by the reviews on this site alone , i am not the only one .
Flowers	one of the worst online shopping experiences i have ever had .
Flowers	under no circumstances would i use or reccommend this company .
Flowers	they did not deliver my mothers_day flowers on time , then when i tried to contact them by phone , web chat , email and social_media i recieved no response until the flowers were delivered .
Flowers	brutal service from a brutal company .
Flowers	do not use .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for mothers_day ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) but to be delivered the day .
Flowers	i then had to chase the order every day after until they were delivered on the 00 / 0 / 00 .
Flowers	i still had to pay the full_amount and it left my mother thinking no one cared , as her children all live far away .
Flowers	i was told same day delivery was not available and next_day delivery didnt happen either .
Flowers	there was no number to call and it took a few hours for a reply so i had no_idea what was going on .
Flowers	terrible service .
Flowers	would not recommend as it was a complete let_down .
Flowers	i bought some flowers from this site to be delivered this valentines_day .
Flowers	i was a little scared after i ' d read all the negative_reviews but the flowers were delivered on the day as promised , and they didn ' t look too different than the photo showed .
Flowers	i ' m very pleased and would definitely do business again .
Flowers	of course it was quite pricey but still !
Flowers	if it matters , i live in canada and the flowers were being delivered in geneva , switzerland .
Flowers	so glad i came_across silk_blooms .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for our_wedding and they are truly beautiful !
Flowers	as we were having our_wedding overseas i felt fake flowers would be an advantage , but did feel a little_apprehensive that they would not be as good as the real thing .
Flowers	i need never have worried , they look better_than the real thing and will now be a lasting memory !
Flowers	i couldn ' t have asked for more and would highly_recommend !
Flowers	excellent communication and delivery as scheduled .
Flowers	my girlfriend absolutely loved the flowers that i got her ... first time i ordered from here she loved them and i kept coming_back !
Flowers	every birthday , anniversary , valentines_day .
Flowers	absolutely love this company , you ' re there when i need you most !
Flowers	very easy process from start to finish , prices are very decent too and lots of free_stuff included !!
Flowers	nice one iflorist !
Flowers	will use this company again !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	not only is there a great choice of flowers but i also got a free card and chocolates with the promise of free delivery in time for mother ' s day .
Flowers	as an added_bonus , i received cashback on my purchase too .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for a relative in new_zealand as a present to be delivered on 0nd september .
Flowers	the flowers did not arrive on this date ( and still have not arrived ).
Flowers	i contacted iflorist by email and received an impressively prompt reply and was advised that they would contact me again once they had gotten hold of their florist / courier service in new_zealand .
Flowers	i received an_email later stating that they thought the flowers had been delivered at midday on 0nd september .
Flowers	i confirmed with my relative that this was not the case and responded asking for further details as my relative was in the house on sick leave for 0 weeks around the date of the requested delivery , and did not receive any flowers .
Flowers	following this email , i received an_email_saying that my order was being delivered ( sent just a few minutes after my email_confirming that my relative had not received the flowers ).
Flowers	i responded asking for confirmation of delivery address and asking whether they requested a signature for this delivery ( hoping it had been a case of being delivered to a neighbour ) and asking why i had only just received a delivery notification .
Flowers	i received a response confirming the address but not addressing any other queries .
Flowers	on asking for further clarification and having reiterated that the flowers were not delivered to this address on the requested date , i received an_email_stating :
Flowers	" thank_you for contacting iflorist .
Flowers	please give us some time while we check the delivery report .
Flowers	i have already escalated your order for delivery status .
Flowers	we deeply value your relationship with iflorist and are committed to providing you with the highest_level of service simply because our customers deserve the very best ."
Flowers	this was on 00th septemeber .
Flowers	on 00th_september , i requested an update and received an identical email from iflorist customer support .
Flowers	i replied asking when i could reasonably expect a response from them and received a further identical email , which i responded to explaining that i was extremely_unhappy , having paid over £_00 for flowers that were not delivered .
Flowers	i also said that i felt their customer_service was unacceptable and that i was very dissatisfied .
Flowers	i remain so , having received a further identical email and still no response .
Flowers	the advice on the website is to contact through email or live_chat for a response : i am getting no response from email and the live_chat is constantly showing as being offline .
Flowers	in addition the available contact number is an 0000 number which would be costly to call , and i am reluctant to do so given that iflorist have already had over £_00 from me for flowers they did not deliver and their customer_service to date has been appalling , despite their claim to provide the " highest_level of service " ( frankly , at this point i ' d settle for any customer_service ...)
Flowers	i would not recommend iflorist to anyone , not only did my flowers not arrive , but i have not yet received an explanation for where the flowers are ( or why iflorist are now ignoring my emails ).
Flowers	i have never had any reservations_about using serenata for flowers , and have used them exclusively for nearly seven years now .
Flowers	the flowers are always fresh , and often arrive just before flowering to ensure they are enjoyed for the longest period - and their longevity is impressive anyway .
Flowers	their customer_service is spot on , deliveries are reliable and the information they give when you have ordered a delivery is great .
Flowers	the arrangements are all stunning , and very reasonably_priced , with upgrades easily available as well .
Flowers	i would not use anyone_else for flowers .
Flowers	great experience having to place an order from the other side of the world !
Flowers	i received up - to - date emails as to where my order and delivery were at .
Flowers	great customer experience and will_definitely use serenata_flowers again .
Flowers	text and email notification of when and where my flowers were going to be delivered - brilliant .
Flowers	speedy service , nice website , simple to navigate and friendly emails with personal touches , would recommend .
Flowers	never have i been more disappointed in my life .
Flowers	i had such high expectations from the website that when i saw what we actually sent i couldn ' t be more horrified .
Flowers	flowers are meant to signify an important event and this company has ruined these events with such disappointing results !
Flowers	i used the website once not knowing how bad it might be .
Flowers	i ordered flowers in the orange and yellow colour scheme and received something that was very pink !
Flowers	how in the world is that an appropriate substitution ?!
Flowers	i am very knowledgeable when it comes to knowing flower types and what variations grow during certain time periods but this is completely inexcusable .
Flowers	after sending a complaint email i received a very pathetic apology letter saying that it would be taken care of .
Flowers	after weeks of no further correspondents i wrote a second letter in which i received a small discount and a very small apology replacement bouquet .
Flowers	i decided to give the company one last shot by ordering some birthday flowers for a friend .
Flowers	once again i was shocked to discover how completely_different the bouquet was from the flower_arrangement i chose .
Flowers	take my advice , do not use this company !
Flowers	it is a very obvious display of false_advertising and it is not worth the money !
Flowers	really happy with this website .
Flowers	easy to choose delivery day and was kept up to date with dispatch and delivery .
Flowers	flowers for mums_birthday , she was delighted with them .
Flowers	also a 0 %_discount at time of ordering so upgraded to deluxe bunch which made quite a difference
Flowers	best * fast * flowers
Flowers	convenient despatch and delivery alerts
Flowers	great flowers , fast delivery , would highly_recommend and will be using again !
Flowers	i found this site by chance and would definitely_recommend it .
Flowers	the flowers are very well_priced and the service is impeccable !
Flowers	i love the way you get a text to let you know about the status of your order .
Flowers	i have never known any site to do this before .
Flowers	fantastic service .
Flowers	bought flowers plus balloon on a stick for my mother in laws birthday and she said they were beautiful .
Flowers	arrived on time .
Flowers	this is now the third time i have used this company and would use them again in the future .
Flowers	thank_god for serenity .
Flowers	great and reliable would use again anytime .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for yesterday and they arrived on time .
Flowers	but i was sent a bunch of dead flowers most of the heads fell off in the box .
Flowers	i was ashamed to give these has a present and i ' ve rang the number on the website also for the london office manchester and birmingham all are saying there not taking calls .
Flowers	i have also emailed the company 0 times now and still no response .
Flowers	i don ' t know how a company could send out such a poor product please don ' t buy from these .
Flowers	hay - guess_what i sent laurence llewelyn bowen ' s team the below via facebook ( as he is the face of the company ), and they have been in touch with iflorist , i have had an_email from iflorist to say i am getting a full_refund .
Flowers	money not received yet .... but fingers_crossed this has been resolved .
Flowers	well_done laurence ' s team
Flowers	i like to be organised and ordered 0 gifts of different items to be delivered during feb and march_0000 .
Flowers	item 0
Flowers	valentines gift for my husband , a wine gift set .
Flowers	should have been delivered on the 00th_feb , was not received until the pm of the 00th_feb .
Flowers	i complained on the 00th_feb following their online process , and sent 0 more complaints , no reply was received until the 0rd march , where they said they would send the item again as a sorry .
Flowers	it is now the 00th_march and nothing received !
Flowers	item 0
Flowers	my mother birthday arrangement arrived on the 0th_march as request ... wait for it .... all the roses in the arrangement where dead , not just a bit wilted , but brown petals on each and every one !!
Flowers	! i took pictures and complained .
Flowers	still not even an acknowledgement received .
Flowers	even their marketing has got it wrong , i have received today 0 emails telling_me mothers_day is i 0 weeks and to get my flowers ordered – guys this was yesterday well_done !
Flowers	i can really do without this hassle and the poor quality and service just topped the whole experience off .
Flowers	will never use again , go with any other company this joke of a company will let you down every way possible
Flowers	do not buy totally untrustworthy i bought some monday and they said there is no contact number i send them the contact number and no reply to any message i have sent there is also no contact number this is a scandal and a ripoff
Flowers	delivered as promised , cannot_fault them :-)
Flowers	flowers received where not only of poor quality most of them were dried out to the point of dying .
Flowers	the flowers have been replaced by a much_better set from the local_supermarket at half the price .
Flowers	very disapointed :-(
Flowers	ordered some pink roses for my fiancee and i received a bunch of garden flowers with pink glitter on .
Flowers	sent picture to customer_service requesting that they replace the flowers with the right ones or give me a partial_refund .
Flowers	i paid for roses !
Flowers	not an art attack glitter mess .
Flowers	i got one reply saying they will look_into it and they replied .
Flowers	they cheat & scam to get orders .
Flowers	this company won ' t last long if it continues down this road .
Flowers	bad_reviews all over the internet and i only wish i looked before i ordered .
Flowers	won ' t be dealing_with again and will be alerting my facebook friends of the poor quality so they don ' t experience the service i received .
Flowers	ordered 0th_feb and paid for delivery too .
Flowers	no communication , no tracking_details and no delivery as of yet !
Flowers	will again rate at 0 / 0pm
Flowers	there is no chance in hell that i would ever use iflorist again , my money has been stolen , the goods have not been delivered , the live_chat is always offline , emails and phone_calls are going unanswered .
Flowers	complete and utter joke .
Flowers	my order was placed and i paid extra to guarantee mothers_day delivery needless to say i am in my mothers bad books because she thought i forgot about her - thanks for that iflorist !
Flowers	i have learnt my lesson , i ' ll be taking my custom elsewhere in future !
Flowers	just avoid trust me !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	ordered a bunch of flowers as a belated mothers_day gift , placed order at 0 . 00am ish for same day delivery .
Flowers	got a confirmation_email to say my order had gone_through and then another to say that it had been allocated and would be delivered on the 00 / 00 / 00 as requested .
Flowers	however nothing has turned_up and no email / call with either an explanation or apology .
Flowers	absolutely_disgraceful service infact - i wouldn ' t even call it a service .
Flowers	further follow_up reviews to follow as i take things further .
Flowers	the flowers never arrived .
Flowers	i paid and was guaranteed a next_day delivery , but nothing happened .
Flowers	and i only found out days_later - which was already way too_late .
Flowers	irate , i called to demand an explanation and was faced with a pre_- recorded voice telling_me that , apparently to make things easier , they no_longer take phone_calls and that i should email them instead .
Flowers	so with no other option i sent an appropriately angry email demanding an explanation and a refund .
Flowers	the reply i eventually got was that although the website advertises " guaranteed courier delivery " ( which i opted for ), i should have seen in their small_print that they cannot guarantee any delivery dates .
Flowers	completely contradictory and makes no sense at all !!
Flowers	there was no hint of apology what - so - ever , no mention of refund , nothing .
Flowers	if anything , the response was nothing short of curt and condescending .
Flowers	i urge you not to use this company , for anything , ever , under any circumstance .
Flowers	terrible .
Flowers	really really awful .
Flowers	disaster .
Flowers	great company kept me updates with every_step taken .
Flowers	highly_recommend and will use again :)
Flowers	right on time and great service .
Flowers	flowers were fresh and everyone ' s happy ...
Flowers	nice and easy purchase process and the flowers were delivered in the morning , well_presented and looking really good .
Flowers	this is the second time i have used eflorist and would be more_than happy to use them again in the future .
Flowers	a friend of mine in the uk gave birth , tried to send flowers because i was in germany and they claim to be the best flower delivery service in the uk , never got a confirmation , the flowers never arrived , they claim they delivered them so i didn ' t even get a refund and my friend possibly thinks i made the story up .
Flowers	very embarrassing , tried to contact customer_service , the phone numbers didn ' t work , the email i got from was from a noreply address , very suspicious !
Flowers	very nice flowers , and good timing
Flowers	i was never made aware that it could be delivered between 0 am and 0pm .
Flowers	i did it all on the mobile n it wasn ' t till i had to use the full site as they were not delivered yet .
Flowers	shout be more clear on all ways you can order them .
Flowers	never again , what a dreadful experience ... waited the whole day for this delivery and it arrived at 00 : 00 in the evening !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	so am i supposed to cancel all my plans to wait for the delivery ?
Flowers	it was supposed to be a surprise but had to end up telling my wife as she didn ' t seem impressed , killed the whole excitement !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	very happy with the entire service
Flowers	they promise to delivery this wonderful flowers that i order for my partner !
Flowers	all in good place !
Flowers	no problem with the service or timing .
Flowers	eveything was perfect .
Flowers	this company is a con and a bunch of d * ckheads .
Flowers	i ordered valentines_day flowers to be delivered today .
Flowers	i have just checked the courier ' s tracking website and the flowers have been returned back to the depot with out delivery ever being attempted .
Flowers	although i find this slightly annoying , my main grievance is with the cowboys at serenata_flowers .
Flowers	all of the numbers on their website are dead and they had the audacity to e_- mail me in the afternoon and supply me with another dead number , with the catch phrase " don ' t hesitate to call us if you have a problem "
Flowers	i am still trying to ring them , in the hope that somehow , this joke of a company can rectify the situation , but i am having no luck .
Flowers	i totally agree that this company is run by a bunch of amateur cowboys .
Flowers	we need to find the ceo of this c * ap company and write to him / her .
Flowers	a f * cking disgrace .
Flowers	i ' m sorry about the swear words .
Flowers	i am just soooo annoyed :(
Flowers	have ordered same day delivery explaining my wife finishes work at 0pm and still has not arrived .
Flowers	no customer_service available to call and only email .
Flowers	the turn_around time for email ; 00_hours !
Flowers	absolutely_shocking service .
Flowers	do not use
Flowers	i have put an order through for a ballerina bouquet on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
Flowers	delivery was suppose to be made on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
Flowers	after phoning customer_service , been told that one of their employees tried to contact me .
Flowers	never got any voice_mail or phone call ..
Flowers	now delivery has been moved even further to 00 / 00 /_0000 .
Flowers	feel very disappointed .
Flowers	this is my first and probably the last time when using their services .
Flowers	i am glad that despite the shocking reviews , my mothers 00th_birthday flowers came just in the nick of time .
Flowers	i think they need to dedicate a person or a team of people to deal with customer_relations because whats the point of the extra instructions if you cannot specify a time ?
Flowers	why can i not choose a time for delivery ?
Flowers	there should be sufficient customer_services , a means of calling the company to query or people dedicated to handling customer queries .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered 00_mins before my mum left for work and i would have been infuriated if they had not arrrived on time .
Flowers	they didnt look much like the picture so was disappointed .
Flowers	what a sorry excuse for deluxe flowers which looked so sparse .
Flowers	and the fact that they were delivered in a rubbish brown box , completely takes the shine off of it .
Flowers	additionally , i was a bit perturbed when i placed my order but didnt receive any confirmation or notification of my order until 0 days_later .
Flowers	i dont know what the point is of that really .
Flowers	thankfully , i dont order flowers too much but i wont be using serenata again .
Flowers	i found it all a bit haphazard and regular .
Flowers	i ordered a simple bouquet of flowers from serenataflowers to be delivered to my partner who lives at the same address as me for valentines_day .
Flowers	we waited in all day for them and despite receiving a dispatched email along with a delivery confirm email from serenataflowers , nothing showed up .
Flowers	after looking on their website for a contact number , it became_clear that all communication was dealt_with through email .
Flowers	i sent them a messaging asking where the flowers could be , and they explained that they would be delivery up until 0pm ( it being 0 . pm now ).
Flowers	i waited , no flowers turned_up .
Flowers	as the whole point of ordering from them was for my partner to receive the flowers on valentines_day itself , i emailed back in the morning explaining that the flowers had still not arrived and requested a refund .
Flowers	on return of their email , they confirmed that the flowers had been delivered to the right delivery address on the 00th of february and ignored my request for a refund .
Flowers	as i have said before , this was simply not true .
Flowers	i decided to explain it to them again , making it clear that i was at the address all day .
Flowers	the same response was given .
Flowers	by this point , the whole situation was getting very frustration as the communication from serenataflowers was coming from a number of people working from the company rather_than just one person .
Flowers	also , they seemed to be disregarding everything i was trying to explain to them .
Flowers	when i arrived home on the 00th , the flowers had arrived along with a different address penciled in on the side of the box .
Flowers	already disheartened that the flowers had not arrived on the correct day , i opened them to find a badly arranged bouquet wrapped up in one clear piece of cellophane ( taped badly round the bottom ) with a " bow " stuck down one side ( which was also the wrong_colour ; green , not red ).
Flowers	the quality of the flowers themselves was not great .
Flowers	they had already started to wilt a little and they were no way near as extravagant as the photographs on serenataflowers ' site .
Flowers	to add further insult to injury , the card which i had paid for had been placed inside the box poorly which had caused it to bend .
Flowers	the sticker inside was also stuck on at an angle , despite the obvious guidelines in the card itself .
Flowers	at this point , the communication with serenataflowers was going round in circles .
Flowers	i kept explaining to them that the flowers were not delivered on the right day , and they kept ignoring my comments and telling_me they had been .
Flowers	finally , after getting very frustrated with serenataflowers , i asked them for their courier information .
Flowers	i felt that it was serenataflowers responsibility to resolve the issue , however , as they were refusing to listen to and deal with my complaint so i decided to find out for myself what really happened .
Flowers	i received a reply from this email , which seemed to make absolutely no sense when compared to the rest of the emails i received from them , finally offering me a refund .
Flowers	edit_: i would like to add that this email said i would receive my refund within three days .
Flowers	after the three days were up , still no money had been refunded to me .
Flowers	i emailed them on the 0th day and no reply was given .
Flowers	lastly , i emailed them on day 0 after my refund was agreed .
Flowers	they responded on the same day , and i finally got my money back .
Flowers	--- anyone who has this problem , keep pestering .
Flowers	i know it is irritating and frustrating but it does work ... eventually .
Flowers	overall , the communication with serenataflowers was appalling .
Flowers	i found that they had a tendency not to listen at all to my complaint .
Flowers	the fact that around 0 different people were messaging me made the whole situation a lot more confusing and stressful .
Flowers	they didn ' t even seem to communicate well with each other .
Flowers	the flower quality was ok , but for what you are advertised through the photographs on their site , you would expect to get a lot more for your money .
Flowers	the way they were wrapped also didn ' t give them any justice at all .
Flowers	i decided to give them away and bought a much more extravagant bouquet for my partner from the local_supermarket ( might i add , at a much_better price ).
Flowers	i strongly feel that anyone_else who has had to deal with the frustration and stress of this company should report it straight to trading_standards and bbc_watchdog .
Flowers	i have , along with what seems hundreds of unhappy customers who had similar problems with this company not only on valentines_day ( the busiest day of the year for florists ) but also on other occasions too .
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet for my mother to be delivered today and despite being told by email i would receive it today , it is now past 0pm and still nothing .
Flowers	i would not reccomend this site to anybody , nor would i suggest you buy from a florist that clearly does not see it important to send orders on time .
Flowers	i regret ordering anything from this site and should have opted for a more trusted name like interflora , i ' d have rather paid a bit more to at_least receive the bouquet than be left waiting from 0am - 0pm , a clear waste of time and no consideration for it being a special day .
Flowers	i hope that they will honour me with a refund and until i do receive one , i will be constantly emailing them in regards to the refund and their appalling customer_service .
Flowers	this was a complete_joke and i was looking_forward to this being a good experience and convincing all my friends who spend the same amount of money with mroe reputable florists , to switch to iflorist - this will obviously not be happening now .
Flowers	i am not one to ever give negative_feedback , but this was necessary .
Flowers	edit_:
Flowers	like the review above i also spoke to jack and he said he would refund me in 0 - 0 days , however when looking lower in teh reviews on this site it seems somebody_else was promised a refund and never received it , so i will_definitely be phoning my bank tomorrow , sayonara iflorist , you can keep your £_00 discount_code .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for mother ' s day , to be delivered on mother ' s day .
Flowers	i was very , very disappointed that my mother ' s flowers where delivered today .
Flowers	two days early and in poor condition !
Flowers	a day which my mum is seldom in .
Flowers	i called iflorist to complain_about the service , they offered no compensation , or resolution to this situation .
Flowers	additionally , they plain and simply did not care !
Flowers	they literally tried to blame it on me saying that it was my fault for not reading the fine print .
Flowers	moreover , they said that there is a tab in the payment process that states if i pay an extra £ 0 i could get guaranteed delivery on the day of my choice ( not true ) there is no such tab !
Flowers	if you can ( never order from this website ).
Flowers	you will be in some sure way disappointed .
Flowers	that ' s a guarantee .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	two days last delivery .
Flowers	by the way , i didn ' t order a last_minute delivery but i order them almost 0 weeks from the delivery date i had chosen .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	very rude delivery man .
Flowers	didn ' t called out name instant he said .
Flowers	here your gift .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	quality of flowers !!!!!!!!!!!!
Flowers	terrible terrible terrible .
Flowers	disgusting .
Flowers	gone off !!!
Flowers	not fresh .
Flowers	already in the bin !
Flowers	pointless keeping dead flower in my home !!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	ordered roses and chocolates on the 00th to be delivered on valentines_day to my wifes place of work .
Flowers	when it came to valentines_day , waited all day , received no e mail or phone call until 00 : 00 , when an e mail was received starting my order had been ' allocated '.
Flowers	however , the wife was at work until 0pm and no flowers were delivered .
Flowers	have e mailed the company with no feedback .
Flowers	no live suppport is available and no number to call .
Flowers	the whole situation has left me embarrassed and angry and upset .
Flowers	everyone should avoid this website .
Flowers	completely_unacceptable service .
Flowers	still_waiting to hear from the company .
Flowers	if flowers are delivered today ( 00th ) out will be even more embarrassing .
Flowers	avoid .
Flowers	failed to deliver on mother ' s day .
Flowers	no customer help , just faceless website with form to fill in .
Flowers	terrible , don ' t use .
Flowers	even removed their 0000 number from the site to stop people contacting them .
Flowers	i ' d avoid at all costs - this is my second hugely disappointing shopping_experience with iflorist .
Flowers	a bouquet of flowers i ordered for a specific day didn ' t arrive on time and turned_up a day late , when they did arrive the bouquet was essentially a totally different bunch to what i ordered ... the only commonality was that the flowers were yellow !
Flowers	i had to send about 0 emails and wait 0 weeks before i got a response .
Flowers	when i did finally receive an answer there was no way of apology , just excuses about the info that can be found in the t &_c ' s small_print .
Flowers	i won ' t be using again and i ' d strongly_recommend other not to also .
Flowers	ordered roses to be delivered , verified , money taken .
Flowers	email on valentines_day saying order had been rejected usually due to incorrect details .
Flowers	i can see this has been a common complaint from other reviews .
Flowers	it said i would be refunded , but as yet no record of any return .
Flowers	no response to emails and no answer all day on the phone number provided
Flowers	i have never used the site till i bought these flowers , i would recommend the company to anyone that i know .
Flowers	was very easy , and didn ' t have to go through ' sign_up ' process , which can often feel unnecessary .
Flowers	good choice of flowers at not too steep prices , and free delivery for mothers_day was a big winner !
Flowers	everything was brilliant and my wife loved her flowers .
Flowers	it was for christmas and the time was tight .
Flowers	iflorist managed to deliver on time at peak time and my mother - in - law and husband were very surprised to have received the flowers along with delicious chocolates on the coldest day of the year !
Flowers	well_done !
Flowers	i really_appreciate it !
Flowers	reliable on time no hassle friend loved them easy to use website
Flowers	flowers arrived in perfect_condition , on time .
Flowers	i cannot describe to you how much frustration they have caused i do not need to write any more_than this ... every reveiw underneath is so true flowers that were sent died in a day wrong type sent still no contact from the customer_service team terrible terrible company .
Flowers	hope they go_bankrupt and rot
Flowers	soo soo disappointed .
Flowers	it was my girlfriend birthday and valentines_day all together and i have received nothing form them , the worst is , i gave the iflorists a chance hoping they would deliver the flowers today .
Flowers	to add to the surprises .
Flowers	but i have received nothing .
Flowers	i have just contributed to reporting them to watch_dog .
Flowers	and i want a refund or i will dispute my order with my bank asap .
Flowers	i will_continue destroying this company any anyway i can .
Flowers	moonpig where nice to let customers no why didn ' t you do the same .
Flowers	ps .
Flowers	refunds will be nice with free flowers and a random day with the chocolates i added .
Flowers	i bought flowers last_minute for my friend , for her_birthday !
Flowers	for a nice package i also got a balloon and a teddy_bear which she loved .
Flowers	although she wasn ' t in at the time , the flowers got sent next door and her lovely mum picked them up .
Flowers	they were fresh , colourful and overall stunning .
Flowers	you have one happy customer , and i will be using you guys again !
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my partner on the 00th of february for valentine ' s day .
Flowers	when checking out i selected the " next_day , before 00 : 00 " delivery option ( for which i paid a little extra ) in order to ensure that she would definitely receive them on the 00th .
Flowers	on the 00th just before 00 : 00 i called iflorist to find out why the order hadn ' t been delivered yet .
Flowers	my first call went straight through to voice_mail which basically stated " we ' re busy , call back later " ( what kind of company does that ?).
Flowers	the second call , although ringing for almost 00_minutes , managed to get through to one of their customer_service agents ( this guy , who ' s name i sadly didn ' t get , was clueless , for reasons which will become apparent shortly ).
Flowers	after giving my order number i asked where the delivery was , he said it ' s marked as " out for delivery " by the courier and he can ' t be more specific than that as the delivery times are between 0 and 0 .
Flowers	i pointed_out that i had selected the pre_- 00 : 00 option when checking out and it was now 00 : 00 .
Flowers	he said that he knew nothing about this .
Flowers	it ' s on your website !
Flowers	take the time to educate yourself about the products and options that your company is selling !
Flowers	he then said that he would find out when it will be delivered and call me back within an_hour .
Flowers	at 00 : 00 ( 0 hours_later ) he still hadn ' t called me so i called back , again getting the ever - so - helpful automated_message the first time round .
Flowers	at the second attempt i got through to a lady who informed me that due to problems with weather at their warehouse the order wouldn ' t be delivered until the 00th .
Flowers	why hadn ' t the genius i spoke to earlier tell me that ?
Flowers	did he even bother to check the order or do they just have a generic answer for " pesky " customers : " it ' s out for delivery "!
Flowers	?
Flowers	i requested she cancel the order as for it to be delivered on the 00th was pointless .
Flowers	she said she couldn ' t do that due it already being assigned and some other mumbo - jumbo !
Flowers	now i ask you , why the hell not !?
Flowers	clearly the order had not gone out yet , and would be only going out the following_morning ( as couriers pack their vans in the morning ) so how hard is it to pick_up a phone and say " don ' t send this out "!?
Flowers	i then requested a refund which she said she also could not do because it needed to be delivered first .
Flowers	what madness is this !
Flowers	?
Flowers	now , i understand that unforeseen events happen .
Flowers	i work for an e_- retailer so i ' m only too familiar with the unexpected events that can occur during an order , however the quality of a company is defined by how you deal with your customers and how far you are willing to go to placate them in order to retain their business in future .
Flowers	in this iflorist has failed utterly and miserably .
Flowers	the flowers have now arrived ( on the 00th ) making them completely pointless and even somewhat embarrassing as they were intended for valentine ' s day !
Flowers	on top of this their website advertised the flowers i ordered as coming with a free ( albeit small ) box of chocolates .
Flowers	surprise , surprise the flowers of course arrived without these !
Flowers	so , not only incompetent and completely unhelpful customer_service but false_advertising as well , it gets worse and worse .
Flowers	now , given that you have completely failed to carry out the level of service you advertise , in exchange for my money , i demand a full_refund of the money i paid to you for a service which you have failed to deliver .
Flowers	unless i receive a full_refund of my purchase , i will post this review on every review website and social_media network that i can think of .
Flowers	furthermore i will dispute the transaction with my credit_card company .
Flowers	please contact me with information pertaining to the refund asap to try and salvage what ' s left of your reputation as an e_- retailer .
Flowers	i ordered a plant for my mother for mothering_sunday .... no arrival .... even today !
Flowers	tried to track - gave a royal_mail tracking_number !
Flowers	i didn ' t know rm posted on a sunday !
Flowers	i have tried_ringing them .... twice .... first time on hold 00_minutes and second time 00_minutes !
Flowers	stil didn ' t get through .
Flowers	i have emailed them 0 times and contacted them on facekbook .
Flowers	will be taking this further !
Flowers	it is disgusting service !
Flowers	i ' m just glad i paid through paypal !
Flowers	hopefully i ' ll get my money back quicker !
Flowers	i bought the seeded hearts for favors for my baby ' s " welcome to the world " bbq as wanted something a bit special , and to " give something back " to the family & friends that will be attending .
Flowers	the hearts are really lovely with their speckled " pattern " and petals .
Flowers	the service was very quick and the items were packed very well .
Flowers	i also found the p_& p charges reasonable compared to other online_retailers , as well as the cost of the hearts themselves .
Flowers	these are a unique and lovely item to use as favors , place cards and decoration for weddings , baby shower / naming day , etc .
Flowers	i placed an order .
Flowers	one batch of flowers to be delivered on the 00th_february and the other batch to be delivered on the 00th .
Flowers	i am still_waiting for the flowers to be delivered and have tried to contact iflorist through email and live_chat however it seems that there is never anyone online .
Flowers	i am sure that it is fine but i am concerned and wish to be reassured that my flowers are going to be delivered especially as i paid £_00 .
Flowers	thank_you very much for the rapid_response .
Flowers	apart_from this minor query it has been a most helpful and useful service .
Flowers	flowers arrived at 0pm and where dead as they were not in water and looked nothing like picture on website .
Flowers	hardly any flowers for the money .
Flowers	never use company again
Flowers	summary_: not only do they fail to deliver on their promises but they make it extremely difficult to contact them to seek redress for their incompetence .
Flowers	i have ordered from iflorist before and didn ' t remember anything remarkably bad going on so when i got their email advertising mother ' s day bouquets i decided to place an order .
Flowers	i was flying home to northern_ireland to visit my mum for mother ' s day and thought i was being sensible planning in_advance rather_than rushing around last_minute .
Flowers	one week before mother ' s day i ordered one of their bouquets .
Flowers	i was disappointed they could only offer a single delivery option that covered the saturday and sunday of the following week , but reluctantly_accepted that the flowers might be a day early .
Flowers	no problem .
Flowers	i then got an_email on the tuesday advising me that my order had been " allocated " and was " ready for shipping ".
Flowers	the email confirmed the delivery would take place on 00th_march , one day before mother ' s day .
Flowers	fair_enough , as long as they were there on time .
Flowers	unfortunately the 00th came and went .
Flowers	i therefore had to race around last_minute on the sunday to pick of a bunch of flowers and a card , probably paying over the odds and certainly limiting my choice - not to mention the fact i ' d now had to pay twice !
Flowers	what ' s the use in delivering mother ' s day flowers the day after mother ' s day ?
Flowers	!
Flowers	the flowers finally arrived at approximately 0pm on monday 00st_march , the day after mother ' s day .
Flowers	i called iflorist to complain almost_immediately and was directed by their call advisor to email my complaint from the website .
Flowers	i did this , asking whether they this was standard practice or an irregular slip in quality that merited some redress .
Flowers	within a couple of hours they replied .
Flowers	this time they told me i had to put my request ' in writing ' ( i . e .
Flowers	via post ) ' as per company policy '.
Flowers	i find this to be an_absolute_disgrace in this day and age ; to be redirected from one channel to another not once but twice .
Flowers	iflorist clearly don ' t value their customers in any way , shape or form .
Flowers	they don ' t want to hear from you , they just want you to pay your money and take your chances .
Flowers	i ' m absolutely_disgusted with this and won ' t be ordering from iflorist again .
Flowers	the roses in the cupid bouquet were browned around the edges and tatty looking .
Flowers	these were a valentines present .
Flowers	paid £_00 . 00 for it .
Flowers	the flowers are brill very fast delivery will be returning thanks again mr n raftery
Flowers	i also ordered flowers for mothers_day which never arrived .
Flowers	infuriatingly the order still shows as pending and having waited a few_days for the online_chat facility to become available i emailed requesting i be contacted .
Flowers	today i receive an_email from them suggesting that they may not have managed to resolve my query .
Flowers	i will be contacting my employer requesting this terrible company is removed immediately from our staff offers website .
Flowers	i cannot_believe they are endorsing such a shody operation .
Flowers	i no_longer require the flowers as mothers_day has passed .
Flowers	if they try and deliver now i will be livid .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my mother ' s birthday !
Flowers	i live in asia so this was the only way i could have flowers delivered to her .
Flowers	yes , they delivered it the same day , however , they left it outside the gate , it was caught in the rain , and someone found it outside the gate .
Flowers	the flowers were disgusting , its like they just put a bunch of old flowers together and wrapped it in a plastic wrapper and put it in a plastic container !
Flowers	i will never order flowers from serenata again and i will make_sure everyone_knows about this horrible site .
Flowers	you messed with the wrong person serenata !!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i have photos of what they sent and what they put up on their website !
Flowers	dont order from them !
Flowers	the service i have received from iflorist has to be the worst service i have ever recieved and probably ever will receive .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered on mothering_sunday , probably the most_important day of the year to florists .
Flowers	i recieved an_email confirmation from them stating it would be delivered on 00th_march ( mother ' s day ).
Flowers	great - nice and simple i thought .
Flowers	i was wrong .
Flowers	two days_later i got an_email from them saying my tracking_number was ready and my flowers would be delivered on 0th .
Flowers	the 0th ?!?!
Flowers	this isn ’ t what i asked for .
Flowers	i rang their helpline .
Flowers	the rude , incompetent girl (< private data_removed >) told me its on their website that delivery dates aren ’ t guaranteed .
Flowers	she started laughing and said my mum should just be grateful she was getting flowers at all - i honestly thought i was going to explode with rage at that disgusting comment .
Flowers	i demanded a full_refund - she told me there was no way i ' d get a refund because i would get the flowers at some point .
Flowers	i later tracked my order , and it actually said my delivery had been ' delivered and left safe ' - on the 0th !!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	so not only did they promise a delivery on 00th .
Flowers	they then emailed me and said i would get in on the 0th .
Flowers	it then said it had been delivered on the 0th !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	and guess_what ... today its the evening of the 00th and i have not received any flowers or a refund !
Flowers	i have send three emails to iflorst ( after demanding a direct email address on the phone as both the email address on their website and their father companies website - colonial gifts ltd - do not even work !!!)
Flowers	this company is a joke .
Flowers	they are incompetent and could do with some lessons in customer_service .
Flowers	my advice - do not use this florist , no matter how desperate .
Flowers	not had issue in previous years but flowers arrived a day late on this occasion .
Flowers	after_speaking via live_chat , i was fully_refunded for the issue .
Flowers	the flowers were dispatched on time so the issue may have been the company they put their delivery trust in - yodel , who are fairly garbage .
Flowers	maybe a lesson_learned there .
Flowers	resolved quickly and fairly , which saves me from rating a 0 star .
Flowers	bestilte i sidste uge en buket til omdeling i anledning af min mors fødselsdag idag mandag 00 / 0 fra acacia blomster glostrup .
Flowers	jeg kontaktede selvfølgelig butikken først og sendte et billede for at sikre mig hvad_jeg_bestilte online svarede til hvad_jeg ville få .
Flowers	da_jeg_er bosat i england har_jeg brugt interflora til bestilling af blomster til min familie ved lejligheder .
Flowers	hvad min_mor modtog idag kunne ligeså godt have været hentet på tanken , til 00 kroner .
Flowers	lad mig lige starte med at sige ; tidsler hører bare ingen steder hjemme i en fødselsdags buket til_en man i kortet skriver ' jeg elsker dig !'
Flowers	til .
Flowers	absolut ingen lighed med de billeder men tror man bestiller fra !
Flowers	da_jeg_så klager til blomsterbutikken får_jeg af_vide at han rent faktisk synes den er_meget pæn , men at han desværre ikke_kan gøre andet for mig !
Flowers	jo min_mor kunne da komme ned og få den byttet .
Flowers	så_jeg_har betalt 00kr for levering af noget møg , som min_mor så alligevel skal ned og hente selv .
Flowers	det vil hun selvfølgelig ikke da det for det første er_en lang vej ( hvorfor jeg_har bestilt dem ) og yderligere ville sætte hende i en ubehagelig situation - på hendes fødselsdag !
Flowers	det_er absolut interfloras ansvar , at de blomsterbutikker de bruger lever op_til deres ansvar og leverer det man betaler for !
Flowers	jeg_har skrevet til interflora og udbedt mig en forklaring samt vedlagt billede af denne buket !
Flowers	det_er pinligt og ganske enkelt tyveri , snyd og bedrag .
Flowers	er enormt skuffet !
Flowers	great company flowers where amazing .
Flowers	brilliant custormer service 00 out of 00
Flowers	i ordered flowers on monday 0th_march for mother ' s day .
Flowers	i specified delivery on saturday 0th when someone was home .
Flowers	my mother arrived home yesterday ( friday 0th ) to find a delivery card from yodel , iflorist ' s choice of courier i assume .
Flowers	the card stated " i called to deliver i have left your parcel for you to collect from : front_door ".
Flowers	are they mad ?
Flowers	needless to say there was nothing outside of our front_door .
Flowers	we live on a london street with the front_door opening onto the public road .
Flowers	who can possibly think that ' s an acceptable place to leave a parcel .
Flowers	i called iflorist this morning .
Flowers	after 0 separate attempts i finally got through .
Flowers	my call lasted 00_minutes ( to an 0000 number ) - excessive - after which i was told my query had been escalated and to be assured i ' d get a call back .
Flowers	obviously no call back .
Flowers	their customer_services shut at 0pm .
Flowers	at 0 . 00 i called to be greeted_by an_automated voicemail .
Flowers	this is my second attempt ordering from iflorist , more fool me that i gave them a second chance after a disappointing first .
Flowers	horrible horrible way of conducting a business , do not use this company .
Flowers	have never seen so many terrible reviews - wish i ' d seen spent some time reading them before .
Flowers	iflorist are cowboys .
Flowers	delivery was stated as next_day 0am - 0pm , but i did not receive news of dispatch until 0pm with the recipient finally getting the bouquet at around 00pm .
Flowers	not only was this out of delivery hours , i feel was especially late for the fact that they were flowers sent in sympathy to a grieving family who had been at work all day and would have needed the evening to wind down .
Flowers	however i did find the text updates useful and the item arrived as_described
Flowers	i always order flowers from the same website but i thought i would take a chance with iflorist as they had an offer of £_00 worth of flowers for £_00 .
Flowers	i wish i hadn ' t bothered as even the £_00 i paid was too much .
Flowers	i ordered a bunch of ' vibrant oranges and greens ' but received a bunch that was mainly leaves with a few yellow flowers mixed in .
Flowers	i contacted iflorist who apologised and said they would make_sure this didn ' t happen in the future , i replied_saying i would not be ordering from them again as i had no confidence in the quality of their flowers and received a reply of which half was word for word the same as the original email they had sent me , theres nothing like the personal approach !
Flowers	the free delivery is a huge bonus over some other flower delivery sites and the flowers on offer ranged from the standard to the interesting and unique .
Flowers	would definitely_recommend !
Flowers	i ordered easter flowers for the ladies in my team and paid extra for a speedier delivery .
Flowers	the flowers were showing as " allocated " in the online tracking tool however nothing happened and they never arrived .
Flowers	the next_day i phoned and after a rather complicated process of handing in order number , name etc i was put on hold .
Flowers	the lady on the other line told me that she would need to check with the local_florist and would come back to me .
Flowers	i therefore left my number and mentioned that the flowers should have been there yesterday since i paid extra .
Flowers	furthermore i said that a delivery before easter was a must since it were easter flowers .
Flowers	she told me she would do her best and come back to me asap .
Flowers	i as well asked for a refund of the extra money i paid for the next_day delivery ( which didn ' t happen ) - i was told she couldn ' t do anything but the accounts_department would come back to me via_email .
Flowers	nothing has happened since then : no email , no phone call and of course no flowers .
Flowers	this is the worst customer_service i have ever_experienced .
Flowers	the take your money and you get nothing for it just promises and a catastrophic service in every field - try to avoid them ...
Flowers	to comment on the reply below : the local_florist was indeed in touch with the office saying that they wouldnt be able to deliver it on that day .
Flowers	so it was never a discussion but we were informed that it wouldnt happen .
Flowers	regarding all the other points it remains the same , only today after another call i was told that the flowers would be delivered .
Flowers	fantastic flowers !
Flowers	colours were wonderful !
Flowers	thankyou x
Flowers	i have sent my mother flowers over the years and her falling ill with cancer this year has hit us all hard .
Flowers	i have never used iflorist before but to be honest , tried them because they were affordable .
Flowers	my mother could not stop telling_me every time i rang about how nice the flowers were and told me to keep using iflorist as some other bunches she received were not lasting as long or looking as vibrant .
Flowers	i have just ordered another bunch now because i trust this company now !
Flowers	thank_you !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i couldn ' t be_happier with iflorist .
Flowers	the beautiful selection of arrangements was well catalogued , and competitively_priced .
Flowers	free delivery on a sunday !?
Flowers	outstanding .
Flowers	the website was easy to use , and felt secure - the option of adding a personalised message to the cute cards is a very nice_touch too .
Flowers	would definitely use this site again , and have recommended it to friends .
Flowers	very pleased as brought for mothers_day and the message was printed and sent on a great card flowers were beautifully arranged and very fresh could have asked for better service great value for your money would be pleased to do business with again thank_you for giving my mother a smile on her face well worth it
Flowers	from day one mara has been so helpful to me , advising me on what flowers would go best that would match my chosen theme .
Flowers	she was a genius !
Flowers	my flowers turned_out to be even more beautiful than i could ever imagine , and the photographs through the development stages don ' t compare to seeing them in person .
Flowers	all flowers are completely customisable which makes the whole experience so special , knowing you ' re creating your own flowers that no one has had .
Flowers	i would recommend mara and silk_blooms to anyone i know who is looking to get married in future .
Flowers	this company is horrendous .
Flowers	spent two days ringing and emailing to find out where my aunts flowers where that i ordered for her_birthday .
Flowers	needless to say they didn ' t arrive on the date .
Flowers	i was told they were left in a safe_place although they were no where to be found .
Flowers	took two days to ask the driver where he left them .
Flowers	even after that they still hadn ' t turned_up .
Flowers	offered a refund which in my mind wasn ' t enough as my aunt still had no flowers .
Flowers	this caused me a great deal of embarrassment that my aunt couldn ' t even receive her_birthday_present .
Flowers	on the two days of contacting them they were supposed to ring me back .
Flowers	this never happened .
Flowers	email on one instance ignored on the other .
Flowers	i would recommend you to never use this company of you want your loved to receive their gift .
Flowers	totally_unacceptable !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	ordered on a friday_night saturday_morning a lovely bunch arrived .
Flowers	they were fresh and well trimmed
Flowers	i ordered some flowers to be delivered to my nan with the same day delivery .
Flowers	they didn ' t arrive until the next_day and when they did arrive they were just dumped on the steps outside her house .
Flowers	as she is 00 and has just had a hip replaced she had a nightmare trying to get them picked_up .
Flowers	i am very disappointed in this lack of service especially for such a high delivery charge .
Flowers	i have sent me complaint via_email .
Flowers	the two dozen roses i ordered and received looked absolutely nothing like the image on the website , on arrival they were a lot smaller and pettles were brown in parts and looked like they didn ' t have long to live never mind bloom .
Flowers	the extras i purchased e . g .
Flowers	teddy_bear and chocolates only added to my overall disappointment .
Flowers	the bear was a tiny cheap looking thing you would probably grapple in an arcade machine and there were 0 chocolates in a tiny box , woeful .
Flowers	as this was for a birthday_gift i was majorly disappointed and pretty_much ripped_off .
Flowers	visited a florist myself the following_day and got a superb bouquet for less_than i paid here . lesson_learnt and won ' t be using this sub_standard service ever again .
Flowers	amazing service as usual !
Flowers	brilliant order process and delivery !
Flowers	fantastic flowers and beautiful all_round !
Flowers	third time i have ordered with sereneta flowers and once again they do not let you down .
Flowers	flowers arrived on time on the day you arrange and they email you every_step of the way .
Flowers	when the flowers were dispatched and when they are delivered .
Flowers	not personally there to see the flowers as i am not the recipient but no one has complained and have said they were beautiful .
Flowers	great service and great flowers at good price .
Flowers	just left a review for the flowers i sent my girlfriend saying about the terrible packaging , however my girlfriend has just bought the flowers home and i have inspected them ....
Flowers	they are awful !
Flowers	they are half_dead , the leaves are rotten already and i highly doubt those roses are going to get any better if / when they open up .
Flowers	i ' m so disappointed !
Flowers	especially as i had them delivered to her work .
Flowers	how embarrassing for us both !
Flowers	we are not short of money but now i look like a proper cheapskate !
Flowers	we are currently in the middle of relocating jobs , home everything and i just wanted something to make her smile , instead i look like i sent her some cheap after thought flowers !
Flowers	:(
Flowers	i placed an order for flowers to be sent to perth wa on the 00th_december for delivery on the 00st december for my parents who i haven ' t seen for 00 years .
Flowers	the flowers were not delivered .
Flowers	00nd_december used the " live_chat " on the website and told the order was delayed but would be delivered on the 00rd , how he could know this as it was 00 :_00pm in perth on saturday_night so i doubt if he could have spoken with them .
Flowers	no surprise it didn ' t turn_up .
Flowers	00 rd december contacted " live_chat " again to be told exactly the same_thing again as if they were copy and pasting from a script .
Flowers	definitely be there on the 00th and would put the order in his " follow_up folder " for the next_day to make_sure it got there .
Flowers	again as it was 0 :_00pm on sunday in perth who did he contact ?
Flowers	guess_what no delivery , asked for name of florist in perth so parents can contact them direct .
Flowers	however he couldn ’ t give that information due to their privacy policy !
Flowers	some privacy when the florist is bound to turn - up in a sign written van and their name and telephone no on the card that should come with the flowers , or will they be sent in a blacked out taxi with the driver in a ninja outfit !
Flowers	used " live_chat " again today , 00th_december , to find out why no delivery again most suppressed the lady at the other end was quick to point out it was 0pm in perth so would not be able to contact the florist due to different time zone .
Flowers	i don ’ t see why as the first 0 men could do it a lot latter and guarantee delivery would occur the following_day , unless they were liars or reading from a script .
Flowers	so long_story short do not risk using them .
Flowers	post add - since iflorists ' offer of a replacement bouquet to replace the ones i ordered but weren ' t delivered , still no flowers have turned_up in perth !
Flowers	my mum is very hard to please when you give her things but when she saw these beautiful flowers she said she loved them !
Flowers	it was such a quick service at a reasonable_price :_d thank_you !
Flowers	this company is a disgrace and avoid at all costs ... all contact numbers stated on their own website don ' t even work , all are invalid .
Flowers	( great start ) also they don ' t even deliver the flowers , so you have no_idea whats_going on or how to even get your money back .
Flowers	i ' m not happy at all and really feel to go down to their stores and wreck the place !
Flowers	!
Flowers	either deliver the bloody flowers today and properly for all customers or shut up shop ... because you have no_idea on how to run a business professionally .
Flowers	d *** heads !
Flowers	of the online flower companies , iflorist is my favourite as the website is straight_forward to use , the website offers a variety of products and have many decent deals .
Flowers	my flower delivery by iflorist has also been on time and without much ado .
Flowers	the only time i had an issue with iflorist was when i was delivered a different flower which they made up for by giving me a gift voucher .
Flowers	so excellent customer_service .
Flowers	highly_recommended .
Flowers	i ordered a lovely plant for my nan and did all the choosing and ordering through the website .
Flowers	it was very easy and fast , it was delivered on my chosen day and my nan was so pleased with it .
Flowers	easy to place order online , got an_email straight_away to confirm order .
Flowers	then got an_email to confirm my order had been dispatched , and another when it was delivered .
Flowers	i ' m very impressed and won ' t hesitate to use again .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my mothers 00th_birthday , i was expecting them to be delivered on her_birthday but they never arrived .
Flowers	i tried_contacting someone from iflorist but the telephone_number was just going to answer message .
Flowers	i then tried_emailing them , i eventually got a reply a few_days_later .
Flowers	they offered to deliver the flowers and give me a £ 0 . 00 voucher off my next purchase .
Flowers	i said i didn ' t find this acceptable and wanted a full_refund .... i have had no further response from them , the flowers have been delivered some what 0 weeks late .
Flowers	overall all i very disappointed with the service and won ' t be using them again .
Flowers	chris
Flowers	i would always use serenta for my flowers now .
Flowers	the service is second to none , much_better_than interflora .
Flowers	good value , and loved the fact the text me at every_stage to let me know where my order was at .
Flowers	would recommend to anyone .
Flowers	just perfect in every way !
Flowers	delivery 0 days late after mother ' s day when guaranteed delivery before .
Flowers	charged £_000 instead of £_00 , of which £_000 was eventually refunded .
Flowers	flowers of a sub - standard .
Flowers	website crashed at card payment every time and so didnt even confirm it was processed until 0 days_later - once i had sorted an_alternative out .
Flowers	tried to cancel , 0 days before a response , no online_chat , no telephone_number , no acceptable solution .
Flowers	would avoid at all costs .....
Flowers	i have used many different flower delivery sites on the net over the years and serenata_flowers is by_far the best .
Flowers	the selection is fantastic and at a very good price .
Flowers	the picture on the net didn ' t do them justice , the flowers were magnificent !
Flowers	the best thing about it is the free next_day delivery !
Flowers	i will definatly be using them again .
Flowers	ordered flowers sunday_night 00th_feb to arrive to my girlfriend in ireland on wed 00th from the valentine ' s section on your amazing website .
Flowers	email confirmation stating flowers will be delivered on wed 00th as requested !
Flowers	they still_haven ' t arrived today they are still at hatfield terminal in england .
Flowers	yodel informed me on wed they won ' t be delivered till friday 00th as you only put them on 0 - 0 days sea delivery !
Flowers	what use is this when she is now here with me in england ????
Flowers	surprise down the pan !
Flowers	your online support system if you can call it that has been offline all day today !
Flowers	shock horror !
Flowers	i will be expecting a full_refund i know my rights !
Flowers	!
Flowers	awful_awful company !
Flowers	flowers arrived on time , were of excellent quality ... can ' t complain .
Flowers	i have used iflorist before and they delivered the flowers too early , but redelivered with no problem .
Flowers	my experience this time was much more disappointing .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my girlfriend ' s birthday on the 00th_january .
Flowers	around this time there was a lot of snow , so it was understandable that they were not delivered that day or the following weekend .
Flowers	however it took a week ( much longer_than the snow took to melt ) for them to be delivered and so they predictably arrived dead .
Flowers	after the weekend i contacted the customer_service ( scripted online_chat ) and asked for a redelivery as the flowers would arrive dead .
Flowers	at this point i was told nothing could be done until they had been delivered .
Flowers	i was advised that for a refund i should tell the recipient to refuse to accept the delivery .
Flowers	according to iflorist ' s website this would actually mean i was not entitled to a refund as iflorist were not responsible for failed delivery attempts .
Flowers	eventually , after emailing their ' support ' team , they agreed to redeliver them on the 0st of february , two_weeks late .
Flowers	it got to the 0rd and still no flowers !
Flowers	i then got an_email on the 0th telling_me they had been delivered .
Flowers	obviously i was again unhappy that i had paid for fresh flowers to be delivered and they had arrived late , meaning they would last at_least 0 days less before dying ( confirmed by their shabby look ).
Flowers	i contacted iflorist , first online ( they refused to give me a refund ) and then by phone , where they requested a picture of the flowers .
Flowers	i explained that i was not satisfied because they arrived late again and that this detracted from the total time my girlfriend had the flowers alive , yet i sent a picture anyway .
Flowers	i received an_email this morning explaining that *********@ iflorist . co . uk had ' inspected the flowers with a number of my colleagues and in agreement there does not appear to be anything wrong with the flowers ' and went on to explain that she was ' not authorised ' to issue a refund .
Flowers	throughout the whole correspondence i have asked / demanded / begged to talk to someone who was authorised to issue a refund without any success .
Flowers	in conclusion iflorist will fail to deliver your flowers on time .
Flowers	they will then likely fail to redeliver replacement flowers on time as well .
Flowers	you will not be 000_% satisfied and despite their guarantee you will not receive any sort of refund .
Flowers	their customer_service team consists of people ( likely based far abroad ) on online_chat following scripts without initiative or understanding .
Flowers	failing this you can ring their premium_rate call_center .
Flowers	after this , they will still fail to understand that you paid to have fresh flowers delivered , not ones sitting in a courier ' s warehouse for days on end without water , and that is all you really care about .
Flowers	they see orders not people , and fail to see that failing to receive flowers on special occasions is just cause for customers to not be satisfied , regardless of what failing attempts they make to redeliver , weeks after the occasion .
Flowers	don ' t gamble with your special moments and please , please don ' t give these people anymore money .
Flowers	their guarantees are worthless and they will likely fail you .
Flowers	really want to gamble ?
Flowers	interestingly iflorist has replied to this review quicker_than they managed to reply to any of my emails , funny that .
Flowers	' the delivery was on time however your recipient was not there '.
Flowers	firstly do they mean the time it was a week_later or merely four days .
Flowers	00 people live in this house and i have been told my the recipient that she was in , as were here housemates .
Flowers	' after looking at these images we can confirm the flowers received were beautiful . '
Flowers	they were four days old and so had four days less time being alive when my girlfriend finally received them .
Flowers	how can they challenge the recipients opinion after never seeing the flowers in real_life ?
Flowers	' we would advise that you ensure the recipient will be there to receive the flowers .'
Flowers	does this mean that in order to make_sure the flowers are not left in a warehouse for a week we should tell the recipient that we are going to surprise them for their birthdays ?
Flowers	get them to stand by the door waiting for flowers that will never arrive .
Flowers	my message to iflorist is where does your 000_% satisfaction guarentee stand when i am not satisfied .
Flowers	the original flowers were not delivered on her_birthday but a week_later .
Flowers	the replacement flowers were also delivered late .
Flowers	i paid for fresh flowers to be delivered and this did not happen , therefore i again request a refund .
Flowers	for those reading this , make note of what iflorist does so you can too value their guarantees and services , except you can escape paying the price .
Flowers	one extra note , if you google iflorist fake_reviews you can unearth some very interesting info on how iflorist illegally maintains higher average reviews while providing such poor quality services .
Flowers	i would like to see iflorist explain all of this .
Flowers	i ' ll be waiting .
Flowers	myself and my girlfriend live a long way apart and i ordered her some lovely flowers for £_00 to be delivered before 0pm , knowing that she leaves work at 0pm .
Flowers	so far , nothing .
Flowers	i got an_email_saying that they would be delivered by local_florists due to adverse_weather_conditions in nottingham (???
Flowers	).
Flowers	anyway nothing has been delivered and to my embarrassment she has sent me a gift to work .
Flowers	now it looks_like i didn ' t bother .
Flowers	phone_calls unanswered , tickets not getting responded too .
Flowers	my tracking says ' allocated '.
Flowers	what does that mean ?
Flowers	i ' m so angry that this company can ruin valentines_day for so many people .
Flowers	in fact , i have spent the whole day stressed .
Flowers	they ' ve got an_hour to get them there but given the service so far , i ' m not expecting them to arrive and it seems like it is going to be hard to even make a complaint .
Flowers	not picking_up the customer_service line is disgraceful .
Flowers	worst company ever !!
Flowers	ordered flowers for mother ' s day to be speciafically delivered for sunday ( mothers_day ) but its wednesday now and it never arrived .
Flowers	they spoilt the very essence of mothers_day and the surprise i had enstored for my mother .
Flowers	they do not have telephone_number and emailed 0 times but no respond at all .
Flowers	got to talk with a woman named roxie online and she took forvere to even reply to a ' hello ' and then said she will reschedule to deliver the gift again .
Flowers	later when i said i dont want it asked for refund she blatantly cancelled the chat room .
Flowers	this company seems to be fraudster .
Flowers	please stay_away for disappointments .
Flowers	sh ! t service - fraudsters !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i used iflorist as they always have a varied selection of flowers and gifts catered to all tastes .
Flowers	i have always been able to get delivery when required too !
Flowers	i would highly_recommend them !
Flowers	completely_useless .
Flowers	i trusted them with one of the most_important orders i have ever made and they screwed it up .
Flowers	avoid at all costs .
Flowers	use another company .
Flowers	ordered 00 red_roses for valentines_day , £_00 . 00 , i thought that it was an ok price to pay for a big bunch of roses .
Flowers	the roses were very uninspiring , 0 of the 00 were dying and the rest of them were half open , so the bunch looked tiny and very poor quality .
Flowers	also the text written in the card didn ' t even have spaces between some of the words and it was all written on one line in tiny text size .
Flowers	does someone not check the quality before they are sent out ?
Flowers	an embarrassing experience !
Flowers	never used serenta before this time but i was delighted with the whole service .
Flowers	i wanted some flowers for mom who lives in birmingham but couldn ' t afford the prices other_companies were asking .
Flowers	this company provided a big bouquet ( compared to others companies ) of my choice at a brilliant cost .
Flowers	when they were delivered they were just as_described on the web .
Flowers	( my mom sent me a picture ). they were excellent quality too .
Flowers	the website was also brilliant .
Flowers	easy to use , everything was clear and next_day delivery which was free .
Flowers	would i use serenta again ?
Flowers	you bet !
Flowers	i ordered two bouquets for my partners_birthday .
Flowers	their ad shows a very impressive bunch as a standard size and even states is the standard size .
Flowers	i ordered the extra large ' grandissimo ' size and what i got was crazy small .
Flowers	much smaller_than the standard size .
Flowers	i spent £_00 on flowers and all i got was honestly what i can only describe as £_00 - 00 worth from sainsbury .
Flowers	i do honestly feel really bad for my partner now .
Flowers	... i was really trying to do something above and beyond for the women i love more_than anything on this planet and i get this ?
Flowers	?
Flowers	guys , if you need to order flowers , please_please_please do it through interflora .
Flowers	these_jokers aren ' t interested in your comments .
Flowers	they got your money and that ' s all they want .
Flowers	as i am on a student budget i searched the internet for the florist that could offer me the best quality flowers for the best value , and thats when i found iflorist .
Flowers	so , after looking over their website i decided to order my mum some tulips , which were a very reasonable_price and even came with a free box of chocolates !
Flowers	and theres nothing students like more_than free_stuff !
Flowers	however it should be noted that these flowers are suuitable for anyone , whether they are on a budget or not because the flowers are said to be such good quality .
Flowers	i cant_wait to receive a phone call from my mum on saturday , once shes received them at work , im sure she will be over joyed .
Flowers	thank_you iflorist !
Flowers	i would highly_recommend this site .
Flowers	excellent value for money .
Flowers	my mother and mother inlaw were blown_away by how beautiful the flowers were .
Flowers	spent 00 pounds on a large bouquet or roses and lillys for mothersday , and what arrived was 00 carnations !
Flowers	the description on the box says lrg rose and lilly bouquet , but their having a laugh , the delivery box is tiny - only suitable for a tiny bouquet in the first place - , conning people who send flowers distances who dont know what is being delivered until it ' s too_late !
Flowers	i tried for 0 days to get in contact and finally after being on hold for almost 00_minutes i got through and not only even an appology !
Flowers	i have to provide_evidence !
Flowers	disgusted and completely dissapointed .
Flowers	i have just received a call from my nan saying that she was very impressed by the flowers .
Flowers	the bouquet to my mum was a little late but arrived , and i was able to track them all the way .
Flowers	they do almost everything you want ; flowers , chocolates , cards .
Flowers	what more do you need when you ' re panicking about a last_minute present ?
Flowers	the fact that they deliver it makes it all the more special .
Flowers	handing_over a bunch of flowers with chocolates and a card is nice but to get it delivered to your door ?
Flowers	everyone loves knowing someone ' s thinking of them .
Flowers	flowers reached fresh in the morning i am very pleased recommend , certainly order in the future
Flowers	another unhappy customer .
Flowers	ordered flowers on monday , did not receive them yesterday and have been told that they were delivered to a secure location at the front of the property .
Flowers	as the house faces on to a main_road , there are no secure locations .
Flowers	nobody has signed for them , the neighbours haven ' t signed for them and the only response i get is that they are waiting to hear from the courier .
Flowers	i am out of pocket and my partner did not receive any flowers on her_birthday .
Flowers	i live 000_miles_away and wont see her until the weekend , the flowers would have been a surprise for her as i said i hadn ' t sent anything to her as i would give her a card and present when i see her .
Flowers	so frustrated and disappointed .
Flowers	serenata come_across as not caring .
Flowers	i find companies that dont provide a telephone_number to call when you have a problem the ones that have something to hide .
Flowers	the usual excuse of 00 hour online support doesn ' t cut it for me .
Flowers	i would take 0 - 0 telephone support any day and feel someone is dealing_with my issue .
Flowers	the responses i am receiving at the moment are copied and pasted one liners .
Flowers	the last one being ..." as soon as a response has been received we will be updating you accordingly ."
Flowers	no sorry , no " i will chase them ".
Flowers	please do not order flowers from serenata if you expect to be treated like a good paying customer .
Flowers	you will not receive such treatment .
Flowers	rather , if you want to hand money over without expecting anything back , give it to charity or a homeless person to buy a hot meal .
Flowers	at_least you will feel_like you ' ve made a difference to someone_else ' s life and not be left frustrated and angry .
Flowers	rant over
Flowers	flowers were ordered for mothers_day and delivered on the wrong day .
Flowers	the bunch received was much smaller_than pictured ( rose & lilly bouquet image showed 0 lillies , received 0 that were both closed ).
Flowers	customer_service ' s department ( if there is one ) doesn ' t appear to feel the need to respond to the complaint .
Flowers	i ordered flowers in the morning for my girlfriend and wanted to make it delivered in the same day .
Flowers	this website makes order process easy and don ' t ask silly and unuseful questions => you can do it quickly !
Flowers	flowers were beautiful and made my girlfriend really happy ( we are picky and really i was worrying that it doesn ' t look good but hopefully it was great !)
Flowers	also , i ordered it from abroad but it worked !
Flowers	i ordered flowers from iflorst for same day delivery on 00 september and the flowers didn ' t arrive until 00 september - and they were very mediocre flowers too !
Flowers	iflorist don ' t make it obvious on their website but they ' re an online aggregator ( not a florist ) so have a florist network which they assign jobs to .
Flowers	they don ' t even have a contact number to call to sort out any_issues .
Flowers	when my friend didn ' t receive the flowers on 00 sept , i emailed them and tried to contact them via their ' online_chat ' service a total of 0 times !
Flowers	what i got was a robotic script and a refusal to be cooperative to sort out the issue .
Flowers	they made up various excuses for the delivery not being made on time ( i . e my friend was not home when the delivery was made when she was , that she did not pick_up their phone_calls ( she never received a call until 00 sept ) and they they left calling_cards , which she also never received .
Flowers	it wasn ' t until the 0th time i contacted them via their online_chat that they assigned the job to a different florist to make the delivery .
Flowers	the whole_process was long and painful .
Flowers	they also refused to compensate me in any way for missing my friend ' s birthday by more_than two_weeks .
Flowers	i would never recommend them to anyone ever and i just want to warn you before you make the mistake of ordering from them !
Flowers	ordered flowers for my girlfriend 0 days before valentines_day - mainly to avoid last_minute influx and make_sure they arrive on time .
Flowers	thankfully the flowers arrived at my partners work first thing in the morning - and received a thanks from her .
Flowers	however seeing them in person later that night , they were a lot smaller_than i expected and was not how it was " as pictured " as they make out on the site .
Flowers	they should maybe remove the option to order " standard ( as pictured )" if it ' s not going to be .
Flowers	also , they forgot to add my loving message to the flowers - which was a big_mistake since it is the 00th year i have been with my girlfriend , which the message referred to !
Flowers	flowers in general were fine - some wilting on the edges .
Flowers	mixed overall - will reconsider in future when ordering from this website .
Flowers	bra service - supernöjd
Flowers	the flowers were ordered for my mums_birthday - they were very disappointing .
Flowers	i will never order with you again .
Flowers	it was sad to see how disappointed she was - very upset !
Flowers	used them once and once was enough , sent flowers way too early and support was just scripted and useless .
Flowers	seems to be ran by some entrepreneur who clearly doesn ' t have a clue , just a fancy website to hide the lack of professionalism .
Flowers	i ordered large flowers on thursday for mothers_day - sunday 00th_march , i arrived home this afternoon to find a crushed pink box on my doorstep containing a few tulips which i did not order !!!
Flowers	( i could ' ve picked better from my garden ) i paid over £_00 for this order - wrong delivery date , wrong flowers and no answer from customer_service !
Flowers	never again - do not make the same mistake i and others have !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered a bunch of flowers and chocolates for nans 00th_birthday to be delivered as a suprise as she lives quite far away and i wasn ' t able to see her , i decided to order with the courier option for delivery ...
Flowers	so on the morning of the 0rd jan my chosen delivery date i logged on to track to find no tracking_number , alarm_bells rung as i ' d seen the other reviews on here after_placing my order ..
Flowers	so using the live_chat option spoke to a lady explaining my lack of tracking_number and my concern she reassured me that they would be delivered an was infact in transit ...
Flowers	i decided to call the call_centre to confirm and was told that they had no information and that they would call me back once they had spoken to courier ... 0 hours_later no phone call and no flowers so i tweeted them and was advised to ring yodel as they were the ones delivering i rung them to be informed that no order from iflorist had been placed !
Flowers	by this time i was so angry and upset so rung the call_centre after being cut_off 0 times i finally spoke to a young_girl who at first fed me the same lies as the lady on live_chat it ' s only when i called her bluff and said that i ' d spoke to yodel that she said that my order wouldn ' t be delivered today and she wasn ' t sure when it would be with my nan !
Flowers	i wa in tears at this point and asked for a refund so i could send my nan some more from a reliable company only to e told you can ' t have a refund unless the recipient refuses the delivery !!
Flowers	so not only did my 00 year_old nan not get her flowers she now has to refuse them !
Flowers	she then said there ' s nothing she can do !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	later that night about 0 i recoeved an_email to say my flowers were allocated and would be delivered the 0rd !!
Flowers	clearly not !
Flowers	i was then sent a dispatch email and told they would be here today 0 / 00 / 00 ..
Flowers	so although fuming i was happy with this , so this morning i logged to to track and no tracking_number !!!
Flowers	again rung yodel .. no such order with them !!!???
Flowers	sound familiar !
Flowers	so i went in live_chat to be lied to again and told that it was with yodel for delivery today i then told them that i ' d spoke to yodel only for him to reply that i ' m not alone and 000 people were missed due to " festive rush " !!!!!!
Flowers	but apparently they were all happy to reshcedule !!
Flowers	funnily_enough my nan can ' t reschedule her 00th !!!
Flowers	in a rage i phoned customer_services and asked for a refund as they had not fulfilled there duty only to be told they couldn ' t until the delivery was refused !!
Flowers	when i asked to speak to a manager i was told that they are all off to the 0th !!!
Flowers	he assured me that if they arrived dead try would collect them and refund !
Flowers	what a star !
Flowers	!
Flowers	so my hubby called them to be told that they will in fact refund me and would confirm right away via_email ....
Flowers	i ' m still_waiting for that !!
Flowers	i ' ve wasted £_00 . 00 and 00mins in total on the phone for my nan to end up with nothing !!!!
Flowers	shocking company don ' t use !
Flowers	i cannot complain_about anything !
Flowers	right from the selection of the flowers i had plenty of choice , all for a great price including extras .
Flowers	the checkout online was fast as simple .
Flowers	the flowers where delivered on time and exactly as planned .
Flowers	if anything was to go_wrong serenata emailed me throughout the process so i could of easily contacted them .
Flowers	lovely flowers , good value and delivered safely to relatives , they were very pleased but i haven ' t seen a picture .
Flowers	i was recommended iflorist from a friend .
Flowers	flowers are posted in a nice box , which is perfect to transport flowers and keeping them from getting damaged .
Flowers	the range of flowers are great , nice arrangements and prices are better_than most competitors .
Flowers	lots of great deals too .
Flowers	mine came with a free personalised card , which is perfect .
Flowers	same experience as previous reviewer .
Flowers	flowers didn ' t show up on mothers_day even_though i paid extra to guarantee this .
Flowers	just a weakly apologetic email after 0pm but no offer of a refund .
Flowers	the company ' s 0000 number leads to a recorded_message_saying ' we no_longer accept calls on this number .
Flowers	please visit the website '.
Flowers	it ' s the first time and last time i use eflorist .
Flowers	i think it ' s a scam .
Flowers	i ' ve been using the website for almost two years to send flowers from bulgaria to my colleagues in lithuania .
Flowers	every_single time everything was just perfect .
Flowers	delivery on time , even on valentine ' s day , which happened to be sunday last_year .
Flowers	customer_service is quite friendly and replies quickly .
Flowers	oh i almost forgot how generous they are for their regular customers offering discounts up to 00_% on their whole selection of amazing flowers .
Flowers	be sure to see for yourself , you ' ll find something to make your special people happy there !
Flowers	000_% satisfaction guaranteed !
Flowers	i was really impressed with the delivery service .
Flowers	serenata sent me an_email to let me know when the flowers were dispatched and another when they had been delivered .
Flowers	no other flower delivery company has done that before !
Flowers	very professional and the flowers were gorgeous .
Flowers	fresh and new so they will last longer .
Flowers	beautiful flowers with lots of choice .
Flowers	great offers including delivery and a variety of payment options .
Flowers	will_definitely return !
Flowers	i am genuinely really impressed .
Flowers	it was my first time having flowers delivered as i ' ve heard a few bad_experiences so have avoided it but as a last_minute birthday_present to a friend who lives far away i thought i ' d give it a go .
Flowers	everything from the reasonable prices , the tone of the communication , regular_updates , delivery and of course the flowers were spot on .
Flowers	will_definitely use again and would highly_recommend
Flowers	have used this company before , had no issues with them whatsoever .
Flowers	quality products at good prices .
Flowers	will use again
Flowers	really pleased with our end product ( personalised seed packets ) and love the personal , friendly service .
Flowers	even the invoice / stationery was floral with a bonus forget me not seed paper .
Flowers	too cute .
Flowers	delivered quickly and had an_email to advise of planned despatch .
Flowers	couldn ' t be better .
Flowers	thank_you .
Flowers	surely worth the money , simply amazing
Flowers	it was mine and my girlfriends first ever valentines together , i wanted things to go perfectly .
Flowers	i placed an order for 00 roses and a bottle of rose bubbly on the 00 / 00 /_0000 ( order 000000 ).
Flowers	i received my tracking_number and was a little_wary about the delivery service ( it looked like a dhl / fedex type caurier , hardly romantic ).
Flowers	anyway that was no big deal as long as everything arrived .
Flowers	around lunchtime my girlfriend receives a beaten up box with 00 flowers and no rose bubbly ( sounds_like she was lucky to receive anything ).
Flowers	obviously i am disappointed that less_than half the stuff i ordered arrived and that stuff that did arrive was not what was advertised / sold .
Flowers	i get straight on the phone to iflorist ( or try to ) & am greeted with a straight to voice_mail mumbling message ( it doesn ' t sound at all professional ) inforrming me to email them if i have any_problems ( not even leave a message & they ' ll get back or hold and someone will be with you message ).
Flowers	i try calling several more times , but get the same message .
Flowers	in then email them with my complaint , i hear nothing back , i email again , nothing , 0 hours_later ( at 0 . 00pm , far to late to deliver of the bottle of rose ) i get an_automated_response giving me a ticket number .
Flowers	i have emailed a further 0 times and called several more times and i have still not received even a basic acknowledgement or apology notification over 00_hours_later .
Flowers	i have never received such bad customer_service , surely a company should be ready and capable of providing a service they offer , even at busy times .
Flowers	iflorist made what was supposed to be a nice guesture into a disappointment .
Flowers	it made me look like i went to some cheap dodgy company i found on the internet .
Flowers	the first valentines_day with someone is supposed to be special and iflorist took some of that away .
Flowers	i will not be happy until i receive a full_refund for my order .
Flowers	i have used iflorist twice now .
Flowers	the first time i paid for before 0pm delivery the next_day and though the flowers did arrive before 0pm , at 0pm when i still not been told the flowers had been delivered i rang yodel ( the courier ) who informed me that the flowers had never actually been marked as a ' before 0pm delivery .'
Flowers	it was just chance that they were actually delivered before 0pm .
Flowers	now the second time i used iflorist , i placed my order on the 00th of february for delivery on the 00th and now come the 00th , they still_haven ' t been delivered .
Flowers	this is supposedly due to an ' address problem ,' i ' m not entirely sure what that means as the address was selected from a list on the site after i entered the postcode .
Flowers	i also know it exists as i ' ve visited and used the postcode to direct me to the address .
Flowers	no one from either yodel of iflorist has got in contact with me however to resolve the issue .
Flowers	i tried to contact iflorist and had no reply , so i tried for a second time and still nothing .
Flowers	eventually today i have managed to speak to a customer_service advisor on a ' live_chat ' function who has told me that the flowers are still with the courier due to an address problem .
Flowers	finally i have managed to talk to someone who has in turn offered for the flowers to be delivered by the florist on wednesday , this will be 00 days after_placing the order and also when one of the two recipients will be leaving the country in the early hours , never having received the flowers .
Flowers	there has been absolutely no contact between iflorist and myself apart_from the ' live_chat ' i have initiated , had i not done this , then who_knows when a bunch of dead flowers may have ended_up arriving at the recipients door .
Flowers	please , i cannot urge you enough not to use iflorist .
Flowers	the service is terrible and there is no customer support .
Flowers	when i asked why i had not been replied too , i was told they had been busy .
Flowers	that would not have been too much of an issue , had the first time i tried to contact them not been the 00th of february in regards to being charged for a before 0pm delivery yet yodel never being told about it .
Flowers	avoid , avoid , avoid !
Flowers	never again will i use iflorist and i hope you don ' t too !
Flowers	i bought some flowers to be delivered on the 0th but instead they were delivered a day early !
Flowers	no one was in to accept the delivery as i chose the 0th for a reason !
Flowers	not only that they were left outside in the pouring_rain and the box and flowers were drenched and had animals marking their territory on the box !
Flowers	so thank_you iflorist for a rubbish service and a terrible experience once again !
Flowers	quality of flowers were poor - tesco £ 0 job looks better and fresher !
Flowers	flowers were specifically supposed to be delivered on march00th , but did not show up untill 0pm on the 00th when i knew she would not be there to accept them .
Flowers	there is no customer_service phone number , and the mail administrator returned all my emails .
Flowers	i did eventually get the phone number from the people that delivered the flowers .
Flowers	the person i spoke to at iflorist was very nice and gave me a full_refund and let us keep the flowers .
Flowers	so i encourage all dissappointed customers to phone them and talk to them and make them accountable .
Flowers	the size of the bouquet was too small for the price i paid , and they made no attempt to match what i ordered .
Flowers	it was basically whatever they had left over at 0pm on mothers_day , as they got the order to a local_florist after holding it for 0 days .
Flowers	can ' t fault the service of eflorist - its hard work choosing which company to use to send flowers as there are loads out there and generally all have mixed_reviews .
Flowers	in the end i went with eflorist and i have very happy with the service - ordered day before for next_day delivery , and the flowers arrived before 0am the next_day - flowers were beautiful and looked pretty_much as in the photo ( it was one of the ones with sunflowers which were great ! )
Flowers	, and the flowers lasted over a week , in fact we have just thrown the last ones away over 00 days after getting them
Flowers	would definitely_recommend them and use again ,
Flowers	will
Flowers	i have bought a 00 long - stemmed red_roses that i never receive .
Flowers	i received instead other little roses .
Flowers	they were more but totally different respect of what i wanted and the vase was a poor quality green plastic .
Flowers	totally different from quality , appearance and value .
Flowers	i contacted them in chat , which i have to say that are kind and helpful and they gave an_email where i could raise my complain .
Flowers	i wrote them twice and nothing happen .
Flowers	i think is really dishonest make people think that you will deliver the flower chosen from your website and then do whatever you like , changing the order , based on factor that are really subjective .
Flowers	i will never buy from you again and i hope this review will help the poor customer to choose another more serious on line florist .
Flowers	i would like to report them , but i don ' t know exactly where and how .
Flowers	someone knows_how to do it ?
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my parents in law to mark the death of thier daughter .
Flowers	flowers never arrived and it took me 0 days to get an e mail response which was nothing but policy jargon .
Flowers	no phone number to call either .
Flowers	terrible service .
Flowers	disrespectful
Flowers	specifically chose a bouquet that didn ' t contain lillies , and the flowers arrived with two stems of the damn things !
Flowers	i guess i shouldn ' t complain too much because , unlike others , the flowers arrived , but it is still annoying .
Flowers	however , i ' m not sure how much of the blame can be apportioned to the individual florist , as that is actually where the flowers came from .
Flowers	did they get the order order wrong , or was it just duff information ?
Flowers	i won ' t be using them again , and therefore i ' m not interested in a paltry £ 0 off .
Flowers	steer_well clear people - there ' s a reason_why interflora is so successful ...
Flowers	ps_: do i actually have to give a rating ?
Flowers	can ' t it be zero ?
Flowers	i had an issue with redeeming a voucher_code .
Flowers	within 00_minutes of an_email asking for help i was called by a very nice and helpful assistant and the issue was resolved .
Flowers	i am more_than happy with the service provided and would definitely_recommend serenata to family and friends .
Flowers	i will be back :-)
Flowers	i received an_email confirmation that my flowers would be delivered yesterday , they still have not arrived to my mother and its getting late now , she ' s very upset as she thinks ive just forgotten about her .
Flowers	ive emailed and rang and cannot get on my account as the website isn ' t let me reset my password .
Flowers	i ' ve had no reply , can someone please let me know when they ' ll be here ?
Flowers	from all the terrible reviews i ' m terrified what state these flowers are going to turn_up in , if they do ever turn_up .
Flowers	ridiculous , so unprofessional .
Flowers	ordered the flowers around 0pm on a monday , and they were delivered by 0am the next_day .
Flowers	sent regular_emails and texts to keep me updated on the order .
Flowers	great service and will_definitely use them again !
Flowers	this is how all online_retailers should be !
Flowers	great communication and updates , fast response and the quality of the flowers are excellent .
Flowers	will_definitely use serenata in future
Flowers	ordered roses for valentine ' s on 00 january ... to arrive on 00 february and like so many others , nothing arrived .
Flowers	i do not think that it is acceptable that iflorist took my order a fortnight ago and after promising to deliver on valentine ' s day , could not manage this . this is the first time that i have used this company and i must_say that i am so disappointed .
Flowers	hope to have my money refunded and the order cancelled as the flowers are of no use to anyone now .
Flowers	so infuriated that i couldn ' t contact anyone to make further enquires !
Flowers	ruined the day totally .
Flowers	please do not use this company they took £_00 .
Flowers	00 out my account for flowers for my aunt in australia .
Flowers	the sent a delivery confirmation but flowers were never delivered .
Flowers	they have ignored my complaints and e . mails .
Flowers	i ordered flowers on 00 dec , for delivery on 00 dec .
Flowers	i received an order confirmation but it ' s now the 00th and still no flowers .
Flowers	i ' m extremely disappointed as we waited in all day on the 00th for them instead of going out for my mum ' s birthday and they never showed up .
Flowers	the money has gone from my account too so they certainly got my order , just have chosen not to fulfil it .
Flowers	i want my money back now !
Flowers	there is no way to call them , so i have left several email messages but none have been replied .
Flowers	their ' online_chat ' service is off too .
Flowers	total_con merchants .
Flowers	do not use this company .
Flowers	even if they were struggling with orders they should send an_email out to say it will be delayed rather_than leaving customers feeling cheated .
Flowers	totally appalling customer_service .
Flowers	i would give them zero_stars if i could .
Flowers	very disappointed to learn that the flowers i ordered due for delivery on saturday , 00 september had still not been delivered by the end of monday , 00 september .
Flowers	we had ordered these flowers for my inlaws ruby wedding_anniversary and now the moment has truely passed .
Flowers	i have had no acknoledgement from the email i sent to complain_about this ( apart_from an_automated_response ).
Flowers	i await a full_refund for the flowers .
Flowers	paid for pre_- 0pm delivery and it didnt turn_up .
Flowers	not only that , its not coming today !
Flowers	whats the point of buying anniversary flowers if they dont come on the anniversary ??!
Flowers	totally ruined the surprise and our day .
Flowers	didnt even have the courtesy to phone back when they said they would .
Flowers	will never use sernata again .
Flowers	after_reading all these bad_reviews after already placing an order with serenata_flowers i was really nervous but i had absolutely nothing to worry_about .
Flowers	they arrived before 00am on the day that i had asked them to be delivered and the flowers are gorgeous .
Flowers	couldnt have asked for anything better .
Flowers	will_definitely_recommend to family and friends !
Flowers	arena_flowers have a hilarious twitter account , wonderful flowers and the easiest service you could wish for .
Flowers	i read these reviews yesterday with horror .
Flowers	i ' m not too sure what made me continue with my order , i guess because i can be stubborn / stupid and i had a discount_code !
Flowers	i received flowers from serenata last_year , the first time i ' d heard of them and soon after bought some for my mum ... both were lovely .
Flowers	great news !
Flowers	i ' ve just had a phone call from my grandma thanking me for the lovely flowers .
Flowers	the only problem i had was that my discount_code didn ' t work in the checkout .
Flowers	that did annoy me somewhat especially as i ' d allowed myself to be upsold based on having the discount .
Flowers	i placed the order anyway because i wanted the flowers .
Flowers	then i emailed their customer_service telling them what happened and advising that i would be much more likely to use them again if they honoured my discount_code .
Flowers	hey_presto today i have an_email response telling_me £ 0 has been refunded to my card !
Flowers	i honestly can ' t fault them so in the interests of fairness thought i should add my positive experience here .
Flowers	excellent flowers , so pretty and well arranged .
Flowers	kept very informed about process and each_step of delivery , really went above and beyond .
Flowers	i ordered a lovely bouquet of flowers and hand chocolate made with 0 days before my sisters birthday but they got with a day late .
Flowers	i really wanted those flowers to get to her in time .
Flowers	i haven ' t seen her for an year and i wanted to make her a little surprise as much as i could .
Flowers	:-(
Flowers	it ' s good though that the flowers got to her in the end entire ( bouquet and chocolate ).
Flowers	wonderful business , easy website to find exactly_what you want for every occasion , next_day delivery and apparently the delivery staff are very polite and friendly !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i never make reviews ever but feel i should in this instance .
Flowers	it was my grandmother ' s 00th yesterday and even amidst the chaos of mother ' s day just around the corner the flowers arrived on time as promised .
Flowers	not only that but they were packaged with extreme care , i paid extra for a larger bunch and the first thing my gran said was that they looked really big and presented beautifully , in my grans words she said " they ' re beautiful , just perfect ."
Flowers	so thank_you very much serenata as you ' ve made my gran smile on her_birthday and seeing her happy is priceless for me .
Flowers	thank_you again .
Flowers	ordered flowers to arrive 00th , it is now 00 and still nothing .
Flowers	do not use
Flowers	service is a complete_joke , i got an_email this morning 00oclock saying my flowers had been dispatched .
Flowers	at 0 . 00 i tried_contacting them to which i found they dont even have a phone line ...
Flowers	i mean what sort of joke is that .
Flowers	i write an_email asking where was my delivery , since its my girfriends birthday and she finishes work at 0 .
Flowers	so all i ask was a simple change of delivery address .... after moaning far more_than i had to go get it changed i then recieve a tx message at 0 : 00 saying the flowers was unable to be delivered since no one was in to collect them .
Flowers	i then email the company back again asking where the hell are the flowers i have been in waiting and suprise_suprise the guy taken it to the wrong_address even_though i confirmed the new address 0 hours prior !!
Flowers	i ask for a refund and all i got was crap about we hold the right to deliver untill 0 on busy_periods .
Flowers	its october the 0th not x - mas !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	dont buy through these people !!!!
Flowers	they suck big time
Flowers	couldn ' t ask for much more , great choice of flowers and gifts , mum should love it !
Flowers	am always impressed by the service i get from serenata .
Flowers	their customer_service is outstanding day or night .
Flowers	i would definitely_recommend to others .
Flowers	i ' m_glad i found the company , who would have thought after searching for the internet for cheap flower delivery i would find such a great company with bargain prices .
Flowers	i was disappointed with the size of the bunch of flowers i had ordered .
Flowers	i thought ordering " grandissimo " would mean a huge bunch !
Flowers	but it wasn ' t .
Flowers	also , the green stick was broken at the top and the card wasn ' t attached to it .
Flowers	the box of chocolates was tiny !
Flowers	and i didn ' t like that the flowers and the balloon came in boxes .
Flowers	i felt that it spoiled the effect as it took a while to be able to get the flowers out of the box !!
Flowers	could only do it by tearing / cutting into it .
Flowers	would ' ve been much_nicer if they were presented / handed directly to the recipient .
Flowers	despite all the negative_reviews and positive_reviews accused as ' robots ', i decided to try and see for myself .
Flowers	i ordered a val ' s day bouquet + complementary chocolate for a discounted price of 0 , 00 pounds (+ i used a 0 pound voucher ), and it arrived very beautifully in a box .
Flowers	i refrained from reviewing it until now to see how fresh the flowers were , and there it is , almost 00 days from delivery date and still blooming and smelling wonderful .
Flowers	i recommend this florist to anyone_wanting a bouquet of good value .
Flowers	anyone thinking this is just another robot posting can ask for a picture of the beautiful bouquet that was delivered .
Flowers	my gf was thrilled .
Flowers	thank_you again , iflorist :)
Flowers	ordered flowers to be delivered next_day they never delivered them . they apologised blaming the courier they use . im now waiting for a refund . very bad service .
Flowers	easy to use , excellent prices and delivery when needed !
Flowers	thanks !
Flowers	ready for mother ' s day my girlfriend ordered flowers that were supposed to be delivered today ( 0 / 0 /_0000 ) but now 00 . 00pm and no flowers arrived at my mother in laws house
Flowers	i would feel far better if there was a phone number to call as i have been worrying all day , but nope .
Flowers	no flowers , no contact from company and i ' m down £_00 !
Flowers	i ' m partly posting on here as i see some people have had the situation explained to them !
Flowers	i wanted a pick me up for my mum
Flowers	who had a bad morning looked on line florists near ( destination ) and was amazed to see
Flowers	the price and the prompt service for the flowers .
Flowers	i ordered and flowers and recipient received in just under an hr half .
Flowers	the flowers are beautiful thank
Flowers	u
Flowers	very impressed with the level of contact - texts to let me know they had received the order , they were en_route with the delivery and when they ' d been delivered !
Flowers	fantastic service and beautiful flowers !
Flowers	i have never felt_compelled to give a product or service bad feedback before , however the service ( if one can even call it that ) i have recieved this weekend from serenata_flowers has left me angry , frustrated and £_00 out of pocket .
Flowers	despite living on a very tight_budget with very little disposable income , i of course had to spend some of my hard_earned cash to send my mum some flowers for mother ' s day .
Flowers	at first look , serenata seemed to offer great value for money on lovely bouquets .
Flowers	i added to my basket a bouquet for the reasonable_price of £_00 , however on checking out the website told me my payment had failed so i abandoned their site and went to look_elsewhere for a deal online .
Flowers	a few minutes later , i recieved an_email from serenata offering me 00_%_off if i retrieved the contents of my basket and attempted to order again .
Flowers	with money so tight this seemed too good to refuse , and of course i did so .
Flowers	imagine my horror when i checked my online_banking the following_morning to find two payments had been take from my account by serenata - the first for £_00 . 00 and the second for £_00 . 00 .
Flowers	as soon as i discovered this error , i immediately contacted serenata .
Flowers	the phone number on their customer care page would not connect , and so i send them a message via the site explaining what had happened .
Flowers	working in customer_services myself , i assumed that they would simply correct the error by refunding one of my payments and apologise for the inconvenience .
Flowers	i could not have been more wrong .
Flowers	their only response was that both orders had already been assigned to production for dispatch and so there was nothing they could do to rectify their error .
Flowers	i requested a phone number where i could speak to a representative , but was fobbed_off and told that as they were an e commerce company they only deal with customer complaints via_email .
Flowers	their correspondence continued with them claiming to have sent me an_email confirmation for my original order - i can_assure you that this was not the case .
Flowers	the only email i received from them was the aforementioned one offering me a discount if i attempted ordering again .
Flowers	the only consolation they were willing to offer me was that both bouquets would be delivered today .
Flowers	" great ", i thought to myself , " my mum will be delivered two of the same bouquet for mother ' s day and i will be eating from the reduced section at the supermarket for the remainder of the fortnight ."
Flowers	you can not imagine the anger and frustration that i then felt when i left work today and read a text_message from my mum thanking me for the bouquet of flowers .
Flowers	bouquet = single , not plural .
Flowers	after charging me twice - when the error was their own after their company website rejected my payment and sending me a misleading email offering me a discount thus luring me to spend with them again , responding to my query with terribly unhelpful " customer care " and refusing to refund my money , it was the foul icing on the metaphorical stale cake that is the serenata_flowers customer experience when my mum recieved only one of the two bouquets that i ended_up paying for .
Flowers	i have genuinely never felt so angry and frustrated by a company ' s lack of customer_service in my life .
Flowers	serenata_flowers have lost my custom , that of my friends and family , and hopefully that of anyone who reads this review .
Flowers	my wife got both of my orders on valentine ' s day which arrived at her workplace and words cannot describe how embarrassed she was - for her colleagues having to see such pathetic flowers ordered by her husband .
Flowers	words cannot describe how bad i felt and how cheap i must have looked in her workmates ' eyes because in all honesty , these are the absolute worst flowers i have ever ordered from any company and i have used interflora and bunches and don ' t know why i didn ' t just stick with them .
Flowers	heck , even aldi do far better flowers for less cost !
Flowers	the first order was of a single dead , dried rose in a broken vase .
Flowers	there was glass everywhere .
Flowers	this is the one that should have had tracking but i never even received a tracking_number .
Flowers	the second order ' true romance ' was a million miles_away from the photo on the webpage .
Flowers	instead of true romance i got ' herpes in the jungle ' - 0 roses , 0 incredibly wilted and dry and 0 passable with lots of brownery and small dead flowers .
Flowers	it didn ' t come with the message card and oh , they actually smelled bad too .
Flowers	i am absolutely astonished .
Flowers	whoever made these did not actually care about the quality of the flowers they were giving and it has to be the biggest joke of a company to have sent these out , actually thinking that it was ok to do so .
Flowers	i am sure that these were sent out with the knowledge that there would be a complaint but since they ' re making enough money off the back or valentine ' s day , they probably reasoned they would be able to absorb the costs of refunds from those who would complain .
Flowers	none of the flowers were actually salvagable and seeing these and comparing them to the pictures on the website makes me feel so pissed_off .
Flowers	the difference is a million miles apart .
Flowers	i requested my refund after finally having my email message read after 0 days .
Flowers	a simple apology but nothing further than that .
Flowers	( i would have phoned but this joke of a company doesn ' t have a phone number )
Flowers	you ruined my valentine ' s day iflorist and you don ' t even care ! i
Flowers	great service .
Flowers	flowers good from what feedback received
Flowers	ordered my partner a valentines bouquet which should have been delivered on valentines_day ( as you would expect ).
Flowers	i checked the order tracking throughout the delivery day to see it had been ' out for delivery ' from 00 . 00 .
Flowers	this didn ' t change all day .
Flowers	i contacted their chosen courier ( yodel ) who informed me they could be delivered up to 0pm , i asked my girlfriend to stay in work til then which she did but still received no delivery .
Flowers	i emailed prestige_flowers to ask for a refund and to ensure the delivery was not attempted however on checking the tracking later that day i see they were out for delivery again .
Flowers	i specifically asked for these not to be delivered as my girlfriend is now away for 0 days and i don ' t want her to come back to a dead bunch of flowers ( not the romantic gesture i was hoping for ).
Flowers	i then spoke to raf at their customer_service centre which is actually a generic inbound call_centre who informed me that within their terms and conditions they don ' t have to deliver them on the day they say they will .
Flowers	and even refuse to stop the delivery going ahead or refund the delivery costs .
Flowers	i notice that negative_reviews never make their website , however i will be posting a link to this on twitter and facebook to try to ensure that people actually see it .
Flowers	bought valentines flowers , company sent an_apology email_saying they couldn ' t deliver on the 00th despite ordering on the 00 , was disappointing but these things do happen , was promised a doubling to 00 roses , on the 00th , they didn ' t arrive until the following_monday and only 00 arrived .
Flowers	safe to say this company has a long way to go to operating a smooth operation that wont disappoint it ' s customers .
Flowers	the prices are really reasonable and quality is superb .
Flowers	love that you are kept up to date with delivery status .
Flowers	cannot_fault and will definetly use again .
Flowers	i am_disgusted in the quality of flowers that i bought and my mum had to receive .
Flowers	the pink roses are 00_% brown and one even being completely dead .
Flowers	i do not understand how ' iflorist ' could think this is acceptable to sent these flowers and for my mum to be delivered such an awful ' present '.
Flowers	when i came home and saw the flowers i was truly embarrassed .
Flowers	then for my mum to then say to me ' i didn ' t want to say on the phone and you to be upset but the flowers are brown '.
Flowers	i paid for my mum to be send a lovely bunch of flowers to make her smile and brighten up her day , instead i ' ve spent a considerable_amount of money on an absolutely dreadful bunch of flowers .
Flowers	i wish i had read these reviews first before ordering .
Flowers	bobbie hudson
Flowers	easy , no hassle ordering .
Flowers	very reasonably_priced flowers .
Flowers	a great range of bouquets and gift_ideas .
Flowers	i ' ve never had any_problems with serenata .
Flowers	arranged flowers for my mother in law they " emailed " not even a phone call to say that they had not passed it to a florist and would i like to call them and get a refund or a re - delivery .
Flowers	the next_day i emailed again and got a reply to say that they had refunded as they do not have any florists in the area !!
Flowers	not remote area its crawley !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	will not deal with again and would avoid ,
Flowers	my mother in law , i am sure now thinks that we forgot her_birthday because of them !
Flowers	!
Flowers	my girlfriend was very happy with her flowers , they were massive too .
Flowers	such great value when other shops would charge twice as much .
Flowers	free and fast delivery .
Flowers	they let you know whats_happening with the parcel every_step of the way .
Flowers	very pleased
Flowers	these were not delivered according to recipient .
Flowers	i was so happy with the bouquet my daughter sent via the marvellous interflora that i thought i ' d let everyone know .
Flowers	beautifully arranged and they ' re still going strong a week_later !
Flowers	i have only received interflora flowers a few_times in my life , and i must_say that every bouquet has been a delight .
Flowers	thanks interflora , and thank_you most of all emma .
Flowers	x
Flowers	i wanted to send flowers to my mum and i came_across this website . i usually stray away from ordering products on - line but i gave this one a go . it was so clear and easy that it only took a few minutes making my life_easier and my mum very happy . a win_win situation . beautiful flowers ordered in minutes what a breeze . i recommend you do the same ! x
Flowers	living in the uk , i placed and order to have my mothers flowers delivered in nz for her_birthday only to be told on the morning ( uk time ) of her_birthday ( nz night ) that they do not deliver to that part of nz .
Flowers	may i add that she lives in central auckland , the largest city in the country .
Flowers	absolutely appalled and now i have to let my mother know that nothing will be turning_up for her .
Flowers	response from the company offers no explanation why they cannot deliver to the largest city in the county and the voucher was a lousy 00_%_off , if it was 00_%_off another respectable company then maybe i would use it , not touching these_guys with a 00ft pole
Flowers	jag skulle beställa blommor till min mamma på mors dag .
Flowers	första strulet var vid själva beställningen .
Flowers	jag försökte tre gånger betala med kort men_det gick inte .
Flowers	till slut fick jag gå omvägen via_paypal för att kunna betala , men nu i efterhand ser jag att jag blivit dubbeldebiterad - det_har tagits betalt både direkt och via_paypal .
Flowers	sen levererades inte blommorna förrän sent på kvällen , vilket ledde till att min_mor inte fick dem förrän dagen_efter när hon skulle gå till jobbet .
Flowers	skitdåligt .
Flowers	ordered flowers 0 days ahead for my partners_birthday and got nothing !
Flowers	no phone call or ring at the door .
Flowers	i know this because i and 0 others were at this address all day .
Flowers	i got in touch only to be given the classic untrue tales , i . e " the courier service attempted delivery at the address provided by you on the scheduled date , but there was no one to receive the order , so a card was left ".
Flowers	how is that even possible , when no card was left and we were in all day ?
Flowers	i wish i never bothered with this unreliable company , somethings are not just about the money but reliability .
Flowers	it was a special occasion and no good to me if they couldn ' t do the simple job of delivering the flower for the occasion .
Flowers	my advise is take your money somewhere_else and let them feel it where it hurts .
Flowers	absolutely atrocious service !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	perfect - i ' d recommend to anyone , girlfriend thrilled with flowers .
Flowers	one thing that i do like , is you can see a different image for ' small ' ' medium ' and ' large ' bouquets .
Flowers	usually , you see an amazing picture , click it , and then find that large is an extra £_00 . 00 - which usually means that the amazing picture you ' ve seen is small - and your flowers are going to look poor .
Flowers	with eflorist , you see each type .
Flowers	i chose medium - the bouqet was huge !
Flowers	i shall definitely be back .
Flowers	the flowers were lovely , they were for my boyfriends mum for her_birthday and he sent me a picture of them but they were quite a small bunch .
Flowers	it did look like there were lots of flowers still to come out so they might look better within the next couple of days .
Flowers	i was kept up to date on the progress all the time .
Flowers	i had to change the delivery address and within half an_hour of emailing them the change they had emailed back to say it had been changed .
Flowers	overall very impressed and would use again .
Flowers	i got what they promised .
Flowers	delivery of a bunch of flowers from the uk to ireland in one day .
Flowers	i will use them again .
Flowers	this is the first time i ' ve ordered and i am so pleased !
Flowers	online ordering was quick and simple and i chose next_day delivery .
Flowers	was surprised to get texts to confirm that flowers had been dispatched and another when delivered .
Flowers	my nana was chuffed to bits with her flowers !
Flowers	i will be back again a + on customer_service thank_you so much , kate
Flowers	i have ordered flowers for my mother a week in_advance to make_sure they will be able to deliver .
Flowers	today was supposed to be a delivery day and i have instructed my mother to be at home because there will be a surprise coming for her .
Flowers	at about 0pm i was a bit_worried and contacted local flora_queen customer_service via phone as well as sent a request via their website to investigate .
Flowers	there was no answer what so ever since and via phone i was only informed that the order was picked_up by the florist !
Flowers	i wasnt informed which one ( so i can do the job for them and contact florist directly ) and i wasnt informed what time the delivery will be there .
Flowers	i was only told " i believe it will be delivered today ".
Flowers	you believe ?!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	not to mention that my father is on a wheelchair and at home 00 / 0 to be able to pick_up that order so any excuse of that kind is out of the question .
Flowers	now sitting here and writing it its already 0 . 00 pm in poland so every florist is long closed !!!!
Flowers	i was trying to call again customer_service but they are already closed !
Flowers	what a useless service ... all day their website chat help was off ... and now the phone line doesnt answer at all as if they unplugged the phone number .
Flowers	and this has to be said that they were very quick to collect my money paid via_paypal !!!!
Flowers	usually companies tend to wait ( other florists i used before ) until the flowers are actually delivered !
Flowers	flora_queen takes " pre_- payment " and takes a p **** after that .
Flowers	i am disappointed , mad and i believe this is a scam ...
Flowers	i ave ordered flowers for nearly £_00 and was expecting to be provided with the service matching the price .
Flowers	please don ' t use them - its not worth the hassle , nerves and hours spent on the phone trying to contact them ... you are gonna waste your money not to mention that you exposing your card_details to scammers ...
Flowers	and to be frank i am not just a picky customer ...
Flowers	i understand that there might be things out of their controls however they should have in place a tracking_system and be able to advise customer what is going on ... at_least have some customer_service you could actually contact .
Flowers	very very disappointed !
Flowers	ik
Flowers	************************
Flowers	so ....
Flowers	i have to update this now ... the flowers were delivered eventually at 00pm ( what a commitment !)
Flowers	however i have ordered yellow flowers and got pink ones ... delivered flowers died the very next morning and fall off !
Flowers	wtf !
Flowers	really ?
Flowers	for the price of £_00 ?
Flowers	the vase delivered looked like a cheap glass which you could buy for £ 0 and i was charged £ 0 . 0 ... and not always that is the only problem .
Flowers	i would be able to understand if they would be having a office and send requests to local flower shops to prepare and deliver but no !
Flowers	they prepare flowers themselves so there should be no excuse in the quality and colours etc .
Flowers	at_least i should have been contacted and advised that they don ' t have yellow flowers but pink so i could make the final decision .
Flowers	in my case i have a pink flowers delivered to a person who cannot stand that colour !
Flowers	and more ... the picture on their web suggested that there will be at_least 00 lillies so i have ordered the premium version and delivered was ... 0 !
Flowers	what ?
Flowers	to be honest the total prize of what was delivered was about £_00 ( max !)
Flowers	on the market and i was charged £_00 !
Flowers	anyhow i will never use this service again !
Flowers	and i hope you will find my comments useful and save_yourself money and stress .
Flowers	i haven ' t seen the flowers as they were a gift .
Flowers	i was thanked by the recipient however and she called them beautiful .
Flowers	the communication was superb , with step by step information by text and email .
Flowers	couldn ' t be_happier .
Flowers	flowers were delivered on time and my friend loved them .
Flowers	can ' t complain .
Flowers	what a shame some other people have had such bad_experiences !
Flowers	my fiance ordered roses for valentines_day from this company to be delivered before 0pm , as reading a lot of the other reviews it looks_like we are not alone on this .
Flowers	i still_haven ' t recieved my flowers !
Flowers	on yodel tracking it shows the flowers are delayed , then sent back then sent out for delivery again then delivery not attempted and sent back again and now out for delivery again today .
Flowers	after numerous_emails and trying to contact them on the phone ( which never gets answered ) i finally managed to speak to someone online today .
Flowers	they said that my flowers are out for delivery today !!
Flowers	i said i do not want them now and would like a full_refund .
Flowers	i have been given a number to contact but to be honest i ' m fed_up of chasing this company !!!
Flowers	i insist on a full_refund and would like someone to contact me asap !
Flowers	!
Flowers	very quick to take the money out your bank !!
Flowers	shambles of a company .
Flowers	will never use again .
Flowers	delivery of flowers turned_up this afternoon , damaged box , dead flowers and to top it off not the flowers my fiancée ordered me .
Flowers	he ordered roses i got carnations with lots of green flowers to !
Flowers	not a rose in sight .
Flowers	i could of got better flowers from my local_garage .
Flowers	didn ' t accept the flowers as they were damaged and not what he had ordered and paid for so i sent them back with the delivery driver .
Flowers	iflorist you need to sort it out .
Flowers	i would like a full_refund !
Flowers	i am absolutely appalled with i - florist . co . uk .
Flowers	i spent £_00 . 00 on 00 red_roses to be delivered on christmas_eve to my girlfriend in sweden , whom i don ' t see very often as i reside in the u . k . she never received her christmas flowers .
Flowers	needless to say i was disappointed to hear she hadn ' t received my gift .
Flowers	i tried to fix the problem by speaking to the customer_service team .... the first time i spoke with the on - line customer_service team they assured me that they would resend the order , but they were not delivered .
Flowers	so i spoke to another member of the team later that week , same scene " we will resend the order "... not delivered .
Flowers	the third time i spoke with another member of the customer_service team the offered me a full_refund or , guess_what !
Flowers	!.... the could resend the order !... so again i agreed to this ... not delivered !
Flowers	after almost 0 weeks the flowers had still not been delivered , yet i had been charged for the service ...
Flowers	i reluctantly_accepted a refund .
Flowers	i am thoroughly unhappy with the " service ".... my girlfriend didn ' t get her christmas_present this year .
Flowers	i am not in the habit of spending nearly £_00 for nothing , what a waste of time .
Flowers	thank_you i - florist .. next time i want to give someone flowers , i ' l take some time off work and deliver them myself !
Flowers	my flowers never arrived and the number that they gave me to call is not in service !
Flowers	how can this company still be in operation
Flowers	beautiful flowers , speedy_delivery , amazing price !
Flowers	very very very happy !!!
Flowers	would highly_recommend , absolutely_brilliant !
Flowers	flowers delivered on friday for my wife ' s birthday .
Flowers	flowers were all disheveled with some heads cut_off .
Flowers	offered a replacement or refund .
Flowers	chose replacement for saturday .
Flowers	waited at home for their full thirteen hour delivery window with no sign of them .
Flowers	emailed twice to find out what ' s happening ( no reply to the first one and there ' s no phone number ).
Flowers	told that ' adverse_weather ' prevented delivery but don ' t know how they couldn ' t have contacted me as they have my number and email .
Flowers	now pushing for a refund as i ' ve had enough .
Flowers	keep you informed every_step of the way .
Flowers	wonderful service , beautiful flowers would recommend .
Flowers	awful service really disappointed !
Flowers	turned_up five days late and were dead .
Flowers	they were for a birthday_present and turned_up ridiculously late .
Flowers	embarrassed by the awful ' present ' they got .
Flowers	why put a delivery date if they can ' t stick to it ?
Flowers	!
Flowers	very easy website , great pricing , delivery very quickly and at christmas .
Flowers	last_night around 00 pm i asked whether a change could have been made to one of my two orders , both paid for and i has received order confirmations .
Flowers	i was told my order was still complete .
Flowers	firstly i was told one order hasn ' t been paid for then i was told the second hasn ' t been paid for .
Flowers	at 0 . 00 am i gave up seeking clarity and went to bed .
Flowers	i wanted these to be special treat for my mum and mother in law but instead i went to sleep worrying that neither of my orders were going to be delivered .
Flowers	the customer_services agents didnt have a clue about what was going on with both my orders
Flowers	this morning my mother in law got her flowers and they looked a mess .
Flowers	unpresentable and the quality of the bunch was rubbish .
Flowers	i really should have gone to a local_florist and spent £_00 x 0 on a decent bunch .
Flowers	i ' m dreading what my mums look like .
Flowers	never again .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for my wife to be delivered on valentine ' s day - order was made a week earlier - i paid extra £ 0 for before noon delivery - at 0pm i received the email claiming that the flowers were delivered , but it turned_out that they were delivered to wrong_address .
Flowers	wanted to call serenata_flowers but they do not provide a phone number on their website .
Flowers	send them an_email which went without reply even_tho they claim that they response time is no_longer_than 0hrs .
Flowers	just sent another one asking for a full_refund .
Flowers	avoid this company as it ' s completely unreliable !
Flowers	will never use them again
Flowers	will wait to see what flowers are like and whether delivery is good before giving a full review though
Flowers	i ordered two bouquets both supposedly £_00 . 00 arrangements , one summer chintz one cherub pink , was sent two cherub pink , both of which were not very healthy !
Flowers	then to be told when i called oh the chintz is sold out that ' s why , well why let me order them two days ago , they arrived without being in the gift bag as stated in the description leaving the plastic container for feeding whilst travelling on show , so disappointed :-( they are also tiny !
Flowers	nothing at all like the photograph
Flowers	ohh , i don ' t even know where to begin on the fantastic service provided by serenata_flowers !
Flowers	the lack of order confirmation took us off to a grand start .
Flowers	i chased up to confirm my order and was told repeatedly that i had not placed an order .
Flowers	after being made to feel_like an_idiot after numerious emails from a charming female on their customer_services team , i even began to convince myself that i hadn ' t placed an order .
Flowers	after all , they were happy to point the finger and put blame on me (' the order wasn ' t completed due to lack of input on my behalf ) so maybe they were right . maybe i was the moronic customer who was unable to place a simple order , that they ' d made me out to be !
Flowers	if you ' re into s & m , this is the company for you , cause they know how to talk down to you and make you feel_like you ' re nothing .
Flowers	i checked my bank_account and found that the value of my order had been deducted from my account .
Flowers	i contacted customer_services who told me again , i had not placed an order .
Flowers	morons .
Flowers	this morning , at 0 . 00am , i get an_email from serenata , telling_me that they have located my order and it will be delivered today .... no apology , no ' sorry for belittling you and making you feel_like an_idiot ', no opportunity to cancel after their downright disgusting attitude_towards me , nothing .
Flowers	i sent a complaint at 0 . 00am , no reply .
Flowers	i contacted them again at 00 . 00am , and received a reply saying they ' d ' not received my complaint '.
Flowers	obviously , i expected this so i bashed out another complaint to another member of the customer_services team .
Flowers	anticipating my reply within the hour ( as the response time is clearly_stated on their website ), i waited an_hour .
Flowers	surprisingly , she has not replied to my complaint , nor the chase i sent an_hour later .... or the chase that i sent in an_hour after that .
Flowers	four complaints in total now , and not even a hint of ' sorry '.
Flowers	all in all , an absolutely_appalling service from an absolutely_appalling company .
Flowers	however , i will_continue to keep contacting their diabolical excuse for a customer_service team , until i receive an_apology .
Flowers	update !
Flowers	i ' ve enclosed my final email , just so people thinking of using the company understand exactly why not to use them .
Flowers	" hi stephanie ,
Flowers	thank_you for your reply .
Flowers	although you are trying to build bridges , i feel that two complaints to a customer_services team is completely_unacceptable .
Flowers	not only those two complaints , one wasn ’ t even answered and the other took three follow ups from myself and almost four hours for a response .
Flowers	pretty shoddy , considering your website states that between the hours of 0am - 0pm , you will reply within the hour , apart_from in peak_times .
Flowers	i work in customer_services myself and i know for a fact that the service i have received from serenata is not just poor , it is absolutely_appalling .
Flowers	half the staff i ’ ve spoken to at serenata have told me i ’ ve not placed an order .
Flowers	my emails have not been thoroughly read , with members of your customer_service team continuously overlooking the fact that i already know that mm0000000 was a failed order , yet constantly referring back to it .
Flowers	not one single member of your customer_services team has taken the time to treat me with a bit of respect , or even put their hands up and say ’ this might be a technical_error , wait_until tomorrow and we ’ ll check again then ’.
Flowers	further to this , nobody has acknowledged the complaints i ’ ve made about your customer_service team either .
Flowers	the amount of emails that i have had to send just to find out i was right all along is absolutely_shocking .
Flowers	further to this , the fact that in all the communication i ’ ve had with yourselves i ’ m_assuming close to 00 emails on my behalf now , you ’ ve been the first person to offer an_apology - that ’_s absolutely_disgusting .
Flowers	00_%_off is not a patch of compensation towards how rude and disrespectful your staff have been to me , but i ’ d have to be hugely deluded to think that you ’ d be willing to give anything more back to a very upset customer .
Flowers	that being said , as it ’_s obviously the ’ best ’ you can do , i might as well count my losses and accept it .
Flowers	after all , it ’_s better_than nothing .
Flowers	i hope that your customer_services team learn from this experience though i very much doubt that they will and that maybe you ’ ll gain a stronger team from it "
Flowers	as my girlfriend and i are apart on valentines this year .
Flowers	we wanted to postpone valentines until she was back home .
Flowers	however , as she is down about being away from home because of work i thought i ' d surprise her with roses on valentines to cheer her up .
Flowers	the flowers had not been received by her and to make_matters worse she had secretly sent me a valentines gift .
Flowers	so she assumes now that i have got her nothing for valentines .
Flowers	overall , i ' m completely humiliated as i sent them to her work place and she is off for the weekend after valentines evening .
Flowers	update
Flowers	just got a text from my girlfriends friend telling_me that the flowers have come , the flowers are wilted and dying ( i was sent a photo ).
Flowers	but my girlfriend is in a different city now anyway .
Flowers	i ' m_glad she is 000_miles_away so she wouldn ' t be humiliated when opening these in front of all her friends .
Flowers	i placed order 000000 for delivery on valentines_day to my partners work .
Flowers	i ensured the address details were correct and payment taken yet no flowers have been delivered !
Flowers	to say my partner and i are upset and aggrieved is a huge understatement !
Flowers	my partner had to stay at work late to wait for this delivery despite having to leave work earlier , so this has been a great embarrassment !
Flowers	the moment for delivery and for my surprise has now passed , and i can ' t understand how you can promise something you can ' t deliver , and having read reviews i am not the only one .
Flowers	i have demanded a full_refund of the amount paid immediately or shall be taking this further .
Flowers	lovely flowers and good service .
Flowers	did the job of cheering up my partner , she was so happy and so impressed with the flowers .
Flowers	thankyou !
Flowers	:)
Flowers	order supposedly delivered but the person who was to receive nothing gets !
Flowers	order was already 0 days after the delivery date and still_waiting , no information what ' s going on .
Flowers	i lost 000_pounds .... time ... trust ...
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	well i ordered some flowers for my mum because she wasn ' t well and i have to say i was over the moon when they arrived at their house .
Flowers	gorgeous , fresh , beautifully_presented .
Flowers	after the dead roses i received late from interflora for valentines today i will be dropping hints for next february to my hubby about eflorist :)
Flowers	ordered my mothers_day flowers + vase a week before to arrive 00th , thinking i ' d try a new online florist .
Flowers	obviously will stick to what i know is best .
Flowers	true that you get what you pay for !
Flowers	made my order on 00th , received a email to confirm , and to let me know the flowers were ready for dispatch ?)
Flowers	and a tracking_number which didn ' t work .
Flowers	no response to my email , or complaint i made that my mum did not get her flowers , was on hold each time i called the 0000 number , for around 00_mins before giving up .
Flowers	lucky for me i chose paypal to open a dispute and hope i get my money back .
Flowers	an explanation would have been appreciated .
Flowers	poor service all_round .
Flowers	i ordered some flowers to be delivered on mothers_day , choosing iflorist above other services because they did deliver on that particular day .
Flowers	the flowers were delivered on the wrong day , they were old and dying ( had brown bits on them ) and the card was poor quality ( the printing was scabby ) with another customers message inside ; it really does ruin the sentiment when the card signs off from someone_else .
Flowers	the service is awful , i ' ve had to continually repeat the problem , no reply to messages , no follow ups , i sent pictures as soon as they asked for them and now i ' m being told the company don ' t give refunds !!
Flowers	what happened to the ' satisfaction_guarantee ?'.
Flowers	and to quote the company on the issue of the misprinted card '[ name ] message cards got mixed up with some orders due to rush time .'
Flowers	they don ' t care at all , let_alone have any idea about consumer_law in britain .
Flowers	don ' t be_fooled by the positive_reviews ; it ' s very clear that they have problems when the complaints are of the same nature .
Flowers	i include a link to a website regarding iflorist posting fallacious positive_reviews on themselves in the past [_link ]
Flowers	lovely shop gorgeous flowers n shabby chic items and lovely staff defo_recommend highly
Flowers	this is the first time i have used serenata_flowers as the reviews for interflora were dismal at best .
Flowers	i was delighted with the order , the flowers were beautiful and the service and delivery was fast and very friendly .
Flowers	thank_you very much .
Flowers	i order a mother ' s day bouguet and ordered the bouquet in large thinking there would be more flowers in the bouquet .
Flowers	i spent £_00 pound on this bouquet to receive 0 roses and 0 stem of lillies .
Flowers	i contacted them and their reply was " ordering the bouquet in large does not mean more flowers , it means a higher quality and more greenery ".
Flowers	if this is the case then they should not be using quantifiable terms when explaining the details of their bouquet .
Flowers	i obviously replied to their email but heard_nothing back .
Flowers	i wonder what i would have got if i had no have opted for the large bouquet !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	extremely poor customer_service and a huge money making scam
Flowers	i ordered a bunch of flowers from this company two days ago and my delivery arrived_promptly this morning .
Flowers	however , when i opened the box i found to my dismay a bunch of flowers that look like they were picked_up from a service station !!!
Flowers	i wish that i had read these reviews before i had placed the order maybe then i would ' ve been wiser in my choice of online florist .
Flowers	the flowers that i ordered were meant to be a 00pcs tulip set and i have uploaded a picture to show you all what i actually received .
Flowers	these flowers were meant for my mum ' s grave and now i am left feeling very upset and disappointed .
Flowers	for anyone who has lost loved_ones , we all know that the only real ' gift ' we can buy them is flowers .
Flowers	i have emailed their support_team ( and i ' ll use that term lightly ) and i have demanded a full_refund and a reason as to why their service is so poor .
Flowers	i would also like to take this further and if i haven ' t received a refund and an_apology swiftly , then i intend to do so .
Flowers	i ' m surprised that they are still running considering the amount of poor reviews on here .
Flowers	just a note to anyone that is considering using this company - don ' t .
Flowers	you will only be left completely dissatisfied and you will have paid a fair amount of money for the pleasure .
Flowers	great flowers , worth the money .
Flowers	cheers .
Flowers	perfection in the form of a rose .
Flowers	i have used serenata_flowers many_times and they never fail to deliver great service .
Flowers	i love the text_messages keeping me up to date on the delivery process and i find the whole_process very simple and easy .
Flowers	these flowers were beautiful and well received by the recipient .
Flowers	i ordered a simple bouquet for my grandmother to say thank_you for a surprise contribution towards our house purchase that was extremely generous .
Flowers	knowing i would be seeing her on saturday the 00nd of december i ordered them the thursday before with assurance they would be delivered in time .
Flowers	they still_haven ' t been delivered to this day , despite having sent three emails to iflorist support .
Flowers	all i have received by way of a reply is 0 automated_responses saying someone will get back to me .
Flowers	this is absolutely_shocking customer_service , and they ' re flagrant disregard for the quality of their service is frankly shocking .
Flowers	there are so many competitors in their market place and i shall choose another next time .
Flowers	i advise you to do the same .
Flowers	i have just placed an order for mothers_day for some tulips which was quick and easy to do so and cant_wait for them to be delivered to my deserving mother , and also very pleased to qualify for some free chocs for her and also a personalised card with mine and my beautiful daughters photo on :) plus free delivery and also had a discount_code so got all this for under £_00 even_though the flowers already had discount taken off well impressed , thankyou so much for making this mothers_day stress_free and i know she will love the gifts :)
Flowers	it is the basics of business to deliver what you promise and this company does not .
Flowers	they like so many other_companies advertise same day delivery but having ordered this morning they ' ve only now informed me that they actually can ' t deliver them ( to the centre of bristol , not exactly a difficult delivery ) and i ' m unable to order elsewhere as its too_late .
Flowers	they are expected and this will of course leave feelings of bitterness .
Flowers	when i suggested they send the same standard order for free on monday they were blunt in their refusal .
Flowers	i suggest inter - flora instead they ' ve never let me down , should ' ve stuck with them this time instead .
Flowers	i ordered these for my great aunt who is in her 00 ' s as she said in a letter that she was feeling a bit down .
Flowers	well she sent me a thank_you card and this is what she said
Flowers	' thank_you very much for my lovely flowers , they were very beautiful , lovely colours .
Flowers	so many kind roses , pinks and violets and lots of green leaves .
Flowers	they are in front of me now and are still lovely .
Flowers	it ' s been a very long time since i had a lovely large flower_arrangement sent to me , i am a very lucky person .'
Flowers	awwww , well if these flowers put a smile on her face , then they were worth the money !
Flowers	:)
Flowers	i had a very disrespectful experience with iflorist .
Flowers	none of my orders bouquets were delivered and i didn ' t get any respond to my emails / calls .
Flowers	it ' s the first company that failed to deliver flowers in london .
Flowers	i won ' t use them again and if they are so unreliable i would advice to stay_away from them !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	used this service twice now , very happy .
Flowers	we was slightly dissapointed when the bouquet arrived .
Flowers	i paid extra for the deluxe edition & i can ' t see what i got for the extra money .
Flowers	the item wasn ' t delivered till after 0pm & there was water inside the packaging which_resulted_in the card becoming wet .
Flowers	would not reccommend .
Flowers	bad values for money
Flowers	you gotta use iflorist blud , its flowers are mad .
Flowers	my mo is gonna be insane with joy wen she sees da bunch i got her for mo ' s day as iflorist don ' t f about wen it comes to creatin the buffest bunches
Flowers	i ordered flowers from the u . s . for an anniversary with my girlfriend who is visiting london .
Flowers	unable to know which address i should send to ( her internship or her home ) i chatted online with one of the representatives .
Flowers	i was told that it would be delivered in " business hours " or as their faqs says , 0 - 0 .
Flowers	it ' s 0 : 00
Flowers	no flowers .
Flowers	chatted another representative , and she replies with , " oh the flowers will be delivered from 0 - 0 , they ' re on the truck now ."
Flowers	i then show her the faqs quote of " delivery typically takes place between_0am and 0pm .
Flowers	we are unable to specify a time , for example " between 00am and 00am " and can only stipulate that your order will be delivered during the working day ."
Flowers	i then ask her if the working day is 0 - 0 in london such as the u . s .
Flowers	only response ?
Flowers	delivery is from 0 - 0 ... delivery is from 0 - 0 .
Flowers	ridiculous .
Flowers	absolutely_ridiculous .
Flowers	no apologizing .
Flowers	no refund .
Flowers	never again .
Flowers	my nan absolutely loved her flowers .
Flowers	i have used serenata several_times for nan and she always says how beautiful they are and friendly delivery people .
Flowers	she also says the flowers are all perfect and the last bunch lasted 0 weeks .
Flowers	the best thing is some of the flowers open later than others so they look different everyday .
Flowers	thanks a bunch !
Flowers	:-)
Flowers	gift delivered on time , beautifully_packaged .
Flowers	couldn ' t ask for more .
Flowers	i had ordered the item for the 00th_december_0000 for my bride on our_wedding day .
Flowers	unfortunately the flowers did not arrive and instead were delivered 0 days_later , brilliant !
Flowers	this was extremely disapointing and sadly on such a day caused some upset and distress which is simple unacceptable .
Flowers	i will most certainly not use your service again .
Flowers	i ' m_glad i used this company as the delivery was quick and kept me updated at each_stage .
Flowers	my nan loved them , although i ' ve not been able to see them .
Flowers	i had placed an order for the flowers and decided to cancel the order .
Flowers	i have sent 0 emails to cancel my order but i have yet to receive a confirmation of this .
Flowers	there is no clear suggested method to cancel an order .
Flowers	i like arena_flowers because they are good value , user_friendly and always deliver the goods on time every time .
Flowers	i ' ve used them every year for valentines and birthdays since 0000 and every time i have been thrilled .
Flowers	i have never been more appalled by the service of a company .
Flowers	their website states , they are " committed to providing the highest_level of service simply because the customers deserve the very best "
Flowers	however i have most certainly seen no evidence of this .
Flowers	instead i see a company who appears to deem special occasions as trivial , unimportant dates , that they can either choose to oblige their commitment , at a date that suits them .. if at all .
Flowers	three times now , my flowers have either been delivered on the wrong date or not at all .
Flowers	if you want you flowers delivered ... do not use this florist .
Flowers	it has taken 00 days to receive an_automated_reply , with still no answer as to why my flowers were not delivered .
Flowers	after calling the helpline , 0 times , i have still not been allowed to speak to the manager <_private data_removed >, as he " must have felt it was not his responsibility to call the customer ."
Flowers	instead i was given the rather cheerful , robotic reply , that , instead she could offer me a delivery ... " on any day of my desire " failing to spot , this was not compensation ... as i had already specified my desired date ...
Flowers	mothers_day .
Flowers	they should really change your 000_% satisfaction_guarantee on the website .
Flowers	" we value feedback as highly as we value anything_else at iflorist .
Flowers	we like to know that our customers are completely_satisfied , and take any less_than glowing feedback really seriously ."
Flowers	how this can be the case , when i have still no word as to why my flowers were not delivered , is a mystery .
Flowers	how this can also be the case when it has taken me 00 days to hear any thing from your company without my contact is also a mystery .
Flowers	awful .
Flowers	it ' s very simple .
Flowers	i ordered some flowers and was assured they would come on the day i specified .
Flowers	they didn ' t , they came two days late .
Flowers	on their website it says " by all means contact us if there is a problem ."
Flowers	so i did , and i have heard_nothing back .
Flowers	disastrously bad customer_service , don ' t believe these 0 / 0 star reviews , i guarantee they are made up .
Flowers	edit - it says below that eflorist contacted me .
Flowers	they did , but the email in no way helped and didn ' t actually make sense .
Flowers	it was also 0 months late .
Flowers	don ' t use this company , it ' s a lottery as to whether you ' ll get your flowers on time .
Flowers	i think this is the worst company i have ever_dealt_with , not only for flower service , but any sort of company ever .
Flowers	i would never recommend to anyone , and instead have emailed all my contacts making_sure they do not use this company either !
Flowers	order was placed before_christmas to be delivered on boxing_day .
Flowers	order no 000000 .
Flowers	never delivered .
Flowers	when chased up , they do not pick_up the phone , return calls or respond to e_- mails .
Flowers	this company is devoid of decent business practice and i can only imagine a lot of these reviews on trustpilot are fake .
Flowers	if you look at their facebook reviews they are all irrate customers awarding them 0 star out of 0 .
Flowers	i have reported to the police and trading_standards as they are con_artists and thieves .
Flowers	they continually update their twitter and facebook yet cannot respond to customer ' s refund requests or queries .
Flowers	i wrote on their facebook wall and it was removed within about 0 . 00 seconds .
Flowers	avoid .
Flowers	avoid .
Flowers	avoid .
Flowers	very good service and very helpful .
Flowers	the 00th of june i did order a product from iflorist to be delivered 0th of july .
Flowers	it did not get delivered and i had to " blow my cover " to my boyfriend asking him if he had gotten a delivery .
Flowers	i then contacted iflorist on the online_chat .
Flowers	i was told due to " technical_issues " it had not been delivered .
Flowers	i wonder_why had iflorist not contacted me due to their issue and informed me it would not get delivered on the specified date ?
Flowers	how ever i was promised it would be delivered saturday 0th_july instead .
Flowers	next_day ... still no delivery .
Flowers	i contacted iflorist again on their online_chat and i got to talk to the same person i talked with the day before .
Flowers	his replys were excactly the same as the day before .
Flowers	like an_automated answer machine really .
Flowers	he promised me the product will be delivered on monday the 0th .
Flowers	i did ask for a kompensation for the late delivery and he offered me a 00 pound voucher .
Flowers	what can i use that for ?
Flowers	i never plan to use iflorist again .
Flowers	so i asked him if instead of the voucher i could get an additional item worth the voucher value in my order .
Flowers	he did totally ignore that question .
Flowers	i had really hoped to give my boyfriend a good suprise with this product on our aniversary .
Flowers	but you guys ruined it .
Flowers	i will not recommend you to anyone and i hope the bad_reviews on this page will give people second thoughts before buying at iflorist .
Flowers	update_: it got delivered monday on the porch but at the wrong adress .
Flowers	luckily the person was kind enough to come deliver it to my boyfriend .
Flowers	the professionalism and reliability of your service made ​​ me very happy !
Flowers	the flowers were perfect , high_quality and very durable , not to mention the customer care service , available for any request !
Flowers	thanks for everything , recommend your service to as many people as possible !
Flowers	i decided to surprise my wife and brighten up our home with some arrangement of flowers just before_christmas .
Flowers	( i might_add - not during or around the time of the snow so this is not an excuse ).
Flowers	i ordered next_day delivery , but on not receiving the flowers within 0 days i contacted them and to be fair , they were very helpful and sent out , as a sorry double the amount of flowers .
Flowers	this would have been great , but these flowers took another 0 / 0 days to arrive ( no weekends involved - so they ended_up taking a full working week for a ' next_day ' delivery ) and then when they did arrive - the flowers died within 0 days .
Flowers	( my wife was an ex - florist and so knows_how to look after the flowers , yet they still didn ' t last ).
Flowers	within the batch i had also ordered a potted rose for the house which is supposed to be hardy and long_lasting .
Flowers	because iflorist sent double of everything we got two roses .
Flowers	however even_though we live in a well lit , well ventilated ( but not too cold or hot ) house - these should have been fine .
Flowers	both rose plants have now died , both within 0 weeks of receiving them , the first within 0 days .
Flowers	honestly , for the amount of money that i spent ( around fifty pounds ) i did not expect to receive such low quality , short lasting plants and am thoroughly disappointed .
Flowers	i will not make the mistake of using iflorist again .
Flowers	as per review below i have also ordered from this site and my mother did not recieve her flowers either .
Flowers	i did leave it til late and didn ' t order them til yesterday , howver on the site it stated that they were still taking orders til 0pm .
Flowers	i am completely disappointed in this service and i have not had any replies to my emails .
Flowers	i have nver written any reviews before online however i am_disgusted with iflorists customer_service and thought i would warn_everyone out there about this company before they disappoint others .
Flowers	i highly_recommend people to steer_clear .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to be delivered the next_day to denmark .
Flowers	after the first day they didn ' t arrive and was told they would be delivered the next_day .
Flowers	the next_day came and still they weren ' t sent and delivered to the recipient then from this stage on i couldn ' t get any response from them for another 0 days .
Flowers	on the 0 or 0th day i had an_email back saying they were delivered when they quiet clearly hadn ' t because my recipient never received her flowers and they where probably handed_over to any old tom , dave or harry .
Flowers	after pointing this out to them on a number of occasions they still refused to offer me a refund and kept insisting nothing would be done .
Flowers	in my opinion the worst possible service and customer_satisfaction you will ever experience .
Flowers	i ' m still in the process of trying to get my money refunded back through my bank as you simply can ' t deal with this company .
Flowers	frauds , people save your self the time and effort and find a company that truly offer and deliver the goods they say they do .
Flowers	i have used this company before & they never dissappoint .
Flowers	the flowers were gorgeous & arrived when they promised
Flowers	i have placed an order for delivery on 0th of march_0000 as we have a special occasion .
Flowers	i went to work and on my way back was imagining a face full of happiness and joy that i remembered about that scansion .
Flowers	guess_what , the day was screwed due to the non compliance to the instruction box for the order ...
Flowers	i came home , yet flowers never been delivered .
Flowers	and i had to reveal the surprise to my wife .
Flowers	how awful is that .
Flowers	just some soul food for the company who offers a courier delivery and rejects instructions provided by the customer - remove the box with those as you do not pay any attention to the instructions .
Flowers	as in my personal opinion , i will never order flowers with this company as i do not really want to be let_down once more .
Flowers	instructions as they are : delivery notes :- please deliver this flowers by 00 am - call the recipient phone as there is no door_bell .
Flowers	e_- commerce company should comply with customer demands unless they do not have any competition .
Flowers	i wanted to surprise my girlfriend with a bouquet of flowers but didn ' t have loads of money to spend .
Flowers	i found the perfect flowers straightaway and was surprised at how reasonably_priced they were .
Flowers	next_day delivery was also included at no extra_cost , i honestly thought it was all too good to be true and didn ' t hold out to much hope going on past experiences with different companies .
Flowers	how wrong was i when the next_day at 00am i received a phone call from my girlfriend who was absolutely over the moon with her bouquet .
Flowers	the flowers were so fresh and bursting with colour it really made her day .
Flowers	one more thing i would like to add is that from the moment i paid to the moment the flowers were delivered i was constantly kept_informed on the progress of my order , i really did feel_like they treated the customer as king and that there was nothing more they could do .
Flowers	very happy and will be getting all my future flowers from them .
Flowers	00 / 00
Flowers	i ordered flower to be delivered before 0pm on valentines_day !
Flowers	and i waited all day and finally the flowers were delivered after 0pm !
Flowers	the flowers do not look fresh and different to the photos on their website !
Flowers	i emailed them but there was no response at all !
Flowers	however i was refunded after a week and received a letter explaining the delay and apologies for their late delivery .
Flowers	so i am happy with the way they dealt_with my complaint and hope they will keep improving their services .
Flowers	ordered my flowers late on monday as my brother ' forgot ' to pick some up for my mum ' s birthday .
Flowers	good selection of flowers and easy online ordering service .
Flowers	had not had a delivery by 0 . 00pm on the tuesday so phoned the hotline .
Flowers	they contacted my local_store and the flowers were with my in 00_minutes !
Flowers	lovely fresh bouquet and my mum loved them .
Flowers	would definitely use again .
Flowers	i was very impressed with being kept in touch by email as to when the flowers were despatched and delivered .
Flowers	i ordered flowers friday_afternoon and was surprised i could have free delivery which arrive the next_day !
Flowers	!
Flowers	amazing !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	defiantly a flower service i ' ll use again and again so easy and convenient .
Flowers	absolutely dreadful flowers and terrible customer_service .
Flowers	the flowers i ordered for mothers_day were called amazonia .
Flowers	they were very leafy rather_than floral .
Flowers	they had started dying and going brown within 0 days .
Flowers	by day 0 they were completely dead and brown all over .
Flowers	i complained after day 0 and sent photographic_evidence , the customer_services replied_saying they would send a replacement bouquet and i requested this be done on friday ( today ).
Flowers	so i promised my mother the redelivery and she made arrangements to stay home today .
Flowers	i received an_email last_night saying that the flowers were out of stock so i should choose something else or they will refund me .
Flowers	this is unacceptable !
Flowers	they agreed to send them today , so to tell me the night before that they were going back on that promise is ridiculous .
Flowers	i asked for a premium bouquet of greater value to be sent as compensation .
Flowers	this morning i received an_email_saying they had refunded me £_00 . 00 ...
Flowers	i paid £_00 . 00 !!!
Flowers	so they have kept £ 0 of my money , after sending me half_dead flowers and breaking their promise of a replacement .
Flowers	they never answer their customer_services number so everything has to be done by email , which is slow and frustrating and you don ' t get any continuity of case handler .
Flowers	do not use serenata_flowers !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i bought flowers for my cousins birthday she loved them they wear beautiful it made her day all that more special thank_you
Flowers	i ordered a country vintage jug with lilac roses and other country themed flowers , when i received confirmation it was for a dozen red_roses !!!
Flowers	shocking , it wasn ' t even for valentines .
Flowers	i was told when i rang customer_services that this order had been upgraded to red_roses and the option i asked for was out of stock !!!
Flowers	more like they had a load of roses left over !
Flowers	disgraceful .
Flowers	cancelled my order immediately .
Flowers	went elsewhere .
Flowers	ordered flowers for my mother in laws special occasion birthday .
Flowers	guess_what ??
Flowers	she waited in all day as i said there was a delivery coming .
Flowers	did they turn_up ??
Flowers	no .
Flowers	not only has it left me upset , it has also left her upset ... wasting her_birthday sat in for nothing to be received .
Flowers	after having to chase up the order , finally receive an_email back stating there had been a technical fault and that there was a delay .
Flowers	sincere_apologies given ( although it seems to just be a standard email that is sent out ) and they will deliver asap .
Flowers	have requested a refund , as what is the point in receiving flowers late ???
Flowers	that ' s if they would actually be received at all .
Flowers	will never use this company again or recommend to anyone_else .
Flowers	this company charge double_charged flowers and didn ' t deliver it .
Flowers	i ordered flower on 00th_nov 0000 for relatives funeral , till now it is question where are the flowers .
Flowers	on contacting iflorist support centre they have only one answer , local_florist delivered where recipient didn ' t received it .
Flowers	if you can ' t work than why you running these services .
Flowers	it is so embarrassing that flowers wasn ' t delivered on such a emotional moment .
Flowers	hopeless people ....
Flowers	i wasn ' t impressed when saw the flowers that were delivered the bunch was tiny and didnt look anything like the website photo , i even chose a bigger bouquet and it still looked like a bunch from a petrol pump i was highly embarrassed as it was a 0st wedding_anniversary gift .
Flowers	basically tesco had better bunches and for almost half the price .... gutted !
Flowers	do not buy from these people and read the reviews some people left if i knew i ' d have just used tesco .... every little helps !
Flowers	the dispatch emails were extremely_helpful and the flowers were exquisite .
Flowers	thanks a lot .
Flowers	ordered a bunch of flowers for my partner with a surprise message inside a note for the delivered day .
Flowers	flowers were not delivered and customers services fail to get back to you .
Flowers	my whole surprise i spent months planning has been ruined !
Flowers	stay_away from e florist !
Flowers	they cant even deliver a bunch of flowers with 0 days notice .
Flowers	unacceptable !!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	very very very unhappy and disgusted with the poor service .
Flowers	thank_god i didnt have funeral flowers .
Flowers	diane
Flowers	ordered flowers for delivery 00 / 00 / 00 was told up to 0pm , was given a tracking_number which did not work so contacted iflorist to be told " i request you to kindly allow us time " this was on online_chat .
Flowers	i then contacted yodel as was getting no where to first be told my delivery was somewhere in middleton so waited another few hours to then ring back again to be told iflorist had sent out every order late and that it would not be delivered today after all .
Flowers	to say i am angry is an_understatement !
Flowers	yodel said that iflorist should of contacted me vie email if no delivery was going to be made which they have not .
Flowers	i contacted them also on facebook which i got no where !
Flowers	who_wants to get a dead bunch of flowers the day after they were supposed to be delivered ?
Flowers	please dont fall for ordering from this company i wish i would of seen these reviews earlier and my mistake should not be made by others .
Flowers	i was asked to crop my 000kb jpg , which i didn ' t want to do .
Flowers	anyway , i made the crop of the full size and the preview showed it hadnt cropped to the full size .
Flowers	i try to redo , and this time click the " x " at the top of the cropping box ( as in not wanting to crop at all ).
Flowers	i was then taken back to the card message box which i had to redo as this time it was empty !
Flowers	after this , i assumed i ' d have another go uploading a photo but i wasn ' t prompted to !
Flowers	no way to go back either !
Flowers	also , had to use another site as no next_day delivery to netherlands available .
Flowers	not very good so far !
Flowers	site was fast and easy to use , flowers looked good online and free delivery to boot .
Flowers	very happy indeed .
Flowers	that is i was very happy until i had nightmares with the delivery and then get the wrong flowers in my delivery .
Flowers	their support is completely unreachable , 0 critical tickets and no reply in over 00hrs .
Flowers	live_chat is never online .
Flowers	even a paypal_dispute isnt getting a reply .
Flowers	shocking customer_service !
Flowers	the company were a pleasure to deal with , and as a last_minute gift you couldn ' t complain with there next_day delivery unfortunately when delivered the flowers had little to no smell and the life span were only about 0 days
Flowers	having had problems with interflora before , i was hesitant to try another online florist , but decided to give eflorist a go .
Flowers	two orders arrived on time and were exactly like the picture given on the web_site .
Flowers	no nasty_surprises , very professional .
Flowers	ordered flowers from uk for a friend in ireland as she just miscarried a baby , chose iflorist as they said they can meet the short deadline .
Flowers	two days after i received an_email with order cancellation as they couldn ' t fulfill my delivery and a word of apology , but no news on refund .
Flowers	the only way to get in touch with them was issuing a ticket in the support center that i never got an answer to , the case just got closed ...
Flowers	tried online_chat twice as there is no way to contact them , and i was promised a quick refund over two_weeks_ago and again today so let ' s see if i will ever get it ...
Flowers	it ' s been more_than a month now and i didn ' t get my money back nor an_email with some news or apology .
Flowers	very disappointed with the service all the way !
Flowers	excuse me , what service actually ?
Flowers	!
Flowers	order flowers on 00th_march to be delivered on 00st_march for my mums bday an mothers_day .
Flowers	called on fri to speak to a lady_called [_name ] who was very rude an unhelpful telling_me there was no sign of me ever ordering flowers and she then sniggered and said ther was nothing she could do ... after arguing with her for 00_mins she ended the call by saying she would talk to i . t tomorrow and call me back ... iam stil waiting !!
Flowers	i then had to call on monday the 00th to once again find out were my flowers were to be told there was an error in the system and that the flowers i orderd couldnt be deliverd to my choosen destination even_tho the system was telling the lady they were dispatched .
Flowers	so the lady on the phone said i would receive a full_refund ... but flowers arrived monday_evening and every flower was dead .
Flowers	i am soo dissapointed that my mother never received the flowers i ordered or any flowers for that matter ... very diasppointed with end_result and i would not reccomend eflorist to anyone . the lady i spoke to today was very polite and a hugh improvement from [_name ] i spoke to on friday
Flowers	i ordered from the us for my sister in the uk for her_birthday - i ordered 0 days before to ensure timely delivery - they never did - and now reviewing the website , they will deliver in 0 days !!!
Flowers	0 days after my sister ' s birthday !!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i have contacted their customer_service multiple_times online , they do not reply - live_chat person says their " system is down " - i will never ever use this shady unreliable website again - i want a refund you swindlers !!!!!!!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i orded fairytale love bouquet of flowers for my girlfriend , but this morning someone in serenata_flowers email me saying that my flowers were been misrouted to the wrong depot for delivery .
Flowers	tried to phone them on a number i found on their website , nothing !!!
Flowers	email them a few_times during the day , no reply !
Flowers	email them asking to phone me , no luck !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	just got another email now , after 0pm , saying the same bullsh ***!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i just hope i get this refunded !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	so i chose iflorist because the flowers looked beautiful and this is the first time i have ordered flowers online .
Flowers	i am now awaiting confirmation on delivery and i have not yet heard_anything .
Flowers	i also paid to be able to track my delivery and there is no tracking_number .
Flowers	i have to admit , i am a little_nervous especially reading the reviews on the iflorist service .
Flowers	finally , there seems to be no contact number for iflorist .
Flowers	i am yet so see if they are to prove a lot of people wrong and deliver the flowers i ordered on the due date of delivery .
Flowers	i will re - rate on the 00th of february .
Flowers	after ordering i could track my delivery right down to the delivery hour , as soon as it arrived i received an_email , and communication was brilliant .
Flowers	the flowers were fantastic when they arrived , and the colours were as vibrant as they looked in the picture , which surprised me .
Flowers	stunning bouquet .
Flowers	it was missing its feeder sachet but overall i was more_than happy with the quality and the service delivered .
Flowers	i know where to come next time i need flowers delivered !
Flowers	i ordered flowers for a collegues engagement , we ordered the largest size but what was delivered was the smallest size .
Flowers	i emailed my complaint with photos 0 times and had absolutely no response .
Flowers	do not use this company they will rip you off
Flowers	i ordered flowers for next_day delivery to london .
Flowers	despite their claim of ' next_day delivery ' and ' 000_% satisfaction_guarantee ' the flowers were delayed with the courier and came 0 day late after the occasion in question had passed .
Flowers	poor customer_service and refusal to refund the 0 pound ' next_day ' delivery charge .
Flowers	they have offered a free delivery voucher for my next order though ... perhaps not .
Flowers	i tried to order some roses from them but they wanted to know my message in english i told them they refused it , that ' s funny as it was for my partner to marry me .
Flowers	then i had none stop emails 00 per day of junk they say just click the remove link where is there .
Flowers	not at the bottom of the email or top .
Flowers	now i ' m getting phone_calls from firms i never_heard of stay_away from these con artist they sell your data
Flowers	i couldn ' t decide who to order flowers from for mothers_day , and decided on iflorist as they seemed good value and the arrangements all looked quite impressive .
Flowers	i ordered the la belle medium bouquet for £_00 . 00 , which was meant to contain a variety of pastel coloured roses , pink ranunculus , twigs , and eucalyptus foliage .
Flowers	what arrived was 0 pink roses , 0 lilies , and one pathetic twig of eucalyptus .
Flowers	not at all as pictured , looking substantially smaller and a complete disappointment .
Flowers	i would advise_anyone_looking at purchasing from these not to bother .
Flowers	save_yourself the money and spend half the amount in m & s on flowers , they ' ll look a damn site better !
Flowers	i have been asked to update this review regarding service , and my comments on this would be :
Flowers	0 ) ordering_process easy
Flowers	0 ) not particualrly clear if free delivery would guarantee delivery on mothers_day so ended_up paying extra for this to be sure
Flowers	0 ) after sales service regarding my complaint with them is poor , currently four days since i submitted a complaint and not had a response .
Flowers	i ordered the flowers from serenata , found them on google as i ' m not from the area .
Flowers	cannot_fault the service one bit .
Flowers	great communications throughout the whole ordering_process , and they even emailed me dispatch and delivery status ' s .
Flowers	excellent .
Flowers	i only wish they were closer so i could use them regularly !
Flowers	x
Flowers	i ordered flowers from e florist and was extremely disappointed with what my mother received , for £_00 i would expect better_than a plastic vase in a box with a bunch of flowers i could have bought from morrisons for £_00 !
Flowers	to make things worse the flower ( received in a box ) had obviously been sitting in the van that delivered them overnight and no_longer contained water in the bag wrapped round the bottom of the flowers !!!
Flowers	i would not advise_anyone to order flowers from this website .
Flowers	defo not value for money thats for sure .
Flowers	i was excited for my mother to receive her flowers in time for mother ' s day at her work today , however , i was very upset and angry when i received a text from my mother this morning saying she had received them , thanking me for the thought but that they were of terrible quality .
Flowers	she herself described them as ' past their best ' and ' looked as though they had been boxed for quite a while before sending '.
Flowers	after she sent me the photos i was deeply annoyed with iflorist - parts of flowers were brown , with holes in and basically dying .
Flowers	black mold could also be seen on the box .
Flowers	i understand it must be a busy_period with mother ' s day this weekend , but this has ruined mother ' s day for me - even if they may have lots of orders , there should still be some sort of quality standard and customer_satisfaction .
Flowers	preparing orders too far in_advance ( so they ' re practically dead when they are received ) and putting out poor quality flowers which are past their best because it is peak period is no excuse .
Flowers	i would imagine other mothers will also receive the same rushed , bad quality flowers this weekend if we have experienced this amongst their ( probably ) many orders due to mother ' s day .
Flowers	nothing says happy mother ' s day better_than a bunch of dying flowers and a moldy box !
Flowers	a ruined mother ' s day .
Flowers	do not order mother ' s day flowers or flowers for any other sort of occasion from iflorist !
Flowers	!
Flowers	awaiting reply from them .....
Flowers	cannot_fault this service .
Flowers	ordered about a week before mothers_day for delivery on sunday the 00th .
Flowers	i orders some tulips , chocolates and a vase .
Flowers	the courier arrived at 0am sunday morning as advertised .
Flowers	the flowers were perfect .
Flowers	the buds were just starting to open so my mum gets to watch them open which she enjoys .
Flowers	the chocolates and the vase were also exactly as advertised .
Flowers	i really can ' t understand what others are complaining_about as i found the whole_process quick , easy and perfect .
Flowers	plus iflorist kept me informed of the progress of my order through 0 emails which is more_than most company does .
Flowers	0_stars
Flowers	i bought some seeming beautiful tulips for my mum on mothers_day , said to be delivered on the day itself as a wonderful surprise as i was going away .
Flowers	they arrived two days early so falling under a weekday so no body was in and were left in the rain .
Flowers	as if a soaking box wasn ' t horrid enough , we opened the box and inside were old as well as slightly brown flowers that that were covered in scuffs and all dehydrated .
Flowers	i do not plan to use them again as the quality was just not good enough .
Flowers	good , professional , recipient loved the flowers .
Flowers	will be using again !
Flowers	i used this company ' s service for same day delivery , even_though it was advertised as they can make same day delivery they weren ' t able to deliver the flowers same day . i had to authorise them to deliver the flowers next_day instead and asked them to add the additional service fee charged for the same day delivery to the flower ' s value . however , they couldn ' t deliver the flowers next_day too and they sent me an_email that their floweriest couldn ' t find the delivery address and asked for the recipients phone number . i emailed them back with the phone number but the flowers haven ' t been delivered that day as well . on the 0rd day i gave up and find another company to order flowers which are delivered perfectly . i suggest anyone to stay_away from this company if you are going to order flowers which needs to be be delivered at a specific date because my same day delivery flowers were only able to be delivered on the 0rd day without my authorisation and when i asked my money back they collected the flowers that they deliver .
Flowers	waited until 0pm for valentines_day flowers even_though i ordered on the 00th_jan . £_00 for a tiny bunch of flowers which cost £ 0 in asda !
Flowers	quite possibly the worst service amd product i have ever known .
Flowers	dont waste your money go elsewhere
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my grandma in newcastle for mother ' s day .
Flowers	she isn ' t mobile and so i have to co - ordinate things around carers and relative visits .
Flowers	i placed my order specifying delivery on saturday 0th_march as i knew there would be someone in all - day to take delivery and give them to her .
Flowers	i ' ve just been informed that no flowers arrived today despite my order showing as " out for delivery ".
Flowers	i ' m absolutely gutted as even if delivered tomorrow there will likely be no - one around to be able to take delivery and give them to her .
Flowers	so now despite spending a reasonable amount of money - my grandma won ' t be receiving the flowers i ordered .
Flowers	i feel incredibly let_down by this company .
Flowers	i wasn ' t even notified in any way that the delivery wouldn ' t be happening , i only found out now at 00pm that nothing had arrived .
Flowers	i will categorically not be using this company again , and i recommend the same to others .
Flowers	lovely flowers delivered on time and kept_informed of their being disatched so i knew_exactly_what was going on .
Flowers	good price too
Flowers	once a year comes valentine ' s day , the day all flower delivery services relish .
Flowers	one would think a company such as iflorists would try their best to get it right .
Flowers	my order had been out for delivery since 0 :_00am on this valentine ' s day 0000 yet never reached my girlfriend .
Flowers	customer_service attempts ?
Flowers	futile ... marked urgent yet no response .
Flowers	i can only guess that this means i am not alone in my disappointment as they probably have a backup of complaints extending a mile long .
Flowers	well , i like to write so i will be telling my story over and over and over to anyone who will listen .
Flowers	thanks for turning a day that ' was supposed to be full of smiles into a real disaster .
Flowers	never ever ever again !!!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	recieved delivery confirmation late in the day on 0 / 00 .
Flowers	evidently there was no delivery made .
Flowers	very impressed with the ease of service and product description ' s .
Flowers	fast and easy service that helped_me choose the right product for me .
Flowers	would definitely_recommend and use again .
Flowers	the flowers ordered were the same species that were pictured but a different_colour and the message i typed out to go with the flowers wasn ' t there .
Flowers	i didn ' t have a good read of the site so maybe there ' s a disclaimer there saying not all flowers are going to be as pictured , not too sure honestly .
Flowers	delivery service used was fantastic , probably the best out of every company i ' ve ever used .
Flowers	you can pick ( if memory serves me right ) a time before 00am
Flowers	i loved the service , the flowers arrived in perfect_condition and punctual delivery !
Flowers	the flowers i ordered were not delivered on the specified day which was a real disappointment as they were for a sick friend just out of hospital .
Flowers	however the problem was rectified as soon a i phoned to complained the next_day - and within the next hour not one but two bouquets were delivered to her door - along with a £ 0 voucher for her and a £ 0 voucher for me !
Flowers	the website was easy to navigate , and the flowers represent good value for money .
Flowers	i received updates via both text and email_confirming my order , indicating dispatch and informing_me when the order had been successfully delivered .
Flowers	the flowers were for a friend ' s birthday and she has informed me that they are beautiful - all in all , i ' m extremely happy and would use serenata_flowers again .
Flowers	i ordered for my mum birthday 00euros bounce of flower .
Flowers	first they change the bounce because they run out of it , but it ' s still fine .
Flowers	after that the day of the birthday they didn ' t delivery but they just called my mum telling they were coming next_day .
Flowers	still ok . next_day no one delivery the flower .
Flowers	so i have been sending 0 emails every two days to be at_least refund ... no answer !
Flowers	terrible
Flowers	easy to order and - i ' m told !- beautiful flowers .
Flowers	great updates .
Flowers	excellent service , speedy_delivery during past order .
Flowers	thank_you
Flowers	absolutely pathetic , stay_away .
Flowers	the mothers_day flowers which i ordered were delivered a day late ( monday 0pm instead of sunday ) despite requesting mothers_day delivery .
Flowers	customer_service have been appauling and have still not contacted me several days_later , despite my complaint being escalated .
Flowers	this company has treated me appallingly and i recommend that if you would like your flowers to be delivered on time , then you do not order from them from iflorist .
Flowers	flowers were delivered not in time i ordered and birthday surprize went wrong
Flowers	we ordered next_day flowers with a balloon on a stick , some chocolates and a little card for my other halves mum ' s birthday .
Flowers	i was sceptical as to whether or not the delivery would get made in time and what the flowers would look like .
Flowers	we upgraded to the deluxe bouquet and the price was really good .
Flowers	the oriental bouquet is lush .
Flowers	needless to say my other halves mum loved the flowers , she said the chocolates were delish and she loved the little balloon .
Flowers	massive thank_you for saving the day with such a lovely bouquet .
Flowers	we happened to have a discount_code too so not only did we get flowers that were on offer , it meant that we got an extra £ 0 . 00 off with the code ( covering the cost of the chocs and the balloon ).
Flowers	very happy .

Flowers	i booked flowers to be delivered to my girlfriend at work on wednesday 0th_march , for delivery friday 0th_march .
Flowers	plenty of notice .
Flowers	by 0 . 00pm i was getting twitchy that had not arrived , but then found that serenata do not have a phone number to call !!!
Flowers	sent them a message through their online account system and got a response at 0 . 00pm which was clearly a scripted response they send to everyone , was not personal to what i had asked them in message at all !
Flowers	i then replied_saying that if the courier has this ' optimal route ' as they call it mapped out already , then can they not tell me where / when on that route my delivery is ?
Flowers	0 . 00pm now and no response .
Flowers	my partner finishes work at 0 . 00pm and it is a friday ...
Flowers	terrible service , absolutely_terrible that you do not provide a phone number for customers
Flowers	ordered some flowers and they never turned_up .
Flowers	contacted via_email eflorist and was offered a £_00 refund !
Flowers	i have tried to contact them again several_times but have had no response , effectively this company has stolen money from me .
Flowers	terrible customer_service .
Flowers	stay well away .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	paid extra for same day saturday delivery .
Flowers	flowers did not arrive :(
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	they emailed promising the flowers would arrive on the monday .
Flowers	did not turn_up again !
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	unable to get in contact with anybody .
Flowers	rubbish that their is nobody to call .
Flowers	also stupid that they take contact numbers when you order , but don ' t take the courtesy to call you or recipient to give you any idea whats_going on .
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	they responded today ( tuesday ) and told me i could get a refund .
Flowers	seemingly they are not able to send the flowers to south lanarkshire now ?
Flowers	!
Flowers	0 .
Flowers	my mum got nothing for her_birthday ( i live in australia and was counting on this service ) :( going to now reorder with a completely_different company .
Flowers	i ordered some roses for my girlfriend for valentines_day ( today ) and when she received them i was expecting them to be everything i was hoping for ( especially with a £_00 price ).
Flowers	what she received was a pathetic looking cluster of off cuts and a fluffy white center piece which is laughable and totally ridiculous ...
Flowers	i tried to contact iflorist and their phone pushed me straight through to an_automated_message_telling_me to email .
Flowers	so i filed a ticket on their website ... 0 hours and still no contact or resolution .
Flowers	even the online live_chat stated they were online , upon clicking i discover that every department is offline .
Flowers	heads need to roll for the embarrassment that i have suffered whilst trying to do something nice for the love of my life ... she deserves better that what iflorist ' s half assed employees appear to think is acceptable .
Flowers	stay_away from iflorist ... never use them for anything .
Flowers	traffic light flower sales people deliver better quality flowers than florist do ... only iflorist charge you an arm , a leg and a sizeable chunk of your pride .
Flowers	--- i demand a refund ----
Flowers	update - 00 / 00 / 00 - 00 : 00
Flowers	nearly 0 hours have gone by and i am still_awaiting a response ... iflorist just keeps getting better *_cough *
Flowers	ordered flowers online yesterday for delivery today .
Flowers	after waiting all day for a tracking_number , which i still_haven ' t received i submitted a support ticket and still no response .
Flowers	really unhappy with the service as i was really looking_forward to surprising my girlfriend on valentines_day .
Flowers	i find it very strange that iflorist can reply to reviews on this website but do not reply to support tickets submitted on there website .
Flowers	a very poor service !
Flowers	update
Flowers	just managed to speak to someone from iflorist and they have now informed me that my girlfriend will not receive her flowers today and that she will possibly receive them tomorrow .
Flowers	words can not describe how angry i am with iflorist today , they have completely_ruined valentines_day .
Flowers	stay_away from iflorist they are completely_useless !
Flowers	update
Flowers	the excuse that iflorist seem to be giving people is that snow was the reason that they could not deliver .
Flowers	the snippet below is taken from there terms and conditions and nowhere_does it say anything about snow .
Flowers	" 0 . 0 we shall not be liable for any failure to perform in our obligations where such failure is as a result of acts of god ( including fire , flood , earthquake , storm , hurricane or other natural disaster ), war , invasion , act of foreign enemies , hostilities ( whether war is declared or not ), civil war , rebellion , revolution , insurrection , military or usurped power or confiscation , terrorist activities , nationalisation , government sanction , blockage , embargo , labour dispute , strike , lockout or interruption or failure of electricity or telephone service ."
Flowers	also if anyone knows_how to report them to trading_standards could they please inform me .
Flowers	having previously ordered flowers from iflorist before i knew it would be a smooth and easy transaction .
Flowers	thank_you for making the purchase quick and easy to do .
Flowers	excellence service !
Flowers	!
Flowers	very efficient and fast delivery , i was informed about the progress of the delivery by text .
Flowers	definitely i would recommend it !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	hello i am expecting you to deliver flowers to my girlfriend today for valentines .
Flowers	it is now 0 . 00pm and still no delivery .
Flowers	you have made me look like a crap boyfriend .
Flowers	as she is in another country i cannot arrange to give her any more today .
Flowers	also you dont answer to any of my emails to customer_service .
Flowers	i want this sorted asap otherwise i will be going out of my way to make your customers aware of this .
Flowers	when i came_across iflorist i was sceptical .
Flowers	i ' ve had problems with flowers being delivered from other florists and was expecting the same again .
Flowers	not at all !
Flowers	i couldn ' t believe_how quick and easy the ordering system was and the free delivery on mother ' s day weekend was too good to miss !
Flowers	the bouquet looks beautiful and i couldn ' t be_happier .
Flowers	big thanks !
Flowers	do not use this pathetic company .
Flowers	ordered flowers for my mother expecting them to arrive by saturday .
Flowers	to my horror still not arrived .
Flowers	this is disgraceful and just not on .
Flowers	i chose this company because of previous good reviews but what a shocker .
Flowers	i want my money back please .
Flowers	avoid these .
Flowers	due for delivery on 00th_feb for valentines_day , was unable to track order from email which meant the order hasn ' t been dispatched .
Flowers	so i would advise all people thinking of ordering with them to not and use a large well_known company .
Flowers	there customer_service number just rings until it reaches an answer phone which is full .
Flowers	all the other angry customers messages !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	don ' t use don ' t use don ' t use
Flowers	dear laurence / iflorist ,
Flowers	i could not thank_you enough for the flowers you have delivered to my fiancé .. “ ruby amore ” large w_/ vase and chocolates , who would have thought such a concept !
Flowers	ruby amore , the color and flower combinations are so romantic .
Flowers	brilliant !!
Flowers	i ordered the flowers sunday .
Flowers	and i had it delivered monday 00 th of february .
Flowers	and there it was , 0 :_00am to be exact .
Flowers	the flowers are more_than what i expected it to be .
Flowers	with gems and stuffs , how the flowers are arranged , tied and presented are top_notch .
Flowers	you guys are amazing .
Flowers	you bridge the gaps of lovers separated by deep seas and mountains .
Flowers	you give us deep joy and love by showing us the kind of service you provide us .
Flowers	you have given me the chance more_than what your fantastic flowers and gifts can give to my fiancé , and that is time .
Flowers	yes time .
Flowers	time , to show her , how much i love her , and treasure her .
Flowers	and for that , i commend you .
Flowers	lawrence you are the rock star of flower boutique !
Flowers	you even look like the vocalist of foo figthers !
Flowers	thanks man !
Flowers	the recipient said they were fantastic and we over the moon with them !
Flowers	everything was very nice , flowers smells good .
Flowers	cake and teddy was lovely
Flowers	the website was very easy to use with great images and unlike many sites the flowers looked as good when they arrived .
Flowers	ordered the flowers late morning and they were delivered the same day at about 0pm so really impressed with the speed of service .
Flowers	would definitely use again and recommend to a friend - superior service and quality to anything i have experienced when using interflora or any other competitor .
Flowers	i can ' t put it any other way - the service was bang on !
Flowers	the flowers were received exactly when i requested , i was kept up to date with the delivery progress by sms and email .
Flowers	my only_gripe , if you will , is the selection of cards that can be chosen however , this doesn ' t stop me giving it five_stars !
Flowers	!
Flowers	will_definitely use this service again !
Flowers	!
Flowers	living far from my grandparents is hard when it comes to sending a gift so i thought flowers would be a good idea .
Flowers	finding this website was a treat .
Flowers	it was clear and precise .
Flowers	they have a great range of flowers .
Flowers	they were delivered exactly when i wanted and my grandmother was incredibly pleased .
Flowers	she informed me that they looked beautiful .
Flowers	i would use this site again and refer friends to use it too .
Flowers	.
Flowers	they delivered my flowers to the wrong_address .
Flowers	it was a little annoying but everyone makes mistakes .
Flowers	they then organised a re - delivery and sent them to the wrong_address again .
Flowers	their messaging system is ridiculous so it ' s impossible to have a proper conversation , and they don ' t have a phone number .
Flowers	in the end they offered me a refund but i asked them to instead just deliver the flowers .
Flowers	i didn ' t want my money back i just wanted them to deliver .
Flowers	they completely_ignored me and eventually refunded the money ( which is hardly compensation if they can ' t make good on delivering the flowers as well ).
Flowers	really disappointing , the fact that they have ignored my last messages also shows that they don ' t care about their customers .
Flowers	they can ' t deliver flowers and then they ignore you , which , in my book , makes them completely_useless at what they do .
Flowers	i would have given them no stars if that was an option .
Flowers	the flowers were beautiful and different , arrived on the day they should have and cheered up someone who really needed a boost .
Flowers	thank_you :)
Flowers	i ordered my mothers_day flowers over 0 weeks_ago , 0 . 00pm on sunday and they still have not been delivered and as no calling_card has been left i assume no attempt has been made .
Flowers	cannot_believe this company has no phone number or no - one available in on - line help on the busiest day of the year for flower companies !
Flowers	i paid £_00 for a bouquet of flowers to be delivered to denmark .
Flowers	the first delivery attempt on a thursday was unsuccessful .
Flowers	the flowers were eventfully delivered the following_tuesday , five days_later .
Flowers	to my horror , the recipient of the flowers told me the bouquet contained six roses which were completely dead and dry .
Flowers	i can only imagine that the bouquet was sitting in the delivery box for five days !!!!!
Flowers	the company said it was my fault and that i had provided an incorrect address .
Flowers	however i noticed that they had omitted part of the flat number i had provided on the despatch address .
Flowers	they initially agreed to a 00_% refund but after numerous_emails they now say they will issue another partial_refund , although i am still chasing this .
Flowers	overall , if a delivery is unsuccessful for whatever_reason it is unacceptable to keep the flowers in a box for five days and then redeliver them .
Flowers	having placed an order in_advance of the 00th and receiving conformation via_email i was confident and happy that the order would arrive for my girlfriend and all would go smoothly .
Flowers	however , this was far from the case as the order never arrived and still_hasn ' t to this point .
Flowers	according to the tracking service my order arrived at the local service point at 0 : 00 and was out for delivery at 0 : 00 this was the last information i received for the day .
Flowers	having paid extra for it to be delivered before 0pm , as my girlfriend had plans for the rest of the day , when it got past 0pm and there was no sign of anything being delivered i began to become concerned .
Flowers	0pm came and went so we had to leave the house , despite being very frustrated at this , knowing the fact that there were other people in the house who could have collected the delivery in our absence .
Flowers	when we had returned we found that nothing had been delivered i attempted to contact via live_chat , no reply , so i rang them up , no reply , and finally emailed , no reply .
Flowers	to this point nothing has being delivered , despite this morning it saying on the tracking link that there was a failed delivery attempt at 00 : 00 on the 00th which is incorrect as i had been in up until 0pm waiting vigilantly for the doorbell and the subsequent delivery .
Flowers	all attempts made to day to contact have been in vain and still to delivery , i will undoubtedly be seeking a full_refund through iflorist or trading_standards will be informed promptly about this shocking excuse for a company .
Flowers	strongly_advise to avoid .
Flowers	ring 00000000000 go through to customer_service and wait for an answer tell them the issue and they should refund as they have with me , still no excuse .
Flowers	ordered flowers for a 00th_birthday in the usa and they never arrived !
Flowers	iflorist did not even tell me about this !
Flowers	money was taken out instantly and customer_service have not answered my questions .
Flowers	terrible service , do not order !!
Flowers	a girl in customer_service if you can call it that thought giving me a refund was good customer_service !!!!
Flowers	they are cowboys and i will be reporting this to trading_standards as by the looks online they do this to most customers .
Flowers	i have never written a review online so you can see how much i am annoyed by this ' customer_service '!
Flowers	they do not have email address ' s either so expect customers to write a formal letter to their operations manager .
Flowers	i have learnt my lesson and guess that i will probably never see my refund giving the fact the advisor didn ' t even apologise .
Flowers	this is an every day occurrence for this company so take my advice - do not order !
Flowers	i don ' t normally order flowers online due to fear of not getting healthy flowers .
Flowers	but i came_across this site and the more i looked and read up on the site the more my mind was changed .
Flowers	so i order the heaven scent for my mum for mother ' s day .
Flowers	i then realised i ' d over ordered the same flowers so i called and spoke to a lovely woman who helped sort my mistake out .
Flowers	i now feel completely reassured that what i have order will be stunning and breathtaking after the care they took talking to me .
Flowers	paid a premium to have flowers delivered on mothers ' day .
Flowers	my mother waited in all day as i received an_email_saying that they would definitely arrive ( after inquiry ).
Flowers	mothers ' day wasted .
Flowers	nothing received .
Flowers	rather embarrassing affair .
Flowers	in hindsight , it would have been better to trade with a more reputable name .
Flowers	i bought a single white rose , ' i love you ' balloon and a card for my girlfriend all for under £_00 , for delivery 0 days_later , i got a message when the flowers left their depo and when they arrived at hers , she_loves them and sent me a photo of them , they look better_than they did on their website .
Flowers	i used to get flowers delivered from moon pig , however , serenata_flowers are a lot cheaper and better quality , i will_definitely shop here again .
Flowers	i was looking for a last_minute present option for my sister ' s birthday .
Flowers	another website for jewelry promising next_day delivery in holland let me down after i was left with the impression that i had purchased the present and it was to arrive the following_day ( my sisters birthday ).
Flowers	they wrote to me to say that the bracelet was out of stock .
Flowers	then i found euroflorist which uses local_florists and purchased flowers , chocolates and wine which were beautifully wrapped and delivered the same day i ordered them .
Flowers	they made my sister really happy !
Flowers	ordered flowers yesterday before reading the reviews !!!!!
Flowers	and oh my goodness was i worried then !
Flowers	!
Flowers	sending my boyfriends mum some flowers as a apology and just thinking the worst i . e dead flowers .. not arriving etc ..
Flowers	well was kept well informed of the progress of my order i paid extra for delivery before noon and in the morning got a text_saying they would be delivered between 0 : 00 - 00 : 00 ..... woke my boyfriend up so he wouldn ' t miss them arriving and after he text at 00 : 00 saying they still weren ' t there i was panicking ..
Flowers	but no need at 00 : 00 i had a photo of the flowers come through on my phone they were on time and are absolutely beautiful !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered from iflorist on thursday_evening and selected saturday as my delivery day .
Flowers	it ' s now 0pm on sunday and still no flowers .
Flowers	i have a very disappointed mother who thinks i haven ' t bothered to get her a mother ' s day gift !
Flowers	this is the first and last time i will be ordering from iflorist !
Flowers	there ' s really no point in delivering the flowers now as mother ' s day is nearly over !
Flowers	i will be contacting you in the morning expecting a full_refund !
Flowers	made two orders with this company .
Flowers	0 ) one order could not go through several_times and then my credit_card was charged three times .
Flowers	it took me a month to get my money back
Flowers	0 ) the second order was scheduled for 00 april instead of 00 march .
Flowers	a week_later they offer to re - deliver flowers , but the birthday was a week before .
Flowers	customer support terrible and hang_up all the time !
Flowers	no compensation , no apologies .
Flowers	avoid them at all costs !
Flowers	rina . perelman @ gmail . com
Flowers	was looking for flowers for valentines_day and after checking some reviews i decided to book with iflorist instead of the other high_street florists
Flowers	i ordered a bouquet of 00 red_roses ( upgraded to luxury ) with chocolates and champagne for a reasonable sum of my hard_earned cash ... was worried_about delivery but the confirmation delivery email relieved my worries .
Flowers	everything going fine until i came home from work to my girlfriend opening the box with excitement as this is our first valentines_day together so was extra special !
Flowers	after she opened the box she realised the disappointment on my face at the small 00 red_roses that i would expect to have came from a garage forecourt for a fraction of the price !
Flowers	i now realise why the leading florists are established on the high_street and not working from some back street warehouse !
Flowers	if ordering flowers on this remember there is a chance of finding a petrol garage within 00_mins of your house where you can buy some half decent flowers .
Flowers	really disappointed in iflorist and i will await there response , not holding my breath for one so i will take this opportunity to thank them for spoiling my first valentines_day !
Flowers	00 - 00 - flowers are now dead , you get what you pay for doesn ' t actually work here !
Flowers	if there is no response i ' m sure there will be plenty of people in scotland who will be happy to read about this in the sunday mail as i have contacted the judge to make more people aware of this ,
Flowers	flowers not delivered .
Flowers	several_attempts at contacting company have been met with no response and given no refund .
Flowers	all stems snapped , all heads dead and burnt !!!!!!!!
Flowers	wilting and droopy .!!
Flowers	took 00hrs to sort with lots of emails back and forth .
Flowers	had to wait for 0 days after mothers_day for a replacement when there website stated they could deliver next_day if i was placing a new order ... as if i would .
Flowers	had two lots sent one to my mum and they were they worse ones as_described above where as the second lot which was over 000_miles_away the heads of the carnation were burnt .
Flowers	the replacements were better but not great , only wet soggy paper towels in the base to try and maintain water .
Flowers	they should have been in a pot and oasis like all the others i ' ve ever had delivered .
Flowers	and the only reason i never complained about the second bunch was coz my nan wasnt able to take pictures of them !!
Flowers	and they will on look at a compliant is they have pictures !!
Flowers	bloody awful service never ever again ruined mothers_day
Flowers	usual great service from serenata .
Flowers	great price , service and product .
Flowers	will_definitely use again
Flowers	i am shocked to say there is not one thing i am pleased about their service .
Flowers	i contacted iflorist before the order went out on their “ live_chat ” option which six days_later i still_haven ' t had a reply .
Flowers	how can they call that “ live_chat ”?
Flowers	!
Flowers	my order was for mothers_day .
Flowers	i looked at quite a few different companies , eliminating the ones that could not delivery on sunday .
Flowers	iflorist website stated they could and i placed the order based on this !
Flowers	the flowers stil have not arrived .
Flowers	i contacted iflorist again through email and chat and still not heard back again !
Flowers	i am very disappointed in thier service and i will not be using again !
Flowers	so i ordered flowers ( order 000000 ) on the 00th of february ( early afternoon ) paying extra for delivery by 0pm , as i was sending them to my girlfriend ' s work ( a large london hospital ) and i thought that way - even with a bit of a delay , they ' d be there by 0pm for sure .
Flowers	but no - nothing yesterday .
Flowers	what ' s so annoying , and i can ' t believe it - is that surely if they realise the flowers won ' t be delivered , they should be making_sure that every person affected would be contacted yesterday to be told .
Flowers	around 0pm - still noting .
Flowers	so i try and use their customer_service contact - no word back .
Flowers	messaged again late last_night - and still nothing .
Flowers	i definitely want a refund at the very least - and a courtesy_call would be polite .
Flowers	think it ' s really good the company have acknowledged one of the complaints on here promising a refund .
Flowers	i hope i ' ll get the same .
Flowers	and i ' d be tempted to use them again in the future without spreading word of my experience .
Flowers	such a shame that a mother will not be receiving a present tomorrow as i requested delivery today to ensure she got them on time .. shame on you for not doing as you promised .. yet you took the money from my account .. theives
Flowers	still_waiting for my wifes flowers that i ordered for today on 00th_jan for today .
Flowers	no replies to emails or calls .
Flowers	do not use this company .
Flowers	i will be contacting ts about investigating them as the number of complaints seems worringly high .
Flowers	have ruined my wifes valentines !
Flowers	i could not have been more disappointed with my order .
Flowers	i ordered flowers to say thank_you to a family friend .
Flowers	in the end i was too embarrassed to take the flowers i ordered so had to rush to tesco to buy a replacement bouquet - making it quite an expensive thank_you !
Flowers	i will not be ordering trough serenata ever again .
Flowers	lovely choice and good offers !
Flowers	the flowers were absolutely_gorgeous by my only problem was that they were delivered so late - around 0pm .
Flowers	not ideal given that they were a birthday_gift and for a relative who doesn ' t feel_comfortable answering the door to strangers after dark .
Flowers	as a result , they went to the neighbour .
Flowers	i think that delivery should take place during the day and not at night .
Flowers	first time i have used prestige and certainly will be the last based on my experience so far .
Flowers	i ordered flowers for a friends birthday which never arrived .
Flowers	no card was left by the courier to say they had tried to deliver .
Flowers	i emailed prestige and was told a card was left and my enquiry was now closed , and when i called i was told by customer_services they could not do anything , i can only email the same address i had previously but asking for the matter to be escalated to a manager since managers do not take calls regarding complaints .
Flowers	i looked at their facebook_page and found a number of other complaints to the same effect .
Flowers	bitterly disappointed to be out of pocket and feel totally ripped_off .
Flowers	don ' t waste your money , supermarket flowers are far_superior !
Flowers	they arrived to my grandmother late and were brown / half_dead on arrival .
Flowers	ive tried_contacting iflorist with no response .
Flowers	awful company !!!
Flowers	!
Flowers	overall disappointed because the flowers i got did not look fresh at all .
Flowers	and for the price ( i upgraded to deluxe ) i expected to get a much more impressive bouquets , the size didn ' t seem to even be as big as the picture , let_alone a deluxe version .
Flowers	added to this , there was no flower feed included .
Flowers	delivery man rang doorbell and left flowers on the front_door - not the most pleasant of transactions .
Flowers	think ill stick with my local flower shop next time .
Flowers	brilliant range of seeds , i bought some cat grass seeds which helps with digestion .
Flowers	and my kitties go absolutely nuts for the grass !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ' ve bought grass seeds before from another company and they hated it , but these sutton seeds are wonderful !
Flowers	originally posted 00 / 00 /_0000
Flowers	i ordered some flowers to be delivered to my girlfriend on valentine ' s day and paid extra for them to arrive before 0pm .
Flowers	it is now 0 . 00pm and the flowers are nowhere to be seen and no attempt has been made to contact me .
Flowers	the tracking_number they provided for the courier did not work , i sent them an_email at 0 . 00pm and they have yet to respond .
Flowers	their live_chat support services are all offline and they provide no phone number on their website .
Flowers	upon searching twitter and google i have found many , many people saying the same_thing , a few who did get hold of a phone number say they were hung_up on or sent to an answering_machine .
Flowers	this company is a disgrace and should not be used , they have clearly taken orders that they don ' t have the capability to fill , their customer_service is nonexistent and they are totally unprofessional .
Flowers	their company twitter account is acting as if nothing is going on , assuring customers that their emails will be answered .
Flowers	i am extremely disappointed , as is my partner and will not be using this service again nor will i recommend it to anybody i know .
Flowers	update 00 / 00 /_0000
Flowers	the flowers arrived this morning and they are not what i ordered , i asked for tulips and they have sent roses .
Flowers	not only that but they are very poor quality and only four of them are red , the others are pink .
Flowers	still no replies to the emails i have sent them or any other contact made with me .
Flowers	appalling service .
Flowers	update 00 / 00 /_0000
Flowers	it is now 0 days since i emailed them and still no reply !
Flowers	i want a refund !
Flowers	also the roses have already died , they lasted less_than 0 days .
Flowers	this company is a scam , do not buy from them , they cant deliver on time , they send the wrong flowers , the ones they do send are subpar and they ignore all contact from customers .
Flowers	update 00 / 00 /_0000
Flowers	just received an_email informing_me i will be getting a full_refund and " apologies for any inconvenience ".
Flowers	glad to be getting my money back but this does not change my opinion of iflorist .
Flowers	a stock email after 0 days of ignorance is not good enough .
Flowers	tip for people still being ignored , try emailing twitter @ iflorist . co . uk , this marks your complaint as " high priority ", i got a reply about 0hrs after trying that email address .
Flowers	realice un envio de unas flores , llegaron en buen estado y a tiempo .
Flowers	recomendado .
Flowers	i ordered flowers from iflorist , and selected an arrival date a week in_advance .
Flowers	the flowers did not arrive on that day - a birthday .
Flowers	since i was paying a premium for the service of delivering flowers on a specific date - the value of th flowers being much less_than the price i paid - i complained .
Flowers	iflorist responded quite promptly , saying that it was an administrative error on their part , and offered me £ 0 off my next purchase as compensation .
Flowers	i replied to say that i was not intending to use their service again , as it had been unsatisfactory , and requested a refund on the price i had paid , as they had not fulfilled their end of the contract .
Flowers	i did not recieve any response , and have resent the email 0 times in the last 0 weeks , with no reply .
Flowers	shocking service .
Flowers	000_% satisfaction_guarantee policy ???
Flowers	it doesn ' t exist !
Flowers	it is a lie !!!
Flowers	i ordered same day flowers that were promised to be delivered until 0pm and they were delivered after 0pm !
Flowers	it was for my mum ' s birthday ( a birthday surprise !!)
Flowers	and as she was at work , she left at 0 :_00pm , and her boss didn ' t accept the flowers .
Flowers	guess_what ???
Flowers	they don ' t feel responsible for not delivering the flowers by the time they promised !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	do not order anything from them !
Flowers	they refuse to give my money back !!
Flowers	the customer_service advisor is rude !!
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered some flowers for my great aunt as it was the first anniversary of the death of a close family_member .
Flowers	i paid extra for next_day service .
Flowers	the flowers should have been delivered today , yet i have sent several messages asking for confirmation of delivery , and have heard_nothing .
Flowers	i am not happy with this , ad wish i had ordered the flowers from a more well_known florist .
Flowers	very disappointed - i wish i read the reviews before ordering !
Flowers	excellent , product , excellent service , delivered perfectly :)
Flowers	order a nice bunch of flowers for my mum to be delivered on her_birthday ( today ) received a confirmation_email to say it had been ordered .
Flowers	since i haven ' t heard_anything at all !
Flowers	no contact with either me or my mum .
Flowers	no message to say about an attempted delivery either .
Flowers	i ' ve heard_nothing at all from them .
Flowers	quite happy to take a payment but not send the flowers .
Flowers	i thought it ' d be a great suprise for her as she lives away .
Flowers	don ' t think i ' ll be re - ordering again !
Flowers	mothers_day - a pretty important day , when you cant be there for your mum you turn to a florist .
Flowers	text from the old man , " you will be disappointed with the flowers , they are not very fresh at all "
Flowers	back to interflora - absolute_joke of a florist prestige , more like pretty crap florist
Flowers	very easy and convenient to order from the website with a wide_range of flowers .
Flowers	very much liked the mothers_day deal with the free delivery , chocolates and card while also having a discount on the flowers so its really good value for money .
Flowers	also the quality of the flowers are always of a high_standard .
Flowers	would always use this company .
Flowers	i would recommend you to them they are great !
Flowers	my gran said her flowers were lovely .
Flowers	the flowers are great value for money compared to other services .
Flowers	i loved the text_messages when the flowers were dispatched and when they arrived .
Flowers	i will use serenta flowers again .
Flowers	the site is a scam ... they have no real persons working there , and they take your money without sending product .
Flowers	it took them 0 weeks to get back to me , then some guy in india sends a bogus delivery attempt record that is not even for the same week as when i ordered the flowers .
Flowers	iflorist has a spectacular array of bouquets , no matter what your taste , budget or occasion .
Flowers	i particularly appreciate this , as all three things are very important .
Flowers	some websites or shops are either too expensive or have a lot of the same_thing ( for example a bias towards a lot of very colourful and flamboyant bouquets , or the opposite and they are all very classy and understated with not much in the way of colour or liveliness .)
Flowers	the website and the way it is laid_out is also very helpful with this , in that you can choose the occasion you are buying for , and they have a selection which may be appropriate or arranged with that in mind .
Flowers	it is easy to navigate , easy to stick within whatever budget you have and see what choice you have within it , and all bouquets come in three sizes , so if you can ' t afford or don ' t want a big bouquet you can always choose the smaller .
Flowers	there are also many generous discounts and often free delivery , which i think is generous given the free delivery is often around occasions like mother ' s day .
Flowers	the bouquets are fairly_priced , and are always delivered on time and received with much pleasure and admiration !
Flowers	it was so easy to order flowers for delivery in another country and even for next_day delivery .
Flowers	prices are very reasonable and in my case i even got free delivery .
Flowers	i will_definitely_recommend eflorist to others !
Flowers	thanks .
Flowers	just recived my order from i florist in a nice box opened to expect a nice big bunch of flowers to give to my girlfriend , opened it up and they were the smallest bunch of flowers i have ever_seen , i paid extra for premium flowers but there is nothing premium about these , they are brown around the edges and a couple of them look half_dead .
Flowers	could have bought better from my local tesco for a fiver .
Flowers	would like a full_refund because i feel_cheated as they look nothing like on the website .
Flowers	very dissapointed
Flowers	yes the flowers i ordered were delivered but not on time and not when i asked them to be delivered and upon asking for something to be done i was told that nothing can be done for me .
Flowers	i would not reccomend them or use this company again
Flowers	00 red_roses and cinera was the first order i made from arena_flowers and when they arrived the bouquet looked stunning according to my cousin .
Flowers	flowers were fresh and smelt lovely .
Flowers	best quality flowers he had ever received at a great affordable ( for me ) and unbeatable price .
Flowers	very happy customer and a very , very happy man on the receiving end .
Flowers	thanks arena
Flowers	very easy to navigate website and excellent pictures of what you are purchasing .
Flowers	easy to pay and don ' t have to sign_up if you want to get an express order placed !
Flowers	shocking service , there is no way to check on the order i made ... even_though i paid the extra amount to track .
Flowers	it ’_s not 00 : 00 and so far no flowers .
Flowers	this is the first valentines for myself & my fiancé , will be devastated if iflorist have ruined it .
Flowers	i will be complaining to the relevant body if nothing turns up and if the quality of the flowers are not top quality .
Flowers	some comments below say the flowers are practically dead .
Flowers	will change rating if i am proved wrong .
Flowers	do not do business with this company !
Flowers	they are complete fraudsters and i will be reporting them to the authorities .
Flowers	after my flowers for mothers_day were a week late i called and they said they couldnt find my address despite the fact that its no probably for every other delivery service ever .
Flowers	on their website it says a full_refund if not satisfied but they wouldnt give me one because apparently its not their fault , whose is it then ??
Flowers	this compant is shameless and i regret not using trusted companies like interflora .
Flowers	i can ' t believe their audacity , worst customer_service ive ever recieved .
Flowers	great same day service , good communication and great flowers .
Flowers	lillies in bud which is perfect to ensure the bouquet will last for a decent amount of time .
Flowers	one happy recipient equals one happy sender !
Flowers	ordered flowers for delivery 00 / 00 /_0000 , which never arrived .
Flowers	no call , voicemail , txt , email to advise of a delay .
Flowers	it ' s now 00 : 00 00 / 00 /_0000 however still nothing .
Flowers	tried_calling several_times on the order & customer_service lines .
Flowers	both lines simply state that they cannot take anymore orders for valentines_day , despite it being passed valentines_day !
Flowers	the lines then terminate with no option to speak with a consultant .
Flowers	judging_by the volume of similar reviews , it would seem that this company has little regard for meeting it ' s most basic obligation !
Flowers	i have emailed to request a full_refund and have received nothing more_than an_automated_response .
Flowers	stay_away
Flowers	what a load of tosh !!!
Flowers	wish i had read these reviews before ordering mums flowers !!
Flowers	yes uou guessed , £_00 . 00 spent , flowers ordered for 00th_dec , well in_advance , but bo flowers delivered ,
Flowers	company is diffficult to get hold of , - but i did grt hold of them by live_chat as you cant phone these fraudsters ... and i was promied a delivery on the 00st and theres a no show again .....
Flowers	i will be chasing this up but i guess i wont have much success judging_by the reviews on here .....
Flowers	dont put yourself through this hassle ....
Flowers	trading strandards and watchdog here we come
Flowers	very easy to use online facility .
Flowers	great pictures that truly represented the flowers that were delivered .
Flowers	great communication and updates_throughout from ordering to delivery .
Flowers	great price .
Flowers	great service .
Flowers	i ordered flowers 0 . 00pm friday_night and they were delivered by 00 . 00am the next_day .
Flowers	brilliant service and great choice of flowers .
Flowers	even better that it was free delivery !
Flowers	will_definitely be using again !
Flowers	!
Flowers	i ordered for a friend and the prices were great .
Flowers	she received the flowers and said they are beautiful and a very full bunch .
Flowers	the teddy was also very good quality .
Flowers	loved the text_message updates so i was constantly informed about what was happening .
Flowers	no_hesitation in using again or recommending .
Flowers	it was nearly 0pm on valentines_day and still no sign of the flowers .
Flowers	i received and email at 0 :_00pm to tell me that due to adverse_weather they were unable to deliver .
Flowers	really shocking service especially as the weather was far from adverse .
Flowers	i received another email offering a completely_different flower_arrangement and some chocs as an_apology but i suggested they refund me and maybe send my wife something as a gesture of goodwill .
Flowers	needless to say they agreed to refund but nothing else .
Flowers	if i were you i ' d use someone trusted like [_external reference_].
Flowers	the prices are pretty_much the same and at_least it is a trusted brand .
Flowers	oh , and despite me providing my order details , my review was removed pending me providing proof of my order !
Flowers	it looks_like everyone who left bad feedback about valentines_day had their reviews suspended and i expect some people won ' t bother to provide the proof .
Package_Service	i was in a bit of a tight spot when it came to shipping a couple of international parcels and figuring_out who to use and which prices were correct , etc .
Package_Service	they helped_me with everything i needed , no_problems or delays
Package_Service	i made a mistake on my order which was to be collected today , however parcel0go were able to rectify the mistake and reschedule the collection for the same afternoon really easily .
Package_Service	i spoke to emma who was very prompt , polite and helpful .
Package_Service	i was trying to make an urgent delivery booking this morning but my computer was playing up .
Package_Service	thankfully emma was able to process the transaction for me via the online_chat box and everything was sorted .
Package_Service	amazing customer_service thanks !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	peter was a great help in the live customer helpdesk .
Package_Service	thanks guys !
Package_Service	found sammy_taylor very helpfull
Package_Service	interparcel is a scam .
Package_Service	i paid for next_day delivery but they never delivered .
Package_Service	i contacted them and they said they had to wait for information from the carrier , ups .
Package_Service	these items were to be delivered to a hotel in london , to accompany someone visiting the uk back to his home country on the sunday and i explained this to interparcel and ups but both_parties turned a deaf ear .
Package_Service	after nearly 0 weeks , they emailed me to say they had found the suitcase and it would be delivered to the hotel .
Package_Service	at this point it became obvious that they had failed to read all my emails as had they bothered to , they would have realised that the items aught to have been abroad by now .
Package_Service	they refuse to deliver abroad and the car insisted they would deliver to the hotel .
Package_Service	i finally drummed it in her ears that this was not an option and i will fight tooth and nail to ensure they pay the cost of sending the items abroad .
Package_Service	the easiest place to book a courier and for the best price too !
Package_Service	gives you options to choose which company you want to go with , which service and also tells you the ones you need a printer for and the ones you don ' t !
Package_Service	fantastic !
Package_Service	cheap , easy , friendly and the best service .
Package_Service	have used quite a few_times now and will_continue to use them .
Package_Service	0 / 0 don ' t bother looking elsewhere :)
Package_Service	great service and very cheap , twitter customer_service is excellent
Package_Service	coherent and easy to understand .
Package_Service	[_name ] knows her stuff and gets the job_done .
Package_Service	great customer_service .
Package_Service	shes like a much more attractive yoda but not green , hairy or small .
Package_Service	never used parcel0go before , i will be now though !
Package_Service	bear .
Package_Service	had a problem with a next_day collection and they didn ' t arrive .
Package_Service	spoke to daniel on the chat system and he was very efficent and re - booked my collection for today ( 00st june_0000 ), sent over new paperwork and emailed the courier saying this must be collected today for next_day delivery .
Package_Service	all i can say it - brilliant customer_service !
Package_Service	thank_you daniel .
Package_Service	i chat with sarah_hayes and help me a lot to complete my order process .
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	punctual , good value !
Package_Service	catherine was very helpful in helping me send a parcel to ireland .

Package_Service	i had a problem and it was rectified very quickly with no_fuss or hassle .
Package_Service	thank_you kindly emma for your help today !
Package_Service	happy birthday to your little_boy .
Package_Service	iv used alot of livechat services and i have never recieved such brilliant service and good manners as today .
Package_Service	richard understood and evaluated my problem efficiently and within minutes the problem was solved with the best of manners and curtsy .
Package_Service	honestly he is amazing , thanks parcel0go !
Package_Service	needed assistance which i received via live_chat .
Package_Service	sarah p solved my problem in under a minute .
Package_Service	a * :)
Package_Service	i have book a parcel with them about a month_ago .
Package_Service	it was collected by parcel_force but than returned without a reason .
Package_Service	i dig down to find out why there was a return .
Package_Service	i phoned parcel_force , they told me it was retuned because item weight might have been exceeded .
Package_Service	i tried to make them understand i quoted for 00kg and get prices in the website for 00 kg and booked for 00kg !!!
Package_Service	at the end even parcel_force depot did not find out why it was returned .
Package_Service	parcel0go tried to rebook collection ; however , as i moved out of the property the needed to change collection address .
Package_Service	representatives wrote the wrong_address details 0 timesss , then they told me to confirm the weight of parcel , which i did and said that it is about 00 kg and i booked for 00kg parcel .
Package_Service	they insisted and told me to confirm item weight and i confirmed and said 00kg !!!!!
Package_Service	there was a problem , so i was tired and i just canceled the booking .
Package_Service	i got my refund .
Package_Service	yesterday , i rebooked for the same parcel for 00kg .
Package_Service	i waited at home all day for the collection man to arrive and collect my parcel but no body turned_up .
Package_Service	i went straight to their online help centre .
Package_Service	i admit that online help assistances were helpful and polite .
Package_Service	however , they told me item is heavy and parcel_force refused to collect it .
Package_Service	againnnn .
Package_Service	however , online help assistance was confused too , why parcel_force really refused to collect it .
Package_Service	there wasnt sufficient information about it .
Package_Service	if it is too heavy for the service , i don ' t understand_why parcel0go quote for it and why they sell it to me in first place .
Package_Service	i recon , parcel_force finds the price , that parcel0go offers , too low for the service and refuse to carry but parcel0go web_site still show the cheapest option as parcel_force after all that trouble .
Package_Service	i had to get my money back second time .
Package_Service	as far as i understood there is a problem between third_party ( parcel0go . com ) and the actual currier company .
Package_Service	however , if there is a problem they should have cancel their contract completely or for some services .
Package_Service	selling the product , wasting my all day and then just apologies .
Package_Service	it is not acceptable !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	big thanks to [_name ] and [_name ] for there help today on live help and social_media after i had a issue with my order :)
Package_Service	fast , friendly service .... always on time and always reliable ..... sam was exceptionally helpful during a recent communication .....!
Package_Service	my parcel wasn ' t delivered on time and i needed to chase its whereabouts .
Package_Service	i have just had a live_chat with leanne from parcel0go and she was excellent , very efficient and to the point .
Package_Service	great service for a sunday_night .
Package_Service	well_done .
Package_Service	keep up the good work .
Package_Service	i have sent at_least 00 - 00 parcels via parcel togo and had no_problems with the compant , 0 parcel did take a little longer_than the 0 - 0 days i paid for but i was always greated at the end of the phone by a friendly member of staff that tried their best to help in tracking the parcel and letting me know the status of delivery ...
Package_Service	emma advised me today , the process was fast and effective .
Package_Service	i will be posting my item next week .
Package_Service	great
Package_Service	i ' ve been using them for a while and they are ok .
Package_Service	i was looking for something instead of " we can break the unbreakable " myhermes and i found collect +.
Package_Service	i had 0 issue after sending 00 parcels .
Package_Service	a plastic fuel pump was broken in the delivery but collectplus paid the compensation without excuse .
Package_Service	im very happy with them so far and i highly_recommend them to anyone .
Package_Service	i like to use their website rahater than parcel0go .
Package_Service	parcel0go charges you if you want to cover your item over £_00 .
Package_Service	collectplus automatically covers everything with £_00 !
Package_Service	one thing which i found bad .
Package_Service	you can ' t pay by card on their website just by paypal .
Package_Service	there is the card payment option but it doesn ' t work .
Package_Service	all good ... keep up .
Package_Service	used the site to send a large parcel the other day and was amazed at the value for money .
Package_Service	so easy to use , print labels , purchase and track etc .
Package_Service	would recommend 000_%
Package_Service	i ordered for my parcel to be collected and when the courier arrived , he said that all the necessary paperwork which parcel0go automatically generate to ' make it easier ' was not there .
Package_Service	so he wanted to leave and come back tomorrow while i finalised this paperwork but manged to convince him to stay .
Package_Service	then when tracking it online , it kept saying ' stuck in customs '.
Package_Service	parcel0go only have an online live_chat assistance who very quickly shrug you off , say they ' ll look_into it and then you never hear_anything from them .
Package_Service	after much persisting , they gave me a phone number to call and they were much more helpful but none of them fed back any updates or the status of their findings at all despite my specific request for this on each occasion and their confirmation that they would advise me .
Package_Service	had i not been proactive in chasing the parcel , i am quite sure it would still be stuck in customs because the customer_service staff at parcel0go seem to be doing nothing .
Package_Service	then i got charged a customs import fee on top of all of this !!
Package_Service	i have requested 0 times now that they refund this customs import fee to me becuse of the hidden_fees but , more_importantly , poir service , and they persistently refuse .
Package_Service	one word sums them up - useless !!
Package_Service	and watch out for their hidden_fees !!
Package_Service	they will gladly take your money instantly and you won ' t see it again !!
Package_Service	do not use parcel0go !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	we were recommended by a friend who uses parcel0go all the time .
Package_Service	i was a bit_sceptical but could not believe the level of service we recieved !
Package_Service	we use parcel0go to send parcels to our parents who live in france .
Package_Service	we have always been very happy with the service and the timescales , and the delivery drivers are so helpful !
Package_Service	from start to finish everything is exactly as it should be , manageable , fast and even the website is easy to use !
Package_Service	its always a smooth_transaction and i would certainly recommend them to anyone who_wants a prompt and professional service !
Package_Service	regards leanne from somerset ! x
Package_Service	[_name ] was very helpful and solved my issues straight_away . 00 *
Package_Service	all my questions were dealt_with well and in a friendly_manner and got quick responses .
Package_Service	thanks sammie_taylor !
Package_Service	on my way to send my package !
Package_Service	really suprised .
Package_Service	courier did not pickup my order and
Package_Service	- available to chat after 0pm
Package_Service	- upgraded me for free to another courier .
Package_Service	interparcel would never upgarded me
Package_Service	ps .
Package_Service	avoid hermes delivery company !
Package_Service	was really not happy with the poor service !
Package_Service	as a customer i purchased through the interparcel site on tuesday and no courier arrive for wednesday .
Package_Service	no message , phonecall or update on why they did not pick_up the parcel .
Package_Service	i complained and was told friday will be next pickup .
Package_Service	i messaged the staff again asking to ensure they will arrive friday and was assurred by staff not to worry and someone will pick_up the collection friday ...
Package_Service	well suprise , no collection and no update , message or any notification why .
Package_Service	i was told monday was next pickup and it was 0pm and still no sign of a courier .
Package_Service	i phoned up staff who said nothign they can do and to accept it or get a refund .
Package_Service	i asked to speak to management and was surprisingly told not to bother as management would say same_thing .
Package_Service	eventually i spoke to management who said nothign they can do regarding the no - shows .
Package_Service	they will not even give information on why the courier is not coming .
Package_Service	no one in the interparcel team will accept_responsibility and niether will i be upgraded for free to another service despite the false_advertising .
Package_Service	i am now 0 days late on my delivery to a ebay customer and have had 0 pickup calls ignored .
Package_Service	to top it all off , today i have asked for a refund and have not recieved an reply regarding my refund either .
Package_Service	advice , avoid this service if you want to save_yourself a world of headache
Package_Service	i had a problem with my order through the site , i contacted live help and i was put through to operator catherine who was brillant .
Package_Service	she identified the problem , and amended it accordingly , she talked me through the whole_process and got my parcel booked !
Package_Service	she was very well_mannered , great communication and kept me in the know the whole time .
Package_Service	i often have to use live help and there brilliant every_single time .
Package_Service	0 * for parcel 0 go customer_service
Package_Service	0 * for catherine
Package_Service	another satisfied customer ,
Package_Service	thank_you .
Package_Service	sammie was very helpful , very quick , overall there ' s nothing that i can fault .
Package_Service	would definitely use the service again , very high_quality .
Package_Service	literally cannot deal with how annoyingly careless they are about their customers ... its seems everyone_else on trust_pilot agree with me too .
Package_Service	i was promised a delivery that never arrived despite being made to wait at home for it the entire day as i was assured it would be delivered .
Package_Service	i was promised several call_backs that never happened ... total incompetence
Package_Service	i had an initial problem with sending a package to italy so i contacted live help .
Package_Service	the operator ashley was extremely_helpful and polite and in a matter of minutes my problem was resolved .
Package_Service	i will_definately be using parcel0go in the future .
Package_Service	hi would like to say [_name ] was really helpful and very quick to respond to my questions .
Package_Service	thanks [_name ] for making my order so easy .
Package_Service	excellent service as always
Package_Service	[_name ] helped be book the order on the live_chat it was very easy to do and she was extremely_helpful !
Package_Service	i was talking to sarah_h online as i had a problem with the description of my contents as files , so i had to ask sarah_h to process my parcel for me .
Package_Service	i had a lot of internet problems and when i eventually got back online after approx 0 hour and got in contact with her , she had my order ready just at a click of a button .
Package_Service	sarah_h provided more_than required and provide excellent customer_service , and was extremely patient and understanding .
Package_Service	thanks to sarah_h my parcel has now been paid for and ready for me to drop_off .
Package_Service	i want to say a massive thank_you sarah_h for your help .
Package_Service	i run a webstore so delivery is pretty key to my business .
Package_Service	i used interparcel for the first time ( most items are pretty small so post_office is hard to beat ) needless to say i won ' t use them again .
Package_Service	i opted for a myhermes delivery ( again won ' t do that again either ) but being as i didn ' t ask for signature on delivery it was deemed acceptable to put the item in the bin !
Package_Service	the bin was then collected and therefore my item was crushed .
Package_Service	£_000 worth of stock down the drain which i ' ve now had to replace .
Package_Service	interparcel have said i should ' ve opted for a better package .
Package_Service	my argument is how can the cheap delivery package be essentially a disposal service !
Package_Service	a bin is not a postbox !
Package_Service	this was on the first attempt at delivery too so it ' s pretty insane .
Package_Service	no compensation at all , now if they had ' ve left it on the doorstep i agree this would be part of their terms and conditions " might be left at the property unattended " and it got stolen then i ' d hold my hands up and say my bad .
Package_Service	but they put it in the bin !
Package_Service	morons absolute morons , take heed people use a decent courier service !
Package_Service	spend a little extra and boycott this shambles of a company
Package_Service	a great 0st experience with parcel_hero .
Package_Service	the courier collected a parcel from me in glasgow the day after booking , as arranged , and the courier delivered the parcel in london the very next_day .
Package_Service	express service at an excellent rate .
Package_Service	very happy with the service .
Package_Service	i ' d use again .
Package_Service	i wanted to add an extra note to the collection address as it is difficult to find .
Package_Service	didn ' t think of it at time of booking on line - which was very quick and easy to do .
Package_Service	searched on the site at about 00pm , no obvious answer on how to do this , so was taken quickly to the on line chat option .
Package_Service	spoke with catherine .
Package_Service	- very friendly , quick and helpfull .
Package_Service	so far i really cant find fault with the service .
Package_Service	have created an account and will_definately use again in the future .
Package_Service	my parcel was collected on time and delivered earlier_than i had expected .
Package_Service	parcel0go kept me updated with emails and the help on their online help facility was excellent , when i couldn ' t find my tracking_number .
Package_Service	two_thumbs_up for parcel0go who i will be using for all my parcels from now on .
Package_Service	i had great help from a lady_called catherine , i was sending out a parcel to poland but was found to be stuck on the webpage without it allowing me to book the service i needed .
Package_Service	i spoke with catherine who went out of her way , and even after she had faced technical_difficulties managed to find me a deal .
Package_Service	thanks again for your help !
Package_Service	jenny couldn ' t have done any more to help process my order , all my questions were answered in detail and all the information needed was provided .
Package_Service	would definitely use this service again and would recommend others too :)
Package_Service	spoke to a very helpful and friendly live_chat agent by the name of daniel .
Package_Service	he offered great customer_service , and answered all my questions clearly and precise !
Package_Service	thanks , david
Package_Service	thanks sam for your swift service on sorting_out my issue with delivery !
Package_Service	quick response and very helpful !
Package_Service	daniel :
Package_Service	fantastic service , helped_me sort out a parcel booking on live_chat brilliantly
Package_Service	service is a ++++
Package_Service	parcel0go simply do an excellent job , despite the couriers creating the problem , they always strive to sort out the issue , and the staff on live_chat are polite helpful and a credit to the company .
Package_Service	its easy to se straight_forward all online , and they collect from the house which is really brilliant and the price is great too !
Package_Service	when i needed help i got through to live_chat really quickly and spoke to sammie_taylor and my problem was resolved within a matte of minutes !
Package_Service	the whole_process of arranging a courier is very straight - forward and intuitive .
Package_Service	i also loved the fact , that i could obtain online quotes only typing in origin , destination , weight and dimensions .
Package_Service	i would also like to point out an outstanding customer care .
Package_Service	when faced a little doubt concerning restricted / prohibited items - i was immediately online assisted by a very friendly and professional lady_called sarah_hayes , who clearly explained how i should fill out the form .
Package_Service	i would strongly_recommend the parcel0go to anyone :-)
Package_Service	thank_you ,
Package_Service	michal
Package_Service	after waiting in for 0 hours in accordance to the tracking_number advising that the parcel was ' out for delivery ' it changes at 0 :_00pm to ' time constraints prevented delivery , delivery at earliest opportunity .'
Package_Service	having seen this message before from other_companies , i expected my parcel before 00am the following_morning .
Package_Service	by 0pm there is still no sign of it , so i contacted tnt who were delivering on interparcel ' s behalf .
Package_Service	they advised that i had to contact interparcel as it was their contract .
Package_Service	fair_enough .
Package_Service	so , unable to call them as i don ' t have a landline , i used their useful ' live help messenger ' feature .
Package_Service	what an_absolute waste of time , the person i spoke to repeated a variance of ' it is out for delivery and will be with you by 0 :_00pm ' every time i asked a question .
Package_Service	after i asked why the company deemed it acceptable that i should have to wait in for another day due to their incompetence , she said ' i have told you it ' s coming by 0 : 00 today what else do you want me to do ?'
Package_Service	and disconnected from the conversation .
Package_Service	this is a shocking way to treat a customer , i hope never to have to deal with interparcel again , and would recommend others to steer_clear as well .
Package_Service	super helpful and easy to deal with .
Package_Service	after half an_hour being frustrated getting_nowhere
Package_Service	a angel apered call catherine_corless
Package_Service	she was very helpfull , pleasant
Package_Service	if there was less_than one star i would rate them that !
Package_Service	i sold a saxophone on ebay and for the first time decided to use collect_plus .. used their tracker service and was pleased to notice that it had been delivered the next_day .. or so i thought .
Package_Service	then received an_email from the buyer a week_later to say that the saxophone hadn ' t been delivered !
Package_Service	confused ?
Package_Service	so was i ..
Package_Service	contacted collect_plus and they informed me that upon first attempt they could not delivered and then on two consecutive attempts the buyer was not in .. no email to inform me of this ..
Package_Service	so upon enquiring_about this , they informed me that the saxophone was on its way back .. that was last sunday and still no sign ..
Package_Service	i have contacted them since and still no correspondence ..
Package_Service	the buyer now wants a refund of £_000 which includes the price of the item and the postage ..
Package_Service	but including ebay fees i will be at a loss and the package was never delivered so surely i need a refund ??
Package_Service	not happy with this service ..
Package_Service	this is going to affect my ebay ratings !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	booked on mon for pick_up tues , got a call on tues from driver asking where we were as he had been given the wrong postcode by them and was 0 mins down the road .
Package_Service	he refused to pick_up from our area .
Package_Service	they said someone would come weds instead but we had to wait_until 0pm , no one came .
Package_Service	on thurs they couldn ' t guarantee pick_up so we cancelled order .
Package_Service	this is the 0nd problem i have had with them so i will never use them again .
Package_Service	cant_fault the service emma was very helpful indeed sorted everything out for me perfect job_done !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	problem very efficiently dealt_with & very helpful .
Package_Service	thanks catherine
Package_Service	had to ask a few questions_regarding whether my parcel was restricted , spoke to sarah_hayes , who was very helpful , happy to give me the answers that i required , and asked me some extra question to make_sure there were no crossed wires .
Package_Service	she should be rewarded for her great service !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	excellent service would recommed
Package_Service	i had great help from the customer_service department courtesy of [_name ], who got my payment processed and shipping labels sent out so i could get my parcel shipped promptly
Package_Service	great to send alot of parcels .
Package_Service	best customer_service .
Package_Service	the information that i have asked from online i was great quick ..
Package_Service	superb online assistance in sending an urgent parcel to a yacht in italy .
Package_Service	clear and helpful service from sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	the 00hr courier did not collect the parcel - so i contacted catherine and she rebooked a different courier to collect from us the same day and deliver next_day !
Package_Service	super helpful , really friendly - you couldn ' t ask for better service
Package_Service	was struggling to sort out a failed delivery .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor sorted it .
Package_Service	i ' m very dissapointed .
Package_Service	the parcel arrived badly_damaged and ofcourse my claim was rejected .
Package_Service	i ' ve packed it very well but it was just smashed .
Package_Service	it ' s obvious for me that they don ' t respect customers property , they just don ' t care .
Package_Service	shame .
Package_Service	even if the item is on prohibited item list it doesn ' t explained why they don ' t treat parcels with care .
Package_Service	also if you want to add negative_review on their website it never going to be posted .
Package_Service	there is also no phone number to speak to someone .
Package_Service	poor .
Package_Service	use it for a year now and made my life_easier !
Package_Service	always trust them with my packages never had any_problems what so ever !
Package_Service	recomend to anyone who doens ´ t want to bother with the logistics of sending packages to fully trust parcel0go .
Package_Service	every time i have a question help online is always at a second away just now been talking to catherine_corless , and it ´_s just one more helping and caring menber of their crew who ´_s always there to help on everything .
Package_Service	regards
Package_Service	can ' t fault a ++++
Package_Service	this company adwertises 0 to 0 days delivery on parcel you send , thats nat the real story wait_till problem arise then you will get this answer
Package_Service	i am afraid we are unable to do anyting for delays in delivery as the courier does not guarantee the delivery timeframe as stated during the order process .
Package_Service	rose from parcell0go .
Package_Service	i ask so it can be one year ?
Package_Service	relpy from rose parcell0go . that would be excessive ali .
Package_Service	after a certain period of time the item is deemed lost at which point you would be able to start a claim for loss .
Package_Service	basicly if your parcel nat delivered you dont know when its going to be ?
Package_Service	and how long time_frame .
Package_Service	this is a fraud ?
Package_Service	or i am wrong , adwertises 0or 0 day delivery ,
Package_Service	but if nat delivered then its all aboute small_print .
Package_Service	please_please stay_away from p0g
Package_Service	this website is easy to use and there is a convienient live_chat button which i used today , spoke to sarah_hayes and she very quickly answered my query and was very friendly :) highly_reccomend this website , never had a problem .
Package_Service	changed my order collection date no problem .
Package_Service	samantha taylor
Package_Service	i ordered the door to door delivery from scotland to dorset , after one and a half week of waiting and 0 unsuccessful pick_up dates / days reschedules ( delivery man has not arrived to pick_up point due to 0 different reasons , like company what we have selected does not operate in that area ... etc ) i gave up the fight .
Package_Service	positive is , that customer_services staff were very friendly and willing to cancel my delivery without any word .
Package_Service	but i would not recommend this company due to my bad_experience .
Package_Service	dhl skulle eftersigende havde forsøgt leveret en_pakke på_min bopæl i dag .

Package_Service	det_har virkelig været en fest at være kunde hos dhl og for fremtiden vil jeg selv samt anbefale andre at undgå dhl da deres chaufføre åbenbart er fulde af løgn .
Package_Service	daniel helped_me with the answer i was looking for and in a very efficient , polite and courteous manner .

Package_Service	perfect service , as usual .
Package_Service	special thanks to [_name ].
Package_Service	i would recommend to anyone .
Package_Service	i used this company to send 0 heavy and expensive tractor parts .
Package_Service	after searching for some time on other_websites i was expecting to pay £_00 - 00 for both this items delivered by a standard service .
Package_Service	i decided to try your site before picking another company to use and i ' m very pleased i did .
Package_Service	i spoke to a very helpful and knowledgeable live help advisor named peter .
Package_Service	because i was new to your site he helped_me though step by step and was very kind and helpful .
Package_Service	i managed to get a next_day delivery for less_than half price previously quoted .
Package_Service	overall i was very pleased with the service and very grateful to peter for helping me .
Package_Service	i will_definitely use again and have already_recommended you to others .
Package_Service	i was dealt_with a lady_called emma in regards to a parcel that needed to be sent elsewhere rather_than the registered address that i had entered .
Package_Service	she was very helpful and changed the address quickly .
Package_Service	i use parcel to go regularly and they offer a great service with a large_selection of postal services .... many cheaper_than royal_mail perfect for my ebay business and private accounts :)
Package_Service	catherine helped_me sort my orders for collection tomorrow with hermes .
Package_Service	she explained a time_slot was not possible and after a short discussion she politley explained the hermes drop_off service was better which it is as there is no waiting around .
Package_Service	thanks for the help and advice .
Package_Service	before used to be missed collections , nowadays seems to be working , overall it ' s a good company for small to medium size parcels with sensible price , insurance on the items however not that great , most of them are covered to £_00 which you need to pay hell extra to insure it , sometimes even more_than the parcel postage price itself .
Package_Service	catherine helped_me on live_chat last_night she told me what to do she was polite and patient she is amazing on live_chat : ddd

Package_Service	merry xmas parcel0go
Package_Service	i arranged for my parcel to be collected by yodel through parcel0go , however the collected was never attempted .
Package_Service	as this was an urgent parcel i was quite disgruntled to say the least !
Package_Service	i was also further frustrated that yodel referred me back to parcel0go and then i found out i couldn ' t just pick_up the phone and speak to someone personally to get this resolved .
Package_Service	however , i was put through to a lovely_lady named sammie_taylor who was very apologetic and went out of her way to help me .
Package_Service	her friendly tone immediately calmed me down and i went away with a resolution and feeling happy with the service i received .
Package_Service	so a massive thank_you to sammie for helping me but also for restoring my faith in customer_service !
Package_Service	i would definitely use parcel0go in the future based on this .
Package_Service	thank_you x_x
Package_Service	i had used this service for the first time .
Package_Service	catherine_corless had helped_me in the live chatt .
Package_Service	she was so quick and helpful that im impressed .
Package_Service	i will return to this service only because of her .
Package_Service	welldone .
Package_Service	smooth and easy transaction made possibly with the help of jenny :)
Package_Service	was having trouble with the website and used the live help option and was assisted by daniel who booked the parcel in for me and went through the whole_process patiently and as quickly as possable no compalints 0 star customer_service
Package_Service	just had a great customer_service experience with andrea .
Package_Service	thanks for helping book a second delivery .
Package_Service	very helpful ...
Package_Service	i would recommend parcel to co and the live_chat to anybody looking for a little_bit of extra guidance / support .
Package_Service	thank_you .
Package_Service	catherine_corless is amazing !
Package_Service	was busy at work and she was patient enough to talk me through a parcel booking from uk to usa .
Package_Service	much cheaper_than other_places too .
Package_Service	thanks a million !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	emma was very helpful and got ahead of the game and arranged an_alternative courier !
Package_Service	thanks emma
Package_Service	emma was very kind and helpful and very quick ty
Package_Service	yeah , rad and easy service .
Package_Service	i just dropped my parcel off at a shop that uses the collect +, no hassle .
Package_Service	would like to see more drop_off points in coventry and birmingham though , cheers .
Package_Service	i paid extra to have a parcel collected that day .
Package_Service	firstly they initially changed their minds to the next_day which i had to have changed back .
Package_Service	that was last thursday on a 00 hour service .
Package_Service	it ' s now tuesday the next week and still no collection .
Package_Service	requested a refund at_least down to the service received and denied .
Package_Service	if it wasn ' t 0 pounds i ' d use the small_claims court but it ' s definitely not worth it .
Package_Service	not even sure whether to let them taje it as fairly sure they ' ll loose it .
Package_Service	bottom_line : all the positive_reviews here are people whose package was delivered .
Package_Service	but just a couple of negatives should be enough for a delivery service .
Package_Service	actually delivering when you are a parcel company is not good service - it ' s just the service .
Package_Service	avoid and use royal_mail .
Package_Service	jessica - parcel0go chat helper
Package_Service	i messed_up an order so a parcel was being delivered to myself ...... in under 0 minutes of talking to jessica it was all sorted - no password ' s no who am i and messing_around .... just simple and clear help - so easy to speak to parcel0go chat help .

Package_Service	!
Package_Service	had a small issue with information on a invoice , samantha found a solution and resolved it quickly .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	i talked to sammie_taylor she is very good , nice , helpfull
Package_Service	my google_checkout payment didn ' t return me to the parcel0go website with a confirmation number , so i was unsure if it had worked .
Package_Service	i had real trouble_finding out how to speak to someone on the p0g website without the p0g reference_number they wanted , so turned to twitter .
Package_Service	kate was fab and sorted it within 0 minutes , but it would be a lot_easier if i could have just done it via the website .
Package_Service	i did get a bit irate going around in circles at first .
Package_Service	i send various weights and sizes all around the world , no other courier , and i have used a few different companys , can offer the level of service that parcel_hero offer .
Package_Service	uk_based customer_service , 0 : 00 on a sunday i emailed , within half hour i had a reply and the answer to my question !
Package_Service	my parcels are always collected and delivered on time .
Package_Service	having used city_link who failed to collect or deliver on time i had to find someone to deliver , pardon the pun !
Package_Service	yes , there are cheaper couriers out there , but when trust is an issue , parcel_hero are the ones to trust !
Package_Service	this is a really great service - get your parcel picked_up from your home / office and delivered to your recipient the next_day !
Package_Service	easy to use , efficient and cheaper_than having to go and queue up at the post_office – an_absolute no_brainer !
Package_Service	had a problem with a wrong adress on my package , spoke to sarah via the customer support window and she solved within_seconds many_thanks again sarah brilliant service couldnt ask for more verry happy :)
Package_Service	very easy to contact .
Package_Service	great that they have an online_chat service and are able to give you a quick quote .
Package_Service	will be using this service to collect my parcel .

Package_Service	i just wanted to say the online_chat customer_service people are very friendly and helpful !
Package_Service	my thanks to emma !

Package_Service	:) :) :) :) :) :)
Package_Service	i have used parcels0go for both business and personal parcels for a while and cannot_fault their service .
Package_Service	when i tried to process an order online today , there was an error but i just got straight onto the live_chat feature and emma processed my order for me .
Package_Service	what great service !
Package_Service	i would recommend this service since the live_chat is really helpful and the service is very cheap
Package_Service	my agent was sarah hunter .
Package_Service	it was quick and informative chat .

Package_Service	and the agent was really friendly and intelligent .

Package_Service	have used parcel0go a few_times now and each time i have its been a breeze to pick and place on order .
Package_Service	they even let me change an incorrect address i had been given and re - arange for the parcel to be pick_up at no extra_cost .
Package_Service	would highly_recomend there service to anyone who asked me !
Package_Service	will be using them again without a shadow of doubt !
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	graham
Package_Service	when i went to that website , it provided me with loads of possibilities to choose the parcel company .
Package_Service	however , i have decided to speak with customer_service instead and catherine was very helpful .
Package_Service	she not only answered on all my questions , but as well as provided some additional necessary_information in front , which i find useful .
Package_Service	thanks to catherine , this process took my no more_than 0 minutes .
Package_Service	had an error with collection as the driver just missed us .
Package_Service	was given fantastic and quick service by catherine .
Package_Service	many_thanks .
Package_Service	[_name ] was an_absolute star .
Package_Service	she was very patient and helped immensely .
Package_Service	would give her a hug .
Package_Service	kel .
Package_Service	great website , easy to use , makes life so much_easier now i don ' t have to make a trip to the post_office .
Package_Service	my parcel come and pick_up my delivery at a location convenient to me , i trust them with my most_important parcels !
Package_Service	i always go to parcel0go . com , to book with tnt to send my parcels , it ' s fast and convenient .
Package_Service	they also have instant chat service which i find really helpful , i have contacted [_name ] for help today , she was very efficent .
Package_Service	great service by emma on the live_chat when the site wouldn ' t recognise the post code .
Package_Service	a star service .
Package_Service	live help was great , spoke to a lady_called jessica who was very helpful .
Package_Service	the only down_side is the companies lack of commitment and responsibility to its customers .
Package_Service	booked several packages on different days , first thing they never collected , so close to 0 pm i got in touch only to be told from a script , collections can go up to 0 :_00pm clearly not because no one arrived , then had to rebook , and lo and behold no one came and collected , complained and was told , " its not a guaranteed service " but they still took my money for next_day delivery ..
Package_Service	second set of parcels , no one collected come 0 pm i get in touch again only to be told from script " deliveries can be up to 0 :_00pm , guess_what ?
Package_Service	no one collected , at this pointy im just about at my wits_end , forked out good money for next_day delivery , so i complained only to be told again ... " its not a guaranteed service "
Package_Service	but wait ..... they took my guaranteed next_day delivery money did they not ?
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	0rd set of parcels went off on time , but never reached the destination , 0 days and no one can tell me what has happened to my parcels , we will email you when we know whats_happening ....... i mean if they dont know what happening they should not be in the business ......
Package_Service	awful_awful_awful service
Package_Service	should be reported to watchdog hiding_behind " its not a guaranteed service " and taking for a service they are not providing is nothing short of theft !
Package_Service	if i could rate them - zero_stars i would
Package_Service	parcels to go are absolutely fantastic at organizing your parcels etc , not only are they a delivery service , they are good to speak to an very very understanding an help you out in anyway possible , sometimes i dont feel_like im talking to a stranger as i feel_like they are a friend as you can have a laugh with them etc !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	needed my label sending to an_alternative email address , popped online and robert sorted it in a jiffy !
Package_Service	very helpful and professional , will_definitely use again if they are all as friendly as him !
Package_Service	as everyone said that the first time was fine .
Package_Service	after that , they always failed to collect the parcel .
Package_Service	my parcel has been failed to be collected for three times .
Package_Service	and i contacted them by live chart , they told me the scheduled collection can not be garanteed as they stated in the conditions .
Package_Service	avoid this company if can .
Package_Service	they can not arrange well with carriers .
Package_Service	it is an useless company .
Package_Service	waste your money and time .
Package_Service	having had a transaction on my credit_card statement from parcel0go for which i had no invoice i contacted thier online live help service .
Package_Service	i spoke with sammie_taylor who was very helpful and polite and was able to quickly sort out my problem .
Package_Service	i would recommend both sammie and parcel0go for future business .
Package_Service	i have booked a courier to india containing used personnel goods .
Package_Service	while getting the quotation from website , there were several providers , some of them shows that they are for commercial service .
Package_Service	i called customer_services , they told that .. ignore that message and go_ahead with booing with tnt .
Package_Service	i booked and once the courier reached india , i got call from tnt india stating that i need to pay 000 gbp as custom charges .
Package_Service	on inquiry , tnt india has confirmed that the courier has booked in wrong mode from transglobal and if they have booked it correctly , these charges could have been avoided .
Package_Service	to report this instance , i have tried to contact transglobal customer_service , no body was ready to even to answer me .
Package_Service	due to transglobal negligence , i have to pay heavy amount and they don ' t bother to listen my concern ....
Package_Service	sammie_taylor
Package_Service	excellent service provided by sammie_taylor the best overall
Package_Service	perfect
Package_Service	it works well .
Package_Service	hassle_free web interface with plenty of options .
Package_Service	would definitely use again .
Package_Service	very helpful and polite representatives , namely rosie .
Package_Service	informative and kind in resolving an issue with a courier collection .
Package_Service	best regards ,
Package_Service	c j
Package_Service	was online in seconds to help and sorted my problem out instantly , was no hassle to cancel my collection and request a refund ,
Package_Service	very impressed
Package_Service	we regularly order electrical_items and electronic components from preston , lancashire , and have done for over 0 years .
Package_Service	their service was mediocre up to about 0 years_ago but now we receive our orders within 0 days .
Package_Service	one order placed in december_0000 took ups less_than 00_hours from collection to delivery to our door ( and we live in the mountains in southern spain ).
Package_Service	our " local " ups depot is nearly 000_miles_away in guarromán , in a neighbouring province but the drivers are always friendly and cheerful .
Package_Service	in contrast , another courier service has been unable to deliver a christmas order placed on 0th_december - a month_ago - with no information available from either the supplier or courier .

Package_Service	quick , fast , easy help sarah_hayes
Package_Service	apparently they can ' t guarantee the day packages are collected , even if you pay for next_day delivery .
Package_Service	no refund given due to when it eventually being collected ( no reason given why it wasn ' t ) it was then delivered next_day .
Package_Service	this is the same for all deliveries !
Package_Service	avoid like the plague and will never ever recommend or use them again !
Package_Service	i had to re - schedule a collection date for a parcel and the support offered by the chat operator ( lauren_w ) was really helpful .
Package_Service	very pleased of the service provided !
Package_Service	great customer_service from jenny b this morning .
Package_Service	many_thanks .
Package_Service	my experience with parcel 0 go was extremely good !
Package_Service	people often forget that parcel 0 go are there to cut out the middle_man when arranging collections !
Package_Service	any_problems i have had are never down to parcel 0 go but certain delivery companies !
Package_Service	thankfully p0g were there to save the day , offering free upgrades of service and 000_%_off code for my next order !
Package_Service	even_though my problem was not any fault of p0g but of the company i chose for delivery !
Package_Service	they always go out of the way to make_sure things get sorted out .
Package_Service	most recently " kate " from p0g has been an_absolute star and fixed every issue i have had !
Package_Service	again remember , when collections fail and deliverys are not on time parcel 0 go are not the ones in the wrong !
Package_Service	they arrange everything for you at great prices and the rest is down to the delivery / collection company !
Package_Service	e . g
Package_Service	if you arranged a collection straight from the yodel website and anything goes wrongthen you have to call them , possibly struggle and re - arrange everything !
Package_Service	not with p0g they go out of their way and sort all of this for you !
Package_Service	they are really worth using !
Package_Service	join their facebook_page and get discount_codes ( posted often )
Package_Service	i have used p0g for a couple of years and only had 0 problems ( both problems with the delivery company not p0g ) alll fixed and everyone is happy .
Package_Service	i reccommend - tnt - citylink as the most reliable .
Package_Service	niether have missed a collection even at this busy time of the year .
Package_Service	excellent sevice all around reguardless of any issue !
Package_Service	also on the fb_page p0g do lots of cool giveaways such as ipads and kindles !
Package_Service	plus loads more cool stuff !
Package_Service	so keep your eyes peeled !
Package_Service	0_stars from me !
Package_Service	keep up the great work !
Package_Service	ken bevis
Package_Service	we have found that p0g have been brilliant towards us and any_problems or issues we may have are dealt_with very quickly and i believe this is down to the excellent customer_service we receive from natalie lafferty .
Package_Service	we send all our small parcels through p0g because of the service and do not intend on using any other company in the future and again this is down to the customer_service we receive from natalie lafferty who deals with all our questions and problems we may have very quickly .
Package_Service	i recommend any company to use this company as there is not a single bad_word i can say about them or natalie .
Package_Service	i have never used a courier before and catherine was extremely_helpful she processed everything through via chat .
Package_Service	it was quick simple and easy , she answered all my questions in great detail and covered all the information that i required .
Package_Service	thanks catherine for the excellent and friendly customer_service that you provided !
Package_Service	even with the simple and easy questions i asked you remained professional and were knowledgeable about the services that you could provide .
Package_Service	you are a asset to you company !
Package_Service	used interparcel a few_times and no_quibbles .
Package_Service	easy to use system and a good range of prices .
Package_Service	good service very helpful staff ( i spoke to danielle ) she sorted all my problems out .
Package_Service	of all the internet based parcel websites collect my parcel is the easiest to use and has the best customer_service , any_problems have always been sorted quickly and there ' s no_hidden_fees .
Package_Service	parcel0go may be a bit cheaper but overall i would rather spend a few more pounds and use collectmyparcel anyday , its a far more personal service with quality to match .
Package_Service	used this company to deliver some parcels for both personal and work purposes .
Package_Service	the work ones were documents which needed to be with another party within 00_hours from london to luxembourg .
Package_Service	the website was easy to use with clear descriptions as to what services i was purchasing and what the time frames of delivery would be .
Package_Service	the package was picked_up and delivered with the minimum of fuss and got there in plenty of time .
Package_Service	as a result , i used them to deliver presents to malta and again found the service easy to use , transparent and clear pricing , secure_payments and trusted .
Package_Service	the 0nd address was difficult to locate and when the delivery driver had problems , they were straight on the phone to me to make_sure i know what was happening to the package at all stages and passed messages to couriers promptly and to me to let me know how things were progressing .
Package_Service	overall , a 0 star service and one i wouldn ' t hesitate to use again .
Package_Service	more cost_effective in some_cases than the royal_mail .
Package_Service	my parcel hadn ' t been picked_up so i used the live_chat system and spoke to emma .
Package_Service	within about 0 minutes , she informed me of the closest drop_off point and sent me a new label to use .
Package_Service	highly_recommended , big thanks :)
Package_Service	after a lot of panic , the online_chat saved the day with an urgent parcel collection that failed twice before hand !
Package_Service	thanks richard , very helpful guy :)
Package_Service	jonathan
Package_Service	this company is great - most of the time . courier failed to show up on friday so i contacted them with live help and gemma was very helpful and re - booked it for monday .
Package_Service	just a thanks fro sammie_taylor for great service and communication
Package_Service	sammie was very helpful and very polite
Package_Service	all my questions and probs got solved and left a very happy customer
Package_Service	amazing service and will recommend to a friend
Package_Service	rude very very rude delivery driver
Package_Service	enough said .
Package_Service	i plan to avoid them
Package_Service	solved my problem in 0 minutes !
Package_Service	wonderful !
Package_Service	i was really supriesed how fast sammie resolve my problem .
Package_Service	he was very helpful .
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	i ' m new to this , but sending my parcel was made so much_easier by chatting with customer_service , although it was extremely busy elizabeth did all the hard work , she put me in the right_direction and reassured me that the service i was getting was the quickest and cheapest which in todays market is what everyone wants .
Package_Service	i would definitely deal with them again .
Package_Service	he is quick and very helpful , solved my problem with no stress .
Package_Service	very good customer_service .
Package_Service	i enjoyed my chat with katie .
Package_Service	she was efficient and dealt_with my query in a very proffessional manner .
Package_Service	i achieved my end objective , that is why i have rewarded her with a 0 star .
Package_Service	matthew was very helpful gave quick responses and sorted my issue straight_away very helpful and will_definitely be using this service in future .
Package_Service	i have had too many issues with them over a few different parcels , with some getting lost and some being damaged in transit .
Package_Service	i had got insurance out on all the parcels which was pointless as they seem to find a way to say they weren ' t covered , only paying a small amount back in a ' good will gesture '.
Package_Service	they also give less compensation should you choose to be paid back rather_than choose to opt for their prepay credits , with the claims process taking a long time and then even longer before the money reaches your account .
Package_Service	customer_service on the web chat is useless , with them refusing to provide a number to actually call someone or even provide an_email address .
Package_Service	will not be using anymore .
Package_Service	i have used p0d quite a few_times , for parcels and pallets and they have always been reliable and provided a quick service .
Package_Service	best for larger and heavier items as their prices aren ' t that competitive for smaller items .
Package_Service	i had one issue with a pallet were it was not showing up on tracking and spoke to a member of their customer_service who was very helpful and sorted it out with the courier and even called back letting me know it was sorted !
Package_Service	very happy with their service and will be using again .
Package_Service	terrible service when i hit an issue with a damaged item - won ’ t be using interparcel again .
Package_Service	the process involved with my order was as follows ;
Package_Service	0 - item collected
Package_Service	0 - item lost / delayed for two_weeks by ups
Package_Service	0 - my customer refunded ( interparcel could learn from my excellent customer sevice )
Package_Service	0 - item then found and delivered to buyer , damaged
Package_Service	0 - queried with interparcel , they provided a mere signature and no apology
Package_Service	0 - claimed for damage , told i can ' t claim because i ' ve send a ' restricted item ' ( computer monitor ).
Package_Service	funny that , given the item arrived with us via ups in the first place .
Package_Service	i ' ve been an interparcel customer for 0 years now and won ' t be any longer .
Package_Service	terrible business sense to frustrate a long - time customer over a technicality .
Package_Service	please , please take my advice and use a reliable , trustworthy courier who won ' t waste your time , effort and money .
Package_Service	missing parcel tracked down quickly by [_name ] in customer_service , excellent , thanks .
Package_Service	i placed an order but inpuuted the completely wrong_address .
Package_Service	i spoke to emily on the live_chat who straight_away found the parcel in question changed the address and then resent me the new documentation to the desired email address .
Package_Service	all in all a very good customer_service would use time and time again .
Package_Service	thanks parcel0go . com
Package_Service	found it easy to set_up a collection to post an ebay item !
Package_Service	the prices were very reasonable & didn ' t even have to leave the house !
Package_Service	item collected around 0 :_00pm so perfect time for me !
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	parcel 0 go are worth using .
Package_Service	my experiences have always been positive .
Package_Service	the live_chat was very useful in helping me with a problem i had .
Package_Service	emma dealt_with the issue instantly .
Package_Service	i am very happy all_round .
Package_Service	this is the first time i have used a courier service and it deffinatly will not be my last .
Package_Service	parcel0go assisted with my queries and helped_me throughout my order process , especially as my parcel was larger than the average specifications .
Package_Service	the advisers on the livechat were called sarah - who helped with the larger parcel surcharge .
Package_Service	and daniel - who helped_me understand the confusing ' print your paperwork ' section .
Package_Service	i hope to use this courier in the future for other parcels .
Package_Service	brilliant !
Package_Service	a very efficient and quick responce bye sarah_h regarding the shipping queries .
Package_Service	the rates quoted i would say great value for money .
Package_Service	sat in on my day off work waiting for collection of parcel .
Package_Service	collection was expected any time from 0 - 0 on a specified date .
Package_Service	no collection occured , so contact customer_service .
Package_Service	they only come back to me with a reply 0 hours_later , since i was not going to ring the premium number .
Package_Service	when they did get back to me they tell me that delivery was attempted on a black door at 00 :_00am with a knock at the door .
Package_Service	well 0 things ... there was no knock , and i have a red door .
Package_Service	proof that no collection was attempted the filthy liars .
Package_Service	i was told they could re - arrange collection for the next_day , but i was in work the next_day .
Package_Service	i just wasted a whole day off work waiting for nothing !
Package_Service	the only thing they did get right was the refund , which was processed within 0 days .
Package_Service	it might be worth_noting this was for the citylink next_day service , so the majority of blame should be with citylink .
Package_Service	never using them again .
Package_Service	thank_you for a quick response and great advice !
Package_Service	i spend hundreds of pounds with this company to send parcels to my customers .
Package_Service	yes , there are the odd mistake , non - collection etc but these are minor errors .
Package_Service	i had a parcel that was delivered to the wrong customer .
Package_Service	i got in touch , they said they would rearrange collection and deliver to the correct customer .
Package_Service	perfect .
Package_Service	problem sorted .
Package_Service	or so you would think ...
Package_Service	what followed was around 0 chats ( when i managed to find out where it was !
Package_Service	not in ' help ' section where you would expect ) and chatted with various different people who , seem very helpful but in fact , are the complete_opposite .
Package_Service	i explained to the customer that incorrectly received the extra parcel that city_link would be collecting next_day from her workplace .
Package_Service	they didn ' t collect .
Package_Service	( this makes me look like a idiot ).
Package_Service	i contacted them and they apologised that it had for some reason been cancelled and would need to be rebooked ( wouldn ' t tell me why though !
Package_Service	).
Package_Service	i spoke to the supervisor - that person confirmed that it would be collected today ( 0th_march ) - i then get an_email 0 hours_later - to say that the consignment_number had changed again - but again , no explanation as to why ????
Package_Service	i emailed back - no response .
Package_Service	i explain to my customer again , that it will be collected today .
Package_Service	surprise , surprise , it wasn ' t - at this point , i ' m getting a little_bit annoyed .
Package_Service	why is this so difficult ?
Package_Service	i can book a parcel in for collection up to 00pm at night and it will be collected next_day .... for some reason .
Package_Service	it takes them over 0 days of ' rebooking ' for collection until i lose my patience and book it in for recollection myself - at my own cost .
Package_Service	i ' m emailing them with a formal_complaint , with copies of all of my conversations with the various members of staff that lied to me about emails that would be sent , recollections getting booked and generally fobbing me off with excuses .
Package_Service	but no explanations .
Package_Service	parcel0go - please do not respond below with the generic ' let me look_into this for you ' there ' s no need .
Package_Service	i have copies of the chat transcripts and am making a complaint .
Package_Service	*******
Package_Service	since writing this ( foolishly hoping it would be sorted out now ) – the parcel again wasn ’ t collected .
Package_Service	i asked why , i was told that there are many reasons_why parcels may not be colleted ….
Package_Service	care to suggest one ???
Package_Service	‘ sorry we don ’ t have that information ’ ….
Package_Service	haha well how on earth am i supposed to know what the problem is if you don ’ t ??
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	i was offered yet another rebook for collection .
Package_Service	let ’_s see if it gets collected today .
Package_Service	0 working_days so far and counting ….
Package_Service	*****************************************************************************************
Package_Service	*** i moved to start using city_link direct but discovered that parcel0go now run their online booking system .
Package_Service	i ' m being followed_by this awful company .
Package_Service	i came to send a parcel with city_link ( who are now run by parcel0go for online bookings - who i actually moved from because of their terrible customer_service ) i tried to login and found that it wouldn ' t allow me to .
Package_Service	i thought perhaps i ' d forgotten my password - i tried to recover my password but it then said my account had been blocked .
Package_Service	i ' ll let the transcript of my conversation with city_link parcel0go_agent speak for itself below ( name of agent changed )
Package_Service	info : welcome to city - link - clickandsend . com .
Package_Service	someone will be with you shortly
Package_Service	info : you are now chatting with ' parcel0go_agent '
Package_Service	danielle_: hello , my account has been locked - can you tell me why please ?
Package_Service	parcel0go_agent : can i take your email address danielle ?
Package_Service	danielle_: danielle_@ craftproject . co . uk
Package_Service	parcel0go_agent : danielle_@ craftproject . co . uk is not a registered email danielle
Package_Service	danielle_: well i ' ve been booking parcels with it since 0th_april
Package_Service	parcel0go_agent : you do not need to be registered to sender parcels .
Package_Service	danielle_: i had an account where i can view my orders
Package_Service	parcel0go_agent : not under danielle_@ craftproject . co . uk
Package_Service	danielle_: ok well i wouldn ' t just make this up .
Package_Service	danielle_: can you get somebody to ring me because for some reason my account has been blocked .
Package_Service	when i tried to request my password it said my account has been blocked - not that the email address didn ' t exist .
Package_Service	parcel0go_agent : we are online based .
Package_Service	you do not have an account to be blocked danielle
Package_Service	danielle_: so now you ' re telling_me the message that came up saying it was blocked was in my head also ?
Package_Service	parcel0go_agent : ive fixed it for you now .
Package_Service	seems there was an error .
Package_Service	parcel0go_agent : i do apoologise , you should be able to log in fine now .
Package_Service	danielle_: oh
Package_Service	danielle_: so i do have an account ?
Package_Service	parcel0go_agent : yes danielle as above seems there was an error .
Package_Service	i do apologise , you should be able to log in fine now .
Package_Service	is this good customer_service ?
Package_Service	instead of asking me to wait a moment while she looked into it - to just completely dismiss me and say things that contradict what is actually shown on their website !!
Package_Service	the way she spoke to me was absolutely unacceptable .
Package_Service	:) marvelous
Package_Service	my problem had been resolved soon after chatting with william .
Package_Service	he is very kind and patient .
Package_Service	0 star
Package_Service	thank_you to sammie_taylor for your excellent customer_service via the chat window - my delivery issue was resolved - very happy with service .
Package_Service	the only company we use at bwnews to send parcels , you really need to check them out , super_fast , super easy , and a good easy on - line system , most of the services are track - able too .
Package_Service	i was at home both days when according them they tried to deliver , but nobody rang the bell and nobody left the card that they were attempting the delivery .
Package_Service	one word - liars .
Package_Service	tried to contact them , customer_service non existing !
Package_Service	i will better pay some extra money for a reliable courier .
Package_Service	very effective and to the point with answer
Package_Service	my third booking with this company !
Package_Service	they are terrible !
Package_Service	no customer_service !
Package_Service	they do not care about anything except making profits !
Package_Service	it took them 0 days to pick_up my parcel , i had to skip work twice and loose money and they did not care !
Package_Service	the lady had to rebook twice for me as she apparently failed to do so the first few_times .
Package_Service	they said the driver attempted to pick_up the package but i was home all day and no driver came by .
Package_Service	they are liers .
Package_Service	they told me the driver rang here two days in a row when i was home both days to make_sure and heard no one !
Package_Service	i had other deliveries which went with no_problems !
Package_Service	now im on the 0rd day awaiting at home for my package to be collected .
Package_Service	no reliable , not honest and got no customer serice !
Package_Service	worst courier ever
Package_Service	i booked a parcel to go service then realised my printer was out of ink and i couldn ' t print the collection label .
Package_Service	went on the online_chat and spoke to william who had within minutes changed my collection date and address .
Package_Service	very pleased to say another great service received .
Package_Service	brilliant service .
Package_Service	great support too - thanks sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	thx to jenny and richard with explain me whats_going on with my problem about the parcel and problem was solve by short chat :_d
Package_Service	after needing to send a parcel via courier it soon became_clear that this was a lot harder than first anticipated .
Package_Service	all the rules and reg ' s and weight issues etc .
Package_Service	practically all national well_known brands couldn ' t help !
Package_Service	then came along sarah_hayes from parcels0go !
Package_Service	after approx .
Package_Service	0 minute online_chat she had confirmed all of my question , cleared up any worries and above all could actually get my parcel from door to door !!
Package_Service	based on her level of professionalism and her knowledge of the business and products available it made my whole experience a pleasure compared to what i had been through 00_hours prior to this .
Package_Service	a real asset to the company and would be welcome_addition to my staff anytime ...
Package_Service	thanks joe hughes , hughes car sales
Package_Service	emma was lovely and very patient even_though i had a silly mistake she really was brilliant !!
Package_Service	thanks emma !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	brilliant , resolved my issue with ease as i could not put in the customers delivery address without an error , sarah p processed order and even hung on whilst we struggled to log_into paypal .
Package_Service	all sorted .
Package_Service	will be using again , nice work sarah p !
Package_Service	[_name ] helped_me to solve the issue very quickly :)
Package_Service	very good service , good pricing , problem quickly sorted by catherine_corless in customer_service
Package_Service	used interparcel a few_times and always get good service and very fast delivery .
Package_Service	one time i needed to change a delivery address after dispatch , emailed them at 0pm asking if it would be possible to change the delivery address and by 00am the next morning it had arrived at the amended destination .
Package_Service	outstanding service .
Package_Service	after having countless problems with yodel in the past and still using them against my better judgement , they yet again screwed up my collection but as always , i go through parcel0go as they ' re much_easier to deal with than going direct to yodel .
Package_Service	the issue was sorted as quick as is humanly possible by sarah , a very pleasant , professional and friendly lady who was more_than happy to do everything she could to help me sort out the issue by offering alternative collection options at no extra_cost to myself as a customer .
Package_Service	she changed the collector to citylink and managed to get a next_day pickup organised in five_minutes of contacting her .
Package_Service	brilliant service .
Package_Service	was introduced to parcel0go by a friend and have not looked back since .
Package_Service	excellent delivery rates from reputable couriers and excellent customer_service .
Package_Service	no more trips to the post_office for me .
Package_Service	every company needs a sammie_taylor
Package_Service	i spoke with agent sammie_taylor and she was very polite and very helpful and i was happy with the information she gave me .
Package_Service	she and parcel0go have my recommendation .
Package_Service	so easy to use and if there is a problem the on - line chat staff are very helpful and well informed and make it so easy its great
Package_Service	catherine was fantastic and was so pleasant to talk too
Package_Service	i took a day off and waiting for my items to arrive from germany .
Package_Service	i was tracing the parcel live and at 00pm they decided to post that at 0 :_00am i wasnt at home ????
Package_Service	i spent the following three hours trying to speak to someone who could help me until they said " sorry you will have to wait_until tomorrow " .
Package_Service	my front_door was wide open since 0am as i had builders in the flat so where the driver actually left the card beats me ???
Package_Service	cusomer service ?
Package_Service	friendly on the phone but that s all it is , dont expect any help .
Package_Service	will wait again tomorrow .
Package_Service	i had to return 0 motorcycle helmets to from the uk to the us and the company has specifically requested either to use fedex or ups .
Package_Service	quotes directly from either courier was about £_000 -£_000 .
Package_Service	interparcel was £_00 including insuring it up to the value of £_000 .
Package_Service	i booked the fedex economy on the 0st may for next_day collection ( london address ) without reading any reviews about interparcel and after_reading the mixed_reviews i did consider cancelling .
Package_Service	i felt a bit more relieved when a fedex uniformed man collected my parcel and it started tracking straight_away .
Package_Service	obviously , i was dubious until the parcel actually got to the destination as i have read other stories where parcel has been lost en_route or left in the warehouse .
Package_Service	the parcel arrived_safely on 0 may in one piece .
Package_Service	i would use interparcel again and i like also to point out they don ' t do the couriering , so if your goods get damaged or lost its the courier service you have chosen , although interparcel should have the duty to deal with any customer disatisfaction on your behalf .
Package_Service	difficult company to communicate with , contradictory information given when trying to re - arrange delivery .
Package_Service	result was they said that we would have to pay again !
Package_Service	well recommended service and great customer support : 0 )
Package_Service	thanks [_name ]
Package_Service	top customer_service from rob , couldn ' t have asked for better .
Package_Service	friendly , responsive , professional and polite .
Package_Service	rob genuinely went above and beyond the call of duty to sort out a problem i was having regarding a delivery .
Package_Service	the live_chat is a great idea and proved very helpful .
Package_Service	i will recommend this company and will consistently use them from now on .
Package_Service	i was disappointed there was no number to call but the online help chat was great .
Package_Service	sammie helped_me with two problems quickly and was really friendly .
Package_Service	i have been using parcel0go for a few_years now and i am still learning of services they provide .
Package_Service	their excellent live_chat ( thank_you to ashely by the way for helping me change the delivery date ... really_appreciate your help ) is second to none and i cannot understand_why anyone would use royal_mail when you have to go out and take it to the post_office ... book a courier to come to you ... simple ... love it !
Package_Service	top bloke , very banterous while maintaining a professional attitude .
Package_Service	very helpful , he answered all questions i had directly .
Package_Service	his knowledge of star_wars and lord of the rings is pretty good .
Package_Service	his knowledge of brown and sticky items was commendable .
Package_Service	in all seriousness , my questions were answered very well and directly , i had a quite pressing issue and i was thankful i got good answers .
Package_Service	the force was also very strong in him , i could tell that he was one for the dark side .
Package_Service	naturally , i offered to train him , to which he agreed .
Package_Service	with my training , he will become ceo of parcel0go and have his own minions .
Package_Service	maybe he can make the current chairman or whoever the top man is at the moment his darth maul .
Package_Service	although i wouldn ' t wanna be darth maul , he gets sliced in half .
Package_Service	then he gets sliced in half again in the comics .
Package_Service	but he does make a majestic return in the film " insidious ".
Package_Service	anyway , top service , totally recommend , for peace of mind alone .
Package_Service	0 / 0
Package_Service	excellent service good helpful staff and nice price
Package_Service	the website is simple and easy to use , not only to arrange collection and deliveries but also enables you to track the parcels .
Package_Service	life ' s made easier by not having to go the post_office and pay over the odds there .
Package_Service	will_definitely be using again an be recommending their service .
Package_Service	sammie was very helpful and it was a pleasure speaking to someone who knew what they were doing .
Package_Service	i have just been communicating with william from parcel0go on the live_chat help_desk and his service was second to none i would give him 00 out of 00 .
Package_Service	what more can i say ?
Package_Service	simple .
Package_Service	to the point .
Package_Service	fantastic .
Package_Service	extremely_satisfied with the service william provided me .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	i used this company on a recommendation .
Package_Service	the web_page is very clear and there are plenty of options to choose from .
Package_Service	i had to use the on line chat due to my stupidity .
Package_Service	i had to use the online_chat the two guys on there jon and adam sorted the problem out very quickly and saved me a load of stress and problems .
Package_Service	i cant recommend this company enough
Package_Service	jenny has made it less estressful to make_amends to my notice .
Package_Service	very polite and correct service .
Package_Service	this is the third time courierpoint provides an amazing service for me .
Package_Service	as an example of their efficiency , they delivered a bunch of boxes to portugal in 0 days , for £_00 ... other quotes i had ranged from £_000 to £_000 , for the exact_same lot , and most of those other quotes estimated_delivery in about 0 weeks .
Package_Service	fantastic job !
Package_Service	i have used interparcel . com for a number of years now and always found it easy to use , book and track parcels .
Package_Service	before the advent of companies like this , it was almost_impossible for the average individual to use big courier companies without setting business accounts .
Package_Service	it left you having to use the post_office , which is more_expensive , slower and less reliable in my experience .
Package_Service	i was was surprised to find how competitively_priced parcel 0 go is with their offerings and the customer_service was acceptable .
Package_Service	i was referred by a friend to use their service so i decided to give parcel 0 go .... a go which turns_out to be a parcel no go !!
Package_Service	and a nightmare ...!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i paid for a collection service before_christmas 0000 but on the day of the collection where i literally sat around the house the entire day just to find out the driver never came and no effort was made to inform me in that regard .
Package_Service	i went on live_chat to make another collection but in view of possibly another failed collection i figured i initiated to do a drop_off to my nearest collection point .
Package_Service	i had to arrange for a label to be physically mailed to me due to absence of a printer which i then received it late .
Package_Service	check with p0g again and they say it might just be a day late and will arrive the next_day .
Package_Service	i contacted p0g through live_chat where they have all my parcel details to confirm what i had to do after i got my new label attached .
Package_Service	they told me to head to the nearest collection point to deposit my parcel and they will give me receipt for it .
Package_Service	i did exactly that today 0 - 00 - 0000 spending 00mins uphill challenge to get to the shop and the guy at the drop_off point told me he can ' t accept my parcel ...!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	came back disappointed again , contacted p0g live support and the only option they decided to give after all the pain they put you through is pay more for another service or get a refund ...!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	conclusion :
Package_Service	p0g caused me lost time , effort , disappointments from those who are expecting the parcel and it ' s going to be very very late ....!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i used parcel0go for the first time yesterday & the service was excellent .
Package_Service	i then realised that i had not booked a return courier for the same day as i needed the parcel straight back . i phoned parcel0go and was greeted_by [_name ] who went out of her way to help me ( even on her lunch_break ) and managed to organise everything perfectly . i will_definitely use parcel0go again and would ask for [_name ] personally as she went above and beyond to help me .
Package_Service	thank_you very much for making my day much_easier .
Package_Service	my question were answer quickly and with a very friendly_manner .
Package_Service	polite , concise and very helpful !
Package_Service	takes absolutely all the effort out of sending parcels , no_hidden_costs and a simple to use website .
Package_Service	ive used these a couple of times and was pleasantly_surprised about how easy it was to use , thanks .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor was a hero thanks for your help
Package_Service	excellent customer_service , sam & craig on facebook messaging really are excellent & even come back to you to check everything is ok & you are happy !
Package_Service	would recommend to all .
Package_Service	i messaged parcel0go on facebook regarding an enquiry that i had and received a response from sam almost_immediately who was very helpful and polite .
Package_Service	it ' s nice to know that you can get a swift response from a real_person , rather_than having to be on hold on the phone forever like many other_companies i have had experience with in the past
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	i have been awaiting a parcel and have found the online tracking_system very vague .
Package_Service	i discovered that whilst in transit , my parcel had been labeled with the wrong_address and found the website very one sided .
Package_Service	it seemed more orientated round the sender , parcel0go ' s customer , rather_than the person recieving the parcel , the third person in the transaction .
Package_Service	however , i felt very reassured after_speaking to rose via the online_chat helpline .
Package_Service	friendly , helpful , efficient , human ( as in got realistic , human answers ).
Package_Service	thank_you rose .
Package_Service	i had an issue with my password and catherine was so helpful with helping me to retrieve this .
Package_Service	catherine went further than_expected by waiting for me to try and log_into my account and ensure this was working correctly .
Package_Service	if i have any_issues in the future i hope the agent will be as helpful :)
Package_Service	i had a problem with the label i had printed , the weight was incorrect , having printed the label i realised it was more_than what i had initially entered on the details , i spoke to samantha using the live_chat and the problem was corrected at no additional_costs .
Package_Service	very pleased with the service and i will_continue to use many more times !
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	i would like to write how efficient is this cheap company which shows you prices of all the cheapest company .
Package_Service	you can easily choose what is the best one for you and quickly book at the same time ! i ' ve spent just 00pound for 00kg ! i chose a simple delivery without any kind of priority service .. but i received my parcel ( in the country where i just moved ) two days after !
Package_Service	inside the box there was my laptop and other fragile items but all of them were ok !
Package_Service	no broken item .. basically , everything was perfect , even the collection of my parcel ! lovely ! i really recommend it to all my friends !
Package_Service	thanks to everyone and to peter chandler as well for all the job_done !
Package_Service	my ca katie , was brilliant and very helpful resolving my issues .
Package_Service	i always try to use live_chat option on parcel0go website .
Package_Service	all my questions and problems are being dealt_with fast and without hassle .
Package_Service	natalie - customer_service was great helping to sort our payment problem .
Package_Service	if they could offer discount for account holders - would be even better !
Package_Service	wanted to send multiple parcels , wasn ' t sure how so used the live_chat .
Package_Service	lauren_w was so helpful and i managed to do it fuss - free !
Package_Service	great , cheap service and so easy .
Package_Service	i spoke to samantha who was really kind and helpfull , and i really feel pece of mind now regarding my parcel and the postage conditions .
Package_Service	it turned_out it will be cheeper that i thought and that i could pack it the way i want and that everything will be fine so it really made my day .
Package_Service	also i was answered immediately so there was no wait and by the real_person unlike with barclays or o0 where you have to talk to a robot .
Package_Service	thank_you samantha and all the best for you !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	and well_done parcel0go for a brilliant service as usual !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i had a problem sorting a delivery out for a saterday so i went online help and had a very nice lady_called emily she was a great help sorted everything out for me very nice person she is great for that company a0 *****
Package_Service	catherine was a big help she helped_me to save money .
Package_Service	she is polite and assisted me through the complete process she was amazing she deserves a medal hope to talk again
Package_Service	i use parcel0go most of the time and find the service great and so easy .... ,
Package_Service	sarah p checked and told me i could still get a collection sorted for today , my order was processed with her help and made it so easy for me to get my collection sorted for today ...
Package_Service	world class thank_you parcel0go and sarah p
Package_Service	i was rather pleased with the service provided almost_immediately after i had made the booking i got a call that sorted out any_issues i had within_seconds and the pickup was fast and friendly =) aswell as i contacted the support staff because i was worried_about if nobody was there to recive the parcel and within 00 seconds i was connected to louise =) louise was a really nice person and fixed my worry within_seconds and to be honest i kind of wanted to keep talking because of how friendly louise was i am definately please with parcel0go and if i ever need to send more stuff im choosing parcel0go again =)
Package_Service	[_name ] gave me a really good customer_service expirience .
Package_Service	i hope the delivery is as good and smooth as their customer_service .
Package_Service	i called them to pick_up item for return , and after 0 hours driver pick it up .
Package_Service	exellent service .
Package_Service	great communication .
Package_Service	quick respond .
Package_Service	i booked a collection for next_day but after i had booked and paid for this i realised the small_print was that it would be delivered within 0 - 0 working_days .
Package_Service	i chatted to lizzie online and within 0 minutes she had rebooked my order and emailed through my new parcel label and confirmation .
Package_Service	this was a really efficient , quick resolution and i really_appreciated that there was a ' real ' person on hand to help with my issue !
Package_Service	thanks lizzie
Package_Service	spoke to daniel on live_chat , very helpful and sorted my order .
Package_Service	0 * customer_service :)
Package_Service	out of a handful pf parcels sent through parcel0go , one has gone_missing , one has been damaged , and another one was collected ( along with other items ) but then reported as not collected .
Package_Service	whilst they use courier companies parcel0go seem to have no control over their suppliers , and when they try to resolve an issue with a courier company that they use , the courier company often ignores them .
Package_Service	several_attempts have been made to resolve the issues , but as yet , they are still outstanding .
Package_Service	i now have two claims against parcel0go out of a total of 0 package sent .
Package_Service	please do not use this company .
Package_Service	they have no interest other than their own , and they do little to resolve problems , have no control over their supply base and are generally obstructive when a problem occurs .
Package_Service	they will not allow you to speak to a senior representative within the company , or a supervisor , and any attempt to do this is blocked and the usual excuse is " sorry , supervisor is not available right now ".
Package_Service	the other really good excuse , is that they will tell you that it takes 00_hours to respond ; if this was true i would have been happy , but unfortunately it is not .
Package_Service	there are many bad_reviews of parcel0go on the internet ( not just this site ) and overall most people have had bad_experiences .
Package_Service	it really is time the small company and individual trader stood up for themselves against these larger organisations who in honesty do not care for the services they provide to you , just the money you pay them .
Package_Service	please email me your experiences of this organisation to duncan @ dabcomputers . co . uk as i am building up a substantial_amount of evidence against them .
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go from the very first year they started trading and yes every company has its ups and downs with regards to products and services however they always seem to be helpful and efficient at what they have done .
Package_Service	i ' ve never had an issue with the staff at parcel0go whether it be a delivery or a collection .
Package_Service	i ' ve sent parcels worldwide , australia , america , hong_kong , uk mainland and ireland and there ' s a vast quantity i have received never have they arrived damaged or soiled .
Package_Service	in instances where parcel0go have missed a collection they have always been favourable and offered a free recollection , credit to the account or a guarantee within a few hours that the parcels will be collected .
Package_Service	there are many rival companies offering similar services whereby they act as a reseller to major parcel companies however i see no others offering the dedicated support that parcel0go offer through both social_media such as facebook and twitter and on their actual website .
Package_Service	many online_chat facilities are automated think of the biggest names bt , virgin , three mobile - all used automated online_chat whereas parcel0go who are a lot smaller but still handling a incredible number of transactions per day use one to one agent to client online_chat facilities .
Package_Service	its also worth liking the facebook_page and following on twitter where you will often save values between 0 % - 00_%_off your parcel orders .
Package_Service	the web is a big place and parcel0go are one company who deserve much credit for being there :)
Package_Service	thank_you to sammie_taylor for quickly sorting_out my collection problem with no_fuss .
Package_Service	was helped out by [_name ] who helped_me out with a little concern i had , she dealt_with it real professionally , just wish every company had people like [_name ] working for them but not all company ' s are as lucky as parcelstogo .
Package_Service	i run a small business and i always use parcel 0 go to book a courier .
Package_Service	it is by_far the easiest website to navigate and i like that it shows a range of prices on one page , making it easy for me to use .
Package_Service	i really like the live web chat too , i ' ve used it a couple of times when i ' ve been unsure of something .
Package_Service	today i used it as i had trouble with the ' find address ' section and a very helpful adviser called katie helped_me to sort it out within minutes .
Package_Service	excellent service , thank_you !
Package_Service	the live_chat_function was really helpful , was passed on to stephanie .
Package_Service	very polite , patient and helpful and sorted out my problem .
Package_Service	so all ' s good .
Package_Service	late by 0 week ( they lost it ) and they wouldn ' t refund or compensate because it was delivered !
Package_Service	steer_clear !
Package_Service	they would not refund my order which they lost and took over a week to arrive in the netherlands but offered a credit on my account of £ 0 against a £_00 courier cost !
Package_Service	customer_service is shocking and massively unhelpful .
Package_Service	go to [_external reference_] direct and get a quote directly !
Package_Service	i did after and it was much cheaper but alas too_late !
Package_Service	finally a website that is simple & user - friendly !
Package_Service	quick & straight - forward booking page with great rates every time .
Package_Service	what more can you ask for ?
Package_Service	i ' m a fairly new customer to myparceldelivery . com and everytime it has been a stress_free experience .
Package_Service	i was introduced by my boyfriend who used to post my ebay parcels out for me but now thanks to this great , easy website i will be posting all of my parcel myself with them so thank_you !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i was a little unsure on the best way of getting my package to india or even how the address worked !
Package_Service	catherine helped_me through the process filling in all the forms for me .
Package_Service	very helpful and even explained why you can ' t send steering wheels by courier .
Package_Service	definately_recommend
Package_Service	thanks catherine
Package_Service	im not normally the complaining type and have never written a complaint before but i feel ripped_off by interparcel .
Package_Service	i have used interparcel alot in the past and if things go well they are fine but recently i have decided to stop using them i urge you to reconsider using them .
Package_Service	i had a parcel delivered after an ebay sale .
Package_Service	i used tnt through interparcel .
Package_Service	0 week_later an ebay case opened as the parcel has not turned_up .
Package_Service	later i find that tnt have attempted delivery 0 times and the parcel is on the way back to me .
Package_Service	i called interparcel on their 00p minute help line and someone said the parcel had not left and so would be held at my customers local_depot for him to collect .
Package_Service	the next_day the parcel arrives back to me and i have my customer not very happy on the phone saying he went to the depot and obviously it was not there .
Package_Service	he also said he had been in on 0 of the delivery dates all day and non one came .
Package_Service	tnt have never left a calling_card on their claimed 0 delivery attempts so me and my customer have never been made aware .
Package_Service	i called interparcel as they are the middle_man who i have paid to get this delivered .
Package_Service	they told me that the tnt driver said he left calling notes which is simply not true but they took his word for it .
Package_Service	( in the past tnt have faked signatures for people who were not in and the parcel has turned_up somewhere_else so i know they can be dishonest and some drivers will cheat the system ) i know its not interparcel ' s fault that tnt were shoddy but then what am i paying them for ?
Package_Service	they took my money did nothing to help me apart_from tell me tnt had made 0 delivery attempts after i asked what was going on .
Package_Service	they took tnt ' s word over my customers and mine basically saying i am lying .
Package_Service	they failed to keep the parcel at depot despite saying that it would be fine on the phone .
Package_Service	the last thing they said to me was i have to pay for another delivery and that was final .
Package_Service	i am fed_up with companies passing the buck .
Package_Service	i am having to pay for tnt not providing a proper service by not leaving calling_cards .
Package_Service	interparcel showed no sympathy apart_from saying ' i understand ' which means the opposite and would not cover the cost to sort this out .
Package_Service	i have sent many parcels and received many parcels from ups and am very impressed with their service .
Package_Service	i use a range of couriers depending_on the situation , i have also received parcels from many different couriers and i have to say these seem the most professional of all that i have used .
Package_Service	i have always sent parcels through an intermediate website so i have never dealt_with their customer_service or that side of things .
Package_Service	i am quite surprised to see bad_reviews of this company , i have used these a lot and have only good things to say about these .
Package_Service	i have looked at other_companies which offer this intermediate service between customer and a range of couriers and their prices seem to be cheap .
Package_Service	i find it a great way to find the best delivery service to use , particularly if i have to send overseas .
Package_Service	the website is easy and straight_forward to use .
Package_Service	customer_service is quite good , not amazing but they get there .
Package_Service	i tried tnt and fedex for an import - but they assume you ' re trying to send a package – and not a package you want to import ( even if you try their import options ).
Package_Service	the tnt / fedex couriers kept arriving at the reception of the ny office and demanding paper - work .
Package_Service	i got fed_up of fedex and tnt - p0d was a great relief ( even_though they broker tnt / fedex services ).
Package_Service	simple - enter the ' from ' address .
Package_Service	enter the ' to ' address and then the details of the package .
Package_Service	pay for it and it works .
Package_Service	great stuff ( and a bit cheaper_than tnt at the same time :-) si
Package_Service	made my problem much_easier to deal with i wouldnt normally_write a reveiw but she did help me emensley thanks
Package_Service	sammie has helped with my inquiry very quickly
Package_Service	just been chatting with rose from parcel0go who was amazing help and answered all my queries swiftly , will get my shipment ready for them to collect soon : )
Package_Service	i was greeted_by a lady_called emma and she was really helpful in helping me to not only re - book my delivery order but also settle me a new delivery that would work out better and faster_than the one i originally order that was causing problems .
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	have been using this site for a few_years now , no_problems and dead easy to use .
Package_Service	have recommended to many people .
Package_Service	catherine was very helpful indeed
Package_Service	thank_you for the help emma !
Package_Service	very quick respond and very helpful !
Package_Service	quick , efficient and very helpful
Package_Service	the lady , catherine , that helped my grandad out today was very helpful and patient considering he ' s not too good with technology .
Package_Service	i was very pleased with the service and would recommend to all friends , family and anyone reading this .
Package_Service	the website is really good for sending parcels safely & cheaply but upon not being_able to print my labels - printer packed up - i had help from [_name ] on the live_chat help & she couldn ' t have been more helpful !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	brilliant service .
Package_Service	hi
Package_Service	had an issue with a parcel where i had booked it incorrectly - operator [_name ] changed the details , sent out the paperwork and sorted it all out - thanks [_name ]
Package_Service	emma was helpful
Package_Service	had a wonderful online_chat support from sammie_taylor who helped_me find the prices and navigate through the quotes on the parceltogo website .
Package_Service	very patient and i quickly got the info i was looking for .
Package_Service	sammie made my monday and happy one !
Package_Service	lots of gold stars for sammie please !
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	delivered quickly and without any damage , a very reliable courier service .
Package_Service	customer support also very helpful and replied quickly to the few queries i had about the item i wanted to send .
Package_Service	very highly_recommended .
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	very easy and fast to place an order .
Package_Service	the tracking facilities are great and everything works as you would hope ( as apposed to [_external reference ]) had some problems with the initial pick_up , used live_chat and spoke to someone called [_name ], who was very helpful indeed and we managed to resolve the problems
Package_Service	will be recommending this service to everyone i know !
Package_Service	hi i was very happy with her job .
Package_Service	very good service , alot of help , very good :)
Package_Service	just been speaking to katie at parcel0go . com !
Package_Service	she was very good and answered all my questions and even spent time talking with me while i sat here twiddling my thumbs waiting for the google_checkout email to come through !
Package_Service	over an_hour and still no email !
Package_Service	my advice don ' t use google_checkout if you are in a rush !
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go on many occasions .
Package_Service	the main thing that attracted me to the site in the first place was that i didn ' t have to go through all the hassle of registering before getting a quote .
Package_Service	even after shopping around they usually can ' t be_beaten on price , or the shear amount of different options you are given when posting .
Package_Service	there is a postal service suitable for everyone !
Package_Service	i ' ve never had any_problems , not even little hiccups .
Package_Service	there staff are extremely_helpful and they have adopted facebook as a way of contact which works fantastic , with a response being sent back within minutes !
Package_Service	with the added_bonus of regular competitions to win pre_- pay into your account .
Package_Service	i must give a big thank_you to ' kate ' and ' sam ' the facebook dream team who helped_me set_up an account to put my pre_- pay into - the hidden gems of parcel0go !
Package_Service	what more could you ask for ?
Package_Service	0 star !
Package_Service	keep up the good work parcel0go !
Package_Service	have to go , just sending a parcel ;)
Package_Service	i ' d definitely_recommend sarah_hayes as a front line person to assist customers .
Package_Service	this morning she was speedy , accurate and most efficient in dealing_with my tracking query .
Package_Service	truly well_done .
Package_Service	this service is greatly under rated .
Package_Service	i will_definitely keep using it for both delivery and receiving packages .
Package_Service	fantastic customer_service from sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	thank_you :)
Package_Service	sammie_taylor was really helpful , took details of my problem and took me step by step through booking my parcel .
Package_Service	felt_like talking to a real_person for a change rather_than just another call_centre drone following a script .
Package_Service	attentive and quick to respond to my queries .
Package_Service	i have sent 00 + parcels via the service over several months and rarely have a problem .
Package_Service	on the 0 occasions i have the customer_service has been great and they are quick to deal with my problem .
Package_Service	contacting them via_twitter i ' ve had almost instant responses from sam or kate and also received great service on the website ' s direct messenger .
Package_Service	the website can sometimes be a bit " rough around the edges " but the people you deal with seem know what they are going and get things sorted .
Package_Service	overall i am very happy with the service and would recommend it , just make_sure to check the t &_c ' s for what is covered for compensation .
Package_Service	andrew .
Package_Service	had an issue with a collection postcode , needed this urgently resolving , i communicated my concerns with a very helpful lady ( sarah_hayes ) who resolved the situation straight_away .
Package_Service	couldn ' t be_happier with the service , thanks sarah !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i had a problem that needed solving and emma from customer_services helped_me straight_away .
Package_Service	very helpful .
Package_Service	i would defo_recommend :)
Package_Service	spoke to lizzue .
Package_Service	super_fast response through online_chat .
Package_Service	no call needed .
Package_Service	higher recommended .
Package_Service	brian and michelle the live_chat customer_service were so helpful >
Package_Service	i created a shipment with interparcel on the 00th_march_0000 .
Package_Service	the shipment was booked with fedex and all details were provided .
Package_Service	the parcel was to be delivered in jaipur , india .
Package_Service	it is now the 00th_may 0000 and the parcel is apparently stuck in india customs .
Package_Service	i have requested the parcel back , paid £_00 . 00 .
Package_Service	they took my money but still_haven ' t done anything to resolve this .
Package_Service	i have been passed around from one advisor to another to another to a supervisor to another .... you get my gist .
Package_Service	everytime i call they keep on fobbing me of saying they are waiting for fedex to reply .
Package_Service	i find that very hard to believe as fedex are usually very good at replying to requests .
Package_Service	we have a domestic account with them and have dealt_with them for international delivery several_times with no issues .
Package_Service	interparcel have not done anything to try and resolve this for me making me very frustrated and helpless .
Package_Service	the parcel contain very important and expensive items but they don ' t seem to care about that .
Package_Service	the advisors don ' t seem to have a clue , no customer_service skills and no motivation to help customers who are experiencing issues .
Package_Service	interparcel i want my package to be returned to me asap !
Package_Service	transglobal is so simple to book through and consistently provide a great service .
Package_Service	i use them pretty_much every day .
Package_Service	my only ever issues are usually with the carrier companies themselves , who seem to have a tape measure designed by a man , ( where there ' s three inches to every one inch ) and once in a blue moon manage to re measure my parcel at twice the size resulting in my getting another invoice for twice the cost of the initial shipment , however , such issues are normally resolved very quickly through transglobal , and all is ok again :)
Package_Service	[_name ] was very helpful
Package_Service	sorted problem straight_away
Package_Service	would be pleasure to deal with her once again !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i have spent over 000_pounds with these_guys , makes it easier then trailing around to different couriers to find the best price .
Package_Service	*****
Package_Service	update 00 / 00 /_0000 :
Package_Service	pre_- pay credit & apology received from parcel0go , i have updated my rating to reflect this .
Package_Service	original review :
Package_Service	very disappointed .
Package_Service	courier failed to turn_up for a collection two days in a row .
Package_Service	both_times no reason given by the online_chat representative when i queried it .
Package_Service	when i rebooked collection for the second attempt , i asked for the courier to be given my mobile number in case of any_problems .
Package_Service	i received no contact or an_apology when i queried this second failure .
Package_Service	the online_chat service is slow and they are very abrupt when dealing_with you .
Package_Service	i asked for a simple explanation why the courier had not shown up and they could not provide one , they just kept asking me to rebook my collection - pretty pointless .
Package_Service	won ' t be using again .
Package_Service	i was placing and order today i didn ' t know what to do but catherine helped_me through the order she helped_me out her skills are amazing she deserves a medal
Package_Service	even_though i had difficulty using this service at first but with assistance from your staff [_name ] via live_chat , i feel it much_easier :))
Package_Service	i need to get some help tracking a parcel sent yesterday and was updated with its location ( delivered ) immediately by daniel who replied in a hwlpful friendly_manner .
Package_Service	keep up the good work p0g .
Package_Service	thank_you .
Package_Service	had ran_into a few problems even_though using the service for many many_times and daniel helped_me out greatly went above and beyond expectations to find solutions that i would have never have even thought of ... thanks buddy ... its because people like this tha i always return to p0g :)
Package_Service	i had an issue and within minutes [_name ] sorted out my problem and was very happy to do so !
Package_Service	that doesn ' t happen very often now adays and to be fair its 00 . 00pm at night so can ' t ask more_than that !
Package_Service	parcel0go have always been effeciant and are far better_than any other service on the market to date !
Package_Service	00 out of 00 and 00 out of 00 for [_name ] ; o )
Package_Service	sent a parcel with a 00 hour delivery service , a month later i find out the parcel has not only not been delivered but has been lost .
Package_Service	i am highly suspicious that anything over £_00 without insurance is being taken and sold by the company .
Package_Service	never use this company there is a reason_why there are so many bad_reviews .
Package_Service	alexandra was very helpful and friendly !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i used interparcel a few_times in the last years and i wasn ` t dissapointed even once .
Package_Service	they have the best prices on the market for international delivery what i used from them .
Package_Service	checked the price on fedex , dhl websites and they were at_least 00 - 00 quid more_expensive than interparcel .
Package_Service	thank_you guys and keep up the good work .
Package_Service	i recently had a parcel that was delivered via parcel0go website arrive damaged .
Package_Service	when contacting their customer_service department on the live_chat feature i explained what had happened and [_name ], a friendly customer_service representative dealt_with my problem straight_away .
Package_Service	i was compensated for the damaged item and cost of delivery and all this was sorted in under 00_minutes !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i don ' t think i have ever_experienced such speedy service sorting_out a problem before !
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	i must_say that i had a bit of trouble with them at the beginning so i contacted their custmer service .
Package_Service	from that point everything run smoothly , they rearange the pick_up and made sure that everything was ok with my parcel caring for all the details .
Package_Service	i would definetely recommend parcelhero to anyone !
Package_Service	parcel to go is great !
Package_Service	makes everything easier .
Package_Service	a little chat with rick soon sorted my need for a " note to driver ".
Package_Service	thanks :-)
Package_Service	i ' ve used transglobal express for my business and personally and they ' ve never let me down .
Package_Service	great service and easy to use at such a great price .
Package_Service	definitely_recommend them to anyone
Package_Service	lauren_w is so friendly and helpful super star
Package_Service	richard_mileham was a great help and amended by booking straight_away
Package_Service	i booked a collection through interparcel .
Package_Service	we are a business so the office was manned throughout the day , cctv will confirm this .
Package_Service	no courier arrived by 0pm .
Package_Service	we were told on the live_chat to allow up until 0 . 00pm as we are a business .
Package_Service	0pm arrived and still no sign of any courier so onto live_chat again as we were about to leave the office for the weekend .
Package_Service	i asked about the lack of pick_up and was told the courier had been at 0pm .
Package_Service	now bear in mind that we are an office , we contacted them at 0pm and hadn ' t been told this and i have a cctv camera on the front_door i knew this was a blatant lie .
Package_Service	the offer to me was the pick_up could be booked for the saturday when the office was closed , again not good service from interparcel .
Package_Service	i asked for a refund and this is where the service went from terrible to criminal .
Package_Service	i was told my prepay account would be refunded but i couldn ' t have the money from my prepay account until a manager decided i could have it back .
Package_Service	i clarified this with the live_chat operator (?)
Package_Service	with the words i ' ll get my money back when a manager can be bothered , the response .....
Package_Service	yes , it will be some time next week .
Package_Service	so not only now have i let_down two important customers because they will now not get their orders i have my money held in the a prepay account until a manager deems enough time has passed and they will then grace me with a refund .
Package_Service	mistakes_happen and i wasn ' t happy about the missed collection at all but the follow_up service is just terrible , no interaction and no empathy just you don ' t get your money back until we say so .
Package_Service	i ' ll be sticking with [_external links removed_] from now on , if anyone is sending something that is really important i would advise you to do the same .
Package_Service	interparcel has damaged my business and cost me dearly .
Package_Service	it took less_than 0 minutes , what else we could want ???
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	daniel provided excellent service and help to me and guided me through every_step with ease , very good service .
Package_Service	great customer_service , quick and very polite .
Package_Service	thank_you for your help !
Package_Service	after having being advised first time round that my parcel would be collected on a monday ( next_day del ) i was very happy .
Package_Service	it then failed to be collected and when i looked for a contact number for p0g i realised they do not list any phone numbers on their website so , instead had to use their instant live_chat .
Package_Service	this took_forever and the representative was slow and reasonably unhelpful explaining there was no reason for the failure of delivery but he will re - book for thursday .
Package_Service	thursday came and went without any sign of collection .
Package_Service	i then got hopped back onto the live_chat to be told exactly the same reason ... there is no reason for the failure !
Package_Service	they tried to tell me that it would be picked_up on the following_monday ... i refused to accept this and they finally said they could put it on for friday but no guarantee ' s .
Package_Service	its literally a joke how bad they are .
Package_Service	no - one seems to be able to help and they can ' t guarantee anything ... there is a reason they haven ' t got their cust service number on their website , because they would be inundated with angry customers !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	parcel0go is brilliant to ship internationally or locally , they work well to the advertised cut_off times & should modifications to a parcel be needed , they ' re always happy to help .
Package_Service	sam austen especially makes even the most difficult of orders / amendments very easy .
Package_Service	myparceldelivery . com is so easy to use , quick and its comparison site - style is excellent for people who want to save a few £££' s while finding the right service for them .
Package_Service	i had a great experience on this website - much_better_than the others ... and i would highly_recommend myparceldelivery . com and will_definitely be making it my no0 service provider in their field
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	:-_d
Package_Service	jade fox d ., 00 , coventry .
Package_Service	i just had a chat in parcel0go with sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	he was very helpful and polite , and coul answer for my questions .
Package_Service	thanks again !
Package_Service	i spoke to emma at parcels to go with two queries about my parcel collection and she was a great help !
Package_Service	the instant online_chat is extremely useful , particularly if you are in a rush !
Package_Service	well worth the money .
Package_Service	steph is very helpfull on live_chat , well worth having a chat
Package_Service	had a slight_issue with one of my order , probably my own fault to start with .
Package_Service	contact live help and katie of their customer_services was at hand to go through and rectify the issue promptly and very fairly .
Package_Service	an extra bonus for sorting_out issue efficiently even through live help .
Package_Service	everything about this service is great , i can ' t fault it from the choice , the price , the service and the customer_service live_chat .
Package_Service	a five_star service !
Package_Service	i ' ve used this company a few_times now for personal / ebay stuff and now i ' ve recommend to my boss and our company use .
Package_Service	they have been faultless in the information they provide and the ease of use of their website should have their competitors quivering in the shadows .
Package_Service	i have just had to use the live_chat service for the first time and had the pleasure of talking with daniel .
Package_Service	his professionalism and help is another face of a great company .
Package_Service	super impressed and very satisifed .
Package_Service	good service , and very very cheap price
Package_Service	hassle_free to find cheapest and best service and next_day pick_up even when service placed at 0pm and £_00 + cheaper_than rip_off parcel_force recommended by post_office so will always recommend and use again
Package_Service	very helpful , efficient and friendly
Package_Service	very helpful and professional team to help you from step 0 to finish .
Package_Service	sarah from customer_service did a great job in helping me setup my shipment request , and was very efficient and patient in answering my questions .
Package_Service	i ended_up signing_up for an account as i will_definitely use this service for my business .
Package_Service	i was dealt_with by samantha and she was really helpful without any_problems and was clear with instructions .
Package_Service	overall brilliant .
Package_Service	gives me faith to keep using parcels0go
Package_Service	katie was very helpful and sorted my issue out with in minutes , she resolved it and put my mind at ease :) fantastic service !

Package_Service	she solved my problem in a sec ,
Package_Service	many_thanks [_name ]
Package_Service	the instant_messaging feature is perfect , you are talking to a real_person whilst still able to go about your business .
Package_Service	hugo was the agent appointed to my message .
Package_Service	he was very helpful and had changed my collection date within_seconds .
Package_Service	i hope everyone is like him in the future !
Package_Service	:_d
Package_Service	polite from the start and very willing to go the extra yard for you ,, things couldn ' t have gone better ,, made a stressful time ,, less_stressful ,, thank_you sammie_taylor :)
Package_Service	i ' ve just had the chance to speak with representative tom on the live_chat and i have to say he was very , very helpful .
Package_Service	he resolved my query within a matter of minutes and was very polite and very easy to understand .
Package_Service	he has certainly given me the confidence and belief that parcel0go is a brilliant service .
Package_Service	i used the online method to set_up a collection for a parcel and it was very easy to use .
Package_Service	i then provided my query to tom who gave me great answers and helped_me right till the end .
Package_Service	fantastic .
Package_Service	i will certainly be coming_back to use parcel0go service even_though in this instance i cancelled my request ( because circumstances have changed for me personally i . e .
Package_Service	no_longer need to ship the item )
Package_Service	so my story ...... i buy some alloy_wheels from wales .
Package_Service	due to bad_weather and all commitments , i paid parcels 0 go , £_00 to pick_up and deliver my alloy_wheels .
Package_Service	so the order is complete , paid my money for a 0 day service .
Package_Service	( 0 different parcels , with 0 wheels in each ) - not hard to understand that right ?
Package_Service	ok , so its the new year period .... my parcels one day later .... ok , no big issue .... however one parcel arrives .
Package_Service	when my father inlaw collects the parcel , he asks the driver " where the other parcel ?"
Package_Service	driver states “ there ’_s only one ".... father inlaw signs for one parcel ... clearly uniquely marked with parcel0go reference_number " a "
Package_Service	live_chat : i explain myself and what ’_s happened ..... that ’_s i have only received parcel " a " and not " b ".
Package_Service	the operator explains that the parcel has been separated and i should worry as they can locate my parcel via tracking and it clear shows parcel " b " not delivered .
Package_Service	- great news ( only have to wait a few more days ) ****** reminder 0 day service ***********.
Package_Service	few_days go by , nothing arrives .
Package_Service	so live_chat again : this time i get told they have found my parcel and its on its way to me .
Package_Service	- ok , at_least they found it ....
Package_Service	few_days go by : telephone call to p0g - explained myself again and as where my parcel is as they had found it and when will it arrive ........ operator : sorry_sir , we do not know where your parcel is ....... so i ask to speak to a supervisor , operator states i am the supervisor and , there nothing they can do , but email the courier and i get told to wait a few more days !!!!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	few more days_later ... no reply from anyone ..... speak again on web chat : explain myself and the situation , explain how angry i am for doing all the running around ..... anyway ...... states hes a supervisor " peter " - and that the parcel is defiantly lost and that i should open a claim , while they chase the courier company again " yodel ".
Package_Service	so i open the claim , attach all the documents as requested .......( guess i ' m doing all the leg work again ) ...... claim get rejected on the grounds " parcel has been delivered !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	ring up p0g ( now thinking about my telephone bill ) - speak to an adviser - they state ........." sorry , i see what that claim team have done here , they have not investigated it and closed it as you have received parcel " a "!!!
Package_Service	.......... i will reopen the claim as " good will decision " and add a note ...... please can you upload your documents again - seriously ?> ..... anyway i do .
Package_Service	so now its the waiting game again ......... my documents get approved , documents are follows_:
Package_Service	0 .
Package_Service	conversations with adviser ( peter the supervisor ) - proving the parcel is missing
Package_Service	0 .
Package_Service	bank_transfer screenshot , paypal screenshot and ebay advert for wheels ( proving costs )
Package_Service	0 . pictures of wheels , descriptions and valve .
Package_Service	... few_days_later ..... nothing heard . so i ring up again ...... i get told up the adviser , your claim has been accepted and you ' ll have a email with a offer in next 00_minutes .
Package_Service	offer £_00 !!!!
Package_Service	your kidding me !!!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	alloy_wheels - £_000 ( prove provided )
Package_Service	postage - £_00 ( prove provided )
Package_Service	offer £_00 - unacceptable !!!!!

Package_Service	ring up p0g - speak to advisor - i get advised that " if you are not happy with the offer , reject it and the claim team will review the case again and get back to you "
Package_Service	................ offer - rejected by me !
Package_Service	still not happy - webchat p0g again speak to " sarah " - ( guess_what ?
Package_Service	, she a supervisor ) and states ........ sorry , as you have rejected your offered that ' s the end of your claim ?
Package_Service	...... hang on , i was advised too ?
Package_Service	.... sorry_sir , you reject the offer , not us !!!!
Package_Service	......... (" is this customer_service " - get told to reject the offer , then get told , that ’_s the end of the claim ?)

Package_Service	katie is like a star in the night sky , some stars shine brighter than others and this is the case of katie , if she was part of a constellation i would say she would be part of orions belt , because belts provide support .
Package_Service	i hope she gets promoted and a higher pay grade
Package_Service	i booked a parcel in a few_days ago and unfortunately no driver arrived to collect it , i spoke to the superbly helpful samantha who rearranged for my package to be picked_up at the nearest possible time .
Package_Service	i was most pleased with her kind and swift rectification of the situation and eagerly awaited the arrival of my new courier on friday ( the 00th i might_add ) friday arrived and sadly departed without the smallest trace of a courier .
Package_Service	as i was working at the weekend i thought i would contact parcel0go a second time to see if i could find out why my goods had not been collected .
Package_Service	after logging on to my parcel0go © account i proceeded to click my way to the live_chat .
Package_Service	i had received such swift and efficient help in my last hour of need that it seemed like the right and most sensible course of action .
Package_Service	live_chat connected me to lloyd , who frankly should win some sort of medal , award , accolade or honour for his down right heroic customer_service super powers .
Package_Service	after explaining my troubles to him he immediately and magnificently rose to the challenge and booked me a courier for the following_monday with ups , who he said he had dealt_with personally and could vouch for their services .
Package_Service	so as this tale draws to a close , let us all raise a glass to those brave individuals who provide us with such good care .
Package_Service	here ' s to you lloyd and samantha .
Package_Service	you beautiful people , you .
Package_Service	( in all seriousness though , your customer_service is great , thanks very much ) .
Package_Service	i found parcel0go on google_search when i was looking for a delivery from a charity in hertfordshire to my parents ' house , and it was really useful !
Package_Service	they give you a whole list of different services and prices ( kind of like with airline price comparison_sites ), with little labels to tell you which ones you need a printer for and which ones you don ' t ( which was also super handy , seeing as i don ' t have a printer on hand a lot of the time .)
Package_Service	chose the cheapest one which didn ' t need a printer ( not yodel - do not use yodel - but that is another story entirely ) filled in details , paid , and all is well .
Package_Service	isn ' t it ?
Package_Service	no .
Package_Service	of course , me being me , i got the address wrong first time round .
Package_Service	great .
Package_Service	so , i head off back to the delivery site to try and change it , expecting to have to pay fees or - more likely - just be told to go away , tough_luck .
Package_Service	i ended_up on livechat with an agent named ashley , who was beyond lovely and got everything sorted out for me in minutes .
Package_Service	so , now everything ' s sorted , right address , and no extra_charges !
Package_Service	i would highly_recommend this company !
Package_Service	( also , ashley - you ' re the best !)
Package_Service	greeted_by sarah_hayes , friendly and very helpful .
Package_Service	i was stuck proceeding on a section for some reason ( website just kicked up an error with no error code / message which wasn ' t helpful ), so sarah took all my details and filled in the form on my behalf .
Package_Service	success .
Package_Service	great service and great customer_service .
Package_Service	package sent 00th_dec , according to tracking_number online the package was delivered on the 00th to the customer but this was a lie .
Package_Service	the package was sitting in their depot for 0 weeks over christmas and still took another 0 days after it had been found .
Package_Service	by this time my customer requested a full_refund so i asked for the package to be returned to me but once again this company saw fit to deliver my returned package to the wrong_address .
Package_Service	i have asked for a refund but i am not expecting it as these people probably don ' t even know how to do it .
Package_Service	i will never use interparcel again .
Package_Service	her name was [_name ].
Package_Service	helped_me change service to accommodate my requirements .
Package_Service	friendly , efficient service , reason_why i use parcel0go !
Package_Service	keep up the good work !
Package_Service	thanks guys
Package_Service	i ' m looking for a courier service for my business to send about 00 parcels a week and then increase this to around 000 per_month by the end of the year .
Package_Service	i tried the inpost service on p0d .
Package_Service	i sent two e_- mails this week asking for information and i ' ve been completely_ignored , which does not give me any confidence that help would be given if there were issues in the future .
Package_Service	i did a trial run today for the inpost service to deliver a parcel to myself .
Package_Service	the barcode would not scan at the locker .
Package_Service	i phoned the inpost customer_service who could not help and suggested that i drive another 0 miles to the next locker .
Package_Service	i could barely hear them on the phone because the locker is by a main_road and the mobile signal is poor ( perhaps because it ' s at a petrol_station ?).
Package_Service	also , the label expires today so it ' s probably too_late to go to another locker and it ' s now too_late to phone p0d .
Package_Service	all in all , it ' s been a total fail and it looks_like i ' ll be using connect + for my business instead .
Package_Service	this may be slightly more_expensive but at_least i ' ve had replies to my questions with them and i may actually be able to send a parcel .
Package_Service	i had already set - up the option to select the inpost service on my website today but i ' ve just removed it .
Package_Service	thanks to [_name ]. for . his kind email .
Package_Service	i dont nornally do company reviews . but i feel the service i have received from . parcels 0 go has been . outstanding and deserve some recognition .
Package_Service	thank_you .
Package_Service	[_name ] and . parcel 0 go .
Package_Service	i waited in all day for my parcel to be collected and nobody turned_up .
Package_Service	after rearranging the collection date it was picked_up late in the afternoon but then they have managed to lose my parcel .
Package_Service	this was 0 weeks_ago and after submitting a claim_form and sending messages on live_chat every day i am getting_nowhere .
Package_Service	i would definitely not recommend them !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i had a problem booking my parcel online but i used the facebook live_chat service and the operator was able to solve my problem in no time .
Package_Service	perfect – no reservations , i would recommend this company to anyone .
Package_Service	i book next_day delivery with their city_link 00 hour service and i have never been let_down .
Package_Service	absolutely professional and friendly , very helpfully operators .
Package_Service	thank_you [_name ] for all your help today :)
Package_Service	fast service , very professional people , they pick_up the parcel from my house and the delivery was so quick with no dramas .
Package_Service	very happy !
Package_Service	many_thanks to emma for her help in many questions today , she was really helpful which made the experience really easy .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	sammie_taylor great customer_service :)
Package_Service	straight to the point , very helpful and got my problem sorted .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor was fantastic !
Package_Service	i am very pleased with what rose has done regards my query .
Package_Service	i have had the worse experience of my life with tnt ( consignment 000 000 000 ).
Package_Service	i sadly decided you to use their services via transglobal london to send two boxes of all my personal items ( all of things very close to my heart ) to india on 0th_february_0000 .
Package_Service	there was a typo on my invoice ( it should have been £_00 instead of £_000 ) and i had requested them to reassess my invoice and try to get them to accept the new invoices for my things .
Package_Service	i was informed that they had already paid the customs at india for rs00000 on my goods and given that i am unemployed at the moment i had been requesting them to try to be a little flexible and try to show that they really care .
Package_Service	for them it was just another consignment but they did not realise the emotional importance of the things for me .
Package_Service	i literally was on the phone with them for three_weeks and pleaded them to help me out and later my retired father also got involved .
Package_Service	i was transferred from one person to another from uk , us and india .
Package_Service	the entire_process was emotionally taxing for me and physically for my father who is retired .
Package_Service	i am unemployed and never disagreed to pay the hefty charges .
Package_Service	all i was asking them to be a little human .
Package_Service	we spoke with the tnt uk office on 0th_march again if they could help us out a little and try to adjust some of the charges against the freight charges of £_000 i already paid for these boxes .
Package_Service	today morning i called them again to receive heart breaking news .
Package_Service	i called them to ask if they could really reconsider and to follow_up with the uk tnt office - i have been informed that they have discarded my boxes without informing_me .
Package_Service	i received no mail from their team at tnt and transglobal giving me a deadline .
Package_Service	from the very start , i spoke with tnt uk and india office and at every point i heard a different_story .
Package_Service	at all times tnt and transglobal only cared_about the money and more money .
Package_Service	they do not care about their customer .
Package_Service	how could they discard the things which hold close to me ?
Package_Service	i want them back and now they are not even willing to help me .
Package_Service	they need to give my things back to me .
Package_Service	how_dare they discard and distribute my things without my consent .
Package_Service	i will_definitely take this further and get to the bottom of this issue .
Package_Service	spoke to a person called remi and he really helped_me out with a refund that i needed due to a bad customer .
Package_Service	would definately use the service again and the courier who collects the parcels is lovely .
Package_Service	i tend to use the hermes service as the courier is a local lady .
Package_Service	i brought 0 vintage cabbage patch kids off ebay and the seller sent them through collect_plus .
Package_Service	they managed to lose the parcel and have been incredibly unhelpful on the phone , just telling_me that they would contact the hub and should hear back within 00_hours .
Package_Service	that was 0 days ago and they have just admitted loosing the parcel .
Package_Service	even if i get a refund there is no way to replace the cpk ' s lost as they were over 00 years old .
Package_Service	total rip_off and should not be allowed to trade .
Package_Service	i ' ve only been using this company short while but had an issue with someone cancelling an order that i had already arranged collection of - richard took the time to help me cancel this and was super efficient :)
Package_Service	thanks richard :)
Package_Service	i had problems booking and selected the live_chat option .
Package_Service	i was greeted_by william who created a custom order and forwarded me the payment .
Package_Service	very professional service , kind and prompt in his actions .
Package_Service	a real credit to p0g ,
Package_Service	i also needed a duplicate order and this was created also .
Package_Service	i have been using p0g for a while now and cannot_fault the company nor the customer_service .
Package_Service	a wide_variety of services and prices to suit all needs .
Package_Service	highly_recommended .
Package_Service	[_name ] was absolutely amazing in helping me out .
Package_Service	definitely_recommend
Package_Service	lloyd put me a t ease and was very helpful
Package_Service	been using parcel0go for a while now - today is the first day i ' ve had a problem with the postcode not being recognised - however i popped up on livechat and a lady_called emma was happy to help !
Package_Service	solved all the problem and my parcel is ready for collection !
Package_Service	i have used this site / company for a few parcels now ( one international within europe , rest uk_based ) and i am still impressed and will still use it for further parcels .
Package_Service	sarah_hayes from customer_service has helped_me out a few_times with various queries .
Package_Service	keep up the good work .
Package_Service	i paid for city_link to collect a parcel tuesday 00th 0000 and they never arrived .
Package_Service	city_link informed me they made an error and would collect the next morning .
Package_Service	after calling city_link in the morning to confirm , they said it * wouldn ' t * be the morning and it would be the afternoon .
Package_Service	after relaying this to a parcel0go live operator on their website , they apologized and stated the service isn ' t 000_% guaranteed .
Package_Service	so if you select a day for a courier to collect and they don ' t arrive or come the next_day , you nor parcel0go are entitled to any sort of recourse or compensation , apparently .
Package_Service	i was refused an application for a refund as the collection was still going ahead , so i suggested a partial_refund as i hadn ' t received the service i paid for .
Package_Service	this was rejected outright by the operator , and with no address that i can find to write an official_complaint to or to seek a partial_refund , i find myself here on trustpilot making others aware of how they deal with such situations .
Package_Service	my full chat log below :
Package_Service	-----------------
Package_Service	welcome to parcel0go . com .
Package_Service	someone shall be with you shortly .
Package_Service	you are now connected with [_name removed_]
Package_Service	[_name removed ]: welcome to parcel0go . com online .
Package_Service	how can i help you today ?
Package_Service	[_name removed ]: hello peter .
Package_Service	peter owen : hi there , i paid for a parcel to be collected yesterday by city_link and they didn ' t collect it .
Package_Service	they told me over the phone they made an error and it was sent to a driver in
Package_Service	the wrong area , and they told me they would arrange for it be collected this morning instead .
Package_Service	after calling this morning to confirm , they said they cannot delivery this morning and it will
Package_Service	likely be in the afternoon .
Package_Service	peter owen : i still wish for the collection to go_ahead but would like a refund if this is covered under the conditions .
Package_Service	[_name removed ]: i ' m sorry that the courier missed your collection .
Package_Service	they do their very best to make all their collections .
Package_Service	i can only apologise and offer to rebook for the next working day .
Package_Service	peter owen : it states on the website if i ' m not happy with the service then i can apply for a refund .
Package_Service	is this not the case ?
Package_Service	[_name removed ]: of course peter however i cannot rebook your order as well .
Package_Service	peter owen : i don ' t understand - your company and i paid city_link to collect yesterday and they did not provide the service paid for .
Package_Service	as the collection will still go_ahead today , perhaps a partial_refund would be appropriate .
Package_Service	[_name removed ]: i am afraid the service is not 000_% guaranteed peter .
Package_Service	peter owen : i will make my request in writing as i don ' t believe this response is appropriate .
Package_Service	thank_you for your time .
Package_Service	---------
Package_Service	to cut an extremely long_story short i am absolutely mortified that this company has not been shut_down yet .
Package_Service	' live_chat ' yeah_right !!
Package_Service	about as live as siri is on the iphone you absolutely jokes .
Package_Service	i was naive enough to book again with these_jokers after yodel didn ' t pick_up my parcel twice , and history has repeated itself as i am sat here after booking a second collection and still no van to be seen .
Package_Service	avoid completely !!!
Package_Service	i have written a very long_winded letter to them and awaiting a reply .
Package_Service	oh and if you do have problems be prepared to never receive a refund and for them to off you £ 0 . 00 -£ 0 off your next order .
Package_Service	ha !
Package_Service	sham !
Package_Service	catherine was excellent on live_chat she was polite and patient she is excellent on live_chat .
Package_Service	hope to talk to you soon
Package_Service	contacted jessica on the live_chat to change the address on a parcel , did it very quickly and was very nice !
Package_Service	i would definitely_recommend parcel0go .
Package_Service	using the live_chat_function .
Package_Service	did everything that i asked for , friendly and easily approachable .
Package_Service	will_definitely be using this service again without a doubt as can not fault at all !
Package_Service	thanks again to jennyb for the smooth problem that i had .
Package_Service	cole howe
Package_Service	this is the first time i have used this service and without catherines help i would have been lost .
Package_Service	she was friendly , very calm and very helpful
Package_Service	thank_you :-)
Package_Service	dan buzzworx
Package_Service	would like to thank sarah_hayes for her help today .
Package_Service	i was asking on behalf of a disabled friend who i booked a courier for .
Package_Service	sarah was able to help me out and re book my delivery in order for the problem to be sorted .
Package_Service	this has been an incredible help and we are very very grateful .
Package_Service	thanks again sarah , have a blessed day to everyone at parcel0go ..
Package_Service	emily x
Package_Service	classic amplifier damaged on the way to china .
Package_Service	i had to refund the buyer and will not be using this carrier again .
Package_Service	i was struggling to find a company who would deliver to the location we needed so i opened up the live_chat to ask for a little help .
Package_Service	got put through to a lady_called samantha .
Package_Service	she went through and found a company for me who would do next_day delivery to where i needed straight_away .
Package_Service	then she went out of her way to make_sure it was all booked on and sorted correctly .
Package_Service	she was a massive help .
Package_Service	really really impressed with the service , would recommend it to anyone .
Package_Service	i ' ve had a problem with my payment on the website but luckily emma helped_me out on live_chat .
Package_Service	she did a perfect job and it only took about 00_minutes to sort everything out .
Package_Service	i ' ve sent 0 parcels with " next working day delivery " for 00 pounds .
Package_Service	if you read them , you can see that 00_% of the bad_reviews left are not justified through poor service , nor negligence .
Package_Service	sometimes these things just happen , and sometimes by the looks of things , the customers are muppets .
Package_Service	i ' ve used parcels0go 00 + times for international deliveries over the last few_months , and must_say i have never had any trouble what so ever , apart_from one time when it was completely my fault :|
Package_Service	all in all a great value , and faultless company .
Package_Service	thank_you very much indeed for your help earlier today catherine .
Package_Service	your help was outstanding .
Package_Service	in all my years of working in customer_service i have never come accross an agent like yourself .
Package_Service	if your ever looking for a new career opportunity please_please_please get in touch with me !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	thanks catherine
Package_Service	no_fuss , no_problems , great service .
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	samantha was a great help and sorted out my problem quick even explaining when the situation when it got a bit complicatated .
Package_Service	also stayed online with me until i was happy with my collection .
Package_Service	thank_you
Package_Service	i spoke to sammie on live help after i needed to change the delivery address of a parcel i had booked .
Package_Service	the address was changed in an instant and sammie emailed me a new address label right away .
Package_Service	excellent , fast , easy ... a *
Package_Service	i booked p0d as it was linked to parcel0go which i use a lot , never again , 00 days_later my pallet arrived , after days of arranged pick ups where the driver didnt arrive , 0 days after that they contacted my customer to arrange things , told him that the company they hired to do the job ( its obv a broker ) have said iv cancelled the order ( i paid over £_00 for this !)
Package_Service	then they told my customer he will have to pay a £_00 charge !
Package_Service	a simple check would of said , the order was placed from me and i paid !
Package_Service	extremeley dissappointed with this service .
Package_Service	and the " customer help centre " aha !
Package_Service	useless , they didnt even apologise .
Package_Service	i actually set_up a facebook account just to leave a review for kirsty .
Package_Service	she went out of her way to help me as i was having problems paying via the website .
Package_Service	i spoke with her initially on the webchat but as my internet was playing up she offered to call me at home .
Package_Service	however my landline ( which had just been installed ) as also having problems so she very kindly allowed me to call her and resolved my payment problem immediately .
Package_Service	regardless of the olympic - related - traffic in london , my parcel was picked_up as planned .
Package_Service	all thanks to kirsty .
Package_Service	cheers my love !
Package_Service	absolutely_shocking company .
Package_Service	used to be good a few_years_ago , but gone massively downhill .
Package_Service	first they ditched telephone support , after people clearly began phoning in their hoardes .
Package_Service	now we ' re stuck with some irritating livechat interface .
Package_Service	my problem is that over maybe the 00 - 00 times we have ever used parcel0go , nearly every time either the courier hasn ' t turned_up - or there has been some cause for me to contact customer_services .
Package_Service	the most_recent fiasco which spurred me on to write a poor review was sending a parcel ( via tnt .. so not a cheap one ) with an oven in .
Package_Service	it has a small piece of glass on top , and the box was smashed to pieces when it got to the other end .
Package_Service	it ' s a £_000 oven , so we opted for extra insurance .
Package_Service	imagine my horror when it got to the other end after being beaten to a pulp .
Package_Service	because it ' s ' glass ' ( not the whole oven , just the top part ) - it ' s not covered by insurance .
Package_Service	now we ' re at a loss of £_000 for the oven , and the customer is left with a useless box with a smashed up oven in .
Package_Service	absolutely_disgusted with the service and will not be using again .
Package_Service	i was getting worried_about my parcel that something had happened but done a live_chat to sammy_taylor who was fantastic and told me it was out for delivery and if i want for her and the live_chat i wouldn ' t of known what to do so thank_you sammy
Package_Service	i used the live_chat to book a couple of parcels , i spoken to catherine who was fantastic .
Package_Service	she asked me the details she needed and she booked the parcel for me .
Package_Service	great service , will def be using them again .
Package_Service	having used tg for almost 0 years i would recommend them to anyone as i have done on several_occasions .
Package_Service	the only problem i did have was over easter 0000 when i sent 0 parcels to go to the same address and they managed to get separated .
Package_Service	this was the fault of the courier but tg got on the case as soon as i realised it had happened and then put it right .
Package_Service	had it not happened over easter it would have been put right sooner .
Package_Service	this was my fault for sending 0 packages and trying to ship over the easter break , not the fault of tg .
Package_Service	lots of people are making complaints about extra costs upon delivery ...
Package_Service	this is the customs_charges at the destination and this will happen whoever you ship with .
Package_Service	tg are just a broker but they ensure that i don ' t have to pay any more that i should .
Package_Service	there are now a number of similar brokers but i continue to use tg .
Package_Service	big thanks to stephanie for the online help .
Package_Service	all gooood
Package_Service	i ' ve used p0g many many_times for my small business .
Package_Service	i mainly have parcels picked_up from my house , which is ideal for me as i can leave them in porch for the delivery man to collect , rather_than trying to get to the post_office .
Package_Service	the delivery service is great and you can always track the progress of your parcel on the p0g website .
Package_Service	it is also the best website for comparing postage_costs , especially if you are sending larger items , as the prices are much more reasonable than the post_office .
Package_Service	when i ' ve messed_up an order or had to cancel an order the process is very speedy .
Package_Service	the live_chat is the quickest i ' ve ever witnessed from any company and their whole customer_service is really top_notch .
Package_Service	i have been using p0g for around a year now and i would gladly recommend the service to anyone .
Package_Service	the only thing i would want them to change is their credit system .
Package_Service	as i have credit in my account but not enough to use on postage .
Package_Service	if they could make it so you could put any amount towards a postage cost it would be even better !
Package_Service	overall 0_stars all around !
Package_Service	great company with first_class service .
Package_Service	upgraded me to tnt as i missed the courier by a few minutes .
Package_Service	item should get there the same time thanks to daniel on live_chat
Package_Service	great service at a very economical price .
Package_Service	i had tried to send my packages with another company and the result was disastrous .
Package_Service	nothing to do with parcel0go !!
Package_Service	they have been fantastic !
Package_Service	very fast and punctual when picking_up my parcels .
Package_Service	both the courier and sam ( from parcel0go consumer service ) were very friendly and helped_me in everything needed .
Package_Service	thanks indeed .
Package_Service	i will appeal for your service in a future a recommend it :)
Package_Service	thomas was spot on !!!
Package_Service	very helpfull
Package_Service	accidentally used the same delivery address on 0 separate parcels - using the live_chat_function ( which is so much_better_than the phone for me !)
Package_Service	i spoke to jack , really friendly and helpful and he helped_me to rectify my problem and refunded the money back into my account .
Package_Service	thanks jack !
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	i booked the courier to collect from my house today monday 00th_march but nobody has turned_up ??
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	i needed some quick advise regarding a payment issue , catherine was on hand , quick and efficient .
Package_Service	so far i only have good experiences with parcel0go
Package_Service	having made a mistake booking a collection for a return item i contacted the live_chat team - [_name ] and [_name ] - who were brilliant .
Package_Service	they were able to rearrange another collection company for me .
Package_Service	and although there was an extra charge it was easy to pay for .
Package_Service	they made a stressful situation melt away !
Package_Service	highly_recommended and i will be using this service again in the future !
Package_Service	had a problem online and katie sorted me out straight_away , very very helpful !
Package_Service	had my problem dealt_with immediately , top work !
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	no_problems .
Package_Service	good service
Package_Service	0 days ago i booked my parcel in i was happy with the service the next_day i stayed at my office late waiting for the delivery come 0pm still no sign so i contacted them they said there was a fult on the syatem and they were sorry so i wasted my time waiting for them they then rebooked it for collection today i have waited in all day i thought i would just confirm with them they then told me they made a mistake and booked it in for tomorrow so another wasted day had to get refund and find alternative delivery wasted my time and my clients time complete_joke would not offer same day collection
Package_Service	i had an issue with a courier , but parcel0go sorted it straight_away within 00_hours and the chat support operator rose was excellent and prompt with her advice .
Package_Service	a + services excellent company
Package_Service	partner had a nightmare with lost parcels and they don ' t get back to you .
Package_Service	prefer other carriers but avoid parcelmonkey too they are just as bad as this company .
Package_Service	been using parcel0go for years .
Package_Service	thanks to emily for her great service and who got straight to the point without any messing_around .
Package_Service	couldnt ask for better service .
Package_Service	i think parcel0go is the best service to send parcel !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i had a few problem with ups and the parcel 0go staff help me a lot !
Package_Service	! sam answer very quickly to my message and promptly fix the situation .
Package_Service	i recommend the parcel0go service !

Package_Service	thanks a lot sam !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	martina
Package_Service	i ' m on the recieving end of a delivery and was unsure when to expect it , within minutes i knew when it might arrive and the direct tracking_number with the delivery service .
Package_Service	lauren was detailed in responses and quick to reply and solved my question this morning , i ' m now considering using this company when i have my next parcel to send .
Package_Service	failed collection for the second time - will not be using again .
Package_Service	when i asked for an explanation all i got was " unfortunately there is no reason , it is just a failed collection " and then passed the blame onto the courier city_link .
Package_Service	no accountability whatsoever .
Package_Service	it seems that this is a big problem looking at the reviews below ...
Package_Service	as above .
Package_Service	the first time i used this " service " they lost my parcel , and refunded the item minus a few pounds so i lost money on sending something .
Package_Service	the second time i used them over 0 year later , they didn ' t even pick_up the item , now they ' re not paying me back the full_amount .
Package_Service	in my experience they are terrible .
Package_Service	avoid at all costs .
Package_Service	so far the best courier services i have used .
Package_Service	i regularly use its services to ship my artwork to uk , us and worldwide destinations . my packets are always collected on time , by very friendly driver and what more important arrive in excellent condition .
Package_Service	i received some positive_feedback from my customers who also are impressed with ups services .
Package_Service	in the end it is quite a distance and items i ship are fragile .
Package_Service	i tried different couriers and so far ups is the best .
Package_Service	i also buy art materials and some other things from different shops around the world so have received packets delivered by other services .
Package_Service	only ups packets always arrive in very good and clean condition .
Package_Service	ups is very reliable courier , it has earned my trust and i highly_recommend it to anyone who needs to ship fragile content and cares_about the state his packets arrive at their destination .
Package_Service	awesome site , i find the cheapest price to post something , and find a place to drop it off which is closer and opened longer_than my post offce .
Package_Service	i spoke to a very helpful woman called samantha who was efficient and friendly , she was more_than happy to assist .
Package_Service	thanks to the wonderful customer_service received i will be recommending parcel0go to friends and colleagues .
Package_Service	i sent 0 parcels with parcel0go .
Package_Service	yet they didn ' t arrive but they are about to .
Package_Service	even when tnt messed things up with one parcel the staff helped_me in their online live_chat .
Package_Service	the first to ladies i talked to weren ' t too helpful but the third one was after a promise to contact me when my parcel was found wasn ' t held .
Package_Service	rose helped_me and told me the parcel is on its way to the right destination .
Package_Service	parcel0go is a quite cheap way to sent parcels and their staff is helpful .
Package_Service	great customer care and very reliable .
Package_Service	catherine was very friendly and solve the problem so easly
Package_Service	have booked many orders through parcel0go , they seemed pretty good at first .
Package_Service	this was about a year_ago when they were good , but now every parcel is either being sent back to my address , lost or just not collected at all .
Package_Service	i have been trying for the last 0 weeks to get my parcel sent , i email and ring them every day stating that my parcel still has not been collected , but do they care , no .
Package_Service	they send me email_stating the parcel will be collected tomorrow , tomorrow always tomorrow , but the next_day i ring or email and they state that noting was booked in for another collection , i would advise either going to the post_office or getting a real parcel company to deliver your goods , such as dhl , ups or fedex .
Package_Service	please be aware of this company , the reviews left on here are by their staff , no joke .
Package_Service	avoid at all costs .
Package_Service	by the way no has collected the parcel from my address , shall i ring them , erm no their phones are now turned off and its 00 : 00 pm .
Package_Service	( it states lines are open from 0 until 0 monday to friday ), erm its twenty past twelve on a wednesday ???
Package_Service	customer_service big_fat zero .
Package_Service	i wanted to get a refund because i had lost the label for my parcel .
Package_Service	william straight_away helped_me and emailed me it instead , so i didn ' t have to fuss with getting a refund .
Package_Service	he also moved my collection date to friday .
Package_Service	a really good help .
Package_Service	give that guy a pay_rise ...
Package_Service	sarah_h was extremely_helpful in rectifying my issue .
Package_Service	it ' s nice to receive such a speedy response !
Package_Service	what can i say spoke to katie to help me with problem of not putting right weight in and managed to sort the issue out not a problem .
Package_Service	nice speaking to someone helpful and with good personality .
Package_Service	top company and help here
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go . com for a couple of months and have found them to be a brilliant company with excellent customer_service .
Package_Service	out of over 00 parcels i have sent via their service only 0 had not reached its destination and this was over the christmas_period ( this obviously can not be parcel0go . com ' s fault as it was an error of the delivery drivers fault who worked for myhermes ).
Package_Service	parcel0go were excellent in investigating what had happened and once they had all the info refunded me fully the cost of the item and courier fee .
Package_Service	their customer_service via their facebook webpage is brilliant , i have had to use this service twice and both_times my problems were resolved quickly and effectively with polite and efficient service from their representative sam .
Package_Service	i would 000_% recommend this company to everybody .
Package_Service	i had an issue .
Package_Service	bought something off ebay , the seller was charging a silly delivery costs so i sorted it 00_% cheaper at parcels0go but he had no printer so couldn ' t print off the label .
Package_Service	had an online_chat with richard in customer support who amended the booking in minutes so i can post the address label .
Package_Service	effortless , brilliantly efficient and i couldn ' t imagine using any other courier service after this brilliant experience .
Package_Service	you guys at the post_office had better get cv writing ....
Package_Service	i have had great customer_service since joining parcel0go .
Package_Service	if anything has ever gone wrong their online_chat feature is full of helpful people who are ready to sort things out .
Package_Service	( it is open late too ) i find the service very useful for my ebay listings and it is great value for money !
Package_Service	thanks p0go !
Package_Service	colin t
Package_Service	i sent a parcel via parcels0go , the contents arrived broken .
Package_Service	though it went via another delivery company , i made a claim through parcels0go because i was insured through them .
Package_Service	i submitted all that i needed to i . e .
Package_Service	all the evidence that was required by their system .
Package_Service	they failed to pay for my loss and failed moreover to inform me of the reason .
Package_Service	i would never use parcels0go again and would of course never recommend them .
Package_Service	rubbish company that are out to make money at the expense of customers .
Package_Service	just a middle_man company not a proper company at all .
Package_Service	avoid .
Package_Service	avoid , avoid .
Package_Service	they are not even worth 0 star because they are not trustworthy .
Package_Service	recieved really good service today , i ordered at 0am this morning for next_day deliverly of a parcel .
Package_Service	tnt collected it at 00 ( three hour turn_around - wasnt expecting that ) and its on its way to be delivered .
Package_Service	fantastic service and the website was really easy to use , although i couldn ' t find out where the discount_code went i found from their facebook_page , i still think it was quite cheap , compared to other_sites i looked at .
Package_Service	will be using them again
Package_Service	good job parcel0go
Package_Service	i paid for a collection they took my money no one turned_up for collection although the tracking report shows collection point closed .
Package_Service	no one from collect my parcel has contacted me to say sorry or anything ????
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	should a company be allowed to take your money and no provide the service ??
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	i have seen similar negative_reviews and i see the response is that the carriage company that you use is to blame and you do not take the responsibility so i am pretty sure your response to this review will be the same that its city links fault and not yours .
Package_Service	i strongly disagree !
Package_Service	collect my parcel have offered a service and collect my parcel have taken my money there for it is the responsibility of collect my parcel to make_sure my goods are collected and delivered .
Package_Service	i accept that things can go_wrong from time to time but i can not accept that you have not contacted me to say sorry and to offer some solution .
Package_Service	you can not just take peoples money and walk away like thats just fine !!!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	there is no excuse !
Package_Service	timewasters at call_centre promised call back .
Package_Service	nothing .
Package_Service	awaiting delivery .
Package_Service	the package flies 00 , 000_miles in 00_hrs and can ' t make the last 00 on time .
Package_Service	the package is still missing .
Package_Service	the irony is that i ' m having a meeting with a ups rep to talk about a deal for transporting fragile high value goods for my company .
Package_Service	the contract ' s worth 000k ; not much ; but hey , i guess i know better now .
Package_Service	i had stupidly not stayed in to collect my delivery and immediately went online and had a " live_chat " with a sam austen who quickly and with great service has arranged my re - delivery for the next_day to another address .
Package_Service	great service , very impressed with sam , keep it up .
Package_Service	good service via the chat operator , sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	she was great at advising me on my parcel going abroad and actually completed the entire transaction for me online via chat !
Package_Service	fantastic service !
Package_Service	thanks richard_mileham .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor was very helpful today regarding my item that had been canceled very friendly woman ,
Package_Service	sammy is also very straight_forward in her answers so no more questions needed to ask her , which makes you more at ease knowing your parcels & money are in good hands :)
Package_Service	thank_you sammy_taylor
Package_Service	considering the parcel was over a week late , and the parcel was highly important it arrived on time - the staff did not apologise once , nor did they sound empathetic .
Package_Service	it also took countless phone_calls to actually get it sorted ( which took up a lot of time and money on my phone .)
Package_Service	i would never recommend using this company .
Package_Service	more_importantly , this parcel was ordered from ebay - so the seller will be getting negative_feedback - only for the reason that parcel0go was their choosen courier .
Package_Service	do not be mislead by their positive_reviews on the website - they clearly monitor what most people write on there .
Package_Service	avoid , avoid , avoid .
Package_Service	i never write_reviews , but this company hacked me off so much , i just had to .
Package_Service	had an issue where i had to get an error resolved and sarah_h got it resolved quickly and hassle_free and overall very pleased with the service
Package_Service	booked a parcel for collection today , firstly the bad point yodel the courier failed to collect , this seems to be a common problem with yodel .
Package_Service	so i contacted p0g , ashley from p0g sorted the issue for me , the courier has been contacted and collection re - booked , on previous occasions the guys have been just as helpful and sometimes the service is upgraded to another courier to compensate .
Package_Service	at the price we pay you can ' t complain , i mean royal_mail charge a lot more , and the service is completely dire .... well_done p0g .
Package_Service	also as my printer has decided to die today , they even said they would sort the labels , what more can you ask ?
Package_Service	thanks again ashley .
Package_Service	everything went as expected , was really easy and simple to arrange .
Package_Service	will use again .
Package_Service	terrible service !
Package_Service	i ordered something from ebay and they shipped with collectplus .
Package_Service	the courier tried twice to find our address ( on a main_road in london ) and apparently couldn ' t find it , so he had it sent back to the sender .
Package_Service	they had the correct address and my phone number , why not call me ?
Package_Service	the sender then resent it and it finally made it to me , but it literally looked like it had been run over by a truck !
Package_Service	with royal_mail charging excessive amounts to send parcel , i went to parcel 0 go .
Package_Service	parcel 0 go have always done exactly_what they ' ve said they would do , offered great prices with an easy website and when a courier does unfortuantly make a mistake , the customer_service team is great .
Package_Service	after a slight confusion with a tracking code , a chat with sam on facebook quickly solved the problem and was followed up to check everything was ok and the parcel had been deliverd .
Package_Service	great customer_service !
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	thanks again .
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	this morning i had a pleasure live chatting with natalie , she was really helpful , quick , polite and sorted my problem in a minutes .
Package_Service	i was always a bit_sceptical with regards live_chats but if everyone are as good as natalie - i will change phone_calls to this !
Package_Service	thank_you again !
Package_Service	i use to think p0g was good until they lost my package at thier office and although my package was worth £ 0000 they wanted to pay £_00 .
Package_Service	they have no duty of care to the customer .
Package_Service	customer_services personel both online_chat and on phone were rude and will cut you off , when you wanna know more ... i lost my parcel , had to pay ebay and paypal fee .
Package_Service	what makes it worst was the package was lost at their office depot after ups returned it to their front_desk due to them been unable to deliver .
Package_Service	i message them straight_away to return my package and was told i will get my package the next_day and that it was at their office .
Package_Service	a week and a half later i was told the package was on it way to me .
Package_Service	two days_later i contacted them and was told to make a claim seen their can ' t locate my package and since i wasn ' t insured was only reliable for a £_00 pay out .
Package_Service	a real_shame
Package_Service	just be_careful dealing_with them .
Package_Service	rob helped sort a problem that i had with speed and now everything is sorted for my parcels .
Package_Service	thanks again !
Package_Service	sarah popped up to help after an error occured with sending stuff the usa .
Package_Service	she was happy and chatty , and got my order sorted faster_than i usually do .
Package_Service	really friendly and funny , nice to feel i was talking to a human and not a droid !
Package_Service	hope i get her again if i have any_problems :) very happy !
Package_Service	x
Package_Service	thanks to rose she helped with any_queries and questions i had about my account also helped to rebook a delivery for which the seller was not present at collection address for free of charge highly_recommended .
Package_Service	thanks again rose
Package_Service	my first time using these_guys and i made a mistake with my delivery address , went on live_chat and spoke to samantha and she sorted it all out for me .
Package_Service	fantastic quick easy cheap , great stuff 0_stars !
Package_Service	dreadful company , dreadful customer_service , nobody i ' ve spoken to ( 0 people now ?)
Package_Service	is capable o returning a phone call and not one single_person actually cares_about what they do .
Package_Service	completely and utterly_useless .
Package_Service	avoid !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	( my parcels , 0 weeks late , got sent back and i still_haven ' t received them or a refund for the service i paid for !)
Package_Service	alix challis was so helpful and managed to arrange for our brother to receive a special wedding present .
Package_Service	thank_you alix challis xx
Package_Service	i chatted online with samantha as i had a problem with a returned parcel .
Package_Service	she sorted out very profesionally and efficiently and i am very pleased with the service i received from her .
Package_Service	i will highly_recommend your services .
Package_Service	most horrible experience i had with fedex .
Package_Service	ordered couple of items on ebay , got all of them except one delivery which was with fedex after five days i called them to know to status . and they said they couldnt find my address . totally rubbish , my house is very big with house name written on , even who_knows bit english can easily read , i gave the .
Package_Service	clear direction along with my ph number , and the result was d same , when i called them again after 0 weeks they told me that returned the parcel as they couldnt locate my adress even didnt bother to call me . no commitment towards customer .
Package_Service	totally 0 out of 0
Package_Service	i used parcels 0 go today and got stuck with the delivery address , i was frantic as i needed to get the parcel collected the same day and i only had00 minutes to go before the cut_off point .
Package_Service	i couldn ' t find the live_chat anywhere and was getting a bit naused by it all when i searched for it on facebook and found the parcels 0 go app !
Package_Service	it had live_chat on there and although i went through to the wrong department they quickly transferred me over to sammie who got me sorted out in no time , the parcel was booked and i ' m currently printing the paperwork out while i write this .
Package_Service	00 out of 00 !
Package_Service	great service !
Package_Service	i used your service for an express international service spending a lot of money
Package_Service	to then get an_email_saying there are £_00 of return customs costs for me to pay
Package_Service	this went to an old email i stopped using .
Package_Service	then i had an escalated £_000 bill saying i now face holding charges !
Package_Service	no one called me to tell me , i just got it from a catch all email address finally in my junk .
Package_Service	very unfair and very un helpful
Package_Service	i have used their service for my business 0 - 0 times without a problem and then i get stung with this bill making my original £_00 purchase 00 times the costs with all these charges .
Package_Service	terrible service , no one apologised and now i use [_external link_removed_] who are much more helpful , just as good if not better and great service .
Package_Service	do not use interparcel , avoid like the plague
Package_Service	thanks for the support sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	i have now spoke with andrea twice regarding issues i have had both_times she has been more_than helpful a real first_class friendly service
Package_Service	also i had to claim on a damaged parcel which parcel0go accepted with no hassle just a few pictures and they are giving me more_than i requested talk about good will .
Package_Service	thanks andrea and the rest of parcel0go you make sending parcels a pleasure
Package_Service	catherine sorted me in no time .

Package_Service	i love parcel 0 go anyway , they have been my savior for my little business .
Package_Service	the live_chat_function is brilliant and samantha solved my problem in minutes :):) i always recommend to friends :)
Package_Service	i have used parcel_hero eight times now and have never had a single problem , i would recommend parcelhero to anyone .
Package_Service	i just recently sent a parcel to a customer in the republic of ireland who was desperate to get it before saturday , using parcelhero it cost me £_00 . 00 and was picked_up by ups at 00 : 00 on thurday and it arrived at the customers address at 00 : 00 on friday .
Package_Service	once again another job well_done by parcelhero and ups .
Package_Service	sarah_hayes was a fantastic operator , was very friendly , able to say what i wanted to say & got the help that i needed was also sorted very quickly ,
Package_Service	thank_you sarah .
Package_Service	its my first time using parcel0go and was having problem with the online form .
Package_Service	catherine the live_chat agent who had helped_me was more_than helpful with answering my questions , she did the processing for me and all i have to do was confirm and pay ...
Package_Service	i ' m really impressed with the service , both myself and the recepient ( on the other end of the world ) was able to tracked the status on the parcel and it was delivered on time as well .
Package_Service	will_definitely use parcel0go again for sending parcels witin or outside uk ....
Package_Service	sarah_h was so very helpful . a credit to the company . your company really does go the extra_mile . thankyou so much . from john downham who put this review .
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go for a couple of months now and i have found the service to be great , i especially love the upload option to upload my items from ebay .
Package_Service	today i had booked a delivery and the customer contacted me with a different delivery address .
Package_Service	i used the online help and spoke to one of the representatives sam austen and within a minute he had changed the address and emailed me a new address label for my parcel .
Package_Service	can ' t say i ' ve ever had a resolution to an issue that quickly before !
Package_Service	keep up the good work .
Package_Service	used the live_chat of parcel0go and was amazed by the competent and helpful customer_service .
Package_Service	they saved my christams and i will_definitely use parcel0go again for my next parcels to germany !

Package_Service	lovely service , made sending a parcel to norway a breeze !
Package_Service	special thanks to andrea on the live_chat for helping me with a customs issue !
Package_Service	usually live_chats are rubbish , but they were really good and processed the order for me so all i needed to do was pay .
Package_Service	excellent prices compared to other couriers .
Package_Service	emily was the rep on live_chat .
Package_Service	they get a 0star rateing from me , with the drop_off service it means i dont have to wait in all day and is also cheep .
Package_Service	thanks to richard i made an error on the address he corrected it within minuits and sent me the right labels .. cheers parcels0go :-)
Package_Service	i have never done any business with parcel0go , but the way i was assisted by stephanie with a few questions i had was marvellous !
Package_Service	within_seconds , i got feedback !!
Package_Service	i look_forward to doing_business with you in the near_future .
Package_Service	i used parcel0go for the first time today and made an error .
Package_Service	i simply contacted sam via facebook and the matter was resolved in minutes !
Package_Service	i would definitely_recommend :-)
Package_Service	catherine_corless was awesome .
Package_Service	talked me through the process and make it super easy !
Package_Service	i ordered a package and waiting more_than a week as he supposed to be delivered on 0 days , so i called dpd to check what happened .
Package_Service	they delivered my package on the wrong_address , they apologise and promise to deliver the next_day at 0 pm .
Package_Service	the very next_day at 0pm still no package , so i called again , surprise they delivered at the same wrong_address than before .
Package_Service	i spend 00 min waiting on the phone to heard that i wasn ’ t there during the delivery and that the driver put a note under my door to tell me where he put my parcel .
Package_Service	just a precision i am living above a business opened since 00 am with 0 double door open of course with my staff working inside .
Package_Service	is impossible than the driver couldn ` t deliver my parcel as my staff was advise of this delivery .
Package_Service	finally i still_waiting with no assurance that my parcel will arrive , the ladies on the phone was , excuse me , useless , didn ` t let me speak or explain my problem for her it was my fault .
Package_Service	for the direction of dpd i would like to say this : i wont ever recommend you as you customer_service was unacceptable .
Package_Service	thank_you very much for this very bad_experience .
Package_Service	my final word never again !!!!!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	whilst trying to track my " missing " parcel , i used the live_chat app on the website and very quickly got to the bottom of the problem .
Package_Service	the agent , [_name ], was very friendly and helpful and even_though it was nearly 00 . 00 on a saturday_night tracked down my parcel , told me what was going on with it and rescheduled the delivery .
Package_Service	fantastic service !
Package_Service	very thankful for the help given by the team today , especially lauren_w she is a great asset to you
Package_Service	sammie_taylor fixed my shipping issues with tnt :)
Package_Service	[_name ] gave a great service with a up to date response
Package_Service	had a website error when i tried to book and was directed to contact " live help ", that usually fills me with dread as usually its not very live and of little help .
Package_Service	this time i was very happy , catherine_corless ( my very live and very helpful agent ) quickly sorted my problem and got the order booked in for me .
Package_Service	what a star .
Package_Service	very easy to use website and they collect on time and deliver when its meant to be ,, have told other people to use them coz of how good they are ,, will definatly be useing them in the future
Package_Service	i have been using parcel0go for some time now .
Package_Service	with dispatching an average 00 - 00 parcels a week , they are a very helpful tool for a small business .
Package_Service	their service never disappoints me .
Package_Service	and in case of any trouble , their fabulous team is ready to assist .
Package_Service	their live help is a 0 * service .
Package_Service	always helpful , always efficient .
Package_Service	every time i chat to them i have a feeling of being treated like a valued customer .
Package_Service	just today i had a chance to speak to sarah and lauren about two different cases .
Package_Service	amazing and positive attitude .
Package_Service	i recommend parcel0go to anyone who_wants to have peace in mind while delivering goods to customers .
Package_Service	after asking for a day off at work and been waiting for the whole day at home no one came to collect my parcel .
Package_Service	they were quick taking the money from my account but with not collection at all sound a bit of scam .
Package_Service	what a rubish service you have ???
Package_Service	i suggest you better put bid lock on your store .
Package_Service	my parcke was suppose to be delivered by today morning between 0 : 00 to 00 : 00 am and your drived didn ' t attempted to deliver the parcle .
Package_Service	when i track for the iter online it mentioned " we were unable to deliver your parcel as there was no one present to sign for the delivery , rearrange your delivery here - 00000000
Package_Service	calling_card left e_- mail notification sent ".
Package_Service	then i called back your number and sara picked_up , she said that this will be delivered by tomorow on 00th_may .
Package_Service	at 00 : 00 noon today i have got a call from glinish from your customer_service and she just wested my time sating that she has re - arranged the delivery for today in between 00 : 00 to 0 : 00 and driver will call me soon .
Package_Service	don ' t understand when the hell this soon will come ?????
Package_Service	this is the third time hapening with my parcle comming via dpd and i have to give very negative feed_back to other user so that i ' ll be able to spoit your customers .
Package_Service	i have to take this very seriously and i am writting a letter to consumer court , police and to my lawyer .
Package_Service	now it is showing me that the parcle is at delivery depot .
Package_Service	if you guys are useless then better leave the job and give this to the one who really needs it ,
Package_Service	have just used parcel0go for the first time and i have to say my first_impressions are very good .
Package_Service	i have never had to ssend a parcel outside of work before , having a work account meaning i just ring up with a number and someone picks the package up great .
Package_Service	however doing it privately i was amazed by all the different options you have .
Package_Service	i chose to use the online_chat facility and spoke to emily .
Package_Service	she was very professional and after taking the measurments of the parcel i was sending came back with three quotes depending_on the speed of service i wanted .
Package_Service	i decided to go with the 0 working_days option .
Package_Service	she then sent me a link to a preset order page with all the package details and courier service setup .
Package_Service	all i had to do was put in the collect from post code and the deliver 0 post code and check out .
Package_Service	easy .
Package_Service	she also went through how the system worked and advised me of the insurance_cover provided and recomened a covered the additional charge as city_link only cover upto £_00 .
Package_Service	for an extra £ 0 . 00 i coverd the full package value .
Package_Service	i only hope city_link can match parcel0go ' s service and efficiency as it would be a real_shame for city_link to let them down at the last hurdle .
Package_Service	i have rated 0_stars as anything from now is at the hands of city_link .
Package_Service	well_done guys and girls .
Package_Service	top quality !
Package_Service	i needed to re - book my collection and arrange for a pick_up without signature and sarah was very helpful and gave me all i needed to know .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	thanks to daniel at parcels0go for smooth live_chat help which_resulted_in a small problem being quickly resolved , very helpful , thank_you .

Package_Service	much cheaper_than royal_mail
Package_Service	parcel was lost by hermes - not the fault of mpd themselves , but the claim process is made unnecessarily long and laborious by the company .
Package_Service	almost a month since the claim was accepted by the courier , payment i am owed for the lost parcel has still failed to materialise .
Package_Service	they ' ve claimed on several_occasions to not have received my payment details - and now keep pushing back payments dates , stating that the ten working day period has not elapsed - which it has .
Package_Service	it took a formal_complaint to get to this stage - which still has not been fully settled - and will now be looking to contact the postage regulator should payment not be forthcoming in the next few_days .
Package_Service	absolutely_appalling service .
Package_Service	what a star !
Package_Service	no hassle , no delays .
Package_Service	problem that i caused was sorted within minutes .
Package_Service	no wasting time here !
Package_Service	i messed_up and she was very helpful .
Package_Service	thank_you , katie !
Package_Service	really helpful .
Package_Service	daniel gave me all of the info i needed to get my posting done .
Package_Service	they lose your parcel and their customer_service is useless !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	had a problem and dont print the other bit of paper so they was very thoughtful and give me another day any day of my choice .
Package_Service	also quick on getting my parcel to where it was going
Package_Service	i placed an order on parcel0go and i didn ’ t receive a confirmation_email with my vat invoice , i logged_onto the online_chat through facebook and started chatting to [_name ], she was extremely_helpful and resolved my problem in minutes !!
Package_Service	i fully recommend her as her customer_service skills were excellent .
Package_Service	0 gold stars !
Package_Service	elizabeth
Package_Service	i had an arkward delivery to sort out and the online_chat assistant emma couldn ' t have been more helpful and quick .
Package_Service	highly_recommended !
Package_Service	they had some problem of their website when i was processing my order and [_name ] was happened to be on - line .
Package_Service	she solved my problem quickly with very nice attitude that helped_me gained my faith on their service .
Package_Service	** edit **
Package_Service	( 00 / 0 /_0000 ) still full of useless excuses they cannot backup .
Package_Service	complete_lack of empathy from these_guys .
Package_Service	( 00 / 0 /_0000 ) admitted error in the address on city_link side and issued a refund .
Package_Service	after waiting 0 weeks and having the parcel sent back to me by city_link torn open , they refused to offer a refund .
Package_Service	first by lying , saying that i did not provide a receiver number even_though their website forces you .
Package_Service	then by just stating the driver attempted delivery ... he didn ' t deliver so how is that an excuse ?
Package_Service	richard_mileham was very helpful and friendly , resolved my issue straight_away !
Package_Service	ordered a motherboard which was dispatched through ups saturday delivery , arrived in perfect_condition at 0am in the morning , highly_recommended .
Package_Service	only minor_issue would be is no time window being given for delivery .
Package_Service	i use parcels0go quite frequent , its as easy as 000 .
Package_Service	choose from various couriers at a price that suits you , and just pay and print labels , and within 00_hours its collected from you .
Package_Service	what more could you want
Package_Service	i used interparcel to send some very important equipment to scotland .
Package_Service	it was was vitally important that it arrived monday and i even called up to double_check this .
Package_Service	the parcel was collected no problem however the next_day when i tracked the parcel it said it arrived in glasgow .
Package_Service	the nest time i checked it ( friday ) said delivery failed .
Package_Service	when i looked further into this they has refused to deliver it because instead of the label saying ' council ' it said ' counci ' the l had been knocked off and they refused to deliver it .
Package_Service	this happened at 00 . 00 and i saw it at 0 . 00 .
Package_Service	they hadn ' t contacted me to ask for the correct spelling just left it .
Package_Service	numerous_calls and using their online helper , i spoke to interparcel on 0 seperate_occasions and each time the person i spoke to , no matter what accent , was called kirsty .
Package_Service	funny that .
Package_Service	so when i eventually got some sense out of kirsty she said that the address had now been changed and they would deliver it first thing monday .
Package_Service	monday lunch time came and still no parcel .
Package_Service	i rang interparcel again , you can guess who i spoke to .
Package_Service	' kirsty ' then informed me my parcel wouldn ' t be delivered as it takes 00_hours for the address change to happen .
Package_Service	the fact it had been a whole weekend didn ' t faze her .
Package_Service	' kirsty ' then said she would see and get back to me .
Package_Service	however a miracle happened and at 0 . 00pm my parcel finally reached it ' s destination .
Package_Service	' kirsty ' emailed me back eventually on tuesday lunch time to let me know that they would be delivering my item that afternoon .
Package_Service	my item that had already been delivered the previous day .
Package_Service	words fail me .
Package_Service	well thank_you for delivering a parcel to someone_else on my street when at no point have i specified i will be happy to have it delivered to an_alternative address .
Package_Service	i would rather it got taken back to the depot so i can pick it up !
Package_Service	seriously how are delivery companies so useless ?
Package_Service	all you do is pick an item up , drive it somewhere and drop it off , it requires no skill or creativity at all yet it still seems past the competence of ups .
Package_Service	i ' ll be contacting the company i purchased the items from who will then be claiming against you for a lost delivery !
Package_Service	not much more to say really , useless company , useless drivers .
Package_Service	interparcel makes it super easy to check prices and get parcels picked_up , great for sending ebay items !
Package_Service	i have used interparcel twice to send bulky and heavy ( over 00kg ) parcels to south of france from uk .
Package_Service	the parcels took time and effort to wrap to protect the contents but that is my choice .
Package_Service	parcels both arrived fine with no damage after being picked_up and moved by dhl - interparcel are the ' middle men '.
Package_Service	the rates via interparcel are excellent when compared with the carriers when going to them directly .
Package_Service	staff have been helpful via_email and phone when i thought a parcel had ' disappeared ' ( it hadn ' t - it was me using the wrong tracking_number ) so i can ' t complain at all .
Package_Service	very happy with service .
Package_Service	i returned a very valuable parcel to asos , which they stated they never received , and i had lost the proof of postage .
Package_Service	asos were absolutely no help whatsoever , and gave such a poor quality of service ...
Package_Service	i looked on a forum , and emailed paul at collect_plus in a last ditch attempt to have my items refunded .
Package_Service	a guy called philip got back to me and was absolutely amazing !!
Package_Service	i really cannot thank him enough as he tracked down my parcel and gave me my tracking_number in less_than 00_hours !
Package_Service	philip could not help enough , and even offered to write a letter to asos as my proof of postage !
Package_Service	philip was great , and after giving asos my tracking_number ( and chasing them up multiple_times ...) asos then agreed to refund the items enclosed in the parcel !
Package_Service	shocking service from asos , but incredible service from philip at collectplus !
Package_Service	thank_you so much philip !
Package_Service	i will not be able to send the gifts to my family without the help from [_name ].
Package_Service	[_name ] answered every of my simple questions clearly with patience , and understood my concerns .. talking to [_name ] is like talking to a friend , warm and polite .
Package_Service	thanks [_name ] for offering the help .
Package_Service	i would not recommend parcel0go to anyone .
Package_Service	the service is rubbish and the agents you connect to on live_chat - well some are pretty rude .
Package_Service	posted a parcel on the 00th_november and customer hasn ' t received ( tnt ) the tracking data was actually pre filled with the information from another order i placed on the same day - but trying to explain that to them is impossible as they don ' t listen .
Package_Service	i am not sure whether its incompetence or ignorance .
Package_Service	matter still unresolved - claim filed .
Package_Service	i would stay clear - [_external reference_] provide a far better service and also provide telephone_numbers to call if you have a problem .
Package_Service	since post_office raised their prices i have used collectplus three times .
Package_Service	two of my parcels have been delivered successfully and one is still in the process ( only being sent off yesterday ).
Package_Service	collectplus offer a good tracking service which is easy to use .
Package_Service	i prefer using collectplus over myhermes as i have already had one problem with myhermes and have only sent two parcels with them .
Package_Service	all in all i can ' t fault collectplus ' s service and will_continue using them .
Package_Service	had lot of bad_experience with parcel0go such as items neva gettin collected it took a week to pick_up a parcel when i paid for next_day delivery .
Package_Service	it only messes up my business feedback but somehow parcel0go can never compensate for there mistakes i pay for a service and i lose . 00_% time i have made orders i have had problems and i can say ive spent a lot of money via parcel0go and as new websites are coming along i may take custom else where if my orders keep getting messed_up .
Package_Service	city_link may aswel call them shitty link excuse my french but once they left a parcel in a bush in my garden that was of value of over £_000 and did not have no card through door to say it was there and stayed out for few_days .
Package_Service	compensate for ur mistakes parcel0go then id b happy thankyou
Package_Service	good rates , easy to use , had no_problems with 00 + parcels .. online support if needed !
Package_Service	had a problem .
Package_Service	you can talk to these_guys on live_chat which saves time and money .
Package_Service	its win_win with these_guys ..
Package_Service	so give them a try ...
Package_Service	talked to a guy called rob who helped_me sort my problem out that i caused .
Package_Service	he done a great job .
Package_Service	thanks rob for making my day ..
Package_Service	cheers p0g ...
Package_Service	it was really helpful talking to [_name ] ( live help operator ), got my problem solved in a minute .
Package_Service	spot on
Package_Service	i have been using interparcel for 0 years now , i have never had any_problems with damage or late delivery for my ebay items .
Package_Service	varied price structure to fit the service required by customer .
Package_Service	easy booking system .
Package_Service	great value for money , especially if compared to royal_mail or parcelforce .
Package_Service	i started using parcel_hero when i was trying to ship my friends ' things to spain .
Package_Service	i had gone to dhl and other well_established companies but the price was unreasonably high . i finally booked dhl thinking ; expensive but have a proven track record .
Package_Service	unfortunately the didn ' t come to pick the parcel ( claiming no one was home , whilei had been home all day waiting ), and i had to look for an_alternative because it was urgent .
Package_Service	i then googled cheap parcel companies and got parcel_hero , read the reviews and most people scored them highly . i then decided to use them .
Package_Service	i have to tell you in the next hour after payment they were here , and it cost one third of what i paid dhl and i must confess i have used them ever since .
Package_Service	i have even recommended them to friends and family and i am yet to hear a complaint .
Package_Service	keep up the good work . please continue with you good customer_service and do not let the quality of your service decline .
Package_Service	ordered a present from asos , but didn ' t want to wait in for delivery .
Package_Service	bring on collect +, a great idea where you get parcels delivered to a convenience store .
Package_Service	the longest part of the wait was asos dispatching the damn thing .
Package_Service	from when they dispatched the parcel to me picking it up was under 00_hours .
Package_Service	i got a text to tell me when it was ready to pick_up , and the guy serving me in what was a very clean and bright shop was very helpful .
Package_Service	they say the test of a company is when things go_wrong , but i didn ' t have to deal with that , so for my order , top_marks .
Package_Service	i had never used this company before but found them to be by_far the cheapest courier for me .
Package_Service	the item was collected the next_day from my home as arrived and was delivered in the usa 0 days_later .
Package_Service	i was really surprised as i was expecting it to arrive within 0 - 0 days .
Package_Service	i heard from the recipient that it arrived in good condition .
Package_Service	i would definitely use this company again .
Package_Service	the customer_service at parcel0go are very polite .
Package_Service	hannah was extremely fast in dealing_with my request .
Package_Service	which saved me a lot of time and headache !!
Package_Service	always a plus in my opinion !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i would highly_recommend parcel0go to anyone needing to send a parcel !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	quick delivery great communication helpful facebook team !!!
Package_Service	thank_you guys :)
Package_Service	live help - great service offered from emma .
Package_Service	she did everything to progress a rebooking - many_thanks .
Package_Service	very much_appreciated .
Package_Service	richard
Package_Service	i chose this courier to send a birthday_present to the netherlands from england in april .
Package_Service	due to me being late in sending said present i had to use the " next_day delivery " option .
Package_Service	i was abit nervous since they use dhl_express and that has alot of bad_reviews , however the service i received was amazing !
Package_Service	i received step by step updates , and tracking was updated amazingly fast .
Package_Service	the item left at 0pm and arrived at 00am the next_day in the netherlands !
Package_Service	i ' ve used this service twice now and i would recommend it to anyone trying to ship something over 0 - 0kg
Package_Service	not the mention the price is great !
Package_Service	totally useless .
Package_Service	prebooked for collect a few_days before collection and no one turned_up .
Package_Service	i emailed them the day after collection when the seller contacted me to say no one turn_up , and they said they would collect on the same day , but no one turned_up .
Package_Service	messaged the seller of the item i want collecting from , he told me his wife wasted a whole day waiting for the courier .
Package_Service	i ' ve emailed interparcel several_times , only had one reply telling_me it would be rebooked , i ' ve heard_nothing for the last 0 days .
Package_Service	messaged the seller again , courier has not turned_up at all ?
Package_Service	!..
Package_Service	i ' ve received no more emails , or even had a call ?
Package_Service	demanded a refund , waiting for monday for an answer , if not , i will chase my money back through my bank .
Package_Service	bad service , this is the second time i ' ve had problems with this company .
Package_Service	beware !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	excellent customer_service and value for money .
Package_Service	the website is easy to use - for both quotes and purchasing services .
Package_Service	have already_recommended parcel0go to friends !
Package_Service	peter chandler was very friendly .
Package_Service	i had problems uploading my items from ebay .
Package_Service	then only one of the 0 items got uploaded .
Package_Service	so i contacted customer_service and [_name ] was brilliant . she manually booked my delivery and now i am happy i can now send my parcels .
Package_Service	thank_you [_name ].
Package_Service	order placed on 0st december for collection on 0nd december .
Package_Service	collection wasn ' t made .
Package_Service	when i discovered goods had not been collected i contacted parcel0go through their live un - help - ful option as obviously no way of speaking to an actual real live person , but they were unable to say why collection wasn ' t carried_out .
Package_Service	they asked if i wanted to rebook - stupid question but i confirmed i would like to rebook .
Package_Service	however , as this was now a friday_morning the collection could not be rearranged until the following_monday .
Package_Service	monday the 00th_december and the rebooked collection wasn ' t carried_out .
Package_Service	when i realised the goods were not collected i contacted p0g once again and yet again they could not explain reason for failed collection .
Package_Service	best they can do is to rebook collection for wednesday 00th_december .
Package_Service	so 00 days , and counting , after original booking i am still_waiting for the items to be collected .
Package_Service	no offer of refund , or compensation , or delivery upgrade .
Package_Service	really quite pathetic service .
Package_Service	have now entered groundhog day of failed collections , contacting parcel0go through their live help facility and given the option of rebooking .
Package_Service	the customer_service is haphazard , the responses are slow and scripted with no sense of urgency or actual interest in resolving the issue .
Package_Service	i booked the first collection myself on 00th_june for monday 00th_june i booked yodel through parcel0go . com , so wait in all day 0pm comes and i contact parcel0go via the chat system , i got appologises but no explanation to why they failed to collect , was offered free upgrade to tnt , to collect next_day , even_though i mentioned the bad_reviews on google i was told ' it was one of our best courier services ' i should of gone with my gut instant despite this i took the upgrade .
Package_Service	i wait in all day tuesday 0pm comes again , again no collection .
Package_Service	so yet again i contact parcel0go through the chat system , no reason to why and i get told it will take 00_hours for an explanation .
Package_Service	requested upgrade to parcelforce am express which was refused , so requested paypal refund , don ' t know why i bother - useless useless useless
Package_Service	warning to others if you want to waste 0 days sitting in go_ahead this company deserves 0_stars not 0
Package_Service	parcel0go provides the best tracking_info on the web .
Package_Service	even if package not shipped via them .
Package_Service	0x more info than on the couriers own website and easier to use too ...
Package_Service	im sorry but these_guys are rubbish lost my package and didnt give a care in the world to contact me , their communication is rubbish and ur product is likely to get stolen never will i use them again !
Package_Service	amazing service !
Package_Service	very fast and efficient service .
Package_Service	would recommend to everyone .
Package_Service	will_definitely be using them for all my delivery needs .
Package_Service	thank_you .
Package_Service	i ' m really sorry but i cant remember who helped_me with my enquiries but he was a very nice chap .
Package_Service	great help from [_name ] today with a parcel mix_up .
Package_Service	she sorted the problem very quickly and " because of her " i will_continue to use parcel 0 go .
Package_Service	00 out of 00 service .
Package_Service	fantastic service as always its the only courier company i have never had issues with and ill never use another ever again i buy and sell from all over the country and i will always recommend this company especially the staff who are extremely polite an helpful make you feel_like a individual customer not just a number 00 / 00 is what i would rate them
Package_Service	was using for some time , not too bad , but it ' s getting worse now , all great until nothing happened , i recently got one of my parcels stuck at their warehouse , and it ' s not impossible to them to get it out of there for weeks , i look like a to total looser against my customer , trying to convince it will be redelivered tomorrow every day for 0 weeks now , and finally no luck after all ...
Package_Service	if they say something will happen in 00_hours , it wont !...
Package_Service	parcel is still in bolton , every time contact them , same story ....
Package_Service	tired of that ...
Package_Service	catherine was great .
Package_Service	popped up on my screen when i was having trouble choosing a service .
Package_Service	went through it with me and led me to the payment page .
Package_Service	real super woman !
Package_Service	0 star service !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	royal_mail wanting to charge me £_00 . 00 to send a 0kg parcel to france second class !!!
Package_Service	parcel0go £_00 !
Package_Service	and thats 0 day door to door !!
Package_Service	brill service and will use them all the time now so cheap and quick , thanks guys
Package_Service	sammie t was great , i was connected to the live_chat within 0 seconds and both of my queries were dealt_with quickly and professionally .
Package_Service	i ' m all set_up to go_ahead and book my courier ... woohoo !
Package_Service	i have been using this company for a few_years no without problem .
Package_Service	they are always helpful when i have a problem and their live_chat feature is great
Package_Service	frankly speaking , there is nothing to complain_about .
Package_Service	every_single time i use interparcel , it delivers .
Package_Service	couriers are always on time for collection or delivery , never misses , and the website is very easy to use .
Package_Service	keep up the good job :)
Package_Service	today , i needed help changing the shipping address on an order that i had already placed .
Package_Service	[_name ] was very helpful in changing the address for me .
Package_Service	she was very friendly and efficient .
Package_Service	she even e_- mailed over the new postage and confirmation for us as well !
Package_Service	parcel0go . com is such an easy site to use , and the fact that you can chat with staff_members immediately for help is tremendous .
Package_Service	i would recommend this service to anyone .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor great help thanks for your time
Package_Service	i have had a excellent response very very helpful , made everything very clear with the issue i was having
Package_Service	absolutely_terrible service , was promised my delivery for the 00th_may 00 by dpd but that had changed by 0pm that day as the parcel was still in birmingham .
Package_Service	i had used the last of my holidays to wait for the delivery only for dpd then to tell me it would be a 0 day delivery as i lived on an island , in a way this is true as it is great britain where i live !
Package_Service	they are telling_me it is a 0 day delivery as i live so far north , in truth i live 00 miles north_west of inverness , which is only 0 hours not 00_hours to birmingham .
Package_Service	i would like to gurn and cry a bit more but really cant be bother dealing_with a pro english company that is happy to move the goal posts at the last_minute for their scottish customers , which seems to me like its a little_bit racist and i for one will tell anybody that is thinking of using dpd that they would be quicker jumping on a push bike and going to collect their goods themselves as dpd are in one word .... useless !
Package_Service	i had arranged a collection for next_day delivery , but discovered it would not be able to be received the next_day .
Package_Service	i contacted tnt on their chat facility , which is a great idea , and they emailed me back quickly , and took care of everything !
Package_Service	it certainly took some stress out of moving !
Package_Service	would highly_recommend this company to anyone as if your order needed amended , you can be assured it ' s dealt_with promptly .
Package_Service	why bother going to the post_office with long queues and inflated charges for parcels ?
Package_Service	you can even post via parcelforce using interparcel for a fraction of the post_office price .
Package_Service	i have used interparcel twice now and have nothing but praise .
Package_Service	printing the labels is quick easy and then just wait for the courier to come to you !
Package_Service	if you are able to be around to wait for a courier , either at work or home , this is the service you should be using !
Package_Service	the sammie_taylor is very nice customer support
Package_Service	after having past problems with couriers i decided to use parcel0go and i ' m_glad i did .....
Package_Service	i have just had to contact the live_chat support regarding delivery of parcel and "[ name ]" was fantastic !
Package_Service	quick and professional in answering my question .
Package_Service	many_thanks i look_forward to dealing_with you again soon :)
Package_Service	i have an ebay store so it is vital that the courier i choose for heavier goods has an easy to use website , are reliable ( pick_up the items when stated and deliver to a certain deadline ), as well as offer reasonably_priced services .
Package_Service	parcel_hero fulfill all three categories .
Package_Service	they also offer a great discount scheme - the more you use the more discount you receive .
Package_Service	the only negative i can think of is they are not linked to ebay which would make it perfect !
Package_Service	customer_service is really poor with no contact phone number and only online help .
Package_Service	i have had many issues with this company over the years , most_recent being just a few_days when they failed to deliver my parcel despite me providing them with all the relevant_information they needed including two contact numbers for the receiver .
Package_Service	i ' ve had to contact them several_times and each time they have done very little to complete delivery .
Package_Service	the parcel is now sitting in the depot and has been there for over a week !
Package_Service	please avoid this company as they are unprofessional , only amateurs .
Package_Service	[_name ] was extremely_helpful with my enquiry , as a first time user i was finding the whole system very daunting but [_name ] made the whole_thing really simply .
Package_Service	excellent staff_member !
Package_Service	i ' m really bad at filling out forms etc and so went_onto live_chat .
Package_Service	[_name ] was the representative i was assigned to , and she gave me the answers i needed immediately and was very friendly .
Package_Service	it ' s great for companies to have a friendly front line , especially when people like me have questions which are probably very simple and basic .
Package_Service	i imagine people like [_name ] are sick of dealing_with people like myself , but you would never be able to tell .
Package_Service	i ' d like to thank her because my parcel got sent off really quickly and on time , making my day much_easier !
Package_Service	i enjoyed using the site , easy to navigate and exceptional prices .
Package_Service	the online_chat assistant , [_name ] was also very helpful and was able to answer my question pleasantly and fully .
Package_Service	had to go away after booking a collection .
Package_Service	the online team were more_than helpful in changing the collection address .
Package_Service	thanks again !
Package_Service	would highly_recomend this company !
Package_Service	i just spoke to a lady_called catherine and was soo helpfull !
Package_Service	lovely staff a pleasure to deal with
Package_Service	i have no_idea what the other review is on about .
Package_Service	what a truly fantastic customer support_team they have .
Package_Service	i booked two parcels at the same time but had entered the house number wrong on one .
Package_Service	i e_- mailed them and had a reply within minutes ( i ' m not sure how long but it was less_than my other half watching eastenders !
Package_Service	picked_up and delivered without any fuss .
Package_Service	maybe the other review should have tried_contacting them ?
Package_Service	was easy to use and very competitive_prices .
Package_Service	great customer_service from daniel who helped complete my order .
Package_Service	excellent service suitable for working people and fits in easily on the way home from work .
Package_Service	online operator , susie , was very helpful .
Package_Service	they were able to sort out my enquiry very quickly .
Package_Service	many_thanks .
Package_Service	couldn ' t fault the service and efficiency that catherine gave .
Package_Service	would quite happily live_chat with her again !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i was concerned at first as i couldn ' t believe i was sending away high value items for really cheap postage .
Package_Service	i felt very safe after doing some research and felt my parcel had been with me throughout as i had the tracking_number and notifications throughout which put my mind at ease .
Package_Service	was so simple , easy , safe , quick to use .
Package_Service	paid online and went to my nearest shop which was 0mins away at a time that suited me and the whole_process was done within minutes .
Package_Service	i would recommend to anyone .
Package_Service	brillant service !!
Package_Service	!

Package_Service	the courier company required me to print labels .
Package_Service	i wasn ' t able to that , so emma kindly gave me a second option of sending the labels to me .
Package_Service	very helpful indeed !
Package_Service	i had an issue placing an order online and samantha led me through this process online via live_chat !
Package_Service	to be honest it is even better_than communicating through the telephone .
Package_Service	thanks a lot , samantha !
Package_Service	and good luck with the prize draw !
Package_Service	;)
Package_Service	cheers
Package_Service	saved the reference to my pc im delivering and never got an_email from a 0rd_party site .
Package_Service	catherine found my order using my name and email and let me know what is going on within moments .
Package_Service	i was wary of the low price and expected no service support but thankfully i was completely wrong !
Package_Service	thank_you again catherine .
Package_Service	definitely_recommend to others .
Package_Service	when things go_wrong the least you can expect from a company is that they will do all they can to rectify this .
Package_Service	not with p0g .
Package_Service	though i had used them previously and had no need to contact their " customer_service " team when i did , because a package was not delivered within the time_frame for which i paid , i was met with a simple statement that there was nothing they were going to do about it .
Package_Service	i will avoid this company from now on .
Package_Service	when things go_wrong all i expect is that the problem is resolved quickly .
Package_Service	sadly p0g let me down seriously .
Package_Service	i started using p0g late last_year and i have never had a problem and they were the cheapeast out there !
Package_Service	a few day ago i was rather busy and incorrectly typed in my email ( my own fault ) and lost the tracking_number , even_though it was quite hard to find out how to contact p0g as soon as i did sam was a pleasure !
Package_Service	he answered all my questions and more !
Package_Service	i could ' nt have asked for better .
Package_Service	extremly happy not only will i continue to use p0g but i will recmmend them to all of my friends and family .
Package_Service	catherine you was fantastic made everything so easy and explained every detail so there was no confusion i have never booked a courier before but if it is a easy as you have made it today will most defiantly return to you again thanks for all your help and a cheeky smile at the end made it all the more personal thanks again hope you get the recognition you deserve .
Package_Service	kind_regards zoe :)
Package_Service	the staff on live_chat ( hollie , sarah , becky ) were very helpful the polite and friendly and delt with my queries and concerns quickly and thoroughly .
Package_Service	i had a bicycle shipped from new_york .
Package_Service	it cost around £ 0000
Package_Service	it arrived with a dented rim and broken spokes and lost items and after being asked by fedex uk to supply more info and details they basically did nothing for me .
Package_Service	i have spend an extra month sorting_out the repair of this and i have received no compensation for my time .
Package_Service	i have to imagine that the fragile handle with care information on the box was not understood by them .
Package_Service	i would not ship with fedex if i had the choice .
Package_Service	the customer_service lady in the uk was not very helpful either .
Package_Service	first time i used this service and got a bit confused after making payment .
Package_Service	went on to chat with the lovely emma who was very gentle with me and guided me through the process again .
Package_Service	it ' s all very easy when you have someone holding your hand all the way through .
Package_Service	thank_you emma for your help .
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	of a few people i know who have used transglobal express , i have heard only good things about the company - on this basis , i would most definitely_recommend the brand to others .
Package_Service	i have used p0g numerous_times over the past 0 years .
Package_Service	every time i get what was promised and more .
Package_Service	a lot of times there has been an error on my part i . e .
Package_Service	giving the wrong collection address , wrong dimensions etc , but its never been a problem & p0g have always sorted it within minutes .
Package_Service	the live help is the best system i have seen and this has made life so easier and saved me a few bob by not having to make any calls .
Package_Service	the p0g staff are excellent and i am 000_% sure its only about customer_satisfaction for these_guys as they impress me more every time i use them .
Package_Service	and the price for the service you get is pennies compared to other_companies !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	thanks a lot for all your help over the years and i hope you have a merry xmas & a happy new year guys .
Package_Service	just used the parcel0go live_chat service and was amazed at how effective and quick it was .
Package_Service	got through to an agent with minutes .
Package_Service	very nice agent who i came_across ( sammie_taylor ) very very helpful , polite and professional .
Package_Service	must use service ..
Package_Service	thanks once again
Package_Service	[_name ] was really helpful and helped_me sort the problem
Package_Service	daniel dealt great with me , i ' m_glad there is a company in the world which actually cares .
Package_Service	i had a failed pick - up collection yesterday and i wasted the whole day waiting for them to turn_up .
Package_Service	they didn ' t , and i was rather upset by this as i ' ve never had bad_experiences with p0g ever !
Package_Service	i spoke to the chat representative , daniel .
Package_Service	he was a star !
Package_Service	he apologised throughly , and as a good will gesture changed the courier and gave me next_day service , free !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	to put the icing on the cake they also sent me a £ 0 code to use the next time i arrange a courier with them .
Package_Service	talk about spectacular service !
Package_Service	thank_you daniel and thank_you p0g !!
Package_Service	i will always use you for my parcel needs !
Package_Service	happy with service .
Package_Service	customer_service lady was polite and professional .
Package_Service	posted an item which i sold on ebay .
Package_Service	paid for next_day delivery .
Package_Service	it took 0 days for them to collect the item .
Package_Service	it was then never delivered to the buyer and they have stated it has been lost !
Package_Service	its funny now reading all the reviews how the label i printed off to stick on the box told the courier what was inside , hence it being stolen / going missing as it was an expensive amplifier .
Package_Service	parcel0go have not even refunded the cost of the courier let_alone any compensation .
Package_Service	i have emailed them a few_times and had no reply bar an_automated_message_stating customer_service are looking into it - which i never receive a reply .
Package_Service	cant phone them as they dont have a telephone_number listed .
Package_Service	this company is a total_con .
Package_Service	i have read so many reviews about nightmare customer_service , missing / stolen parcels .
Package_Service	this is one company to stay well away from !
Package_Service	unless you want to loose your money and parcel .
Package_Service	i use interparcel for all domestic & most international parcels and find the website very easy to use .
Package_Service	all labels are emailed across to me and tracking_information .
Package_Service	i find the prices very competetive and the couriers reliable .
Package_Service	i currently have a parcel sat in the us with ups who can tell me exactly where the parcel is and is avaliable to be returned to me in uk but it needs interparcel authorisation as the shipper , unfortunately about 0 emails to interparcel i have recieved nothing but sorry abandoned cant help , have you even spoken to ups ??
Package_Service	obviously not they have stated on more_than one_occasion it is there and waiting , i just want my parcel returned it cant be that differcult can it ???
Package_Service	please help !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	needed a quick change of address and a lovely_lady sarah_h sorted the matter in seconds great stuff keep up the good work
Package_Service	i have used this ones , and proceeded a parcel overseas with the help from daniel , the live_chat assistant who ' s being so nice and helpful !
Package_Service	there is no such service like parcel0go .
Package_Service	best prices and best customer_service .
Package_Service	i ' m very satisfied by your representative henry .
Package_Service	he is a great person and give me the best service ever .
Package_Service	also fix my very deep problem in minutes and save me a lot of efforts and time .
Package_Service	go ahed henry .
Package_Service	just booked with p0g service again and entered the wrong delivery adress .
Package_Service	i was able to very quickly talk to william through live_chat and he sorted everything out beyond my expectation .
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	i needed help with the bulk upload tool .
Package_Service	i spoke with catherine_corless who was excellent as usual .
Package_Service	catherine looked at my csv file , found the problem , solved it and then sent me a good example to use in the future .
Package_Service	i am very please with the service that i received from catherine_corless .
Package_Service	the live_chat_function is excellent especially if you get through to catherine !
Package_Service	the live_chat operator kate who i spoke to was pleasant and very quick to ammend a problem i had , would recommend to all :)
Package_Service	i ' ve had a bad_experience both posting and receiving small parcels .
Package_Service	at first i was expecting a delivery which i stayed in for and surprisingly enough it wasn ' t delivered on time so i waited until 0pm next_day and it arrived after i ' d left for work .
Package_Service	only when i got home it hadn ' t ?
Package_Service	no note nothing .
Package_Service	it took me 00 days to track down item which had been left with a neighbour 0 doors away but left me no calling_card .
Package_Service	second occasion i thought i ' d give them another chance .
Package_Service	big_mistake .
Package_Service	item was posted for standard delivery 0 - 0 working_days .
Package_Service	posted on wed should have arrived by fri .
Package_Service	still no sign on saturday so phoned helpline in liverpool to be told i should expect it tuesday .
Package_Service	help_desk person didn ' t even know the difference_between standard and economy delivery times .
Package_Service	also refused to allow me to collect from depot .
Package_Service	very frustrating as it was needed for the saturday_night .
Package_Service	the parcel only had to travel 00 miles so why such a delay ?
Package_Service	next time royal_mail all the way .
Package_Service	usually the service is excellent and trouble free .
Package_Service	when it goes_wrong however due to courier not being_able to find your collection address you can always contact live_chat and have your problem sorted in minutes .
Package_Service	tanya was very helpful today and arranged different courier to come and collect .
Package_Service	she also offered me a quicker service to compensate for the missed collection .
Package_Service	a +
Package_Service	we sent a parcel with a paypal verified address to be told the address could not be found by the courier and the the item had been returned to the uk at an additional_cost to us , without any communication or approval process .
Package_Service	when speaking to customer_service even at supervisor level it was a brick_wall response of its a self tracking service there is nothing i can do .
Package_Service	no approval of cost was made for the return of this item and no attempt to re deliver !
Package_Service	my biggest problem however is the lack of recognition for call to action and response to emails .
Package_Service	so now paid over £_00 to have an item returned to me because a paypal verified address could not be found .
Package_Service	insanely bad !
Package_Service	i have been stuck with my parcel order to namibia , so i have used live_chat option , connected with sammie_taylor - operator , who was an_absolute star , helped_me with my order in a very efficient way , excellent communication and great customer_service skills .
Package_Service	000_% positive_feedback .
Package_Service	will be more_than happy to use your services agin .
Package_Service	thank_you again sammie
Package_Service	well_done
Package_Service	i spoke to richard_mileham , and he was very friendly and helpful , offering me the best solution possiible .
Package_Service	i was able to quickly amend a mistake that was made on my side of the booking , but he helped_me correct that mistake quickly !
Package_Service	overall a very good service for a good price !
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	it is my first time using parcel0go , i ' m trying to ship a parcel to china , from the uk , and am having some questions about the parcel label and tax stuff .
Package_Service	catherine offered me very professional consultant services .
Package_Service	i will place an order soon .
Package_Service	thanks .
Package_Service	two of my collections failed which was not parcel0go fault so i contacted them via live_chat and spoke to james , he was so helpful he offered me a full upgrade to tnt next_day service for free .
Package_Service	parcel0go customer_service is 00 / 00 and this is how it should be done throughout all companies .
Package_Service	great job .
Package_Service	needed to change collection date , used live_chat and instantly got connected .
Package_Service	spoke to tom , he was great !
Package_Service	he changed it straight_away !!
Package_Service	great service
Package_Service	lovely helpful [_name ] :)
Package_Service	i want to get some stand from linc .
Package_Service	but there was problem my client didn ' t had printer to print a label .
Package_Service	paracel0go . com help me to bring my item to my home .
Package_Service	thanks to michelle parcel0go_agent who helped_me to solve my problem
Package_Service	prices are high , the standard of the service - terrible , terrible and terrible .
Package_Service	i used them 0 times , every time they got the wrong_address .
Package_Service	pathetic , they don ' t even have a contact number or an_email address to file a complaint .
Package_Service	can you believe that ?!
Package_Service	when i was looking for it i was rudely turned away .
Package_Service	to save you from ultimately killing one of the ups workers i advise you to never use them .
Package_Service	although being resonably cheap for posting parcels we soon found problems after parcels started going missing , whether this was the websited fault , we dont think so , but after reporting these problems we found our experience with the customer_service team disgraceful , nobody did what they said they would do , they never responded to emails and were rude on live_chat ,, do not use parcel0go !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	the online contact i have dealt_with is sarah .
Package_Service	most online customers services take a while to respond and don ' t help to resolve your issue in real time .
Package_Service	i have not found this with parcels0go ' live_chat '.
Package_Service	i am very happy with the service i have received and will strongly_recommend the service to other ebayers and friends .
Package_Service	i don ' t just give 0_stars for nothing .
Package_Service	great service .
Package_Service	quick and easy to deal with .
Package_Service	all the best
Package_Service	very please with the quick response to the on line help .
Package_Service	[_name ] was very good at sorting_out my problem when i got the weight wrong as i had to re - package my item in a box . a + thanks again sue
Package_Service	amateurs !
Package_Service	booked online for a parcel to go to kenya , collected by tnt and returned by tnt a week_later with no explanation !
Package_Service	turns_out interparcel did not provide correct customs forms - did all and tried again .
Package_Service	0 weeks_later my parcel is stuck in kenya - don ; t know where as interparcel will not respond with anything other than ' we cannot assist you any further ' - customs are charging more_than the value of the parcel , so the collector does not want it !
Package_Service	i believ there has been an error in the customs fee but as interparcel won ' t tell me where it is i can ' t sort it out !
Package_Service	nightmare - can ' t talk to tnt , as interpracel are the " agent " !
Package_Service	all the while the parcel is being charged a storage fee and if it isn ' t collected will be retunred to me at my cost ... and interparcel are trying to wash thier hands of the whole matter no help at all !
Package_Service	i used the service on two occasions .
Package_Service	the first time i sent three packages abroad .
Package_Service	the courier arrived_promptly and the packages reached the destination as scheduled and in perfect_condition .
Package_Service	it was completely hassle - free and i was able to track the progress of the delivery online .
Package_Service	on the second occasion i needed to cancel my order because of a change of circumstances .
Package_Service	i used live_chat via facebook to ask for a refund .
Package_Service	the parcel0go representative who responded to the chat , lloyd , was very polite and friendly , and dealt_with my request for a refund expeditiously .
Package_Service	he provided detailed_information on the refund options and procedure .
Package_Service	based on these two experiences , i have no reservations in recommending the company .
Package_Service	emma couldn ' t have been more helpful .
Package_Service	i have 000 parcels to send to places all over the country and she has made it incredibly easy .
Package_Service	thank_you emma !
Package_Service	booked a collection which failed due to the sender not being at home .
Package_Service	after 0 days of trying to work out a new collection with the sender , parcel0go rebooked , changed the collection address and had it all sorted within a few minutes .
Package_Service	the rep i spoke to , richard , couldn ' t have been any more helpful .
Package_Service	couple the help with the cheap ( cheaper_than royal_mail ) prices and they have to be a winner .
Package_Service	surely ?
Package_Service	i have had a career dealing_with couriers and shippers for fourteen years now , as well as in my life outside of work , and am well aware of the errors , mistakes and other general failings that can occur in getting one thing sent from one location to another .
Package_Service	in my professional life i have been using interparcel for a good period of time and have been very pleased with the efficiency of the service so far .
Package_Service	i need something picked_up and delivered , and it gets done .
Package_Service	reliable is very much the word .
Package_Service	where things have gone wrong they have been in a very small minority , especially when compared with other services that i have used in the past , and have usually been down to the individual driver making an error .
Package_Service	and this is where interparcel truly shine .
Package_Service	the customer_service is uniformly excellent .
Package_Service	wherever a change to an order needs to be made or whenever a fault or mistake needs to chased up , the customer_service team have done nothing but impressed .
Package_Service	emails are answered_quickly , and phone queues are short and answered knowledgeably and confidently .
Package_Service	a recent potential headache was in fact almost turned around by the impeccable actions and service of a becky blythe who was nothing short of exemplary .
Package_Service	interparcel , if you are reading this , please pass this on :
Package_Service	becky works in a service industry where all too often anyone and everyone who can complain will do , but where praise is due very few will make the effort to say anything .
Package_Service	i , and my colleagues here , have been very impressed by becky today , especially_considering it ' s a friday , and i would like you to know just how valuable an asset we consider her to be to you and your company .
Package_Service	0 star service .
Package_Service	i was stoked that sarah managed to change my collection address for same day delivery to another service for pick_up .
Package_Service	she was very friendly and helpfull five_stars
Package_Service	was speeking to katie for all of 0 mins and sorted out my problem i had with my parcel straight_away excellent service will be using again 000_% thanks katie (: a + assistant kind_regards thomas
Package_Service	will be my choice of delivery when shopping with very and other_companies on eligible items , if an item doesn ' t offer collect_+ then i will buy the item elsewhere .
Package_Service	collect_+ delivered on time and more securely than yodel , who certain staff seem to enjoy a kick around with customers parcels ( this can be seen on youtube ) its so easy to use collect_+ when collecting from your local shop and at_least you will know that your parcel is safe .
Package_Service	yodel home delivery couriers ( not all , just the incompetent ones and there are many ) can just continue whatever it is they do swinging from light to light or more like tree to tree like the baboons they are .
Package_Service	no wonder they are rated 00 / 00 uk courier services with a score of 0 . 0 / 00
Package_Service	keep up the good work collect_+ and please never take a leaf_out of their book .
Package_Service	i had a lot of questions to ask before_deciding who to use , sarah_h was very helpful , thank_you
Package_Service	couldn ' t get a delivery confirmed for hong_kong and went on the live_chat and was lucky_enough to chat to sarah_hayes and she was super helpful and efficient at ordering for me online and sending the link so i could pay , all done and a very happy customer here indeedy !
Package_Service	thanks sarah_hayes :-)
Package_Service	sammie_taylor very helpful problem sorted in just a few minutes no hassle .
Package_Service	i regularly use parcel0go to send international packages using dhl as a courier .
Package_Service	the booking process is easy , they have a multitude of payment options , customs paperwork is straight_forward , and the prices are the cheapest i can find .
Package_Service	i have experienced 0 or 0 minor hiccups from the courier side but have had the same problems but when i booked directly through the courier .
Package_Service	the main difference is i paid 00_% less through parcel0go .
Package_Service	i don ' t quite understand the 0 star_ratings for mainly problems relating to pick ups , deliveries and tracking_numbers as parcel0go are simply a booking company not the courier .
Package_Service	i just had the pleasure of dealing_with a lovely , polite and amazingly helpful operative called sammie_taylor .
Package_Service	i had no clue just how easy it would be to change a very important delivery i had scheduled for an item belonging to queen elizabeth ii ' s house of staff which needed to be sent to a different address for an engagement her majesty has this coming week .
Package_Service	sammie_taylor took no time at all dealing_with my change of address and within minutes i had the old address cancelled and the new address included and a new way bill sent to me .
Package_Service	in a nutshell , people like sammie_taylor are doing a great service to the customer_service world and my sincere thanks go out to her / him .
Package_Service	if she / he were stood in front of me now ... i would kiss them !

Package_Service	on the face !
Package_Service	did i mention that i think sammie should get a pay_rise ?
Package_Service	and maybe a little all expenses paid trip to the bahamas ??...
Package_Service	and maybe a reduction in working hours and more holiday time ??
Package_Service	?
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	thank_you p0go and thank_you sammie_taylor ... whoever you are .
Package_Service	jay joseph .
Package_Service	needed to post an expensive item all the way to germany , and [_name ] from parcel0go sorted it all out for me without any_problems , even_though i didn ' t have the full address ( silly me !).
Package_Service	forget going to your local post_office and praying your parcels reach their destinations in one piece , just go to parcel0go and save_yourself time and money !
Package_Service	i deal with one of your advisors catherine_corless she was very polite and helpful and a pleasure to deal with .
Package_Service	ordered an item which was delivered to the wrong_address with no slip posted through our door .
Package_Service	no contact numbers with a real_person to speak to .
Package_Service	would not use ever again and would never order from a company which uses dpd as a courier .
Package_Service	worse than bloody hdnl .
Package_Service	really helpful was daniel , was a bit stressful but problem was solve by daniel with great customers service .
Package_Service	:) recommend to all customers .
Package_Service	great experience with parcel0go , extremely competitive_prices .
Package_Service	good ebay import options and convenient drop_off and collection services .
Package_Service	a query i had with customer_services was resolved extremely efficiently by customer_services advisor sammie_taylor - was a pleasure to deal with and very helpful indeed - thanks sammie !
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	sammie_taylor was very helpful and solved the issue by changing the courier , much_appreciated !
Package_Service	these_guys lost my parcel then took 0 month to do anything about it .
Package_Service	they then did not compensate me for the full_amount and i have lost just over £_000 .
Package_Service	i would spend a little more money and use a company that you can trust to deliver your parcel , and that will do everything to help and compensate should something go_wrong .
Package_Service	been trying to get a parcel picked_up for a whole week now and they still_haven ' t gotten around to doing it .
Package_Service	every time i ask why they just say they don ' t have access to the driver logs .
Package_Service	i would advise against using them at all costs .
Package_Service	*** update ***
Package_Service	the saga continues !
Package_Service	0 days_later and i still_haven ' t received my package .
Package_Service	after going around the houses on the totally unhelpful facebook helpline i decided to get in touch with ups directly ( something which ludicrously p0g cannot do ).
Package_Service	ups gave me clear reasons as to why the parcel had not yet been picked_up , as well as advising as to what needed to be done make_sure it is collected tomorrow .
Package_Service	fingers_crossed it should be sorted now and i should have my package by friday .
Package_Service	my advice : go direct to the supplier , what you save in cost you pay for in customer_service .
Package_Service	transcript from customer_service below

Package_Service	used this service for a parcel to france from the uk .
Package_Service	used their live_chat service and spoke to catherine_corless .
Package_Service	she was incredibly_helpful and pointed_out the right deirection for inputting the delivery address !
Package_Service	many_thanks to her , splendid delivery
Package_Service	i had a problem sending 0 parcels to the highlands and i clicked on the live_chat for help .
Package_Service	catherine_corless assisted me and within minutes and with no effort i found exactly_what i needed .
Package_Service	very good level of customer_service , keep it up !
Package_Service	very good service , cheapest prices i could find and very easy to book .
Package_Service	even when i had a problem and needed to cancel the collection alexandra on the live_chat feature sorted it out really quickly with excellent customer_service , something i can really_appreciate being a retail manager .
Package_Service	easy to compare prices and follow_instructions when sending a parcel within the uk and overseas .
Package_Service	thank_you to sarah_h for her help when asking questions about collection and special instructions .
Package_Service	pleasure to deal with .
Package_Service	have use interpacel multiple_times .
Package_Service	never had any_issues , easy to use and great prices .
Package_Service	very happy with interparcel .
Package_Service	deal with me professionally , friendly and in a manner that was easy to understand ,
Package_Service	i book a collect with myparceldelivery .
Package_Service	that did not happen and no one gave me explanations
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go on many occasions now and just can not fault them for customer_service and price !
Package_Service	if people have trouble with this company then contact them first rather_than slating them as they will go above and beyond to help you !
Package_Service	the transglobal site is undoubtedly one of the best websites i have ever come_across .
Package_Service	my experience was first_class from start to finish and i would recommend transglobal express to anyone_looking for a delivery service they can trust implicitly .
Package_Service	the prices are just right , the customer_service was faultless and the fact that i didn ' t have to endure lengthy phone conversations with call_centre staff made my transaction painless and quite simply , a joy .
Package_Service	simple to book online and compare quotes / services , a breeze to print out the labels and the actual courier service was exemplary - parcel arrived a full three days early !
Package_Service	parcel0go is a great service and fantastic value for money , even better it allowed me to pay through paypal .
Package_Service	it was very quick and easy to get a quote and the delivery time was great even_though i did not pay for next_day delivery .
Package_Service	i would definitely_recommend this service and will be using it again in the future .
Package_Service	thanks sammie for your help today !
Package_Service	using the myparcel website was straightforward with online help available if i got stuck or when i want to post something that is non - standard .
Package_Service	prices are competitive and they are the first website i look at when i need a parcel delivered .
Package_Service	i had a query about my parcel collection and had me worried all day .
Package_Service	got connected to a lovely advisor emily and she was very helpful and solved my problem within a few minutes !
Package_Service	i asked some questions early today .
Package_Service	a staff named rob helped_me about these .
Package_Service	he is so patient about everything and he helped_me find the weight information of what i want to send .
Package_Service	that is a big favour .
Package_Service	brilliant service after i realised my scales were faulty and had mis_- weighed my parcel .
Package_Service	spoke with sammie_taylor on the instant_messaging helpline who was very helpful , confirming i wouldn ' t be charged extra for my mistake .
Package_Service	excellent service all around !
Package_Service	iv had to speak to this company on 0 occasions and i ' m so impressed with their service .
Package_Service	after_reading bad_reviews online i was quite wary .
Package_Service	but kate dealt extremely well with my query this evening and as a goodwill_gesture upgraded me when the error was my fault .
Package_Service	on all three occasions i have spoke to this team i have had immediate , helpful and friendly responses ( the smiley faces make everything seem even nicer ).
Package_Service	i think this is possibly the best customer_service iv received for a long time .
Package_Service	i would recommend this company to anyone ( especially as royal_mail wanted £_00 more to do the same_thing ).
Package_Service	so thank_you parcels0go and kate , steph and sam who iv previously spoke to :-).
Package_Service	leanne
Package_Service	having been able to arrange a same day pick_up was brilliant until we had a problem with our printer and could not print out the parcel label .
Package_Service	the driver who arrived to collect the parcel waited while we attempted to rectify the problem .
Package_Service	eventually our kind neighbour printed the label for us and the driver was able to complete his collection .
Package_Service	an outstanding service without complaint from the driver , well_done and thank_you .
Package_Service	highly_recommend it for people who like to send parcel from the comfort of their home .
Package_Service	collection and delivery service is really easy to arrange and price is reasonable .
Package_Service	today was my third time using p0g .
Package_Service	every_single time the ordering , collection / dropoff ( depending_on how the parcel is despatched ) has been flawless .
Package_Service	the fact you can drop_off your parcel to a local shop ( courier dependant ) and still get a trackable receipt is awesome .
Package_Service	as well as that , out of all three times , it has been cheaper to use p0g than royal_mail and even then , the trackability of the parcels is second to none as you can still track via the actual couriers website if you know where to look .
Package_Service	on top of all this , they have a really well maintained twitter account (@ parcel0go ) that can assist with issues .
Package_Service	my verdict ?
Package_Service	any parcel i have will be going p0g over royal_mail these days .
Package_Service	received excellent service from samantha
Package_Service	great prices , great service !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	got a bit lost on the booking the collection of my parcel , still not sure if it was my fault because first time using this service or the actual website .. but other than that thanks to the live_chat and thanks to daniel managed to rebook the collection of the parcel very quickly and easily .. great service !
Package_Service	used the online_chat for a few questions on what service was best for me - spoke to sarah_h who was incredibly_helpful - gave me all the options and came up with them very quickly .
Package_Service	i was recommended to interparcel through a friend , best price i could find online and the delivery of all my parcels were on time .
Package_Service	no_complaints
Package_Service	i had a problem with my parcel booking , and contacted the customer_service , sarah_hayes who served me and provided a very pro and effective service , the parcel was re - book by her correctly , all done under 00 min .
Package_Service	good job
Package_Service	after having trouble with my account and printing i contacted the live_chat with 0 representatives the first was sarah she was very helpful , though unfortunately we were unable to fix the problem , however she did sent me everything i didn ' t receive via_email which was excellent .
Package_Service	i then spoke to beck who helped_me fix my account and got me up and running for any future parcels .
Package_Service	thank_you very much to both girls .
Package_Service	aces , happy with the service , rob was a knowledgable agent .
Package_Service	a +
Package_Service	the service i got from sammie_taylor was excellent and would defiantly use them again due to her excellent service .
Package_Service	parcel to go not only offers a wide_range of delivery companies it is excellent on price .
Package_Service	they ' re communication is second to none and very customer friendly and only to happy to help .
Package_Service	finally found a company that has the customer in mind .
Package_Service	would highly_recommend .
Package_Service	if you want a means of getting an item couriered , be sure to check these_guys out .
Package_Service	their online interface is easy to navigate and use and they can do some really superb prices .
Package_Service	it ' s not often that we send items off but if we do , i use parcels0go every time !
Package_Service	i would keep away from them spent 0 hr on there support chat just to cancel my order and keep my money
Package_Service	go to a another delivery company there are many more that you can speak to over the phone
Package_Service	no phone support only live_chat that take all your time up and don ' t understand you
Package_Service	catherine was quite helpful , provided excellent service , highly_recommended :)
Package_Service	buy , print , ship , no hassle and delivered on time .
Package_Service	in honesty i havent always had the best service from live help and it has sometimes been very frustrating .
Package_Service	i have been using this service for hundreds of parcels though and they are generally very good .
Package_Service	spoke with lizzie today and i have to admit , the customer_service is definately on the up - fast and efficient , friendly etc , she has definately improved my opinion of p0g from 0_stars to 0_stars .
Package_Service	thanks again
Package_Service	logged_into chat and got assistance by emma , really helpful thankyou , liam
Package_Service	you were very helpful
Package_Service	i would like to thank catherine for her assistance today via the chat window facility on your website .
Package_Service	i ' m not too sure if she was real or a robot .
Package_Service	but she was bloody quick and god dam helpful .
Package_Service	thank_you for your help , and i look_forward to using you again in the near_future .
Package_Service	emily earp is a star , pleasant and polite service .
Package_Service	my parcel was delivered on time , was quick and easy .
Package_Service	very pleased with the service .
Package_Service	would recommend them to anyone .
Package_Service	thanks

Package_Service	i found sammie_taylor very helpful and was able to re - arrange the collection with the minimum of fuss
Package_Service	brilliant site , sarah_hayes is great , very helpful .

Package_Service	top 0 / 0 service .
Package_Service	katie was very helpful , she helped_me fix the problem step by step without losing her patience .
Package_Service	excellent customer_service .
Package_Service	i used the online_chat_function and spoken with michelle .
Package_Service	she was very easy and extremely_helpful from the outset .
Package_Service	her language was friendly and not condesending like most so it was a real breath of fresh_air .
Package_Service	the information provided was exactly_what i needed to know .
Package_Service	all in all a great service from michelle
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	ed
Package_Service	excellent service , prompt and very helpful , will_definitely being using again !
Package_Service	i waited in all day after paying over £_00 yesterday to have my parcel collected today between the hours of 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 what a waste disgraceful no way of contacting them on the website in the manner of a live_chat assistant or anything just a series of questions and had to rebook my parcel for tomorrow and hope they can be bothered to turn_up today .
Package_Service	i normally use myhermes and they have been perfect every time .
Package_Service	i only used this company as my parcel was too big for a myhermes .
Package_Service	£_00 and a wasted day not very happy_bunny at all .
Package_Service	safe to say do not use this company !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	just got my order details through for re - booking .
Package_Service	i now have a new tracking_number so i will have to go and update my ebay account , inform my customer why i ' ve changed the tracking_number and why it will be late , and also print off another label and remove all the packaging as the old slip is on the inside as well as the outside as per their recommendation .
Package_Service	absolutely_useless !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	t
Package_Service	my very first order , i had managed to place the information in the right boxes , however couldn ' t seem to find how to pay .
Package_Service	possibly clicked the wrong curser ?
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	katie came to my rescue on the instant chat service and within 0 minutes i was all paid up and parcel good to go !
Package_Service	many_thanks .
Package_Service	de sender bare et brev 0 dage_efter den skulle have blevet afleveret , om at de_har_været forbi , og at der_ikke var nogle hjemme ... hvilket var løgn .
Package_Service	( hvis de_havde været der kunne de jo bare lægge en sedl i postkassen )
Package_Service	det firma der har sendt pakken til_mig , har nu også fyret gls på baggrund af at de gentagende gange ikke_har afleveret deres pakker .
Package_Service	just want to say a big thanks to jenny @ parcel0go online help , she helped_me with all my queries really quickly and knew_exactly_what she was talking_about enabling me to send my first parcel via this website !
Package_Service	thanks again !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	once again i have encounter the best service in ordering a collection of a parcel , i will be useing parcel0go again and again very nice people and fantastic quick reliable service , thanks guy ' s :)
Package_Service	superb service .
Package_Service	courteous , efficent and trustworthy - and cheap enough to help you keep your hard_earned profits .
Package_Service	parcel0go were great .
Package_Service	the agent on live_chat peter helped_me arrange for a cancellation quickly and efficiently .
Package_Service	i always use parcel0go but in this case the manufacturer of a faulty product arranged to get the item picked_up for free and so i had to cancel my order with parcel0go .
Package_Service	great website and great prices ... highly_recommended
Package_Service	i ' m so glad i did not write a positive review after the first 0 webchats as it did not solve any_problems .
Package_Service	my parcel was picked_up by the courier on monday the 00th_november at 0pm .
Package_Service	so happens i chose myhermes through parcel0go to send this parcel to northern_ireland as this lady has bid and won a toy stroller through ebay .
Package_Service	it was my usual courier guy that came to picked_up as he usually delivers all my other parcels from next , dp etc .
Package_Service	so all fine and dandy .
Package_Service	i didnt think nothing of it .
Package_Service	monday 0nd of december , i got a message from the buyer asking if i know where her parcel is .
Package_Service	i checked on the online tracking on hermes & parcel0go website , both stated friday 00th_november at 0am out for delivery .
Package_Service	date time status
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 awaiting courier receipt
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 out for delivery
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 hub sorter receipt scan
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 sent to myhermes central hub
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 collected
Package_Service	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 pick - up request manifested
Package_Service	tuesday came , the buyer messaged me again as she still_hasn ' t received it .
Package_Service	spoke to a representative , all she said was they will update me between 00 - 00_hours .
Package_Service	wednesday came , still no emails as it ' s been 00_hours .
Package_Service	so tried my luck again , webchat with the same person , told me the same_thing 00 - 00_hours .
Package_Service	i was very stressed out by this time and my husband helped_me to ring parcel0go and also hermes & myhermes .
Package_Service	the same agent spoke to my husband on the phone and basically told him the same_thing , there is no updates , she doesn ' t know where the parcel is waiting for updates .
Package_Service	she offered claims_form .
Package_Service	my husband , who works in delivery company himself , won ' t give up .
Package_Service	he remembered there ' s a hermes depot near his work place and he walked there during his lunch hour to try his luck .
Package_Service	he was very lucky that they allowed him in and the staffs there were fantastic and helpful as it was not meant for walk - in customers / enquiries .
Package_Service	they managed to track the parcel and told my husband it is at the hermes belfast depot .
Package_Service	so i told the buyer and asked if she is able to get to belfast but she said its more_than an_hour ' s drive away , so not really easy for her with her 0 young children in tow .
Package_Service	she also tried to ring the next_day and all they told her was your company will email me .
Package_Service	no emails still i decided to webchat again .
Package_Service	this time i could not hold it in anymore and just wanted the number of hermes belfast depot , that was all i asked for as there was still no updates , no one could tell me anything .
Package_Service	i remember the names of all the representatives i spoke to , and i had to be passed on to another lady because the first one ran out of the same excuse to give me .
Package_Service	i was told parcel0go do not have any courier depot numbers , all they can do is just communicate to their courier through email .
Package_Service	i was told to wait_till_monday .
Package_Service	after this webchat , i was again sent a claims_form through email .
Package_Service	monday came , through webchat , still no updates .
Package_Service	i decided to fill in the claims_form .
Package_Service	tuesday the claims were being reviewed and i had to submit proof of how much this lady paid on ebay , proof of collection and proof that she did not receive it .
Package_Service	yesterday i had 0 offers for compensation , if i opt for payment through bacs i get exactly_what the buyer paid for .
Package_Service	if i opt for ' pre_- pay ' i get extra £ 0 .
Package_Service	at first i thought , ok parcel0go is willing to give me extra £ 0 to compensate me for my lost item , and the rest for the buyer .
Package_Service	but no , the pre_- pay was to be paid into parcel0go account for future_bookings through them .
Package_Service	i must be crazy to even look at their website ever again .
Package_Service	the buyer has been sympathetic and understood that i have tried all i could .
Package_Service	if i can fly to belfast myself , get that parcel from the hermes depot there and deliver it to her , i would !
Package_Service	but then why did i pay parcel0go for ?
Package_Service	i have refunded the buyer her money and who is going to give me back my item ?
Package_Service	it was brand_new in box , not used , unopened .
Package_Service	so its unbelievable for me to see all these 0 star_ratings !
Package_Service	the buyer has said that if it still at the belfast depot , if she has to she will try to drive there to get it herself - if someone can now confirm properly to her .
Package_Service	my husband works in a delivery company and has explained to me .
Package_Service	by looking at the tracking updates : which hermes delivery person did that delivery on friday the 00th of november , obviously has it and didn ' t return with a signature and hasn ' t tried ever since or the parcel has mysteriously vanished in the depot .
Package_Service	if you can find this parcel and deliver it to the buyer , i will happily give u back the money you compensate and the buyer has said so herself she rather have the toy for her little girl as its a christmas_present .
Package_Service	i placed a collection through parcel0go today , then due to unforeseen_circumstances i needed to cancel .
Package_Service	i contacted the live help team and got through to a gentleman called richard who was very helpful .
Package_Service	my collection was cancelled within a minute and my refund was put into process .
Package_Service	i couldn ' t be more happier .
Package_Service	i use parcel0go all the time and i ' ve never had any_problems , the whole_process is very easy .
Package_Service	very good customer_service .
Package_Service	very friendly and easy to talk to .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	ok i am extremely angry now .
Package_Service	i tried to explain the situation on their facebook_page but instead of offering help they deleted my post twice !!!
Package_Service	i have taken screenshots before and after i posted to prove it .
Package_Service	so not only have i ended_up with a very unhappy customer and my reputation has been tarnished but they don ' t want to help me and want to hide it from customers .
Package_Service	i will fully explain the situation here instead :
Package_Service	on friday 00 / 00 / 00 i used parcel0go to book a ups courier via their drop_off point .
Package_Service	i needed the parcel to get to the customer by 0pm the following wednesday as he had a leaving party then as he was leaving the country the next_day .
Package_Service	i was asked to provide a telephone_number for the customer when booking .
Package_Service	i assumed this meant if there was any_problems for the delivery they would contact the customer .
Package_Service	wrong .
Package_Service	the customer received no calls or texts whatsoever .
Package_Service	it gets to wednesday and it still_hasn ' t arrived so i contact ups .
Package_Service	they tell me they have a different address to the one i ordered with .
Package_Service	i check my confirmation_email from parcel0go and it has the correct address on it .
Package_Service	ups say they will try and make an_emergency delivery by 0pm wednesday but they fail to do so .
Package_Service	the customer gave up waiting just past 0pm and left for his party without any of the decorations i sent him .
Package_Service	so here i am ...
Package_Service	i have lost money on the delivery , my parcel is in a ups warehouse in london and my customer isn ' t happy .
Package_Service	my business reputation is tarnished and i am just waiting for bad feedback and it ' s all because of human error somewhere along the line which was not down to me .
Package_Service	i asked on the parcel0go facebook_page for help and explained the situation and they deleted my post twice .
Package_Service	disgusting service .
Package_Service	booked easy and quickly .
Package_Service	even when i got the address wrong , the chat agent samantha sorted it out for me right away .
Package_Service	very impressed with the level of service .
Package_Service	catherine replied immediately and was very helpful .
Package_Service	item was lost in transit and fobbed me off with excuse after excuse on why they couldn ' t pay out on any claim filed .
Package_Service	fantastic customer_service , second to none by sarah_hayes .
Package_Service	she was very helpful and filled me with confidence , a credit to your team !
Package_Service	clare
Package_Service	first thing you come_across is the quick quote button .
Package_Service	enter your details , press quote button , watch all options pop up and select the right one for you .
Package_Service	complete payment details , print off label , job_done !
Package_Service	it really is as easy as that .
Package_Service	will be using the service for all of our companies parcel requirements from now on .
Package_Service	sam sorted out all of our problems via the twitter site !
Package_Service	thankyou
Package_Service	i spoke with sammie_taylor who quickly responded and gave me all the vital information i required :)
Package_Service	due to an internet time out i acidentally duplicated my order .
Package_Service	i logged_onto parcel0go ' s live_chat feature and my problem was very quickly rectified by richard_mileham .
Package_Service	i am very impressed with the service you provide and am now even more impressed with your customer_service ( as long as that money is back in my account within 0 days , otherwise i will take it all back !).
Package_Service	i also appreciated the offer of an enhanced amount i could leave in credit on my account and found the advice on what to do if the courier company still tried to collect both orders very useful and reassuring .
Package_Service	i have been using collect_+ for just over a year for my business needs .
Package_Service	i love having a collect_+ drop_off point around the corner , easy to use .
Package_Service	parcels have been collected and tracked with ease , only 0 customers have complained about boxes looking squashed but items inside are ok as i wrap everything well .
Package_Service	all in all so far very happy but one thing i would like is the offer of next_day delivery and also more discounts for small_businesses like mine as i use them a lot but had no discounts :)
Package_Service	i just want to point out that i am evaluating the chat support feature on the website .
Package_Service	i was helped by william , who put_together a quote for me , was very helpful and friendly .
Package_Service	i needed to find a service that would allow me to drop_off at weekends or late at night .
Package_Service	william knew_exactly_what i needed to know and within about 0 mins my prayers were answered with a tailor made excellent value quote .
Package_Service	he even found a number of drop_off points super local to me .
Package_Service	if you need something sending and you are too busy to have the stuff collected pop onto parcel0go website and use the chat feature to get a tailor made quote .
Package_Service	i am really glad that i did .
Package_Service	interparcel are no good for sending parcels you are better off sending them with the couriers directly .
Package_Service	mistakes_happen i have no problem with this and i will allow them to correct those mistakes .
Package_Service	however i had a collection booked for a tuesday the courier did not turn_up all interparcel could do was arrange another collection for the next working day which they did but the parcel was still not picked_up and again all interpacel could do was arrange for the next working day .
Package_Service	so the parcel was collected and this is where the problems really began as the parcel was then lost i contacted interparcel who chased with the courier .
Package_Service	i was told i would receive a phone call to tell me what was going on 00_hours_later no phone call .
Package_Service	i then rang to be told that unless the couriers update them they would not get back to me and they would chase again with the couriers .
Package_Service	00_hours_later still no response .
Package_Service	again contacted interparcel and again advised would need to wait for the couriers to respond to the email .
Package_Service	we are now 0 days since i contacted interparcel and we still have had no contact from interparcel and still have no_idea where the item is .
Package_Service	the tracking_number is now blank with no information on it .
Package_Service	what a joke of a company no customer_service skills what so ever .
Package_Service	unable to pick_up the phone and chase the courier has to be done on a online system even when the couriers do not respond .
Package_Service	you might as well cut out the middle_man and get a direct account with the couriers as these_guys only make things worse as they are unable to chase anything at_least when dealing_with the couriers direct you can phone them and find out where the parcel is in 0 minutes .
Package_Service	now have a account directly with a courier and will not be useing interparcel in the future
Package_Service	you don ' t need to worry_about postal service , just few_clicks will solve all your queries .. great work guys !!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	good friendly staff who are happy to help , provided a good service
Package_Service	happy with interpacel services
Package_Service	after needing to change my parcel booking i immediately sought out some way of amending it or contacting someone to do this for me , changing it online was impossible , finding a number on their website impossible too .
Package_Service	i managed to find a phone number which isn ' t used any more , they prompted me to try the live_chat on their website , which doesn ' t exist .
Package_Service	eventually i found a live_chat service via their facebook_page , a good idea and the agent was very helpful but this could have been a 0 star_rating if they make it easier to contact .
Package_Service	they did not collect my packet + they did not refund me .
Package_Service	i have booked a collection but they did not come to collect my order .
Package_Service	they wrote me : collection between_0am to 0pm .
Package_Service	i phoned to them several_times buy they never answered .
Package_Service	i wrote several emails and they answered they were late and they were going to collect after 0pm .
Package_Service	they never collect my packet .
Package_Service	avoid this company if you do not want a pacemaker .
Package_Service	it is a waste of time and money .
Package_Service	( my 0st ever review ) i had to cancel a parcel order today that i booked by mistake so i went on p0go ' s ' livechat ', there i was greeted warmly by emma who resolved my query within a couple of minutes with no_fuss !
Package_Service	i would highly_recommend this company & livechat is a fantastic way of resolving any_problems or getting advice on how to get the best from their service .
Package_Service	thankyou emma - nice , friendly & helpful representatives such as her make all the difference !
Package_Service	( david , very frequent p0go customer )
Package_Service	had issues with my parcel collection , i could not hand over the parcel to the driver on time , ashley from parcel0go re - arranged the collection within few seconds !!
Package_Service	was very happy with the speed of the service ashley provided and was very helpful in dealing_with my other queries too !
Package_Service	a credit to parcle0go for having a ++++ employee !
Package_Service	thankyou
Package_Service	i ' ve left my original review below but things have not gone as well this time .
Package_Service	two parcels were collected from the same address for delivery but got split up , only one delivered to me on the 0th_oct .
Package_Service	first contact with live help agent that evening was as my original review ( below .)
Package_Service	i was told the two parcels were separated at the depot and would probably come tomorrow - also that this sometimes happens .
Package_Service	tomorrow came and went , no parcel .
Package_Service	again contacted live help agent who promised to email me after they had contacted the courier for information - so apparently the courier now has the parcel and not the depot ?
Package_Service	most of the day went by with no email .
Package_Service	i contacted late evening to ask what was happening - told that the courier could not be contacted , my separated parcel was probably on the way .
Package_Service	repeated contacts , repeatedly told to hang on .
Package_Service	both parcels were collected together on the 0th of october , one arrived alone ( clearly and repeatedly marked ' 0 of 0 ') on the 0th of october and its now the 00th with no sign of the second .
Package_Service	less_than gruntled .
Package_Service	first review which i posted 0th_oct and reflected my previous experiance of parcel0go follows ...
Package_Service	had several parcels delivered by parcel0go now and no_problems at all .
Package_Service	a couple of times i ' ve had questions that were answered late evening by them via live_chat ( jessica was friendly and helpful just 0 mins ago which prompted me to post this review .)
Package_Service	i ' m usually having glassware delivered so this was initially a concern as you can imagine !
Package_Service	not a single breakage or even dented box !
Package_Service	pay attention post_office !
Package_Service	thouroughly recommend .
Package_Service	[_name ] was very helpful in sorting_out a parcel to be sent internationally , very easy and friendly to deal with and good prices !
Package_Service	jamie
Package_Service	sammie_taylor , one of the most helpful staff , nothing can be expressed by language , just feel thankful , great !
Package_Service	sammie !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	[_name ] answered my questions swiftly and with no complications at all , thank_you very much !
Package_Service	i tried different companies before and nobody in the country can beat interparcel .
Package_Service	never had a problem !
Package_Service	needed to ask a question , used the online_chat .
Package_Service	daniel and catherine were very helpful .
Package_Service	perfect communication with this company , no problem , 0 star company
Package_Service	laurenm was very helpful when i called , helping me out with the best overall solution for me and also provided valuable information on the products available .
Package_Service	thanks [_name ] for the great service .
Package_Service	quick and very positive ...
Package_Service	i had to rebook a delivery and they were really helpfull , thankyou lloyd for all the help
Package_Service	exceptional online customer_service from the lovely katie who was very quick to answer my question and offer assistance .
Package_Service	website and very easy to use and prices are great !
Package_Service	needed to cancel an order and get a refund and was processed within minutes .
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	had a query about a delivery so went on to live_chat and straight_away i was helped out by an adviser called sammie , went out of way to help me and was very polite , solved my query no_messing would like to thank sammie for all your help wish other firms would take a leaf_out of your book ,
Package_Service	thank_you once again
Package_Service	a dash can mean the difference_between failure & success . it may seem straightforward but you have to know how . i was having problems having to get a parcel dashed off to brazil & despite several_attempts the parcel0 go system would not accept the postcode .
Package_Service	knowing the postcode & format was correct & being in arush to get the parcel accepted for collection i noticed a chat line button which i have never needed previously .
Package_Service	a lady by the name of emma appeared & sorted my problem in a dash , in fact the problem was a dash , the dash in the postcode format needed to be removed .
Package_Service	it ; s simple when you know how .
Package_Service	thankyou you emma .
Package_Service	placed an order for collection and found out details of order was placed wrongly .
Package_Service	was worried_about wasting the order who_knows the excellent customer_service , emma was the person assisted me who did not hesitate to solve the problem .
Package_Service	the amazing thing was the whole_process only took a few minutes , very efficient service !
Package_Service	would definitely_recommend to friends .
Package_Service	catherine sorted me out , after trudging through a quagmire of prices and offers online .
Package_Service	she arranged for collection and delivery exactly when i required it , nothing was a bother to her .
Package_Service	will_definately use this service again as i send a lot of parcels up to chester on a regular_basis .
Package_Service	will recommend to my friends aswell .
Package_Service	the quick quote decided it didn ' t like my shipment , the live_chat operator , remi , fixed it very quickly without a problem , despite me cancelling the chat_session a few_times because of hitting the back shortcut on my mouse !
Package_Service	i ' ve been using them for some time now , the only issue i ' ve had is with a lost parcel with yodel and the subsequent claim took some time , most_likely because p0g have to work with the couriers to sort it out .
Package_Service	it is worth bearing in mind , with some of the reviews below , missed deliveries or collections are not p0g ' s fault but that of the couriers .
Package_Service	p0g book the couriers on your behalf but are not involved with the collection or subsequent delivery .
Package_Service	we ' ve had a number of missed collections , notably with citilink but it was always very easy to re - book a collection and p0g gave a discount_voucher upon complaint .
Package_Service	very pleased , i was slightly unsure of how this worked as i had never used a service like this before - have always gone to the post_office .
Package_Service	started a chat with catherine on live_chat and she helped_me through the whole_process , double_checked everything and pointed_out a cheaper option too .
Package_Service	cannot complain and hope to use these again
Package_Service	emma was really good specially for a foring person i really apreciate her help :_d
Package_Service	very helpful , quick responses .
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	used few_times no troubles
Package_Service	ordered my item on 0th !
Package_Service	its 00th now n still_waiting !
Package_Service	parcels delivered by yodel so i need say no more .
Package_Service	update on parcel .
Package_Service	still not received parcel its now 00th !
Package_Service	call them they say its stuck in depo & email to get it onto a van .
Package_Service	stay clear of this type of courier if you want o keep customers !
Package_Service	i always use parcel0go , i normally book city_link 00 hour delivery - never has it taken more_than 00_hours !
Package_Service	if ever there is a problem ( normally not at all ) but whatever you need help with the customer_service team are invaluable , always ready to help and very quick with a reply and solution .
Package_Service	i would recommend them to anyone and everyone .
Package_Service	many_thanks to all those that work hard at p0go .

Package_Service	x
Package_Service	just wanted to tell my experience with parcel0go , sent a parcel through parcel0go with collect_plus which i believe use yodel , i sent it off on 00th of april and got delivered the next_day !
Package_Service	i was told it was meant to be 0 - 0working_days so next_day was a big surprise to me .
Package_Service	i don ' t normally leave_feedback however on this occasion i thought it would be good for other people using this company as sometimes you hear a lot of negative_reviews of parcel companies .
Package_Service	i send hundreds of parcels through this company every week which exemplifies it ' s worth particularly as an online_retailer with limited face to face interaction , distribution has to be of a 00 %+ standard and parcel0go fulfills this peace of mind .
Package_Service	sammy_taylor is a valuable asset to the company and one of the more ' lively ' team members who lets you know it ' s not just words on a screen dealing_with your requests .
Package_Service	[_name ] who dealt_with my query was most helpful , she was able to solve my problem quickly and with no hassle .
Package_Service	wow .
Package_Service	is all i have to say .
Package_Service	it was so simple putting in my specs , lovely ups woman came and picked_up the parcels at 0pm monday , both parcels arrived to their destinations tuesday 00am .
Package_Service	the pricing was £_00 . 00 and i just can ' t complain at that , at all .
Package_Service	they are responsive to their networking sites / review sites ( always a positive , shows they actually care about their reputation )
Package_Service	bloody fantastic tracking , absolutely ideal for ebay / gumtree / online selling .
Package_Service	would love to see some sort of phone / sms implementation to text the recipient when their package is coming ( dpd do that , it ' s awesome ).
Package_Service	does parcelhero handpick their delivery drivers ?
Package_Service	i ' ve never had a woman from ups before , when i had extremely bad dealings with ups i had some fat ballbag that normally dropped my parcels .
Package_Service	i received very quick , helpful and adequate customer_service from sam on the facebook_page and was pleasantly_surprised actually !
Package_Service	thanks once again for the help !
Package_Service	very helpful and efficient never a problem
Package_Service	tried to send a parcel off to a relative in russia but apparently the address needed to be to a company address rather_than a residential address and the package was sent back .
Package_Service	i asked for a refund and was refused it , had to go through barclays who will be doing an investigation into the matter .
Package_Service	i used them and my package has disappeared , order status was in transit for over a month , when i contact their customer_service , they asked me to prove if the parcel was picked_up although the tracking history says it was so !
Package_Service	i recently mistyped a parcel , but getting in touch with their customer_service i was able to sort out my parcel issues in no time at all !
Package_Service	my customer rep [_name ], was an_absolute star and sorted the issue out straight_away .
Package_Service	i would highly_recommend the website and its representatives and service .
Package_Service	have used a few_times without a problem and then when i had a problem with one of their couriers they were able to sort it within 0 mins .
Package_Service	no holding on on teh phone , no costly 00 numbers and no automated_messages .
Package_Service	simply fast excellent customer_service .
Package_Service	highly_recommend !
Package_Service	very quick delivery , proffesional service
Package_Service	spoke with catherine great lady very helpful and polite very understanding if you have problem and need to re order 00hrs before collection so perfect for ebay much superior to parcel_monkey been using now for 0 mths hassle_free except the people i buy stuff off ( on ebay ) i will always be back at_least once a month keep up the great work parcel to go !
Package_Service	and of course hermes look_forward to ordering again soon
Package_Service	samantha looked after my needs and sent over the info i needed immediately
Package_Service	thanks you bhavika for your help .
Package_Service	that ' s quick and easy .
Package_Service	i did a mistake by giving the wrong postcode and they just help me to change and rebook the new collection date .
Package_Service	damaged my goods even_though i packaged my parcel impeccably .
Package_Service	crummy live service .
Package_Service	the customer care member was very reluctant when i asked for the link for trust_pilot ( which they always give you at the end of your chat if you are a satisfied customer ) .
Package_Service	i will never use again and neither should you .
Package_Service	rubbish !!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i was struggling with working out how i should send my parcels and clicked on the link to chat to operator .
Package_Service	catherine went through all my questions , but then also offered to complete my order for me as she had all the info !
Package_Service	this was great customer_service and helped_me to place the order there and then , rather_than worrying that i had not filled the info out correctly .
Package_Service	thanks catherine !
Package_Service	i have used them three times now .
Package_Service	and no problem whatsoever .
Package_Service	what can i say i had a small issue with booking a parcel for delivery i contacted the help chat team and was greeted_by sarah_hayes who quickly resolved the issue and then also offered to complete the details for me what fab customer_service from sarah she completed the full details and placed the collection for me in 0 minutes fantastic service thx again to sarah_hayes if only every company had customer_service agents like sarah , parcel0go excellent service all_round
Package_Service	it was easy to talk over the chat option so was a great help thanks to emma
Package_Service	samantha saved the day after yodel let me down for the 00th time , waited in all day once again for yodel not to turn_up .
Package_Service	samantha was very , very helpful in sorting the issue and switching the parcel to another company ( tnt )
Package_Service	i will not be using yodel ever again as they are totally unreliable !
Package_Service	i placed my order on monday via parcel_force with an undeliverable cheapest price for my 00 " lcd .
Package_Service	and received on wednesday i contacted about some problem like address closing soon they gave me excellent service without any_problems amazing so far .
Package_Service	i got out class customer_service from catherine_corless , she is a star *****
Package_Service	the customer_service i received was outstanding , i thought being late and it closing at 00 that i was going to get flogged off however the agent was very helpful and sorted my problems for me .
Package_Service	polite and friendly tone was used and everything is okay now .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	wow just had a problem and sammi was so so helpfull gotta get sammi to help me again and a easy site to post all my shop items thank_you natalie
Package_Service	excellent service s usual .
Package_Service	emma always takes care of everything , have asked her to sort out the tracking every time .
Package_Service	all good around and will use again soon ,
Package_Service	all be it , text talk rather_than phone support daniels service is second to none !
Package_Service	a pleasurable experience and restored my faith in parcels0go when you have staff as assistive as him !
Package_Service	an asset to the company .
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	ansplutelt disgusted with this company .
Package_Service	shipped two small bedside_tables that were very well_packaged and they arrived smashed to smithereens , legs missing , corners knocked off , obliterated .
Package_Service	although they would cost £_000 to replace , i had not insured them fully so put in a claim for £_00 , the maximum i could .
Package_Service	even that got rejected , despite photo evidence .
Package_Service	would have had better luck tying them to the back of a bus to transport them .
Package_Service	beware .
Package_Service	i needed a problem clearing up and the help they gave cleared it up without problems and was quick and friendly service !
Package_Service	the person who helped_me was very friendly and down to earth , excellent
Package_Service	easy way to get your things sent , great customer_service from sam via the facebook_page have used parcel0go a few_times and would recommend them to anyone :)
Package_Service	on live_chat catherine was polite and patient .

Package_Service	excellent service thank_you very much .
Package_Service	helpful professional and very attentive .
Package_Service	would highly_recommend
Package_Service	great service provided by sammie_taylor !!!
Package_Service	solved all my issues nice and easy
Package_Service	i wanted to deliver a parcel and never thought that it will be so easy and cheep with parcel0go .
Package_Service	everything was very smooth and fast ( collection / delivery ).
Package_Service	however i had a problem with delivery issue as the recipient didn ' t get the item though tracking_number showed ' delivered with neighbours signature '.
Package_Service	but very helpful people , particularly jessica who i was chatting with me , dealt_with the problem and solved in a very short time .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	you guys are way above any other courier company i have used .
Package_Service	thanks catherine for all the advise this evening on the parcel to south_africa .
Package_Service	got the answer i needed , lauren_w answered my question quickly and professionally .
Package_Service	i needed help with changing the details of a label i had purchased .
Package_Service	using the instant_messaging help service , a friendly and very knowledgeable advisor ( sammie_taylor ) sorted the problem in minutes !
Package_Service	very efficient , very helpful and much_appreciated !
Package_Service	never had a problem with parcel0go and always found their customer support excellent !
Package_Service	i booked for a parcel to be collected however the courier ( yodel ) did not show up to collect the parcel , i emailed p0d and they arranged another collection with yodel again .
Package_Service	once again they did not turn_up .
Package_Service	so i emailed p0d again and asked them to change the courier as yodel did not seem to want my business .
Package_Service	they did this and the same day the new courier ( parcel_force ) collected the item !
Package_Service	the customer_service is fantastic and i will_definitely use p0d again .
Package_Service	i dealt_with richard_mileham who helped_me with my item going missing , i have now been approved a refund , no hassle and brilliant service , many_thanks

Package_Service	however the item didn ' t deliver until january 00th and then the jamaica fedex were charging the recipient $ 00000 . 00 for the delivery .

Package_Service	[_name ] was so helpful and so quick to solve my own mix_up and it was all done through chat online .
Package_Service	she ' s sorted it all out for me and made everything easy for me .
Package_Service	i will_definately use this service again !
Package_Service	spoke to emily on live_chat just now regarding rescheduling my collection that was due to be collected tomorrow for after xmas instead .
Package_Service	she was very helpful and rescheduled my collection for me there and then very happy thankyou emily :)
Package_Service	andrew helped_me fix a few problems on my account .
Package_Service	fantastic service !
Package_Service	thank_you !
Package_Service	after missing my collection time twice i used the live_chat tool , a lady named samantha was very helpful with assisting me with my order , she told me my nearest shop i could use to drop_off and sent me my new label , now i dont have to worry_about missing my time again and my parcel will reach its destination tomorrow !!
Package_Service	perfect !
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	my company use parcel0go quite a lot and find them very officiant .
Package_Service	kirsty crowe is the person who usually deals with us and i have to say , she is a very hard working girl .
Package_Service	she is always very helpful and friendly , and tries her hardest to accommodate us .
Package_Service	i would have no problem reccommending parcel0go to anyone .
Package_Service	i too have received awful service from collectplus , twice in a week , the first item arrived completely damaged after being thrown over a 0ft fence in different packaging to what i had used , they refunded me for the damage but nothing else , so i now have a completely_useless item that cost me over £_00 which is useless .
Package_Service	the second item has simply vanished , and they are refusing to offer me a refund , after an official claim and complaint they say the item wasn ' t covered in the terms and conditions , it was simply a bottle of aftershave that has clearly been stolen by one of the couriers .
Package_Service	i will be taking both issues further legally if need be .
Package_Service	brilliant .
Package_Service	seemlessly smooth process with very a very friendly staff to always help whenever a problem should arise .
Package_Service	all my parcels have arrived safe and sound , and within the time limit .
Package_Service	excellent !
Package_Service	i used parcel 0 go two_weeks_ago and it was a truly_awful decision , i will inform people to stay_away from this company .
Package_Service	i had my parcel ( intended for the u . s ) collected by the usp driver ..... all was fine to start with ... the driver looked at the customs documents i had printed and said everything was ok , it will arrive at the destination in 0 - 0 days ...
Package_Service	i tracked the parcel online ... and i started to suspect something when it was frozen in philadelphia for 0 days ... i called parcel 0 go ... and the young_girl ( who was rude , uninformed and brash ) told me the parcel was still in philadelphia , and didn ` t have a clue why it was stuck there ... then she told me to hold he line , only to come back and proclaim : " oh no , it `_s back in bolton "!!
Package_Service	!...
Package_Service	she had no_idea why it was back in the uk either , she was just trying to rush me off the phone and brush it under the carpet !.... i could not believe the parcel had not been delivered in the first place ( to upstate new_york as promised ) but what staggered me was that the parcel had been back in the uk for 0 days and not one member of their staff told me the parcel was back in the uk ... the incompetence and lack of communication was a disgrace ....
Package_Service	to add_insult to injury , the rude girl told me i would have to collect the parcel mysel from bolton as they will not send it back to me via courier !
Package_Service	!... it was like a bad dream to be honest ... i paid for the service online , the parcel does not get delivered and i have to pay to get it back !... you could not make it up !.. truly_awful customer_service and shocking overall service ...
Package_Service	i had to drive down to bolton myself ( costing me a further £_00 in fuel ) and when i arrived at the premises i was astounded my the disgusting state off the offices and main reception .... it was a complete_joke and confirmed to me these_guys are just a bunch of cowboys ... you have been warned , anyone thinking of using them .. do not !!!!!!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	perfect !
Package_Service	she give to me a big help , really nice , quickly , fantastic !
Package_Service	gave me best price to have my parcel shipped to netherlands and when i inquired about parcels location had a reply in less_than an_hour , customer_service is very friendly and was help by sam would highly_recommend parcel0go
Package_Service	i recently used this courier service to transport a baby ' s nursery crib that i bought on ebay .
Package_Service	the carrier they used was dhl ( express ).
Package_Service	i have nothing but praise for collectmyparcel . com but there was a problem with dhl .
Package_Service	i had a great price for the service ( next_day delivery ), the item was collected the next_day as arranged but for some unknown_reason they did not deliver .
Package_Service	i waited in all day but dhl were a no show .
Package_Service	my tracking stated : ' could not locate '.
Package_Service	i don ' t understand this as i live on a main_road and my house is not hard to find .
Package_Service	anyway , i rang collectmyparcel to complain and they were very polite and helpful .
Package_Service	they apologised for the no show and refunded the difference_between the express and normal delivery service .
Package_Service	they contacted dhl who then delivered the parcel the next_day .
Package_Service	i wasn ' t happy when i opened the parcel and found that the baby ' s crib was damaged .
Package_Service	it had been well_packaged so it could only have happened through lack of care during_transit .
Package_Service	collectmyparcel were again very helpful .
Package_Service	they sent me instructions on how to claim for the damage .
Package_Service	i provided photos and all the information they needed and the very next_day i got a phonecall from a lovely member of staff who wanted to reassure me ( due to my pregnancy ) that they will be refunding the cost of the crib plus courier costs .
Package_Service	i couldn ' t believe it .
Package_Service	she didn ' t want me to have the added stress of waiting for a response from dhl so she said that collectmyparcel would refund the costs today and they would then take the risk of getting the money back through dhl .
Package_Service	i cannot tell you how happy i am with this .
Package_Service	the crib is probably repairable but she said not to bother getting a quote for repair as they will refund the full purchase cost as a gesture of goodwill .
Package_Service	i couldn ' t have asked for better and highly_recommend this company based on their high standards of customer care and empathy for my personal situation .
Package_Service	contacted parcel0go live_chat due to me making an error when i imputted postal_address details .
Package_Service	was astonished by how quickly live_chat sorted out the problem .
Package_Service	literally took seconds .
Package_Service	[_name ] was very polite and efficient .
Package_Service	was actually glad i made a mistake just to be treated kindly via chat . lol .
Package_Service	will_defo use this service again , without a doubt .
Package_Service	thankyou parcel0go .
Package_Service	i have never used parcel0 go before and i was assigned to speak to sammie_taylor on live_chat .
Package_Service	i couldn ' t be more happier with the high_level of customer_service i received .
Package_Service	answered all my questions and even went to the extra effort of actually booking my order !
Package_Service	would definitely be using parcel0go more often !
Package_Service	thank_you from jade
Package_Service	lost 0 out of 00 parcels in one month !
Package_Service	cost to me of £_000 without including cost of time and packaging materials , ebay and paypal fees etc , there services arnt worth taking the insurance on as they never pay out anyway , you ' d be better giving your parcel to the next punter on the street and hope he passes it about enough it gets there , will probably be as quick and as reliable , with the same amount of customer_service when it all goes_wrong ( i put when on purpose , its not an if with this company !
Package_Service	i have just ended_up booking with interlink as result of failed parcel collections on two occasions from interparcel .
Package_Service	i called to let interparcel know and they rebooked stating that its possible there was no one at the address to hand the parcel ( that ' s not true because my address is a business house with two security guards an a receptionist from 0am to 00pm 0 days a week .
Package_Service	the second time no collection again this time with no info provided .
Package_Service	i emailed interparcel and they did not respond ( it has now been two_weeks ).
Package_Service	i tried live_chat it was not connecting on two_separate_occasions .
Package_Service	they seem to want customers to call their 00p / minute from bt landline_number .
Package_Service	seems like this is how they make there money .
Package_Service	she was very helpful , responded to my query quickly and efficiently and went out of her way to ensure i was satisfied .
Package_Service	give her a kiss from me and a pay_rise please .
Package_Service	i was treated with respect and had my problem sorted promptly and effectively , thanks
Package_Service	had a good chat an helped_me a lot on this .
Package_Service	thank_you again
Package_Service	hello , do a customer get any discounts if he / she send more that 00 items through collectplus .
Package_Service	thanks
Package_Service	i popped on the website talked to samantha in live support and she helped_me with a quote a third of the price i would have paid in the post_office !
Package_Service	would definitely_recommend .
Package_Service	really helpful , gave me all the information i needed .
Package_Service	very helpful assistant called [_name ].
Package_Service	liked the cheapness and range of couriers that were available .
Package_Service	interparcel seem well put_together but failed to pick_up my package on the agreed date ; not even a phone call to explain or reschedule .
Package_Service	not sure whether this would be down to city_link but the contract was with interparcel so held them mostly responsible .
Package_Service	may use again in the future but , for now , will stick with royal_mail
Package_Service	i love the site , easy to use , offers great help , and i can always count on the help line if i encounter problems ( thx daniel ) !
Package_Service	i definitely_recommend the service for anyone and everyone .
Package_Service	i asked about changing from collection to drop_off and spoke to emma .
Package_Service	she was very helpful and able to assist me efficiently .
Package_Service	i could not be more satisfied with my recent encounter with ' inter parcel '.
Package_Service	the service online is second to none offering varied courier companies lots of different prices and timescales !
Package_Service	i chose ' city_link ' and through inter parcel i found it very easy to track my parcel and the recipient of my parcel was very happy too !
Package_Service	i would and have highly_recommended the company !!
Package_Service	much_better_than others i viewed !
Package_Service	i had a few queries regarding the shipping and mailing service .
Package_Service	thankfully , i received very timely and helpful support from one of the staff_members - jo - who helped_me clear up all queries regarding my shipping both within the uk and continental europe .
Package_Service	very simple layout of the website , and reliable service all around !
Package_Service	would recommend to others .
Package_Service	very comfortable when i can choose from different delivery companies in one website , also very simple and clear to use .
Package_Service	ability to get a label printed .
Package_Service	saves lots of time !
Package_Service	prices are reasonable for the service provided !
Package_Service	liked it very much !
Package_Service	would recommend to everyone !
Package_Service	thank to alix challis did a good job of checking details and requests when the online website can ' t updated on time !
Package_Service	live_chat services are very helpful .
Package_Service	i have only used them once but would recommend them .
Package_Service	i sell items on ebay and my items would cost £ 0 . 00 for royal_mail delivery .
Package_Service	collect_plus charge £ 0 . 00 for the same size and weight .
Package_Service	their charge would have been less at £ 0 . 00 if i could use a jiffy_bag , but i cant .
Package_Service	i have to use boxes to avoid breakages .
Package_Service	another big plus is that you drop them off at a local convenience store and can deliver to a private address or to a convenience store close to the home address .
Package_Service	this means that people dont have to wait in for a delivery if they dont want to .
Package_Service	just pick it up from your corner store .
Package_Service	i dont have any connection to the company but feel it is unfair when only negative_feedback is given .... so collect_plus have 00 out of ten from me .
Package_Service	oh .
Package_Service	and my parcel was delivered from kent to derbyshire in five days !
Package_Service	easy to use service , convenient pick_up times , very good value for money .
Package_Service	would definitely use again .
Package_Service	well i use parcel0go . com all the time not had a problem , but recently i did city_link didnt turn_up not 0 ' s but 0 times so i contacted kate on parcels0go . com on facebook she got me tnt who picked_up the item the same day and delivered it the next_day she also refunded my postage amount i paid but thats not why im giving it 0_stars the reason_why is she was understanding , she was polite and she new what i ment and was there stright away and helped_me .
Package_Service	kate then rang me and talked to me on the phone and even made me laugh and overall its because off her while i am going to keep using parcels0go . com its people like her who keep us ( customers ) coming_back so i think if you have a problem goto facebook type in parcels0go . com because kate is the best and sure does make you want to use them again ok thank_you .
Package_Service	i have used parcel0go . com on several_occasions with no issues .
Package_Service	however , one of my customers cancelled their order so i attempted to cancel collection of the package .
Package_Service	i followed their online procedure and was lead to a page saying that i would have to talk to an operator to complete the process .
Package_Service	unfortunately the link didn ’ t work .
Package_Service	there is no phone number on the site , the phone number on the invoice doesn ’ t work and the live help they promote is difficult to find .
Package_Service	in the end i cancelled after half an_hour searching via the live_chat and the guy came to collect the package anyway .
Package_Service	in my opinion they need a customer_service phone number that is in view and actually works .
Package_Service	special thanks to richard for being vey helpful and dealing withmy query fast and efficiently .
Package_Service	[_name ] of parcel0go was very helpful and answered by query promptly and without any difficulty .
Package_Service	i spoke with daniel via online_chat , he ' s been very helpful .
Package_Service	i would recommend :)
Package_Service	i warmly suggest this company and the customer care is very professional .
Package_Service	i used myparceldelivery . com to send some of my ebay sales .
Package_Service	the website was great and easy to use .
Package_Service	the parcels were collected and delivered as expected .
Package_Service	i also tried the hermes drop_off service which was handy for my local shop & cheaper_than royal_mail .
Package_Service	will certainly book again .
Package_Service	had a great experience when i had a problem with the online ordering .
Package_Service	i didn ' t have a contact number for the recipient but needed to book asap , so i asked the online help .
Package_Service	catherine_corless helped_me by filling it in for me and i can now email her the contact number when i get it ( which i wouldn ' t have been able to leave off had there been no live help ).
Package_Service	i was surprised its actually a real_person who helps - great service .
Package_Service	as for parcel0go in general , i ' ve used them loads , usually to send to america as they are much cheaper_than the post_office for quick deliveries and if you fill out the customs properly theres no delay .
Package_Service	my company only uses parcel0go now !
Package_Service	:) plus , love their promo emails !
Package_Service	i have just spoken with katie and she was extremely_helpful and polite .
Package_Service	the best service ever :}
Package_Service	ewe
Package_Service	re : sammie_taylor
Package_Service	i booked an order for collection the next_day .
Package_Service	things changed at short_notice and we needed to cancel order .
Package_Service	life ; things_happen .
Package_Service	we had been let_down by the person
Package_Service	spoke to sammie_taylor on live_chat .
Package_Service	she was happy , helpful and fun , and knew what to do .
Package_Service	no_problems and a great relief to cancel and get the money reimbursed without fuss .
Package_Service	it is always an anxiety to know what happens with a portal if there is a problem .
Package_Service	the amount was small , £_00 , but the hassle value .
Package_Service	so i recommend p0g and i especially recommend sammie ; she was great , and i got a kiss x which made me smile .
Package_Service	so i left happy .
Package_Service	generally great service , but information of necessity of having a printer before or during ordering_process would of save me a lot !
Package_Service	this left me with a feeling i might not use your service again .
Package_Service	this is only a review of the customer_service aspect of the company , moreover , the live_chat support .
Package_Service	a lady named emma responded quickly and resolved my issue within 0 minutes , i have never had such lighting - fast service !
Package_Service	i do nothing and i receive my parcel in some days !
Package_Service	if i had questions the chat is very very helpfull and gives correct answers .
Package_Service	a girl named catherine saved the game once for me as something urgent happen to the sender and i have to change the collection date .
Package_Service	thank_you guys up there !
Package_Service	cheers
Package_Service	stelios
Package_Service	hermes failed to collect , after a couple quick emails everything sorted and parcel on its way !
Package_Service	catherine_corless was extremely_helpful .
Package_Service	thank_you very much
Package_Service	thanku so much for your amazing help and service :) spoke to lauren tonite and she is the only one i have spoke to thats resolved my problem !

Package_Service	highly_recommend , never used a service like this before , but very glad i have !
Package_Service	its worth the money too
Package_Service	i have used live_chat 0 times today , and [_name ] was the only one who solved my problem
Package_Service	thank_you so much , parcel0go !
Package_Service	i have been waiting for my parcel to arrive for almost 0 months now .
Package_Service	it has driven me insane .
Package_Service	i have contacted many courier companies like tnt and post nl , but they have all said that they could not help me .
Package_Service	i just talked to ally on the chat , and she has just said clearly to me there is some hope left , and that they will send me an_email , providing all the information i need to get my parcel back or to insure the loss i might have .
Package_Service	thank_you so much for the service .
Package_Service	it has lifted a major worry !
Package_Service	perfect everytime i use them and provide the best quotes 00_% of the time .
Package_Service	in the times they havent and someone_else has , i tend to avoid the other_companies as i have had lots of issues with them in the past , interparcel is a simple tranaction everytime .
Package_Service	have used them a couple of times .
Package_Service	always been collected on time , and prices have always been way better then just taking down the post_office .
Package_Service	problem resolved very quickly , catherine very helpful .
Package_Service	thankyou
Package_Service	i feel it only fair that i follow_up my initial review by adding that since making my complaint i was promptly contacted by the collectplus customer care team who have been excellent in addressing my concerns .
Package_Service	so although there were issues with the service i received , i really cannot_fault their exceptional level of customer_service .
Package_Service	------
Package_Service	i ordered from amazon and opted to use the collectplus service ( at a cost of £ 0 . 00 ) and chose to collect from my local asda store .
Package_Service	the day after receiving a message that my parcel was ready for collection i headed to asda where i was met with a 00 minute wait only to be told that the person who deals with collections was not in that day and i would have to come back tomorrow .
Package_Service	it is a bit of a pain to stay in all day as they dont give you a time for collection but i messaged their facebook & had immediate helpful responses !
Package_Service	have no_problems to report , all received by recipient in great condition .
Package_Service	thanks !
Package_Service	i ' ve never had a problem with this company , i use them for practically everything i send thats too big for the post_office to take .
Package_Service	the only issue i had was with hermes not interparcel , it was just booked through them , the problem with hermes they hire ' car owner couriers ' who tend to take it a lot less seriously than those with a name badge and a company van .
Package_Service	anyway the issue was the hermes person took_ages to deliver a parcel to my customer once , i ' ll never use hermes again , but interparcel is great , i hope they drop hermes off they ' re list .
Package_Service	go for interparcel economy - cheap service and usually next_day , and they pick_up from your door , well worth it imo .
Package_Service	ps there are always promo codes around the net , it ' s worth doing a search before you pay .
Package_Service	thanks to andrea for resolving a undelivered parcel issue
Package_Service	the customer support rep [_name ] was very helpful and sorted my problem out .
Package_Service	i put in a wrong review before confusing between interparcel and another interxxxxxxxxx
Package_Service	so , i came to realise that i was reviewing a wrong company .
Package_Service	i started using interparcel since 00 / 00 /_0000 and they have always been a top_class company to me , always recommend them i have never got into trouble with them and they have never failed to collect all around the world .
Package_Service	top_class service , best website easy to use ......
Package_Service	amelia dealt_with my cancellation and refund , best customer_service i have received in a long long time .
Package_Service	made my day !
Package_Service	all the questions to support , answered in seconds .
Package_Service	nice and warm attitude , thank_you jenny .
Package_Service	that ' s what makes customer like me coming_back to your services .
Package_Service	they are an amazing delivery company and are very cheap , always deliver on time and if anything goes_wrong they compensate you straight_away
Package_Service	thank_you so much great helper sammie_taylor , excellent service
Package_Service	having being in a rush to sort out a parcel for next_day delivery on the same day i was in a bit of a dilemma as i didn ' t know whether or not i could do it or not .
Package_Service	so i spoke to daniel on the online_chat .
Package_Service	he was great throughout , simple and precise with the information he required .
Package_Service	the clock was against us with it being about 00_mins before the cut_off point for the collection of the parcel on the same day .
Package_Service	daniel dealt_with my request as quick as he could and even set_up my order online for me .
Package_Service	he linked me across to a processed order for tnt , all i had to do was confirm and pay .
Package_Service	it made things so much smoother and simple !
Package_Service	he was great in all aspects , so thanks for everything !
Package_Service	:)
Package_Service	i would recommend parcel0go highly .
Package_Service	this was my first parcel with them and it won ' t be my last for sure .
Package_Service	thanks again :)
Package_Service	i have used the collect_+ company via selling items on ebay , and have so far had no - issues .
Package_Service	used company 0x twice no_probs what so ever but 0rd time parcel that was supposed to be collected by yodel wasnt collected :(
Package_Service	spoke to lloyd and he sorted it and rearrange booking for tomorro so fingers_crossed it will be picked_up tommorro as planned .
Package_Service	thanks lloyd for your help :)
Package_Service	would definately use again and would definately_recommend
Package_Service	id recommend parcel0go , it makes booking couriers very easy .
Package_Service	integrates with ebay nicely , so saves so much time .
Package_Service	helpful advisors like sammie_taylor are on hand to assist with bookings and delivery etc .
Package_Service	don ' t really like that i ' ve had to sign_up to a facebook to write this but robert did such a good job that it ' s worth it !!
Package_Service	i spoke to him about an issue with delivery and yodel sending stuff back and was having a really bad day and was not my best self to him , but he was very polite and i ' ve gotta say mate you ' re doing a good job !!
Package_Service	if it was me i ' d have cracked and started shoutin so thank_you for all the help in getting this sorted for me !!!
Package_Service	never gonna use yodel again ( lol !!)
Package_Service	but parcel0go clearly employs some stellar people to keep the cogs turnin and all i can say is that if you can deal wiv me on a bad day you can deal with anyone !!!!
Package_Service	fanks again mate !!!!
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i booked a courier service no one has pick the parcel up .
Package_Service	i email them no one got back to me .
Package_Service	i had to ring them up and pay 00p a minute to speak to a person with an attitude .
Package_Service	now i have to give a customer a refund and interparcel will not in anyway compensate me .
Package_Service	would not recommend .
Package_Service	the online_chat assistant emma was very helpful in answering my questions and was able to book a collection in a few minutes .
Package_Service	verry good service , always finding the best price , i only wish you had dpd quotes on your website aswell , notice few people sending with them , unsuccesful attempts for me though as i cant figure_out their complicated web_site ( i mean where is their quote section ).
Package_Service	anyway great service , will use again , definitely recommended .
Package_Service	had made the mistake with the delivery address and the agent sammie_taylor altered it without any extra_cost in no time .
Package_Service	will_definitely use again .
Package_Service	i had quite a large parcel which needed to be collected and delivered asap .
Package_Service	i thought it was going to cost loads , but i actually managed to get the parcel picked_up the next_day ( after booking in the evening ) and delivered the day after that , all for about £_00 !
Package_Service	when i realised i had put down the wrong delivery address i spoke to online customer_service who sorted it out straight_away .
Package_Service	will_definitely use again !
Package_Service	i wanted to send a small birthday_gift to my mum in poland recently but had never used any courier company based in the uk before .
Package_Service	my friend_recommended to me courierpoint company as he owns a small business and uses this company services on daily_basis .
Package_Service	i tried and was not disappointed as the parcel was delivered on time .
Package_Service	great service !
Package_Service	niedawno chcialam wyslac drobny prezent urodzinowy swojej mamie ale nigdy wczesniej nie korzystalam z uslug zadnej firmy kurierskiej w anglii .

Package_Service	sammie_taylor was pleasant to talk to and very helpful
Package_Service	very helpful ([ name ])
Package_Service	all questions were quickly answered by emma , will_definitely continue using p0g .
Package_Service	i will recommend this site and enterprise parcel0go . com online .
Package_Service	the assistant rose was very professional .
Package_Service	many_thanks and keep the good work .
Package_Service	i was struggling finding a delivery company who would deliver to australia at a reasonable cost .
Package_Service	transglobal was outstanding from beginning to end .
Package_Service	an organised courtesy_call made sure i ' d packaged and printed off the necessary documents correctly .
Package_Service	the parcel was collected the next_day , tuesday_afternoon and was delivered to australia friday_morning .
Package_Service	perfect in every way !
Package_Service	as a busy start - up business i need other_companies and websites i use to work , be cost_effective and to add value to my organisation .
Package_Service	my parcel delivery does all of this .
Package_Service	really great service and tool for any micro - enterprise .
Package_Service	[_name ] served me and was most helpful
Package_Service	very helpful service from samantha , she processed my order with no_hesitation and made it simple and quick for me to pay .
Package_Service	0_stars !
Package_Service	the driver came on time and i was not ready , i was very worried that they would not come back the following_day .
Package_Service	before i had a chance to ring parcel_hero they rang me and had already noticed that the package was not collected and then arranged a new collection and followed it every_step of the way because it was an important and expensive item that was time sensitive .
Package_Service	thank_you so much parcel_hero you really saved my day .
Package_Service	not only is the customer_services friendly and understanding they are very competitive and pro - active .
Package_Service	i will be using parcel_hero for all of my high value and important shipments from now on because i feel save in their hands .
Package_Service	i have had some very bad_experiences with other courier companies on the net that are all talk and no action - when your package becomes a problem it is you who has to do all the hard work .
Package_Service	parcel_hero are leaps and bounds ahead of any other company used to use and i would highly_recommend trying them out , especially if you send high value and time - sensitive shipments .
Package_Service	if your reading this and you have reservations just try them you will not be disappointed even if the price is cheaper else where i would still pay the extra just for the safety and service that they offer .
Package_Service	keep up the fantastic work and merry_christmas .
Package_Service	emailed 0 times now .
Package_Service	no reply .
Package_Service	they never delivered on time and the parcel has still not been returned to very after 0weeks .
Package_Service	item was " lost " in transit
Package_Service	( issue was resolved quickly by contacting phillip marsh . )
Package_Service	sammie had exceeded our expectations !
Package_Service	perfect ++
Package_Service	i ' m normally pretty excepting when things go_wrong , it happens .
Package_Service	but when i pay for an express service because an item had to be delivered by a certain_date , paid for extra insurance and paid to have it delivered next_day .
Package_Service	nobody arrived to pick it up .
Package_Service	waited in from 00 : 00 till 00 : 00 like it said , and when i get somebody on the online_chat , all they said is that the item didn ' t get picked_up .... thats right i ' m looking at it .
Package_Service	don ' t bother going to the website , go direct with the actual couriers , its so much cheaper !
Package_Service	don ' t pay for a ' middle_man '.
Package_Service	sammie_taylor very helpful and friendly well_done
Package_Service	i had a query about a parcel , poped a quick message to sam ( on facebook ).

Package_Service	i booked for a home - cinema projector and separate lamp to be picked_up in staffordshire and delivered to me in london .
Package_Service	subsequently i came onto this site and saw all the scary negative_reviews !
Package_Service	!
Package_Service	i was almost certain that i would get my parcels late and completely smashed !
Package_Service	in reality the entire_process ran very smoothly .
Package_Service	so i booked about 00pm on wednesday_night , they picked_up the following_morning and by friday 00am i had both parcels in pristine_condition .
Package_Service	i also called on thursday to check about the cover on the items and although they were unable to cover the bulbs or any other glass , they were very helpful and said if there were any_issues not relating to this element they would be able to assist and / or reimburse any loss or damage .

Package_Service	because of the pricey cost of parcel delivery by air , i was hesitating whether or not to send the gifts & souvenirs i bought from turkey and greece to my family and friends in malaysia which i brought back all the way from my vacation trip to glasgow .
Package_Service	i found parcelhero and discovered their prices ( quotation ) is very competitive .
Package_Service	so i just booked everything and did the non - eu delivery custom declaration forms online , and they said it shall arrive malaysia in 0 days ( weekend included )
Package_Service	i didnt thought of tracking the parcel until a few_days after ups collected my parcel , i checked online and the parcel is already in singapore within 0 days ?
Package_Service	i got up this morning and tracked it again , i saw my dad has signed the delivery in kuala lumpur while i was still soundly asleep in scotland .
Package_Service	what more could you ask for ?
Package_Service	all promises fulfilled and their service is just brilliant !
Package_Service	i called my dad and asked him is the parcel alright , he said its perfectly_fine , except he didnt manage to sign properly on the screen using the stylus of that dhl delivery device thingy .
Package_Service	lol !
Package_Service	will not hesitate anymore after this to send parcels from the uk to anywhere in the world with parcelhero .
Package_Service	:)

Package_Service	i ' ve sent a parcel to germany by courierpoint and i ' m absolutely happy with the service received .
Package_Service	first of all , i ' ve paid less_than half the price than dhl_express ( and some others ) has quoted me , even_though my parcel has been collected and delivered by dhl_express and secondly my parcel has been delivered within 0 days on a sunday !
