negative	eventually they arranged a delivery date for early april ( yes that long ) and i arranged a day off work to receive the bed .
negative	as part of the order we paid £_00 . 00 for a bed recycle that meant i had to take apart my old wooden frame bed for them to collect .
negative	as the day went on i thought i had better chase dreams on a time for the delivery .
negative	on making this call , we found out that dreams had cancelled our delivery without informing us , and that the bed would not be in stock again until may .
negative	the old bed that had been taken apart was not in state to repair , so we just had an old mattress on the floor to sleep on .
negative	i have a 0 month pregnant partner who was in a situation where we have to sleep on the floor for the final 0 months of the pregnancy .
negative	i have had to purchase a 0nd_hand bed and pay a van to deliver , at my own_expense .
negative	dreams , aware of the fact they are leaving a 0 month pregnant women to sleep on the floor , have been no help whatsoever , have not made any attempt to explain the reason for the cancelled delivery ( without forceful prompting from me ), or to explain_why we have had to wait nearly half a year for a delivery .
negative	0 weeks_ago i cancelled my order with dreams and demanded a full_refund ( phone and email ) and was told someone would get back to me on the matter to arrange the refund .
negative	i just contacted dreams again , and they have not even updated my details to say the order is cancelled , so are expecting to deliver the bed in may .
negative	so far i have paid nearly £ 0 , 000 for a bed i haven ’ t received and nearly £_000 for a 0nd_hand bed and delivery to cover the inconvenience .
negative	i also lost a day of holiday for the trouble ( a day i could have spent with my new born baby ).
negative	dreams offered my £_000 of vouchers in compensation .
negative	when i laughed at the thought of ever spending money with them again , they offered £_000 cash , but given the stress they have caused both me and my partner , i don ’ t feel they deserve any sale from me .
negative	this company have proven to be completely unreliable , unhelpful and uncooperative from day 0 .
negative	please avoid at all costs .
negative	yours ,
negative	dan
negative	if i could give no stars i would !
negative	avoid this company !
negative	i was on hold for 00 min and then they hung_up on me .
negative	now i am 00 min and counting .
negative	their bills are indecipherable .
negative	their customer_service awful .
negative	their final_bill doesn ' t show where the figures are coming from and i can ' t speak to anyone !
negative	i ordered a £_00 service hair and beauty service .
negative	couldn ' t use the voucher as the telephone_number provided for the saloon was not answered for days until the voucher expired .
negative	no replies whatsoever from wowcher and the saloon ( exquisite hair and beauty ) say that wowcher needs to refund me .
negative	both organisations are a scam .. never ever will repurchase from this website !
negative	i ' ve ordered from healthdesigns five times .
negative	the first four times were wonderful .
negative	everything went just right .
negative	the 0th time , however , was a complete_disaster .
negative	0 months after the purchase i still_haven ' t received my produt .
negative	i ' ve sent several e_- mails to their support in the last 00 days and none ' s been answered so far , which is tottaly unacceptable !
negative	i don ' t think i will ever buy from them again or recommend them to friend .
negative	they turned away a potential regular customer with an awful experience .
negative	shame on you , healthdesigns .
negative	i ' ve lost_count how many issues i ' ve had with city_link .
negative	their most annoying habit is their drivers that don ' t leave a card when attempting delivery , it ' s like they expect us to be mind readers !
negative	absolute_rip_off !!
negative	!
negative	i used last_year with no_problems ,
negative	so i brought a new shirt in the sale on 00 / 00 / 00
negative	still_hasn ' t come and they ' ve not answered my calls or e_- mails
negative	avoid
negative	some of the hen_party arrived early as we were going to decorate it before the hen arrived .....
negative	instead of a luxury cottage or barn we were promised plus getting hyped up by the pictures online we were shocked to turn_up and see a shed which was infested with a wasps nest two showers inside yet couldn ' t shower in both at once .....
negative	and in the middle of nowhere ....
negative	although our butler in the buff ( christian ) arrived and cheered everyone up from the shock of the shed / barn he was wonderful i ' d say best part of the hen_weekend .
negative	we were supposed to get free club_entry and vip treatment etc well when the hen_party turned_up at the nightclub not only did they not know who we were but the door staff insulted one of the girls to the point of crying her eyes out , when we told manager of this he stated it was only a laugh ..... not impressed ...
negative	so after 00_mins of him faffing about he eventually let us in and shoved us on a table in the hall way far away from the dj and vip ....
negative	he was so rude it really upset all of us so we went back to our shed sorry barn house early ..... even had to book an ann_summers party during saturday because there was no activities available to us .
negative	the money we paid for this shambles is shocking deffo not worth the money never using chillisauce again and safe to say i don ' t think the other girls will either ....
negative	what a flop ....
negative	avoid this company like the plague .
negative	they are useless .
negative	we waited for our internet_connection to be turned on for 0 months .
negative	they kept saying " it will be on by next week "... gone to bt now .
negative	company asks for copy of passport to " validate " order .
negative	when questionned , no response received ever .
negative	they continue to send newsletters but never respond to emails - am unable to cancel my order now , they have left it in limbo and are not refunding me .
negative	they took my money immediately after ordering and can not get through since , even on their phoneline .
negative	absolutely_disgusting service , trading_standards will be informed .
negative	do not use them .
negative	even i brought an android tablet from them via wowcher .
negative	haven ' t received it yet !
negative	( almost 0 months ) i ' m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
negative	i just contacted_wowcher via_email and phone , when i called day by day they asked me to wait .
negative	and then i sent mails no reply from them .
negative	last_week i sent another mail asking to refund me back wowcher is keep silence .
negative	wonder is since two_weeks , when i logged to their web application , vivacitystores mentioned that items were shipped .
negative	and last_week i received a mail ( auto generated ) from vivacitystores asking that feedback ( thank_you for your recent_purchase !
negative	as we appreciate your business and value your satisfaction , please take a moment to visit the link below to submit feedback on all items in your order ).
negative	i dont know whats_going on but i ' m really frustrated .
negative	doesn ' t deserve a star .
negative	terrible to non - existant service .
negative	stay_away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
negative	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
negative	updated : just wonder wowcher , you are able to reply this post within 00min , but you have mentioned that 0days mails to be checked ??????
negative	again you are in a tablet deal , and already 0000 items sold , please dont miss these customers toooo ... :(
negative	even i brought an android tablet from them via wowcher .
negative	haven ' t received it yet !
negative	i ' m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
negative	doesn ' t deserve a star .
negative	terrible to non - existant service .
negative	stay_away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
negative	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
negative	hate it when clothes companies use this courier service is it cheap to use or something ?.
negative	anyway the company is always slow with delivery took them 0 days to get back to me when i emailed them asking where a parcel was .
negative	i ordered flowers to be sent to my girlfriend in her office on valentines_day .
negative	spent nearly £_00 for the same day delivery option .
negative	even_though i know it was cutting it close , paying an extra £_00 for the delivery on the day seemed to make up for it .
negative	but i was wrong .
negative	they charged me the same amount but has not sent me a confirmation letter for the order .
negative	if i had not print screened the check out page with the reference , i would have no proof of sale .
negative	tried_emailing 0 times and ringing several_times and all i got was one email in return saying sorry for contacting me so late on valentines_day to say that my order has failed .
negative	overall value and service .. abysmal .
negative	been trying to reach scottish_power for 0 days now .
negative	they don ' t have any advisers at all !
negative	i have waited a total of 0 hours on hold .
negative	is there anyone in their customer_service center ?
negative	company is a joke .
negative	believe me the first thing i will do when i do finally get through is cancel my policy .
negative	00days and still no news on my phone .
negative	send to be fixed for water_damage , no reply to my numerous_calls and emails , have only had limited contact via the instant_messaging service after much persistence .
negative	i am losing money by not using my contract and fear my phone will never be returned to me .
negative	please rotten apple give me some information , my order number is # 0000
negative	awful company , terrible communication and service .
negative	do not use
negative	in april , i bought a 00 pound voucher for a murder mystery evening + accommodation + dinner + breakfast at ramada hatfield .
negative	i spoke to ramada hatfield on the phone , and was told that my booking had been confirmed for 00 november_0000 , and that i would receive a confirmation_email 0 - 0 weeks prior to the 00th .
negative	i never received a confirmation_email , and when i contacted ramada to check on my booking , i was told that there was no booking in my name .
negative	when i contacted_wowcher on 00 november , they sat on my email for 0 days ( not 00_hours , as they claim ) before passing it on to ramada hatfield .
negative	ramada hatfield replied to them promptly on 00 november , telling them that my booking for 00 november was indeed there .
negative	however , wowcher again sat on this email for a further 0 days , and only passed it on to me on the 0nd of december , which was pointless !
negative	!
negative	i am absolutely_furious that wowcher sat on this email for 0 days - if they had bothered to respond to me promptly , this would never have happened .
negative	it just shows how little they care about paying customers .
negative	when i asked them for a refund , i was told that i could not get one , but i could have 00_% of my money back in wowcher credits .
negative	i am_appalled that they are refusing to refund me my money when this situation is not my fault !
negative	furthermore , i want nothing more to do with wowcher ever again , and the last thing i want is more wowcher credit !!!
negative	i just want my money back !
negative	i will stick to groupon from now on , and will never be using wowcher again .
negative	i would recommend everyone to stay far away from it !
negative	they are thieves and only seem to have an interest in taking people ' s money , without providing anything in return .
negative	i ordered two_pairs of sunglasses , both advertising ' same day dispatch '.
negative	two_weeks have gone by and i ' ve only received one .
negative	they have no contact number , which is extremely irritating , and to make it worse they do not respond to all emails .
negative	after numerous_emails i was able to get an authorisation number and return the pair of glasses that i did receive .
negative	following the tracking , a delivery was attempted back to them , but they didn ' t sign for it , its status is currently ' unsuccessful '!
negative	i can ' t actually believe the poor customer_service .
negative	i have contacted them this morning requesting the return to be processed within 00_hours .
negative	if nothing is done i will take up the matter_further externally .
negative	i purchased a tp forest double swing from wicken toys .
negative	on constructing the swing i noticed one of the wooden legs was split on 0 sides measuring 00cm and ending in a splintered point .
negative	i contacted wicken and was told the split looked normal and wood will shrink / expand with the weather .
negative	i sent a further e_- mail and photo ' s and had to contact wicken for an answer as they failed to reply in a timely_manner .
negative	again i was told they will not replace the leg due to the splitting was part of the charactistics of wood .
negative	as the leg was like this from delivery i do not except their answer of weathering .
negative	i have had to tape the leg up to stop my children receiving splinters from it .
negative	wicken state the swing should be checked for splinters and sanded down on a regular_basis , if i were to attemept to sand the leg i would have to sand half the leg away to remove the split and splinters .
negative	very poor service and i would not recomend wicken toys .
negative	this has destroyed my faith in online purchases of such items .
negative	i bought a wowcher for a hotel stay in dumfries a few weeks_ago .
negative	called the hotel to check availability ( the day i bought it ) as i can only manage weekends and was told not to worry , as long as there are rooms i can redem my wowcher .
negative	great or so i thought .
negative	i called up to book on sunday with some dates we could manage .
negative	there were no dates left for any weekend despite me being told that there was plenty of availability if i wanted to book at the full rack rate as they were only accepting 00 wowchers a day .
negative	?. i was not told this the first time .
negative	i contacted_wowcher as now that 00 days have past i ' m going to lose £_00 due to me only being allowed to claim 00_% as a credit and not the full_amount .
negative	ive heard_nothing back from them .
negative	looking at this site by the looks of it not responding is the norm for them .
negative	a gutted girlfriend as this was for her_birthday which is now no use but yet wowcher is not willing to help in anyway ... says a lot really !
negative	!
negative	after people i know saying how good it is i thought i should try it .
negative	we ordered a large margarita pizza and garlic_bread with cheese and it took almost 0 hours to get here .
negative	when it did it was cold and all the cheese had been stuck to the lid as it had been chucked about in the car .
negative	the delivery driver had his car music blaring out which woke my neighbours children and he left it on whilst he came to the house !
negative	the pizza was so thin and burnt round the edges and it cost me a fortune !
negative	never again would i order from here .
negative	its awful !
negative	bought a voucher for a sushi restaurant , booked tickets , and got a confirmation .
negative	arrived with the three friends i booked with only to find a shut shop .
negative	no notice on the door , no email or phone call prior , and the patrons of the pub next door said we weren ' t the first customers with a booking that day who arrived to a closed door .
negative	got no reply to enquiries as to why the restaurant was closed .
negative	and it ' s been 0 days with no response from wowcher .
negative	horrible experience , having planned the night , invited friends , and ventured out , and with still no explanation as to why or a refund !
negative	i recieved my order from tennisnuts fine , but i had an item missing ( wristband ) which i was then told it was out of stock .
negative	i responsed to their alternative , but since then i ' ve had no repsonse back in ages !
negative	talktalk is hands_down the most difficult company i ’ ve ever had the displeasure of dealing_with .
negative	they rope you in with great prices , but expect to get what you pay for when things go_wrong .
negative	the on - hold times are horrendous , and the staff treat you like idiots , with no real enthusiasm for problem solving .
negative	- one thing i have learned , if you want anything sorted , immediately refuse to deal with the person you are talking to and request a manager , they can actually be a little more helpful .
negative	my issues arised when i moved home and was forced to sign a new 00 month_contract to continue the service .
negative	either that or to buy myself out of the contract ….
negative	including a £_000 bill for the youview_box .
negative	no chance .
negative	so we continued with the home move , all should be well and good ?!
negative	except 0 weeks after the ‘ go live ’ date , we still had no service .
negative	it must have taken 0 phone_calls and over 0 hours of my time just to persuade them to send an engineer out .
negative	there is only so many_times your intelligence can be insulted .
negative	“ have you tried switching the router on and off again ” jesus man , i ’ m not an imbecile , of course i ’ ve tried that - and many of the other useless troubleshooting exercises on your website .
negative	so lots of hassle later , 0 talktalk engineers later ( 0 never turned_up which we are being charged for – whole other story ) and 0 bt engineer later …… 0 weeks have passed – we have internet and phone !
negative	huzzah !
negative	of course , the talktalk rules are i must pay my bill regardless if i ’ m receiving a service , or they won ’ t fix the line because of an outstanding_balance in arrears .
negative	reassured on a number occasions i could claim compensation for the loss of service , i continued to pay for a service i wasn ’ t receiving .
negative	so naturally , i called talktalk again , explained i ’ ve had no service for 0 weeks and am requesting compensation .
negative	“ not a problem ” they say , “ we can offer you …… urmmm , the computer system says , erm ….. £ 0 . 00 ” you can imagine my response .
negative	“ five pounds and fifty pence ?!
negative	you mean £_00 ?
negative	is that a joke ?!
negative	use some logic man , i pay £_00 . 00 a month , i ’ ve had 0 weeks of no service , how you can offer me £ 0 . 00 ?
negative	to date , we are on phone call number 0 , another 0 hours of my time , going round and round in circles .
negative	the most_recent offer was £_00 …......… an_absolute insult .
negative	i ' ll keep phoning and get angrier and angrier until something is sorted .
negative	:)
negative	and a quick message to mary , we have written on the facebook_page explaining the troublesome service we ' ve had , and your response was to delete it .
negative	cheers then , you pirates .
negative	never , ever go with three .
negative	i had a pay - as - you - go contract with them .
negative	my phone was stolen , so of course i asked them to cancel the sim and send a replacement .
negative	they said it would be there in 0 - 0 days .
negative	0 weeks_later the sim had still not arrived .
negative	i called again and asked what was going on .
negative	i was given some piss - poor_excuse about the request not going through , or technical_difficulties or some such rubbish .
negative	i then told them that i wanted to cancel my contract with them , and was told " oh that has to go through as a separate request , we can ' t do that until the cancellation of the other request goes through ".
negative	they promised to ring me within 00_hours to confirm it , which of course didn ' t happen .
negative	i then rang them again and told them to give me my pac_code .
negative	long_story short , i was passed from person to person , none of whom had a clue about any of my details or the story .
negative	you spend ages explaining everything again and again ( apparently , they don ' t possess such advanced technology as customer records and databases ) and they ask you to repeat your number each time .
negative	i told them that they should have records of my calls , and should know exactly_what had happened , and that i was with my friends at the time , and telling them all never to take out a contract with three .
negative	( this was true ).
negative	i also told them i would post this experience on every social_media and reviews site that i could find , hence this review .
negative	and then , after much wasted time that i ' ll never get back , when i finally got my pac - this actually made me laugh out loud - the woman had the gall to say " oh if you want to stay with us then we ' ll give you three months ' free service "!
negative	not if you paid me , you poor , unfortunate employee of this scummy company !
negative	i reckon they know perfectly well that people realise they ' re awful , so they put the hooks in and make it as impossible as possible to cancel your contract .
negative	absolutely_disgusting .
negative	avoid them like the plague !
negative	we have a business and we want to advertise it on wowcher . co . uk .
negative	i sent my first email on the 00th of april , no response , tried to call many numbers and the only responsible is a guy called robert that never pick_up and never get back to my recorder messages .
negative	the customer_service replied " what do you want me to do " after telling_me that they cant give me any other number to call .
negative	they also say , robert is really busy but this is not an excuse .
negative	hire more people if you cant keep up your business .
negative	this is really unacceptable and unprofessional !
negative	poor poor management .
negative	i got my graphics_card then suddenly i realised it was water cooled the engineer and me parent was there and we never installed it we took it back 00 £ for delivery back they told us it was fried and already used we didnt use it for a second it was in a diffrent box aswell a 000 this one was 000 gtx when it got took back we had already used another one a gtx_000 this one isnt working either and they are not even refunding the water cooled one and say we used it they even said they sent us an_email but that was a trick to keep us occupied these are not eligible i wouid highly not reccomend this service at all !
negative	i booked a room in london in january .
negative	when i received the comformation email i realized that the date was wrong .
negative	one minute after booking the room i couldn ' t cancel it and nobody gave me a solution .
negative	i checked my bank_account and my money had dissapeared !
negative	too fast for charging , not for helping .
negative	in booking . com you don ' t have to pay in_advance and it should be like this in all these kind of websites .
negative	not happy at all .
negative	we are coustomers not just money .
negative	i made a bit of a mistake , i admit .
negative	i was too trusting and sent money via bank_transfer to a seller who sent me some acoustic foam which smelt so bad i had to throw it away .
negative	stale cigarettes and a build up of tar all over it .
negative	cost £_00 .
negative	the seller pretended to refund the money , but after a month , i ' ve given up .
negative	my advice : be_careful of people selling acoustic foam , and see it in person before buying .
negative	if you cannot , do not use gumtree to purchase .
negative	you may as well burn money .
negative	i contacted gumtree support who sent a standard email back .
negative	they couldn ' t even be bothered to customise the email !
negative	where the item name should be , there was just an " xxxxx " placeholder .
negative	i did complain directly to them about this , for which they apologised .
negative	i asked them to remove the advert for the remaining foam , as i thought it was unfair for others to suffer loss .
negative	they refused .
negative	utterly_disgusted with this service .
negative	gumtree , i will not be using you again .
negative	worst experience online ever !
negative	i got a new pair of shoes last_week worn them once and they fell_apart so i took then back to the havent store the manager was very ride and refused to give me my money back she could not resell them again , which of course she cant resell them they fell_apart . better custmer service needed
negative	in principle , hukd is great , find great deals , buy / sell old items , freebies , competitions .
negative	a good one stop_shop .
negative	however , all the goodness is destroyed by power hungry moderators who get a kick out of suspending someone at every opportunity , regardless of whether in the rules or not .
negative	sometimes you get suspended for something vaguely within the rules , but open to interpretation , sometimes you get suspended even if it is not in the rules , just because a moderator thinks it is .
negative	they are quick to suspend and never move away from this .
negative	they are like the fa , come up with ridiculous ideas that no one else agrees with .
negative	the best way i can describe hukd ' s moderators are like traffic wardens who wait for your paid parking ticket to expire and 0 minute later you have a ticket , or for being slightly outside a box junction , or being on a kerb .
negative	basically the lowest of the low .
negative	it ' s not even worth going into details of where they have got it wrong , but a perfect example is being suspended for attempting to outbid someone .
negative	apparently that is not allowed , even where the seller had not yet agreed to the sale with the previous individual .
negative	i as the bidder was suspended .
negative	where is the logic .
negative	the previous bidder even said , " feel free to sell to the higher bidder ", the seller of course would surely have preferred more money and i was willing to pay more money , so in the end three people that between us have no issue for complaint .
negative	then comes in the moderator and suddenly i ' m suspended for a breach of a rule that isn ' t even in the rules !
negative	!
negative	this company is diabolical !
negative	do not order from them .
negative	they are scammers .
negative	i placed my order for a samsung_galaxy mini on 00 / 0 / 00 and they have still not even dispatched the item .
negative	they keep giving me excuse after excuse .
negative	i have emailed and called on numerous_occasions .
negative	they keep fobbing me off saying they have an issue in fulfillment .
negative	basically they are taking customers money in good faith saying they have adequate stock_levels but in reality they are building up a back log of orders so that they can purchase the phones when they have say 0000 orders at rock_bottom prices .
negative	they are liars and crooks !!!
negative	do not deal with valuebasket .
negative	i wish i had found this site before i purchased the phone .
negative	i was so bowled_over by the fantastic deal on offer that i should have thought logically , if something seems too good to be true it ' s because it is .
negative	i wish i ' d of paid the extra £_00 with amazon now .
negative	i ' m reluctant to cancel the order because i have a feeling it will take a lot of hassle and time to get my money back .
negative	so i ' m just waiting it out .
negative	they have me stuck behind a rock and a hard place .
negative	i ' ve been sending them emails and talk to different people ( christine , janani ) but they just totally ignore me .
negative	i have a proof that j walker received the cash payment and my credit_card is also been charge at the same day .
negative	i paid mr j walker because his not going to release the package , which i understand without me paying him .
negative	so i decided to give him the cash and call dhl office that i paid him in cash and i need a refund for the card transaction i did few hours before he arrived .
negative	but after all the emails and call no refund been made ...
negative	i ' m very disappointed with their service !
negative	i ordered on 00 / 00 /_0000 - they cancelled order cos not able to do the same ,
negative	they try to transfer the money to my card due to card expiry they are not able to do the same .
negative	after i requested and fight with them , they accepted to transfer the money to my bank .
negative	almost 0 months over still not they are not transferred to bank .
negative	would never book with this holiday company again , after care service is very poor .
negative	complaints_dept is a joke !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	0 of my recent orders with online companies were delivered by hermes .
negative	of those , three were delivered to the wrong_address and three of them were not delivered at all and one took three_weeks to be delivered .
negative	the three that weren ' t delivered were supposedly left in a safe location , the communal hallway of my building by the front_door .
negative	obviously these three parcels went missing as a communal hallway is hardly a safe_place .
negative	that ' s if they were actually delivered in the first place as for all know the courier stole them .
negative	no cards were left through the door so there ' s no proof the courier even left the parcels .
negative	i ' ve actually had a full blown argument with one of their self_employed couriers before after he threatened and swore at me on the phone .
negative	hermes seem to use self_employed couriers and would apparently not require any experience , skill or professionalism from them .
negative	hermes won ' t allow you to contact them by phone or email to complain personally and they say ' contractual obligations ' are the reason , although i ' ve spoken to some of the companies who use them and it ' s hermes insistence that they are not to be contacted directly by the person receiving the parcel .
negative	they really are utterly rubbish and incompetent .
negative	i regret to say i wasn ' t treated nicely at all when i contacted anyvan via the phone
negative	they ladies i spoke to was just simply too rude
negative	basically they are not the ones that do the delivery , they arrange it for you !
negative	they are the middle_man !
negative	unfortunately they are not very good at it and they don ' t really have much control of whats_happening !
negative	their customer_service is a complete nonsense !
negative	the team comes across incompetent and incapable to assist particularly with international deliveries !
negative	i ' m not gonna go into details but if you have a choice go for another service !
negative	and never ever ever choose parcelforce to deliver anything under no circumstances !
negative	dont watch much tv but when i do i just end up turning it off after 0 mins of adverts is stuck in your face 0 seconds after you turn something on .
negative	always left a card for attempted delivery !
negative	maybe knock a little louder as i was 00ft from the door and a card appears i didnt hear ?...
negative	also the drivers i have dealt_with can be rude and abrupt .
negative	bad_experience and service .
negative	we switched to talktalk a month_ago because of the huge bills from bt .
negative	when i rang talktalk about switching i was only after phone and broadband as we are happy with sky tv , but was talked into the tv package too as it was cheaper .
negative	anyway ... 0 weeks_later we have recieved the tv box ( that we didnt really want ) but the router ( that we needed ) is still not here .
negative	then 0 days ago they cut the phone line off without any warning .
negative	phoned up to pay the bill and was told it would be back on within 00_hours , well 00_hours_later its still not on !
negative	after just a month we are done with this second rate company .
negative	felt really strongly about recent issues with my internet and phone provider ( bt ).
negative	so i decided to write a review , my first ever on trustpilot .
negative	i kept composed and even edited out anything that could be termed course or offensive at all before posting my review only for it to instantly disappear and say it was reported for bad language .
negative	so i read through it a couple of times on the edit screen to make_sure there was no bad language or anything offensive at all .
negative	i thought maybe it was standard procedure to check the reviews .
negative	so i waited 0 days then checked when i was next online ... and still no review .
negative	so i message trustpilot and ask if they actually bother checking reviews ?
negative	yes within 0 days was there reply .
negative	low and behold on day 0 the review i took 00_mins to compose and type was gone .
negative	or should i say never checked and / or published when it was perfectly_fine .
negative	what ' s the point trustpilot ?
negative	i suggest you do some work and less time at the coffee_machine .
negative	there is quite a theme going on with regard to wowcher ' s poor service .
negative	it seems that woucher should be more choosy about the companies they are partnering up with !
negative	same here !
negative	paid in good faith but no goods received !
negative	simply not good enough !
negative	if enough of us write to watch_dog we could save other people the misfortune of being out of pocket and unnecessarily stressed by wowcher and it ' s affiliate companies .
negative	it is a shame for the good companies that wowcher partners with ; might their reputation be affected ?
negative	my mums migration to plusnet went wrong due to openreach but plusnet were next to useless getting it resolved and ended_up taking a week .
negative	meanwhile someone_else had been given our number and we had someone_elses .
negative	took so long to resolve as plusnet admitted they raised an incorrect fault as they didn ' t know what else to do !
negative	this caused my pensioner mum lots of stress .
negative	trying to get things corrected was very difficult and involved many calls and having to be quite forceful which should be unnecessary .
negative	dealing_with the complaints_department was extremely disappointing and just exacerbated the bad_experience .
negative	at first they put the complaint on the wrong account , they lied at one point , they did not read correspondence properly and they did not take a probable data_protection breach seriously .
negative	at the end they issued a deadlock code and inferred we were just after money when they didn ' t offer much and we know they offered more to someone for the same problem that only lasted a day !
negative	their cheap package also doesn ' t work out that cheap if you get caught for not included calls and extra broadband .
negative	will leave asap .
negative	update_: complained to cisas and awarded full compensation requested .
negative	note that plusnet have increased some prices but you cannot leave without penalty if you had their ' free ' connection and router within 00 months .
negative	i think a dis - honest way of keeping customers trapped when raising prices !
negative	they attempt to deliver your package , then leave a card with no reference_number , just the mobile number of the person who tried to deliver the package .
negative	you can ' t pick it up from the depo without that number , nor can you just do a redelivery online .
negative	not sure if they are trying to add some kind of personal_touch , but it doesn ' t and big companies such as ' bershka ' and ' studio ' should not use them .
negative	i dread it when the email says yodel are delivering .
negative	used them ( not out of choice ) about 0 times and it ' s been the same every time .
negative	now my current package is in limbo .
negative	no_idea how to get it as courier doesn ' t have it any more , there is no reference_number and you can ' t do anything online .
negative	i am still_waiting 00 days for an item to be shipped from the uk to ireland .
negative	this feels_like fragrancedirect has done a complete 000 and reverted back to a postal policy rivaling the times before the steam engine .
negative	i have contacted customer_service twice and they tell me it can take up to 00 days for delivery to ireland , seriously its not the moon .
negative	i used them before and this was not the case , once burnt etc .
negative	i could not recommend this company and if you are based outside the uk avoid them .
negative	i bought tickets for manunited vs opr in the away section .
negative	price said pounds 000 but it rose to 000 at the final confirmation page .
negative	to my horror i was charged 000 by my bank ( due to some exchange_rate fraud ).
negative	however i still thought my tickets would come and they did come 0 days before the game but i was shocked to see that i got tickets with the home fans in an absolutely horrible place where a pillar blocked my entire view .
negative	do not buy !
negative	i placed an order for a remedy for chickenpox .
negative	now told they have issues with the supplier .
negative	not acceptable to me as selling this type of medice you would expect it to arrive faster given the nature of what it is for .
negative	totally unnaceptable , wish i had read reviews before i ordered .
negative	waiting for a parcel on a 0 - 0 day delivery - a birthday_present for my son .
negative	after 0 days their site said parcel was delivered but i hadn ' t received it .
negative	their website has no contact number on it but i managed to track one down and phoned up .
negative	they refused to give me any info " because i wasn ' t the sender " but they would " raise a query " with the courier and i might hear in 00_hours .
negative	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn ' t even been collected yet , it ' s been a tracking error ".
negative	what ?
negative	so you would think they would rush over and collect it and express delivery it on a 00 hour service .
negative	but oh no - it ' ll just be 0 - 0 days from when it gets collected .
negative	seriously ?
negative	what a complete_joke .
negative	and why don ' t they have their number on their website ?
negative	" because we ' re a web based company ."
negative	no , you ' re a human_being sitting in a physical office working for a company that has a website that doesn ' t bother to give customers their phone number .
negative	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
negative	we got to our hotel in bath and found out that this company had cancelled our stay and not even bothered to tell us !
negative	we had received a confirmation_email but the hotel had received nothing from hotel_voucher_shop about our booking .
negative	we tried to ring customer_service but it is closed on a weekend which is pretty ridiculous for a travel company !
negative	we rang an_emergency number for gullivers but they were pretty unhelpful and refused to speak to my boyfriend who made the booking .
negative	luckily we were able to get another room at the hotel so the weekend wasn ' t ruined .
negative	so in summary , terrible customer_service , we are in the process of making a complaint and hopefully we will get our money back and reimbursed for the voucher we used .
negative	i ' m living kuwait , my company sent me here .
negative	my company bought me a local phone but there ' s not good case for my new phone in kuwait market .
negative	i searched this shop by online .
negative	i checked if this shop can handle overseas order .
negative	i found a list of possible delivery country then bought some_cases .
negative	it was a story a month_ago ..... now i don ' t have any item .
negative	their responsibility is only ' saying sorry ' , ' wait ' ect ... always ctrl + c , ctrl + v
negative	i think they want customers to wait forever .
negative	from now on i ' m gonna fight against mobile madhouse till i get full_refund .
negative	and go to ********* because they send package through dhl_express .
negative	i ' ve never missed parcels using dhl_express or fedex .
negative	i don ' t care whether items come or not .
negative	i ' ll throw it trash can because i buy same one at *********.
negative	thx mobile madhouse .
negative	our deal is over .
negative	the tracking -- 0k0000000000a000 -- said my parcel was delivered .
negative	i emailled them to say we hadn ' t received it .
negative	they replied later the next_day saying no one was home , so the parcel was left in the shed .
negative	but ( a ) we were home all day and no one buzzed the door ( b ) i checked the shed and there is no parcel in the shed .
negative	not to mention , if they had put a parcel in the shed , you ' d think they ' d leave a note .
negative	i ' m sure the real reason no one rang my door and that there is no parcel in my shed is because their delivery man stole it !
negative	i order an xbox_000 and it arrived with no wires or hard_drive that it was supposed to i contacted the store i got it from and asked for a refund they told me i couldn ' t get a refund but they would send the wires out and never mentioned sending the hard_drive it said it would come with i contact them again asking about the hard_drive and they never got back its been a week and a half since and i still_havent recieved the wire for the console .
negative	shocking .
negative	they claim any enquiries will be answered within 00_hrs .
negative	after my third enquiry , a week after my original enquiry , i received a completely unhelpful reply , telling_me to call their number instead , which no doubt will cost .
negative	my experience is obviously tiny and unimportant compared to those whose tickets are cancelled , replaced etc , but i think it ' s very symptomatic of how this company runs and treats its customers .
negative	avoid .
negative	the 0 of us travelling to turkey had an awful experience with travelup .
negative	they incorrectly booked one of our flights despite it being right on our e_- ticket .
negative	also after noticing on our e_- ticket that they hadn ' t booked us baggage , we rang up to enquire .
negative	they told us that it was a mistake and that we did have luggage included .
negative	this was a lie which ended_up causing us a lot of hassle and costing £_00 .
negative	they were rude and unresponsive when we complained to them .
negative	im a new customer that made a booking with you guys , everything was fine till i departure , never got the email at departure to rate the hostel , i was so happy about it but after a week i decided to contact hostelbookers asking about it , someone called hollie reply saying email was sent , check your spam and they even said if i didnt book with them wont get the email what a retards ....... i eamil back and never got and answer .... customer_service suck im wondering_why some hotels have tons of rates and the other ones dont ?
negative	do you have special preference for some hostals ?
negative	do you have another contract with them ?
negative	thats what i think after this expirience ..... but what its funny is at my booking they send me this link to rate hostel_bookers they are more more worry to be rate than the hostels so taking this link the only one you sned me im goona rate you !!!
negative	!
negative	shame i have to pick a start and no half of it
negative	never ever again !!!!!
negative	!
negative	jessica lake
negative	ordered a product online with no store near - by , the product then became_faulty after 0 months , i used my order number to view the order online and it had an option to return and book a courier , i did this and no courier came , so i booked another day and no courier came .
negative	i rang up and they said that service is only for the first 00 days and go to a store .
negative	i told them i had no stores near by and there system gave me the impression the courier was coming .
negative	at no point did they admit there website was in the wrong , letting you book a collection after 00 days .
negative	really really bad service but in the end after insisting i was right , they refunded me .
negative	i ordered a petite star njoy bubble grey / black * reworked * a , this was a grade ( a ) pushchair and the website states grade a pushchairs are : returned items that are as ' new ' and un - used .
negative	when the item arrived it looked perfect , we had a good inspection as the website said : reworked prams and pushchairs are sold without warranty , under distance_selling regulations you have 0 days to return the item to us if you are unhappy for the goods in any way .
negative	we noticed the hood catch was faulty so i rang nursery value up and explained the issue and they said to send it back and we ’ ll repair it , i stated we would have no buggy in this time and can ’ t they send another pushchair to us and collect this one , as it would be quicker but they insisted on collecting and repairing the pushchair and said i ’ d have it back next week .
negative	i really wasn ' t happy with this as the distance_selling regulations said i was entitled to a refund and they could have just exchanged it .
negative	a long time past and i had no updates at all about my repair , i thought i would have had an update when they received it then when it went in to be repaired and so on .
negative	but i was totally in the dark about what was happening .
negative	so i called them and they said they haven ’ t even looked at it yet but they will soon and get it out the week after , i was totally unhappy with this as we at this point have been carrying our 0 month old baby around .
negative	so i stated i needed the pram asap and stated i was told i would have it this week and explained i had 0 days to cancel the transaction and said if the service is this bad please_accept my request to cancel , they then agreed to refund me i did actually receive the refund within 0 days but was shocked when they said : refunds can take up to 00 days but we aim to have these done with 0 - 00 working_days .
negative	they then said : we do hope that this experience hasn ' t put you off purchasing from us again .
negative	so i said it hasn ' t as i like the pram and may buy one from a retail store .
negative	but you ’ re never going to believe what they said next , remember the item came to me faulty .
negative	“ when we collect items for refunds we do need to minus £_00 from the refund for carriage cost , with this being a reworked item we generally would have charged £_00 for carriage as this comes with no guarantee for the repair .”
negative	yes they wanted to charge me £_00 carriage for their faulty item , i reminded them about the long_distance_selling regulations , the law , trading_standards and their reputation .
negative	they then said they would refund me in full .
negative	so in short their pushchairs do look really good and are good quality but if you have a problem that ’_s when the issues start , i just want people to beware and know your rights .
negative	i want the manager of the company to read this and ensure that their staff are retrained and updated on selling regulations , as you have good pushchairs but really really really bad aftercare and this can massively affect your business .
negative	i hope this review has helped some people .
negative	if they would have offered better service i would have gave these 0 / 0 .
negative	i have been ordering red wine cases about 0 times now and every time the quality of the wines get worse and worse .
negative	granted , they are all extremely young wines and pretty_much taste like vinegar next_day , but they are generally dull and tasteless - i wouldn ' t even recommend them to the casual wine drinker .
negative	the delivery was always next_day , but on my last order the courier did not follow_instructions to leave it with my neighbour next door - i had to inconvenience someone across the road whom i did not know .
negative	today a guy rang me and wanted to sell me a new piggybank - type system , apparently unlike any of those typical ' wine plans ' with plenty of benefits and discounts .
negative	it sounded alright on the phone and asked to be emailed the details in writing so i could have a look and then decide .
negative	moments later i receive two emails congratulating me on signing_up to this new fantastic service !
negative	i had to sign into my account and cancel it manually , where i was faced with the most outrageous and miserable cancellation process i ' ve seen in my entire life - involving ticking several check boxes etc .
negative	it was absolutely_ridiculous .
negative	this is a warning to anybody wanting cheap wine over the internet : stay_away from naked wines !
negative	try laithwaites wines instead , for instance , i ' ve only had very positive experience with them .
negative	placed order on 00 / 00 /_0000 worth £_00 . 00 .
negative	on 00 / 00 /_0000 i wrote :
negative	" could you please advise when this order will be dispatched ."
negative	on 00 / 00 /_0000 seller replied :
negative	" our dispatch team said that they will be shipping out tomorrow ."
negative	as of 00 / 00 /_0000 i have not received either dispatch notification or the item itself .
negative	therefore i conclude that this company is involved in fraudulent_activity and a scam .
negative	escalated dispute to claim on paypal .
negative	greatest mistake of my life was to join talk_talk . service is so poor and unprofessional .
negative	they never understand what your problem is and keep reapting same things even_though they have no clue about what they are talking_about . communication between various departments is so poor and they love transfeering your call from one department to another .
negative	at the end i decided to cancel my account after few weeks and its been three months i am still_waiting for my advance line_rental payment to be refunded . just talked to them now and was advised it could take another two more months to process it . unbelievable !
negative	strong advise to all of you , never ever ever switch to talk_talk .
negative	stay_away from talk_talk !
negative	absolutely_shocking customer_service - from order date to delivery took 00 days - still have not had any form of apology from the company - have asked for a refund of my delivery as a gesture of goodwill and they have refused .
negative	prices may be good - but make_sure your prepared to wait a long time for delivery and expect bad customer_service .
negative	i sent my damaged iphone 0 to envirofone because they said " we don ’ t offer an average price for a faulty phone ; instead we take the time to test each_individual mobile so that you get an individual price for the individual fault ."
negative	after saying they haven ' t received my phone for 0 days ( when intact the tracker showed they had ) i contacted them and amazingly the next_day they had not only received the phone , but had tested it and found it was damaged .
negative	everywhere was offering me around £_00 for my faulty phone .
negative	after taking their time they offer me a paltry £_00 .
negative	£_00 less_than almost every competitor .
negative	absolute waste of time .
negative	what has happened .
negative	i used envirofone many many years_ago when they were the industry leaders and pioneers .
negative	( sold some old nokias ).
negative	they are a shadow of their former self and are trading on their name .
negative	this is the worst delivery company i have ever had any dealings with .
negative	i have never had a successful delivery from this company .
negative	i try my very best to avoid buying from other_companies that use yodel as their delivery ' partners '.
negative	just because they are the cheapest way to deliver shouldn ' t mean the likes of amazon , asda and many others use them to deliver .
negative	i have had three total losses with them since the merger and the name change ( from hdnl to drop the bad reputation ) and the rest of the packages i have had to collect the products from the depot .
negative	i have complained on every occasion and don ' t even get a callback or a response when you e_- mail them .
negative	this company is a joke , avoid if possible and urge companies to not use them as a delivery partner .
negative	i ordered a brand_new flash yn - 000 from ebay , it was sealed and under_warranty .
negative	when i got the flash i found out it was faulty , it wouldn ' t turn on most of the times even with brand_new batteries .
negative	just after three or four uses , i thought i should get it checked since it was under_warranty .
negative	so i sent an_email to hkyongnuo service and got a reply within a day or two to send the flash to mr . william lin at their hongkong office .
negative	after that i kept on sending them emails to inform me when they receive my package .
negative	i got a reply after about two months saying that they still_haven ' t received my package .
negative	then after waiting for almost 0 months i decided to contact royal_mail ( uk ) to file a claim for lost parcel .
negative	fortunately , i found william ' s skype id from his email , added him and found him online .
negative	he then told me that he had received my parcel a few_days ago and it was sent for repair .
negative	he also said that i would have to pay them 00 usd for sending the flash back to me .
negative	i paid it right away and got my flash back within a few_days .
negative	when i opened the package i found out they forgot to send the diffuser and the flash still had the same problem .
negative	when i emailed william to send the diffuser back , he said he ' ll send one for " free " if i am willing to pay the shipping cost .
negative	i replied_saying that it wasn ' t my fault since he forgot to put the diffuser in the box and i have already paid the shipping cost , since then i haven ' t gotten any reply from them .
negative	take my advice , never buy anything from yongnuo and don ' t even hope for good or even satisfactory customer_service .
negative	i bought some shorts for a birthday_present for my dad and it didnt come in the waxx tin or with a keyring which i have recieved with all the other purchases that have been made by my family .
negative	i called consumer advice and reported this company since they had not delivered an item i ordered in february and a few_days_later i had a call from trading_standards .
negative	they told me they were in contact with decuisine , took my order details and said they would arrange a refund .
negative	do report them and make_sure you get your money back !
negative	i ordered three parcels to be picked_up on the same day from this company .
negative	0 arrived damaged , the other two went missing .
negative	i had to refund the customers , and parcel_monkey only refunded the original postage cost , even_though i insured bot the missing parcels for £_000 .
negative	all because their system showed the parcels not having been picked_up .
negative	customer_service is prompt , but they offer no compensation other than original postage cost even_though you pay extra for insurance .
negative	wide birth , avoid .
negative	use main companies like city_link , parcel_force , as they provide a tracking_number .
negative	the drivers for this company don ' t have collection tickets , even if you ask for their signature .
negative	i had to hand write one and ask the driver to sign it .
negative	unbelievably shoddy work !!
negative	!
negative	well firstly on arrival in france my transfer never actually turned_up at the airport !
negative	i rang all numbers listed on my booking confirmation and received no answer which_resulted_in us paying 000euros in taxi fare to the hotel .
negative	the next_day we rang the transfer company who told us we should have been given different information on the pick_up off resort_hoppa ( which we didn ' t receive ).
negative	he then told us he would email resort_hoppa and tell them we need to be refunded .
negative	on returning home i rang resort_hoppa to complain and ask for a refund and they told me to email their customer_services ( who you can ' t contact via phone ).
negative	i have since emailed and phones numerous_times and been told that it will be delt with shortly .
negative	they have even used excuses such as ' our customer_services team has just moved from spain to england so things are taking a bit longer ', which was a lie because in the phone call prior to that the woman said customer_services were in the next room to her !
negative	!
negative	i wrote the complaint in mid october and still have received nothing back now !!
negative	do not use the company unless you want to be stranded at an airport and waste your money !!
negative	!
negative	my wife called to say thank_you for the roses in which i asked did she also receive any chocolates , she said no in which it does state to come with these . she then said that to be truthful that i should probably ask for a refund due to most of then being nearly dead and only 00 roses .
negative	have also emailed but not likely to get a response any time soon .
negative	i ' ve been for more_than year with tmobile and experienced many problems with tmobile costumer_service team .
negative	few moths ago asked tmobile to change my tariff plan and was misinformed by costumer_service representative as result overrun my free minutes allowance and was billed en extra £_00 .
negative	i had to make many phone_calls and sent official_complaint letter to sort it out .
negative	last_week i phoned tmobile and ask them to send to my new addrees micro - sim for an iphone .
negative	i especially repeated few_times that i have new address , but representative ignored it and sent micro - sim to old adress however she charged me for it £_00 .
negative	moreover tmobile representative blocked my current sim_card so i can not use my phone anymore and to contact them i had to buy pay and go sim .
negative	over the next few_days i have contacted tmobile 0 times and every time was given different information_regarding my micro - sim !
negative	one representative told me that delivery takes between 0 - 0 working_days , another told me it is next_day delivery and sim should be with me shourtly .
negative	sim still_hasn ' t been delivered .
negative	it was funny to listen these_guys especially_considering fact that tmobile costumer_service located in india and philippines .
negative	i going to tmobile store now , and will have to pay another £_00 to get micro - sim .
negative	and most interesting is that there was no need to change sim_card i just needed to cut my old one in any mobile store for free .
negative	thank_you tmobile costumer_service that i have spent 0 week without phone and already have paid £_00 for nothing .
negative	gonna change my carrier for more_expensive but with professional costumer_service .
negative	i placed an order for a canon_000d , but after 0 days and no email confirmation , i emailed them to ask them why not .
negative	they told me the order had not gone_through , and in one of the most difficult to understand emails i have ever received , insisted i must phone them .
negative	i asked them why , they didn ' t say .
negative	i told them to phone me .
negative	they didn ' t .
negative	eventually i placed the order with another company ( panamoz ) and long after the initial contact with slr_hut i got an " order confirmation " email .
negative	they had put through the original order despite me telling them not to .
negative	i had to ring and cancel the order .
negative	terrible service , deliberately aimed at getting you on the phone .
negative	how an internet company can possibly only deal via the phone is unbelievable .
negative	avoid , their low_prices are bait for foolish customers .
negative	booked a collection for monday and was told they would collect between_0am and 0pm so i made sure someone was home all day .
negative	it got to 0pm and still no - one had been to collect the parcel , it is incredibly annoying to wait around all day and not get the parcel collected .
negative	at 00pm i opened the front_door to let my friend out , there was no card on the doorstep yet in the morning i found a card on the doorstep ( they couldn ' t even be bothered to put it through the letterbox ) saying that someone had attempted to collect and that no - one was in .
negative	which is an outright lie .
negative	the card hadn ' t even been filled out with details of parcel , delivery address , if they would return to pick_up another time or day .
negative	so i called yodel and they informed me that someone attempted to collect my parcel at 00 . 00 the night before which is not only a lie but it is also outside of the time of collection they stated .
negative	if you can avoid it , don ' t use this company to collect parcels .
negative	completely incompetent and unreliable !
negative	they have a . co . uk website but everything is still shipped from america .
negative	they took over a week to even dispatch my t - shirt .
negative	i ordered it on the 0th of december hoping to get it for christmas , but it hasnt arrived and doesnt even have a working tracking code .
negative	customer_services they told me i should expect it by the 00th_december .
negative	although they might say they ship from america on the about us page , a lot of people wont see this and when your shopping on the site it looks to be a normal uk site .
negative	buying any product that takes 00 days for delivery without prior warning is unacceptable but at christmas its is just outright bad customer_service .
negative	got a £ 0 , 000 computer from them for gaming and it is shit can only just play bf0 / mw0 on low setting
negative	next time i will build my own never again will i go to them for anything
negative	i ordered the big_boy xxl beanbag , via groupon , 0 weeks before_christmas ; waited 0 weeks for it to arrive and it never did so i logon to the website and the delivery date was very vague : week 00 , which to me means the week before_christmas .
negative	by 00rd_december it still hadn ' t arrive so i tried to ring them 00 + times and no answer !
negative	i tried the infurn website again and the delivery was changed for week 0 without informing_me !
negative	i emailed them and i finally got a reply reporting that they had a larger then expected order , but this does not make it acceptable to get a customer to wait 0 months for a simple beanbag .
negative	groupon would not take any responsibility for this .
negative	lets_hope it arrives in the end !
negative	stay_away
negative	revision 0th_jan :
negative	after writing my review , infurn have contacted trustpilot claiming they can ' t verify the sale : they are now going after their customers !
negative	i am even more appalled at infurns level of customer_service , how_dare they go after their customer honest_opinions , if they dont want bad_reviews maybe they should get their act_together .
negative	revision 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	now been advised that the beanbag won ' t be in til march thats 0 months for a beanbag to arrive !!!
negative	ridiculous !
negative	groupon won ' t take any responsibility for not checking the availability for what they have advertised .
negative	stay_away from groupon and infurn !
negative	zero_stars
negative	this company has very poor customer_service , it is impossible to reach them via the phone and to receive what you bought .

negative	that was my experience during half term at taunton asda .
negative	a young_girl asked for my id when i bought 0 bottles of lager .
negative	i showed her , she asked for the id for my children .
negative	i told her asda selling the lager to me not the children .
negative	she insisted if no id of the children to prove they are over 00 .
negative	then i cannot buy any lager .
negative	i am 00 , restaurant licensee .
negative	so i asked for her id to complain her poor knowledge .
negative	she then covered her name tag and said she is not called amy .
negative	she is fran .
negative	i told her how can she check people ' s id but she did not have her own .
negative	disguisting experience .
negative	the manager came to sort out and said she had to back up her staff ??
negative	what is the system ?
negative	disguisting service , very slow , very rude .
negative	paid the item on 0 / 0 , 0 days_later asked for more postage , paid them , no response no delivery until 00 / 0 , received the perfect box , but when opened , all solutions are falled aparts , complained to the customer_service , blamed to the courier broke them .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	operator julie snell was so rude at email , said would delete my details at their data base .
negative	i never had that poor horrible service in my life .
negative	they sells cheap but the service is so cheap too .
negative	will not go back at all .
negative	we are the managing agent who looks after the property on behalf of the landlord who is based in abu dhabi .
negative	in november of last_year there was a change of tenant .
negative	the previous tenant moved out and the new tenant moved in the day after .
negative	there was no electricity usage in between tenants .
negative	since november we have been receiving bills and debt_collection letters for £_000 at our office address but addressed to the landlord .
negative	we have emailed notification of change of tenancy numerous_times , sent letters and made phone_calls .
negative	first_utility refuse to speak to us as we are not named on the account ( despite our name being on the letters and bills ) but they have advised us rather_than the account being put into the new tenants name it has been put into the landlords even_though there was no usage over the 00_hours it was vacant .
negative	they now want the landlord to call them directly ( i ' m sure that is possible when he ' s based in uae ?!!!!)
negative	today i have been on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	will to live is disappearing very quickly .
negative	we have no_problems with change of tenancy when the big 0 are the providers but endless problems when it comes to first_utility
negative	after buying ready washed salad and finding a live caterpillar in the salad i immediately emailed sainsburys to notify them .
negative	i took them several days before i got a reply asking for an account number .
negative	the only account i have with them is a nectar card , i sent this and then they told me this is not what they wanted .
negative	they wanted an order number .
negative	two_weeks this was after my initial contact .
negative	as they were no help i took the salad into the store to deal with it .
negative	the staff were mortified that there was a big and didn ' t want to know .
negative	they told me to ring the number on the back .
negative	so i finally rang in , told them i was not happy with the customer_service , the delays and the fact that their ready washed and ready to eat salad is coming with bugs !!!
negative	she told me out of a " good will gesture " they would put £ 0 pounds onto my card .
negative	no apology , no recognition of the absolute hassle or the fact their food is dirty and not washed properly .
negative	she said if i wanted to i could bring it in for investigation but they usually don ' t do anything about salad .
negative	useless and annoyed !
negative	i have ordered a game from them and they just send it a fake game by using fake plastic shrink wrap . i was so upset for that .. unfortunately i havent chosen different shipping address , otherwise i was going send someone fake gift .
negative	i ordered 0 of the same electronic item and they just cancelled my order just because i ordered two .
negative	i had to wait 0week for reimbursement to be able to order them again from somewhere_else .
negative	and their customer_service manager is very rude , i don ' t know how she became customer_services manager but when i wanted to speak to her supervisor , she told me that she is actually a manager and i was really surprised .
negative	ordered a pair of rayban new wayfarers in maroon with prescription_lenses as a gift almost a month_ago .
negative	was initially pleased with the affordable prices .
negative	however do not be_fooled .
negative	the money came out of my account within days , yet weeks_later no sign of the product , and no emails highlighting that there had been any_issues_whatsoever .
negative	distressed , i used the order tracker online to track my order and was told that the details i had used were flagged up in the system and needed further verification .
negative	if i had not checked this myself , smartbuyglasses would never have informed me . how can a legitimate company not send an_email to inform a consumer of this ?
negative	what ' s more , how can a company take the money out of the consumers account and then claim there is delay with providing the product ?
negative	i have emailed the company regarding the supposed need for further verification and two_weeks_later , no reply .
negative	smart buy glasses are aiming to effectively steal over £_000 from me this company seems fraudulent and insincere .
negative	keep your distance .
negative	they fail to communicate after taking your money and ultimately do not deliver the product .
negative	this is theft and the only possible conflict resolution here is to take legal_action with a claims court , which i am_currently seeking advice regarding .
negative	the company needs to take warning , service like this will not be tolerated and we are certainly no fools .
negative	it might be the cheapest broadband provider in the uk but certainly not the best .
negative	the internet speed is not great , the tv channels not fantastic but i was able to live with that .
negative	the worse and unbearable thing is the customer_services ... saying that it is non_existent would be a compliment .
negative	they are not only completely_useless and but also probably paid to annoy you .
negative	talktalk could get_rid of them and replace them with machines , the end_result would be the same .
negative	they don ' t understand your request at all , don ' t even care , and just repeat again and again talktalk policy .
negative	helping you is not on their job description .
negative	even now that i ' ve cancelled my account with them 0 months_ago , i still have issue with the refund they owe me .
negative	talktalk is not a reliable company .
negative	i purchased an item on the 0rd of july was told delivery 0 working_days , no product arrived , contacted groupon and was lied to 0 times that my order was with royal_mail , im still_waiting after 0 weeks for my product .
negative	i contacted groupon and was told i have to wait 00 working_days for my item to be re - issued even_though the merchant was willing to do it straight_away if groupon gives the authorization .
negative	groupon refused and i asked for a refund and was told i had to wait the 00 working_days first for the re - issue before they can refund my money even_though i don ' t want the product anymore .
negative	they have the worst customer_service and even their manager gareth is the most useless and very unhelpful , if you don ' t want to come off the phone crying don ' t bother buying from them because they would frustrate you .
negative	i paid for next_day delivery on a product which apparently couldn ' t be delivered when required .
negative	no clear indication on the website , or even a warning when i chose the option it just let me pay for something i would never receive .
negative	spoke to their customer_services who were short , rude and completely unhelpful , with no offer of a refund on delivery .
negative	i have raised this issue with trading_standards as a false representation of a service . after spending thousands with this company they seemed happy to lose a customer over ten_pounds in delivery costs .
negative	i would advise to completely avoid until they amend their website to only sell you products and services they can actually deliver on and change their poor customer relationship attitude .
negative	my flowers from my girlfriend were delivered after she had finished work but rather_than call the delivery agent had just dumped them outside on a busy main street .
negative	and suprise , suprise they got ruined .
negative	any way no contact number to get immediate answers and resolution instead i have had to write emails , post on their facebook and message them on facebook , then wait hours for a response which was we will " investigate " nothing to investigate , they messed_up i ' m requesting a full_refund .
negative	we ' ll see how that goes .
negative	wrong cable sent and speaker reflects light , completly the opposite of what i was told , just to get a sale .. still wating for the correct cable to use the speaker ..
negative	i won ' t be doing_business again with this company if sales are all they are interested in .
negative	i recently_purchased a mattress from this company that i had meticulously researched .
negative	i ordered it online without a problem and the money was taken out of my account quickly .
negative	the next_day i received a phone call from mattressnextday telling_me that the mattress i had ordered was now out of stock ( even_though it did not say this on the website ).
negative	i was offered an_alternative and was told on the phone that the mattress i would be receiving instead was very similar / almost the same as the one i had originally ordered .
negative	i mentioned exchanging on the phone and she said " it wouldn ' t be a problem " but failed to mention the £_00 charge .
negative	the day after that , the alternative mattress arrived .
negative	it was roughly packaged and covered in mud and dirt .
negative	i could tell instantly that it was a terrible mattress and phoned the customer_service number .
negative	the lady i spoke to on the phone was rude , unhelpful and unsympathetic .
negative	she didn ' t apologise at all and then told me that if i wanted a refund i would need to pay £_00 .
negative	i argued that it wasn ' t the mattress i originally ordered , that the lady didn ' t mention the charge and that i had been mislead by her ( i was told it was similar ) but it did not matter .
negative	i am now paying fifty pounds to have this mattress taken away , i would unquestionably not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	take note : no paper work comes with the mattresses that they deliver .
negative	appalling .
negative	simply appalling .
negative	i don ' t know how this company is still in business .
negative	the customer_service is non - existent .
negative	we ordered a painting for my parents wedding_anniversary and use interparcel as the courier it arrived to us 0 days day with no explanation or apology we opened the packaging to find the frame and glass smashed .
negative	the answer we received was that its no there problem well im sorry but if i am putting my faith in your company to complete a simple_task as to delivery my parcel to me in one piece so of us quite clearly can not do their job properly .
negative	ill give you a clue , its not me !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single_person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay_away .
negative	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
negative	all correspondence i have had with this company will be being sent to trading_standards and also watchdog and would suggest everyone_else do the same .
negative	its about time companies like these get what they deserve .
negative	this company and there dodgy third_party companies have cost me a further £_000 in repair costs not to mention £_000 on a new painting for my parents wedding_anniversary .
negative	i don ' t know how this company is still in business .
negative	the customer_service is non - existent .

negative	this is not the first time i am on a contract .
negative	but the first time on tmobile and definitely the last time .
negative	i have to say they have the worst customer_service in the uk .
negative	no coverage and i called them to ask to change the plan so that i dont have to atleast waste my data .
negative	the customer_service never picks_up the calls despite waiting for 00 min on the line .
negative	obviously they must have that many annoyed customers on call .
negative	if you go to the store its unbearable to stand the attitude of their staff .
negative	please teach them some manners .
negative	i cant_wait to end the contract .
negative	oh my .. its a long wait though
negative	first of all you can only log in with a facebook account ?
negative	what is that about ?
negative	when there are many of us slowly eliminating facebook from our lives , besides that what about the endless amounts of fake promotional profiles as i like to call them ,
negative	fake accounts that are used to promote websites ?
negative	these are then used to rate companies ?
negative	dont sound right to me .
negative	but my actual complaint about trust_pilot is that you cannot tell the truth !
negative	by telling the truth in your review it will be removed !
negative	i have a very genuine case against a very big website yet soon as i rate it 0 / 0 and give an honest opinion based on my many years experience with the company it is removed and i am sent an_email from trust_pilot asking why i have made this review .
negative	what ?
negative	it s in the review trust_pilot !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	the review explains why i made the review surely ?
negative	the worst part is every one else can make a review with out the need for trust_pilot to take it down ask to change then send an_email asking why you made it .
negative	its a review site isn ' t it ?
negative	its an honest review yet you have taken it down and wont let me re - post or post another review about this company ?
negative	corruption !

negative	my website has been tried and tested and verified safe , we are a registered business and work hard to keep our members happy and safe .
negative	we are verified safe by all the companies that actually test website , who are facebook to make the statement ?
negative	" this website may be unsafe " <<< facebook statement !
negative	facebook are putting up public statements that our sit is not safe !
negative	this is a " false spoken statement damaging to our reputation ". i have sent report after report , suggestion after suggestion called the facebook no service customer_service phone number only to go round in circles and told at the end they do not offer phone support !
negative	and sent a letter the ireland h . q .
negative	the customer_service is extremely un - satisfactory !
negative	if facebook take peoples money facebook should have a customer_service !
negative	facebook have no customer_service !

negative	facebook is ranked number one in the world battling between google , if facebook makes an un - warranted decision to display an un - justified message then the herd will believe facebook is right regardless of how wrong facebook is .
negative	facebook website is damaging every thing i have taught myself and worked hard for !
negative	i pay them money to advertise my site and now they display a message on my site stating it " may be un - safe !"
negative	this has been in place for almost 0 weeks now , this is causing massive loss in traffic , engagement and sales !
negative	we are suffering heavily !

negative	i ordered flower for the same day delivery for my wife birthday in luxembourg .
negative	the flowers were never delivered , plus they never answer my email when i filed a complain .
negative	i don ' t know how such a site can buy google_ads and be on top of search_results .
negative	they took my money and there is no way for me to having it back .
negative	it ' s definitely a scam .
negative	i ' ve tried several time to switch from a cash - back website and eon website seems no to work ...
negative	i had to change my ticket due to an_emergency .
negative	i was told that i could not change the ticket and i had to cancel it with no refund .
negative	i lost out on 000 plus dollars .
negative	most airlines have a cancellation_fee or a change ticket fee .
negative	i am disappointed , because i paid them for nothing .
negative	i am a paying customer and the least i can get for my money is some help or some of my money back .
negative	ebookers has lost a customer and i will be sure to let my friends know , that when life happens and things change ebookers dose not compromise .
negative	please stay clear !
negative	where do i begin , bad coverage when i was told it was good , i had a 00 day sim which i only wanted for 00 days but you have to give 00 days notice so as soon as i got it i rang 000 to cancel now this is a call_centre in india they are very hard to understand it took 00_mins to cancel and get a pac_code during these 00_mins i was told i would have to pay for 0 months which i said i wasn ' t paying as its a 00 day contract and i was giving 00 days notice i will pay for that then i was told that i would get a bad credit_rating and enforcement officers would come and collect the money after this i agreed to pay so i could get my pac_code and cancel then i got put through to cancelations who then tried to sell me another contract i had to say i just want to cancel about 00 times before they actually did it awful company
negative	a few_days ago i needed to order 0 - tyres for my car and i decided to purchase these through the national website .
negative	the quoted price was £_00 . 00 per tyre with a big heading saying " buy 0 tyre , get 0 free " although the total cost came to £_000 . 00 !.
negative	my first impression was already one of distrust but it was the only place i could find with a saturday slot for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	on arrival i went into the reception to find no staff , no problem i thought as they might be busy .
negative	i waited 0 - mins and then decided to go and find a mechanic .
negative	i politely asked if someone could come and talk to me regarding my booking .
negative	" you ' ll have to wait , can ' t you see we ' re busy ?"
negative	said the man .
negative	i responded with an ok and thank_you and proceeded to sit in the reception .
negative	another customer was sitting down and conversed with me regarding her own experience that morning .
negative	apparently her car was about to be seen only for the mechanic to get a phone call and spend 00 - mins in the back !
negative	we could even hear him shouting at someone on the phone .
negative	he eventually came out with no apologises .
negative	i have now been waiting 00 - mins and still no - one has acknowledged me even_though i ' ve spent £_000 to support these_guys jobs .
negative	" oh mr . mason " said another man who came to reception " is that you ?"
negative	i nodded " someone will see you in a bit "...
negative	when is ' in a bit '??...
negative	the lady said i would miss the whole day at this rate .
negative	00 - mins later the man came back in " move your car in for us would you ?".
negative	i proceeded to drive the car onto the forecourt and without even a thank_you they started working on my car .
negative	i went and sat back in the reception .
negative	another 00mins past and one of the mechanics walked in , started eating his sandwich and then approached me and reached for my car key , which was in my hand , without even a friendly gesture or even asking for my car key .
negative	i handed it over saying " is my car almost done ?"
negative	he walked out .
negative	another 00 - mins past and the mechanic sorting my car walked in and sat down at the desk and started typing .
negative	after 0 - mins he said " oh mr . mason you can go now its all done ".
negative	so off i went to my car with the key left in the ignition , my wipers left on and my lights on full beam .
negative	is this garage for real ?!
negative	are these_guys just some cowboys who have locked the national mechanics in the back and running some shoddy show out front .
negative	extremely unprofessional , unhelpful and rude .
negative	i will certainly be avoiding this garage and all other national auto centre ' s in the future ... my friends will be receiving the same advice .
negative	kwik_fit gets a lot of flak in the car world ... at_least the service was friendly and it was cheaper !
negative	i placed an order for xbox one controller and was promised it would be here for day one , a week_later it is still not here , so i asked for a refund .
negative	they went_ahead and canclled my order but didn ' t give the money back .
negative	now they have stopped_replying to my emails !
negative	i placed my order on wednesday before 0 pm and i received an_email that states it would be delivered on friday or monday .
negative	it ' s friday_evening now and there ' s no news , is this a joke ?
negative	ebay delivers from china in 0 days !
negative	plus , there ' s so many online sports supplement s websites that provide same day delivery .
negative	ordering on wednesday and waiting till_monday is silly , will never order from this site again .
negative	i submitted an unlock for orange uk ( now ee ) and they said it would be done within 0 week .
negative	0 and a half months later , still no unlock , no contact from customer_service and best of all they never answer the phone .
negative	they blamed orange / t - mobile merger for the delays but another phone shop officially_unlocked it in just three days !
negative	if you want your phone unlocked , do not go here as you ' ll end up paying for nothing - they will not give you a refund either .
negative	they also have a tendency to report real feedback to trustpilot as where all their other reviews are not genuine .
negative	two_weeks_later , still no item , no communication / explanation , nor any response to email .
negative	edit_: in response to what is stated from tredz below and that they understand that i have " spoken to someone ".
negative	no one had been in touch by phone or email at that point .
negative	i got a call today and surprise , surprise they had it problems and it is out of stock / discontinued .
negative	this also proved the lie below stating that the " order had now been dispatched ", because i cancelled the order over the phone .
negative	0 .
negative	don ' t list items for sale that are not for sale .
negative	0 .
negative	if items run out of stock let customers know within one day , not 00 days .
negative	0 .
negative	don ' t lie to customers in an attempt to look like you are being a responsible company to the outside world .
negative	0 .
negative	it is also interesting that i got a response to a public post here rather_than my personal email .
negative	rating has been downgraded to 0 star due to the proven lies and lack of trustworthiness .
negative	i ordered four kubikov dining_chairs with matching felt cushions from homeconcept00 in july_0000 .
negative	once you place your order ( and pay at point of order ) you receive one email as confirmation of order .
negative	then you wait .
negative	and wait .
negative	and wait .
negative	in fact i waited for eight weeks and heard_nothing so i made contact with them .
negative	no answer .
negative	i emailed again .
negative	no answer .
negative	i called th uk phone number ( which is forwarded to germany ) and no one answered .
negative	i called five times before receiving an answer .
negative	i was informed my chairs and cushions would be with me in four move weeks .
negative	the chairs arrived six_weeks_later after several more emails that went_unanswered .
negative	four chairs but only one cushion !
negative	dozens of emails and phone_calls later and still no response .
negative	in the end i arranged for a credit_card charge back as this company had failed to send all the products .
negative	it was only when i did this that they answered my emails .
negative	in the end , i received the cushions two_weeks before_christmas .
negative	in total , it took them five months to complete the order .
negative	they have the most dreadful service and they honestly just don ' t care .
negative	my advice is to find someone_else to purchase from if you can .
negative	homeconcept00 are very hard work to deal with .
negative	one other piece of advice is that while there are very few uk reviews for them , there are a lot of reviews from germany ( where they are based ) and generally the reviews are very poor .
negative	a quick google_search using the translation function should prove illuminating !!

negative	three emails sent regarding my order for mothers_day flowers which were supposed to be delivered today and were not .
negative	i have tried all day to access iflorists " live support " which untill half past nine tonight was set to " away ".
negative	when i was finally able to connect i was informed by " jack " that due to the mothers_day rush , iflorist were unable to find a florist to deliver on time .
negative	despite the order being placed on 00st_march , nobody could be bothered to get in touch and let me know this in order that i could make alternative_arrangements .
negative	when i asked why no one had been in touch , i was then informed that due to the limited amount of florists in the area the delivery would not be dispatched untill tuesday .
negative	considering the money has already been taken from my account i think this is completely_unacceptable .
negative	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn ' t expect such shoddy service , i think it ' s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people ' s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
negative	i have been offered a discount_voucher for £_00 my next order , well i can tell you with absolute certainty that there will never be a next order from me or anyone i know .
negative	i wouldn ' t use iflorist again if they were paying me !
negative	i have been told that " jack " will arrange a full_refund , which will be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
negative	in the meantime , i will now have to explain to a rather disappointed mum what has happened and hope that a much more reliable and trustworthy interflora can deliver something which will make up for iflorists terrible service .
negative	in future i ' ll be reading reviews before i purchase anything , but in the meantime i would urge_anyone to stick to trusted sites and avoid this mob like the plague !
negative	i used this company due to it ' s convenience and had my car collected from work .
negative	car passed mot , payment made and i was advised car would be delivered for 0000 .
negative	0000 came and went , no car .
negative	called the helpline at 0000 to be told by a robotic and non - compassionate advisor that the garage had closed for the day and my car is in the locked compound .
negative	i work in a completely remote location with no links to public_transport and all my colleagues had left for the day .
negative	after 0 hours of bouncing calls around and getting no where with the unhelpful agent , i had to make my own arrangements .
negative	long_story short , an_apology was made but no reimbursement for expensive taxi , missed commitments with the family and cancelation of business meetings .
negative	convenience turned into a complete nightmare .
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	i ordered 0 pairs for the price of 0 on the 0th of october , received the cheaper of the two 0 - 0 weeks_later but still no sign of the other pair despite countless emails .
negative	it ' s been 0 months now .
negative	was told there was an error found during dispatch and that they would be with me shortly but have heard_nothing since .
negative	i ' ve neither heard nor received anything since and get no reply to my emails .
negative	avoid at all cost !
negative	there seems to be no customer_service at all , the cheap prices really aren ' t worth it !
negative	attempt 0 to get through to someone in as many days , currently held for 00_minutes .
negative	attempts 0 - 0 i gave up after 00_mins each .
negative	attempt 0 their automated callback disconnected me .
negative	i got through yesterday , but this time their system was down .
negative	been a customer for a week as they supplied our new house , and its been a week too long ; already switching .
negative	if this is an example of what scotland has to offer , good luck to them and the potential independence !!
negative	shocking .
negative	i ordered a switch actuator for a kenwood kettle on 00th_feb_0000 and it promptly arrived a mere 0 months later on the 00th of august_0000 !
negative	( yes 0 months , i know amazingly fast right !)
negative	once i had recovered from the excitement of my delivery i eagerly opened the package looking_forward to admiring my shiny_new switch ... unfortunately my new found happiness was short lived .
negative	the switch was the wrong_colour ... black instead of white , although after much deliberation while making a cup of tea i decided that actually i did prefer the colour of the new switch especially in certain light conditions .
negative	after all of these ups and downs with this package the absolute worse thing was that the switch was broken on delivery so totally un - switchable !
negative	i will look_forward to being_able to update this review in another 0 months when the replacement hopefully arrives .
negative	in summary .... worse £ 0 . 00 plus p_& p ever !
negative	you can sometimes buy in their shop products in good prices , that is the reason i bought from them my seagate 0tb green , the disc failed after few_months , and when you try to contact them they made up senseless excuses , they don ' t even talk correct sentences just senseless words which you later put_together as meaning '' no sorry '' there is no warranty talk with manufacturer .
negative	as they say they are not trained to offer you other product in place of broken one .
negative	as when you loose 0tb precious data isn ' t enough you will end up with empty wallet .
negative	i agree dabs . com might know how to sell you a product but that is where they finish their job .
negative	and as with every company making business in this way you can read up on their website dozen of comments from supposedly satisfied customers and off course only positive ones how wonderful the company is
negative	ordered my ghds from them and was happy with the service until yodel tried to deliver my product .
negative	as soon as i got the first card through the door i phoned the delivery person as instructed on the card and asked when they would be re - delivered .
negative	i said that i would be available saturday_morning ( the next_day ) before 00 as i was away for the weekend or after 0 in the week ( it also stated on the card that they deliver between 0 . 00 and 0pm ).
negative	i also said they could leave it with a neighbour .
negative	the next card i got through the door stated that they tried to deliver it at 00 and that they couldn ' t leave it with a neighbour , then again at lunch times during the week .
negative	after the last card i contacted yodel to explain what had happened and they said i could pick it up from the local_depot .
negative	no where in the email or on their website did it give the address of the local_depot or a date to collect by .
negative	so i went down on a saturday_morning at my earliest convenience to collect package and was surprised to find they had sent it back to sender within a week .
negative	i then contacted body care 0000 to rearrange delivery and was again surprised to find they had refunded me less 00_% for costs for delivery .
negative	as it states on their website that you have two_weeks to collect ( if delivered by royal_mail ).
negative	i then inquired about what had happened and why i was being charged when i didn ' t feel i was at fault and i got some really patronising emails off someone called linda @ bodycare0000 .
negative	i then asked for a number and a manager to contact and they never got back to me .
negative	i am out of pocket and have no product .
negative	i placed order in the beginning of november , 0000 for my purchases of christmas .
negative	i received only a part of my order and having contacted twice the customer_service by e_- mail ( once in french , once in english ), i still had no answer .
negative	when we deliver all over the world , it would be sensible to have a customer_service at the height .
negative	i was never paid off and i had to buy other christmas_presents !!
negative	!
negative	this company is diabolical and i have never been involved with such scam_artists .
negative	yes there are some good reviews on this site for pyb , however they are from people who just say " cheap and quick to set_up " - they haven ' t even tried claiming from pyb .
negative	my ipad was stolen and they are refusing to pay out .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i ' ve been with talktalk for nearly 0 years now and throughout those 0 years my internet has been appalling !
negative	the first house i was in it was an everyday exerciser to have to plug and unplug the router 00 - 00 times before it would connect .
negative	after trying to make a complaint i was told it was my computer .
negative	i was living in a house with 0 of us , all with different computers of different ages and operating systems .
negative	after telling them that they told me it was my software , again told them this , each " problem " was always me , never them .
negative	after giving up and then moving_house the problem persisted , this could no_longer be the house , or even the area , causing these problems .
negative	after multiple attempts at contacting them , an engineer and many phone_calls the problem is still reoccuring .
negative	i can ' t watch anything online , from a youtube video to on demand shows .
negative	neither can i use my phone or tablet on the wifi , again because it ' s too slow .
negative	it ' s impossible to send a snapchat , photo via_email or even skype relatives or friends because they can never get through !
negative	it ' s becoming a real issue .
negative	i spent 0 hours this morning trying to file a complaint and was told there were no managers i could speak to , however after getting rather angry with the caller , she suddenly said that there was a manager i could speak to .
negative	again , after being asked if i had an old computer , being told to use the lan cord ( this is not wifi , therefore not what i want to be paying for ) and threatening to contact the papers , i was abruptly interrupted and offered a new router , because this might be the issue !
negative	0 years with the same router and only now do they tell me this might be the issue !
negative	!
negative	this is unacceptable for a company and i am_disgusted with the way i was treated as a customer .
negative	never go for talktalk .
negative	it ' s better paying a little extra for a better internet provider .
negative	ordered two_pairs of shoes from boohoo totaling almost £_00 .
negative	i was charged for both and only received one .
negative	i have tried to contact boohoo using all methods ( inc twitter and facebook ) and had no response .
negative	their customer_service is truly_awful .
negative	they have no contact number and despite responding to most_recent messages on twitter , they ignored mine from hours ago .
negative	very selective about who the help obviously .
negative	disgusting .
negative	if i could give no stars , i would have .
negative	i will never be using boohoo again .
negative	they do not care about their customers at all .
negative	avoid at all costs .. you can get the same items elsewhere and actually receive them !
negative	!
negative	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
negative	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
negative	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
negative	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
negative	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer_service lines .
negative	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
negative	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
negative	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer_service via his customer_service line .
negative	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer_service line .
negative	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
negative	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
negative	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
negative	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
negative	now , let me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
negative	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
negative	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
negative	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
negative	i had spent over £_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
negative	moral of the story ?
negative	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd ...
negative	the silver lining .
negative	my husband bought me roses for our first valentines_day together .
negative	he recieved an_email on wednesday 00th at 00 . 00pm to say they wouldnt be delivered until 00th !!!!!
negative	after waiting until 0pm today - still no sign so my husband called up and apparently they would be there before 0pm !
negative	they have just turned_up now and and they are a total state .
negative	every flower is pretty_much dead .
negative	really disappointed .
negative	was not explained to me the photos were going to be smaller_than i had ordered due to the different ratio aspect of digital photos .
negative	i had ordered photos 00x00 and were actually 00x00 .
negative	they looked awful in the photo album i had purchased .
negative	quick delivery though and customer support replied quickly when i complained about the size issue but there was no compensation .
negative	you would seriously be a sad state of mind to pay for any program on itv_player , now i like a lot of itv programs but if i miss them on normal tv i just put it down to experience .
negative	the adverts never seem to have a problem .......... think about it !!!
negative	!
negative	purchased an acre of moon off here from moon estates , waited 00 days for it to arrive , when it did the certificate had the wrong name on it .
negative	when i contacted moon estates they told me it was a £ 0 charge to change the name and that they had had a great number of calls as wowcher had made mistake with order details .
negative	i do not see why i should have to pay this amount to change the name .
negative	have emailed several_times over a week_ago and heard_nothing back at all .
negative	disgusted
negative	have had countless orders from this company however my last 0 orders have been terrible .
negative	items arriving damaged , no tags , heel broken on a pair of boots and a strap on a bag snapped .
negative	sizes changed order a 00 it ' s like an 00 order a 00 it ' s like a 0 .
negative	complained to head_office as ordered a cardigan size 00 .
negative	when it came was stuffed in a bag , hole in shoulder , no tags to say was new .
negative	looked inside had a george asda tag size 0 .
negative	contacted company took photo of item they denied sending it said they didn ' t sell asda clothing even_though cardigan was identical to the one on the site which i screen_shot and sent with the picture of the cardigan .
negative	they refused to let me return it .
negative	person who emailed me was very rude .
negative	ups are so bad it is barely comprehensible .
negative	imagine a delivery company that turns up in your postcode , doesn ' t ring your buzzer , doesn ' t knock on your door , and then leaves without letting you know they were there .
negative	apparently , on planet ups , this counts as an attempted delivery .
negative	of course , for all of the psychic people in the uk , this is no problem at all .
negative	for the rest of us , this is not exactly ideal .
negative	and then imagine you arrange for them to come on another day , agree a specific date with them , receive email confirmation of this date , and then they turn_up again 0 week before this agreed date .
negative	what are they thinking might happen ?
negative	there are a few things i can ' t fathom about ups : how they can be so stupid , and how they can make any money mindlessly attempting to deliver items .
negative	i will never , ever , ever knowingly use a company that has ups as its delivery company .
negative	first order fine although received a few_days late .
negative	my second and larger order has been a complete_shambles .
negative	i ordered the same product by in slightly larger quantities .
negative	was given a delivery date via_email confirmation .
negative	the delivery date come and went with no communication from them .
negative	a few_days after the delivery date i emailed and received no reply , i used online_chat and was told it is out of stock , i asked when do they expect stock and was told " i don ' t know i don ' t deal with online orders " i asked why no one had bothered to call or email and let me know and was again told i don ' t deal with online orders ask mike ( i ' v never had any dealings with anyone called mike and had no contact details .
negative	about a week after the delivery date i emailed asking for an update and no reply again .
negative	i re emailed asking for a refund no reply .
negative	complete_waste of time and now have to wait for paypal to refund .
negative	will not be using workwear ( not ) express again .
negative	* in response to workwear_express reply *
negative	a copy and pasted reply is not good customer_service , and saying " i will look_into what occurred to ensure that these sorts of problems don ' t arise for future customers " is pointless just reading the first 00 or so reviews you ' ve said this at_least 0 times , so either you ' ve not looked into what occurred as you claim or you ' ve not sorted things out .
negative	its amazing that you ' ve failed to reply to my emails yet within minutes you reply to my review and contact me regarding my paypal_dispute .
negative	if you are in fact sorry as you claim to be give me a refund and learn and take on board what the reviews say instead of simply offering a generic reply and forgetting about it .
negative	this company is claiming to be based at 000 moston lane , however this is not the case and 000 moston lane is my address , we have never had any dealings with them except the countless people visiting to complain .
negative	avoid this company as any order your place will result in your money being lost and nothing to show for it .
negative	this company is a complete scam , the office address they are using to claim they have a uk office is infact my property .
negative	the police visited today with a warrant as they are ripping people off selling them container loads of paper at a fraction of the uk retail price however it never shows up and nor do your money .
negative	i am only on my second month with plus net and i ' m on my third fault .
negative	trying to get someone to listen when reporting a fault is like pulling teeth .
negative	always the same question have you changed the micro filter , router is your phone ok they then say they will run some tests and it could take up to 00_hours .
negative	on all 0 occasion after the 00_hours is up they send an_email_saying the support ticket has been closed as your internet is now connected .
negative	i have to go through the whole rigmarole again because its still not working .
negative	0 months 0 faults and about 0 days with no connection whatsoever yet they still wont send an engineer out .
negative	i waited on hold for 00_minutes only for the phone to cut_off .
negative	when through their online trouble shooter about 00 stupid questions in is says sorry there was a problem please try later .
negative	well plus . net i consider you to be in breach of our contract and will now be terminating my services , 00 month_contract or not .
negative	complete_shambles and complete_waste of time run by people who cannot think for themselves only readying auto prompt of their computer screens .
negative	the worst thing you ever did was to sell out to bt .
negative	this is a scam the website offers downloads and installs a tool bar , changes your home page and search providers then puts a popup saying the download you requested is no_longer available .
negative	i have a good anti virus so have tried on a couple of different files and all do exactly the same .
negative	don ' t waste your time and risk downloading something you cannot get_rid of .
negative	very poor , been waiting on a delivery for 0 weeks now tracking keeps saying tried to deliver .
negative	we ' re a business open 0 - 0 yet they claim they tried to deliver and left a card .
negative	we ' ve never closed during the day and no card was left .
negative	business should stop using them as their carrier , my supplier has now lost my business simply because yodel cannot do what they are paid to do .
negative	if you ' re reading this reveiw do not buy a car from these people .
negative	the worst dealership i ' ve ever came_across
negative	having had a few visits to this dealership i ' ve had my car damaged twice ( included one when i was in they car yet they still denied it ).
negative	been told i do not have the extended_warranty i pay for monthly ( which turns_out that it covers nothing ).
negative	and finally today they lied to me about having someone who_wants to buy my car , upon_arriving at the dealership it was very clear that they just want to sell me a car and and want offer less that have the glass guide price for trade in .
negative	this just from the outside where there is no damage at all .
negative	sent iphone 0 in good condition , sent recorded_delivery , then got email_saying screen cracked which is a joke as this had bubble rap and was in a case , said phone screen cracked so it was put down form 000 to 00 , i have sent many phone before with out problem , this has made me so mad and i will never trust this company again , would not surprise me if the company has been sold to somebody_else .
negative	never ever using this again !.
negative	just seen the reply , 0 its my word vs your word about phone being damaged .
negative	0 you could have damaged it .
negative	0 . what the point off sending phone back if its been damaged .
negative	thats why i took the price in the first place its one big joke , like i say never will
negative	use again !
negative	.............................. update ..................................................
negative	will never use again !
negative	thats the end .
negative	my husband ordered me flowers for valentine ' s day , and it was agreed upon ordering them that they would be delivered before 0pm as we were leaving for a week long trip at 0pm ( the plan was to take the flowers with us so that i could enjoy them whilst i was away ).
negative	between 0 and 0pm my husband was getting more and more concerned that the flowers hadn ' t showed up , so he kept ringing eflorist but could never get through on the phone ( he was on hold the entire time ).
negative	we waited until 0 . 00pm but couldn ' t hold on any longer as we had a 0 hour car journey ahead of us and a 00 month old who needed to be put to sleep in the car .
negative	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .
negative	after failing to get through to eflorist on the phone , my husband sent an_email complaint to them but no one ever replied .
negative	the next_day he continually rang eflorist but could never get through when selecting the option that he was calling about an " existing order ".
negative	eventually he got through when he selected the option to " place a new order ", and was told he was not eligible for a refund despite explaining our circumstances in detail .
negative	we never even got to see the flowers as we were away for a week , and they had died by the time we got home .
negative	we both wrongly assumed that eflorist would be apologetic and give us a full_refund but as they refused we intend to spread the word to our friends , family and beyond that they shouldn ' t use eflorist .
negative	following on from reviewing a company trustpilot contacted me saying my negative_review of said company was in breach of their guidelines .
negative	i edited by review to bring it inline and it went live .
negative	it was taken down again immediately and i was asked to provide_evidence to my purchase .
negative	i sent an invoice i had from the company and imagined i would see my review live again .
negative	this is not the case .
negative	i ' m now being questioned on what i purchased , as if that is relevant whether i bought a chair or a table !
negative	the important point is that i have complied with every_single guideline and my review is still not visable .
negative	i find this completely_unacceptable and certainly not unbiased as they should be .
negative	this awful company let me down in couple of occasions .
negative	couple of time they didn ' t even left the card , but when i checked online - attempted delivery card left .
negative	but funny think was , that i was home at all time .
negative	so literally the self employees drivers showing the company that they are at work even they are not .
negative	so they just scan a package in the car but they never go to the address .
negative	and after 0 attemps , they will just return package to the depot .
negative	and depot is about 00miles away from my house :) and phone customer support won ' t even give you phone number for the driver .
negative	i have never_experienced worst delivery company in my life .
negative	having read previous comments i have also had a poor experience with this company .
negative	i had two samsung_galaxy_s0 ' s that were in very good condition and was lured to this company because of the fantastic price they offered ( they were offering 00_% more_than [_external reference_] or [_external reference ]).
negative	when they phones were tested that apparently had bad bezel damage , they didn ' t , and the price offered was a fraction of the original .
negative	haggling occurred and then finally i settled on a price as it was clear i was not going to receive my phones back .
negative	also had a major problem with getting payment as they took down the wrong details and then had the phone put down on me by their customer_services team when all i wanted was to sort out my details so i could get paid .
negative	please avoid them and go for a more recognised and trusted company , they are just not worth the hassle .
negative	very have £_00 of my cash and won ' t return it .
negative	can ' t get any response from then .
negative	spent £££ on their chargeable phone line trying to rectify their mistakes .
negative	useless robots in a call_centre ( south_africa ?)
negative	who say they will sort it out , then do nothing .
negative	been in tears .
negative	need my money back .
negative	it ' s xmas !!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered a tv online and was told the delivery would be between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm during the week , so i had to take an afternoon off work to make_sure i was in the house to accept the delivery .
negative	i arrived at home just after 00 . 00 .
negative	as soon as i got home i got a call from my partner saying that the delivery man had been and gone .
negative	it had come to our attention that the delivery man had tried to drop_off our item outside the agreed time forcing us to arrange a new delivery date a week_later !
negative	this is extremely frustrating as i had to take the entire afternoon of work for someone_else ' s incompetence .
negative	we decided to cancel the product and ask for our refund which was over £_000 .
negative	they said we would be refunded within 0 - 0 working_days , but after a week of nothing , we decided to call again .
negative	apparently the refund request hadn ' t gone_through , so we had to request it again , waiting another 0 days until we got our money back .
negative	firstly , my home hub kept dropping connection , so i had to call to get a replacement .
negative	you ' d think this would be a straight_forward task , but after much deliberation with customer_services , they finally gave in and accepted that it was indeed a fault with the home home a week_later .
negative	i got a new one , but then my bt vision stopped_working .
negative	again i had to jump_through hoops to get this resolved ... but it never did .
negative	to add_insult to injury , i moved_into a new home with my partner who is also a bt customer .
negative	you ' d think it would be easy to merge our accounts .
negative	nope .
negative	they charged me £_000_+ to cancel .
negative	thanks bt .
negative	but wait , there ' s more .
negative	when i did move in with my partner , we wanted to get set_up with our existing services for our new home .
negative	this was the final_straw .
negative	after agreeing to an installation date , bt phoned us and cancelled , rearranging a date for a week_later !
negative	they also charged us £_00 for a month without any service which we tried to get refunded .
negative	after calling customer_services and being on hold for a total of 0 hours , i finally got through to the right people and by this stage i was happy to cancel our account all together .
negative	it ' s an_absolute_joke and should be criminal .
negative	goodbye bt .
negative	hello sky .
negative	i and my boss ordered two mobile_phones , my boss ' order went through ok whereas mine was blocked .
negative	i called them to resolve this , but despite the website advertising delivery within 00_hours , after 00_hours neither order had been processed .
negative	my boss ' phone eventually arrived this morning , opened and used .
negative	i have immediately submitted a returns request and have cancelled my order .
negative	they may have the best prices , but it ' s balanced by dreadful and dishonest service .
negative	if you are thinking about buying anything from this company .... forget it terrible company sent me a faulty pair of headphones tried to contact them several_times .... no one ever picks_up the phone .... i did get a reply email but nothing was done about it .... i has been 0 weeks and several_attempts to get a replacement or refund with no joy .
negative	still_waiting for a solution from them !
negative	marcos
negative	i set_up a vps with heart and in the same day discovered that the server backup costs were way more_than i had imagined .
negative	i had moved from rackspace to save money and now discovered it would be costing more , fair_enough its my mistake .
negative	i spoke to heart and they were happy to cancel the account which was great , unfortunately they refused to refund any money .
negative	the account had been open less_than a day and i had paid for a full year - so it cost me over £_000 for less_than a day ' s hosting .
negative	i would have been happy to pay for the days service i used or even a month , but the stance the took of charging for a full year really surprised me .
negative	companies with that kind of money grabbing attitude do nothing to help their reputations and i will happily be staying with rackspace .
negative	it ' s been 0 days since i ordered now and i ' ve gotten in touch and had no reply from " customer_services " i wish i used a big well_known website and i will never make this mistake again !
negative	i have just recieved my valentines_day flowers which my boyfriend bought from them to be sent to me at work today ( valentines_day ) and i just needed to express how disgusted i am .
negative	the flowers were delivered in a damaged box and when i opened them i was so dissapointed .
negative	these flowers were dispatched on monday 00th_feb - are you suprised they are dead ?
negative	there were not in water and had come loose in the box so are not looking their best .
negative	the mojority of them are dry , black and curling !
negative	they are so squashed and look like a 0 year_old hand tied them .
negative	i had to call my boyfriend and thank him , however he knew something was wrong and is equally as angry that he purchased from yourselves .
negative	i understand they are an internet company with lots of orders but there will be so many unhappy ladies today if their flowers were sent out monday and arrived in this state aswell !
negative	i am furious !
negative	hope to be getting a refund !
negative	if you cant handle the busy day orders then dont take any more !
negative	dead flowers are no use to anyone !
negative	i wont even be able to enjoy them for one day .
negative	these_guys are scam_artists !
negative	thought their prices were too good to be true but thought i ' d give them a go , what an_idiot i was !!!
negative	good never turned_up , now having to go through crazy chargeback process , which is taking for ever to get back .
negative	made a booking , ordered 0 coaches for my brothers wedding day and paid on that basis .
negative	on the day of the booking they sent 0 double decker and simply fobbed us off with some rubbish about the other bus breaking down and having tried to contact us .
negative	this was unacceptable to us due to certain cultural issues ( women and men should travel on separate coaches as the men tend to be drunk on the way back from the wedding reception ).
negative	now they refuse to refund us on the basis that only 0 coach turned_up and worse they keep changing their story as to why they feel they are not at fault .
negative	i ' m now taking this up with my solicitor as well as the confederation of passenger transport uk .
negative	you ( the public ) have been warned !!
negative	!
negative	as with many of the people below i ordered a bean_bag via groupon on 0th_november for a christmas_present and it ' s not arrived and i cannot get a response via_email or telephone - i ' ve tried several numbers .
negative	i ' ve now written to bbc_watchdog and copied them this thread as well as writing to groupon about it .
negative	will let you know what happens .
negative	bought a coat and the wrong_size came .
negative	tried several_times to call but no one ever picked_up .
negative	sent numerous_emails and query forms to which i had a ' thank_you for your query ' reply but never received anything_else despite them saying they answer all emails within 0 working_days ???
negative	total_waste of time !!!
negative	!
negative	lucky for me i paid on my credit_card so i am covered and they wont be keeping my money !!
negative	!
negative	i e_- mailed wowcher on their enquiries e_- mail address regarding a special offer they advertised on september 0th , asking if the deal was suitable for a person in a wheelchair .
negative	to this day , i still_haven ' t heard from them and the deal is long gone .
negative	looking at previous reviews , it seems that the only way to get a response from wowcher is to leave poor feedback on a public forum , so here goes .
negative	the lack of respect in answering potential customer ' s queries is , quite_frankly , disgusting and , as such , i won ' t be using them in the future , however good the deals are .
negative	very misleading and terms of contract are shocking .
negative	do not take out a product or service with this company .
negative	i have since cancelled my policy
negative	i placed an order over the weekend for valentines_day with " courier track and trace " delivery .
negative	the order was accepted and i received a confirmation e_- mail but when i view my account the order has disappeared and i have not received any tracking_number at all ( you would have thought this was essential right ?).
negative	the item has sold out also so i ' m increasingly worried that they couldn ' t fulfil all orders and just cancelled them .. live_chat was offline and they ' ve not responded to my e_- mails .
negative	ringing up the bank first thing and disputing .
negative	horrendous experience !!
negative	ordered my brother ' s xmas_present in nov , which the website advised was out of stock , but would be available in jan ..( as he already knew what he was getting he said was happy to wait ).
negative	when checking my bank_statement in mid dec though i noticed a refund from very , rang them & they confirmed they had cancelled the order as they were not in fact getting the item in ( but didn ' t have the courtesy to actually inform me of this in the 0wks since ).. then it turned_out they hadn ' t refunded the shipping ... so i spent probably the cost of this on phonecalls ( was cut_off twice while ' on hold ' after battling through the lengthy & inaccurate voice recognition menu system ).
negative	it took 0 attempts for what passes as ' customer_service ' to find my account , then 00_minutes on hold while they talked to a supervisor , before saying they couldn ' t refund my card , but would have to send out a cheque for £ 0 . 00 ... gaaaaaaaaaaaaah .
negative	shop with very at your peril - only if you have the patience of a saint & don ' t care about shocking service ....
negative	i had used mandmdirect a couple of times in the past but i happened to check my bank_account over christmas and they had taken money from my bank_account .
negative	i hadn ' t ordered anything in months .
negative	i contacted them and they refunded it but said they couldn ' t give an explanation - just not a good enough response for such a breech of trust !
negative	disgusting service , 00 days_later item is not delivered and wont give a refund because " i still used the service "
negative	obviously mistakes_happen in parcel delivery - but it truly shows what a company is like by how the deal with the mistake .
negative	either my hermes is really bad - or quite simply their customer advisors need some good training .
negative	after ordering a pair of expensive headphone from them , less_than 00_minutes later i realised they were the wrong ones , despite the description saying differently .
negative	because of this i requested a cancellation which could not be processed 00_minutes after i ordered .
negative	due to this i had to wait for the product to arrive from france , only to refuse it and send it back - a waste of everyones time .
negative	in the middle of all this , i was trying to tell them that this product wasn ' t described properly and that they should change it .
negative	each reply was a half - assed attempt and each time they told me i was wrong and that it was correctly listed .
negative	after 0 or 0 e_- mails they eventually accepted that the description was wrong and gave me a poor_excuse for an_apology .
negative	to this day , the headphone are still listed incorrectly .
negative	do not buy from pixmania .
negative	ever >
negative	they stole our money .
negative	we turned_up for our hen_do cocktail_making sessions at sway bar and were told release_travel hadn ' t paid for the session or dinner and that it would cost 000_pounds .
negative	we paid release months before .
negative	of course there was no one answering release_travel " we ' ll be there should have any_problems " emergancy phone line .
negative	the hen was distraught .
negative	have since looked up their credit history they have four ccjs out againest them , and even then they haven ' t paid up .
negative	they lied to the hen all the previous week saying everything was all good and ready .
negative	getting the money back is like getting blood out of a stone .
negative	we got ours back by going down and visiting them in person , when they said the cheque would be ready .
negative	which they had said about 00 times before .
negative	i ordered two pillows on 00 - jan - 0000 .
negative	they said that they need 0 days to deliver them .
negative	today is 00 - jan - 0000 and i didn ' t hear from them .
negative	i called them 0 times and every time they told next week .
negative	currently , nobody answers the phone !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a chair on friday 00 - jan - 0000 .
negative	they called me next_day to inform me that the product is out of stock and that they will receive new stock on monday .
negative	the customer_service agent assured me that i will receive it on tuesday .
negative	i called them on tuesday and they told me that they did not receive new stock yet so i have to wait_until the end of the week or until monday , so apparently they don ' t know when .
negative	this company is out of credibility .
negative	this is not how a respectful companies do business .
negative	p . s : i posted this review on their website but unsurprisingly they did not post it and make it visible to other customers .
negative	they only post 0_stars reviews and this supports the incredibility claim .
negative	i have had issues with dpd before where they have delivered to the wrong_address and just left the package on the doorstep .
negative	i gave them the benefit of the doubt as there are 0 properties with the same house number .
negative	however , on my most_recent delivery , i was very clear about the location .
negative	they still attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
negative	when i tried to call to resolve this , there seemed to be no way to speak to a human .
negative	i used the website to just arrange collection rather_than have another failed delivery .
negative	when i went to the local_depot , there was a small door resembling a fire exit for collections ( at_least the entrance for the staff looked nice !).
negative	i pressed the buzzer no less_than three times with no answer .
negative	eventually , after_speaking to someone at the staff entrance , they finally let me in .
negative	all in all , i think it ' s a terrible service .
negative	bad customer_services , useless don ' t know what each other are doing !
negative	been sent goods that were obviously ' seconds '
negative	account often wrong and still now having problems with them trying to charge me money i don ' t owe !!!
negative	all in all avoid very !
negative	awful tried to charge me over £_00 for ' not paying on time ' when i had infact paid over a week early .
negative	awful customer_service , rude and arrogant .
negative	goods terrible quality please avoid .
negative	false economy using studio !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered an ipod fm transmitter on 00th_july_0000 .
negative	after no sight nor sound for a week i emailed them and got the typical automated_response .
negative	i emailed again , same response .
negative	i read the reviews and decided i was going to lose out one way or another so i bombarded them with an_email every three hours or so in large text and started then on the complaints @ datakits . co . uk .
negative	they have not replied but my item has now been dispatched ... despite telling them i want a refund .
negative	lets_see what turns up first ... my item or those flying pigs i ordered off amazon where i should have gone in the first place .
negative	the results i got was only basic tense and punctuation corrections .
negative	in addition , i asked my girlfriend to check the proofread document and she was able still to identify grammar errors .
negative	i think the results of the service are no better_than the ms word spell checker .
negative	i am also a bit_sceptical how the company has such a high average in feedback .
negative	where do i begin ?
negative	always check your receipts !
negative	on one of these shops , 0 / 0 of the products i ordered were unavailable , on other shops huge amounts were unavailable .
negative	regular promotion mistakes - always in tesco ' s favour , never customers .
negative	overcharged something , 00_% of the time , i ' d say .
negative	deliveries made outside of a 0 hour time_slot 0 out of 0 times .
negative	one of these being over an_hour later than the end time of the slot with no call or notification .
negative	cheated on promotional points
negative	0 / 0 shops was short changed on points
negative	promotion invalidated because tesco couldn ' t deliver goods advertised ( 0 weeks in a row )
negative	check your reciepts with care !!
negative	!
negative	flight times changed , not informed missed flight , whole holiday ruined .
negative	no response to complaint email even after there stated 00 day responce time .
negative	no contact telephone_number for customer_services listed and when you do call asking for legal department , management or cheif executives office you get nothing only someone will be in touch and a point_blank refusal to help !
negative	book with someone_else evasive nasty and slippery i won ' t be back not to be trusted !
negative	been plagued by text_messages confirming delivery slot and date on 0 seperate deliverys .
negative	once item was late and missed time_slot by 0 hours and on 0 occasions arrived the day after stated delivery date !
negative	ii ' d give them a miss !
negative	the company is awful , good luck to anyone returning faulty_goods because the return_policy is not worth the paper its written on .
negative	i will not touch them with barge poll after my experience .
negative	better off spending money elsewhere with a more reputable company that offers a decent returns / exchanges and doesn ' t charge you a fortune .
negative	they are not competitive with some smaller products being up to 0 x the price of other_retailers like ebuyer or scan .
negative	the community forums are just full of very rude and patronising , egotistical , arrogant ( insert explicit word ) people .
negative	i was a member there before all my troubles started i am now leaving this place well alone .
negative	i ordered a microwave one saturday and it was delivered the next_day , which was fantastic .
negative	unfortunately it did not work .
negative	i phoned and emailed many_times .
negative	the unit was eventually collected 00 days after delivery and the refund was done 00 days after delivery .
negative	i think that ' s appauling customer_service .
negative	ethan in particular needs re - educating in customer_service .
negative	i recently_bought 0 season of friends and 0 season of lost on dvd from here - never again .
negative	in each boxset , there was one disc which was for a different season of the same show .
negative	one of my series 0 friends discs was actually for season 0 .
negative	0 times is not a coincidence - it makes me think that it is done on purpose .
negative	i would rather pay an extra few pounds from a different shop , because at_least the discs will be correct .
negative	dear_sir / madam ,
negative	my order had been confirmed and money taken out of my account in full . i was due my order between 0 - 0 pm on the 0th_may .
negative	by 0 . 00 i phoned customer_services to be told she would ring the driver ( whils i was on hold ) to which there was no answer from driver .
negative	she informed me she would keep trying the driver and get back too me ( which i heard_nothing back .!
negative	) as it got to 0pm i was worried , our shopping was not going to arrive . we are on benefits , and therfore have no spare money what so ever .
negative	i had no food it except bread and so had to sent my daughters 0 and 00 too bed with 0 slices of toast , in which i felt awful ( that was there tea ) . this was so upsetting , not having food which you have rightly paid for .
negative	its now 0pm so i ring back . com , to be told the driver had now gone home ( i was told it was stange as there was no accident or breakdown recorded ) which would have been easier to accept then just not bothering . he then apparently arrived back in store a little later with our shopping .
negative	i then asked to speak to a manager at which i was told he would give £_00 worth of e_- vouchers to take off this order we were due , as he had put the order through once again of his system between 0 - 00am the following_morning .
negative	i was told to go back through my orders on . com and to apply my e_- vouchers so the balance outstanding would therefore be £_00 . 00 .
negative	this i then did to no_avail as my bank_account was now empty as tesco . com had taken the money allready so thefore could not confirm order to reduce balance . as i stated i had no spare money !. i then phoned . com back ( which is also costing me .)
negative	to be told that because my account was now empty this wouldnt be possible .
negative	so now i am back too square0 .
negative	as i will never shop with . com again after this disaster , i did not want the e_- vouchers taking off my next shop , i wanted the money off the shop that was due !
negative	i was told the driver had said he knocked at our door and there was no answer , which is a lie as we firstly have a camera too prove he never came to the door and so do our neighbours .
negative	( which is 000_% proof this member off staff is a liar ) my daughter husband and mother was in the house all day with myself .
negative	we aggreed with sarah ( manager ) to go into store in blackpool as this is where our shopping is , to collect , and speak too mike norbury ( manager ). so i had too put my mother out to take us all the way down ther too sort it ( also costing in petrol !)
negative	we arrived at the store at 00pm , after taking daughter too doctors .
negative	we asked for mike norbury too which he came too see us .
negative	i had too explain the whole situation once again to mr mike norbury . he kept telling us to just take our shopping and use the e_- vouchers off our next shop as there was nothing else he could do .
negative	i had already told him we will never shop with them again so to refund me the money into bank , too which he said he couldnt do from store ?
negative	i said as a good will gesture we should be given the shopping for nothing as all the hassle k , kids going without tea , petrol money , phone call and the sheer stress off the stress and frustration in which he smirked !!
negative	he said he made a phone call too head_office and has refunded the shopping too our bank accound this he did by store after telling us this was not something he could do .
negative	this i was told will take 0 - 0 days too show in bank .
negative	( i just hope it arrives )...
negative	this was then fine i said and made my way to husband where he and a member off teso staff were putting in the back of my mums car .
negative	my husband then went too find my mum instore as she had got bored off sitting in car , as it was all taking ages ..
negative	he came_across mr mike norbury talking with another member off staff clearly slagging us off for having our shopping for nothing .
negative	he was going too approach mr mike norbury in store , but i adviced too come away and complain to head_office .
negative	i then got home to unpack my shopping to be disapointed once again these are the reasons_why ?.
negative	0 . coleslaw all over one of the bags ,
negative	0 .
negative	0 lettuces with yesterdays date on them , ( the date we orriginally ordered )
negative	0 . missing cheese ,
negative	0 . squashed bread ,
negative	0 . steak that had so much fat through it i feel it was only fit for my dog ,
negative	i am greatly disapointed and un neverd as to how this is possible from a massive store as yorselves .
negative	i want this sorting asap ...
negative	mr and mrs preston
negative	it took me ages to try to get the lense in my eye properly because it was so flimsy .
negative	it ended_up tearing rendering the lense useless .
negative	disgusted by the product .
negative	i recently opened an account with next and was really disappointed .
negative	i ordered some cultery £_00 + ( inc delivery ) and they looked like i got the from poundland .
negative	the cheeeeeeapest plastic decor you could imagine on cheap plastic handles .
negative	i had to send them back asap and of course i had to pay for the return as well .
negative	now the only thing that i ' ll order from them is flowers !!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered a camcorder and a freeview box online , then had a littlewoods rep trying to convince me that i could pay next year for item .
negative	i explained that i hadn ' t recieved the item yet and then the rep tells_me that not only did i get the camcorder 0 weeks_ago i signed for it !!!!
negative	as advised i checked the garden shed whilst on the phone and found it soaking_wet ( was suppose to be signature needed and no card was left at my door ).
negative	i have since returned it as not confident that it would be working properly in the near_future and i had missed the event it was ordered for .
negative	( when i asked the rep about the freeview box she said it was out of stock ).
negative	i am far from happy with littlewoods way of handling this fraudulet event .
negative	i have complained twice and i recieved an_email telling_me that the complaint has been sent to the courier company but still i ' ve heard_nothing .
negative	how am i suppose to be confident purchasing items from littlewoods when they show such little care for the fraud committed and the faith of their loyal_customers .
negative	shocking !!!!!
negative	!
negative	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
negative	then to add more embarrassment the roses were past the fully opened stage .
negative	i ' ve never been so publicly embarrassed in all my life .
negative	also no telephone service so you can not call them , i sent a complaint via_email and received template email with a promise to contact me asap .
negative	but i ' ve heard_nothing .
negative	don ' t use this company they have no care nor respect for their customers .
negative	**_update **
negative	0th_february_0000
negative	so iflorist said they would send my sister some flowers and guess_what ?
negative	it didn ' t happen !!!
negative	this company is ridiculously unprofessional .
negative	i emailed iflorist reminding them that the flowers had to be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
negative	the reply stated that the driver would be contacted and then i ' d be emailed back .
negative	this did not happen either .
negative	the service is shockingly disgusting .
negative	i just want my money back and i have insisted on this from iflorist .
negative	let ' s see how long it is to take for this refund .
negative	once again in case you have forgotten my advice in the first complaint : do not use this company !!
negative	!
negative	have never been spoken so rude on the phone in my entire life by a customer_service adviser as the ryan_air staff !!!
negative	no manners !
negative	! charge you for everything on their rubbish website and do not treat their customers with any respect .
negative	awful !!!
negative	!
negative	i was very disappointed with rentalcars .
negative	they are only after your money , don ' t care about the clients .
negative	any problem you have they don ' t try to sort it .
negative	i paid for a car that i never used .
negative	when i rang and ask for a refund they said its not possible and that ' s it .
negative	dont rent with rentalcars !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	this company is horrific .
negative	the staff are horrible and don ' t give a damn about you .
negative	i have bought there frequently over the few_years but recently due to new staff i will not be returning .
negative	the staff are unhelpful , lazy , you ask them a question they sigh .
negative	you ring them up to ask about an order they sigh down the phone and act like they don ' t care .
negative	the pricing / website is also a joke .
negative	i went into the store two days ago and spoke to a staff_member , we ordered myself a motherboard which is stated on the website as well as the manufacturing code - asus m0a00l - m lx v0 .
negative	when he printed out the collection receipt it said asus m0a00l - m lx which is obviously incorrect .
negative	( the v0 / revision 0 supports my 000w cpu unlike the original only supporting 00w ).
negative	i then asked him to change it and make_sure i get the v0 version .
negative	he said okay , reprinted , we left .
negative	when i arrived to pick it up the next_day guess_what i received ?
negative	asus m0a00l - m lx .
negative	so i complained to him about receiving the wrong one , and guess_what he says to me ?
negative	' no this is the right one , it is the v0 version .
negative	you need to research your stuff before you buy it '.
negative	my god .
negative	i got so angry .
negative	the fact that he said a customer is wrong is just plain stupid .
negative	it clearly_states on their website , their manufacturing code and their own staff that i ordered a v0 .
negative	so i just couldn ' t be bothered , got a full_refund and bought it off amazon .
negative	the funny thing is the original price i bought it for was £_00 right , i checked before i drove to the store , as i left the store i checked again to compare it ' s price to the one off amazon .
negative	guess how much it is now ?
negative	£_00 .
negative	they upped the price just as i left the store .
negative	maybe this isn ' t a big deal to people but my advice is to stay_away from them .
negative	they are conniving , horrible people .
negative	i would happily pay £_00 + elsewhere for the same item .
negative	cclonline will be informed about this review haha .
negative	this is for the staff - i work security at hotels / bars etc .
negative	i carry around a pin camera on my jacket button incase there is any trouble .
negative	everything i have said in this review about the sighing and lazyness is all on tape .
negative	obviously the phone one is only a voice recording but have fun guys .
negative	i will be returning on the 00th which is my day off to complain to your manager and if he is unwilling to do something about this i will happily contact the corporate line to complain with proof .
negative	have a nice day .
negative	i ordered my bath 0 weeks_ago , 0 bath was delivered into the local_store and they found it was faulty , the 0nd bath was delivered to my house 0 weeks_later and was damaged .
negative	my tub have been good at communicating but not with offering any confirmation as to when the new bath will be delivered .
negative	instead i was asked what i expected from buying such a cheap bath !
negative	i eventually rang the director steve marshall and he was very rude .
negative	he said it was common practice to have these problems in his industry and that he could not guarantee a delivery time because the drive might have a heartache or crash so he would never give a gaurantee .
negative	i would strongly_suggest you ignore the cheap prices and pay £_00 more fomr a reputable company .
negative	update_: to clarify following laurie ' s comments i have not yet had a refund as he stated .
negative	however they have not collected the goods yet ... not sure why he would say they have refunded me yet ...
negative	i ordered a motherboard from them was damaged on arrival , requested rma they refused to fix it as it was after 00_hours ( i was away from home ) and to this day 0 weeks_later they still have my motherboard and refuse to answer any emails for me to request it back .
negative	will not use again !
negative	my iphone was coming with yodel .
negative	i stayed in all day waiting and when tracked online that night they stated they had been to deliver at 0pm and nobody answered so they left a card .
negative	i had no card and also have cctv on our apartments .... yet no one except for the postman that morning had attempted delivery .
negative	rang customer_service and they rearranged delivery for the saturday_morning ... still no delivery .
negative	upon calling customer_services couldn ' t get through .
negative	finally got through monday_morning and kept getting passed through departments and drivers .
negative	got home from work on tuesday and the package had been dropped that morning with a neighbour - hardly safe for an iphone when they don ' t know if we get on with our neighbours ...
negative	worst delivery experience i ' ve ever had !!
negative	!
negative	my declared dimensions were correct for the entire package .
negative	i can prove that my dimensions were correct for this shipment .
negative	as i said in my last e mail to your customer_services i have photographic_evidence .
negative	where is yours ?
negative	ordered something for christmas .
negative	haven ' t seen any updates to tracking whatsoever , but they claim it will be delivered for the 00th .
negative	tried to contact them about it , receiving no response other than automated_messages .
negative	left a message on their fb_page , they said to send them a private message , which i did , and then received no response .
negative	seems like they just took my money and have no_intention of shipping anything .
negative	good thing i ordered with paypal .
negative	will never be shopping here again , and warning all my friends against them .
negative	my boyfriend ordered flowers on the 00th to arrive on the 00th_february as a surprise for me and considering the fact the office is normally open from 0 . 00am to 0 . 00pm , you would think the flowers would be delivered within that time .
negative	in fact the flowers didn ' t arrive by the time i left at 0 . 00pm resulting in my boyfriend having to leave work early , rush to the shops to spend another £_00 on roses , chocolates and a vase so i wouldn ' t be left without anything .
negative	the flowers turned_up at the office at 0pm and it was only by pure luck someone was still in my office to sign for them , but considering i ' m on holiday now till the 00th of february (!!!!
negative	), i find it astonishing that my boyfriend was told all he would get refunded was the delivery charge of about £ 0 . 00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	yes , someone in the office signed for them , but it was delivered after i left and the colleague , who signed for the order , didn ' t know i ' m on holiday with the 00th_february otherwise she would have straight_away rejected the order .
negative	you would think it ' s not unreasonable to deliver flowers to an office address within normal working hours , not after 0 . 00pm .
negative	my poor boyfriend spent considerable time and money yesterday not being_able to get through to iflorist and eventually spending more money buying me new flowers .
negative	i won ' t be able to enjoy these flowers as they will be dead by the time i return to the office and to top everything off , my colleague ( who i asked to open the box this morning ) has emailed me to tell me the flowers are of poor quality and already started to wilt !
negative	my boyfriend was told that as the delivery arrived on the day requested , he would only get a refund of the delivery charge ( i don ' t agree with iflorist that delivery at 0pm to an office address when the office normally shuts at 0 . 00pm counts at successful delivery as it was rather luck that anyone was still in the office , never mind i , the recipient , didn ' t even get the iflorist flowers and won ' t get to enjoy them till the 00th of february when they are completely dead ).
negative	my boyfriend spent about 00 £ on the iflorist delivery , which i can ' t enjoy and went all the way out to spent more money to ensure i wouldn ' t be left completely disapppointed on our first valentine ' s day together .
negative	to only refund the delivery charge in light of what happened is despicable .
negative	i would strongly_advise people not to order from this company !
negative	my boyfriend deserves more_than the refund of £ 0 . 00 for the inconvenience , quality of the roses and service provided .
negative	please arrange for adequate compensation .
negative	been in all day .
negative	saying my item was delivered at 00 : 00 .
negative	it wasn ' t and still_hasn ' t been .
negative	don ' t use yodel if you live in exeter
negative	never bother using them .
negative	the slightest mistake cannot be rectified without costing you more_than half what you paid .
negative	do anything_else but use this pathetic_excuse for a company .
negative	the staff were polite , but the best staff in the world can ' t save you from being chewed up and spat out by horrible business_practices .
negative	0 star is too nice !
negative	needs no star
negative	we booked a flight for the 00th of february , however the confirmation that came through was the 00th !
negative	when i called to speak to them , they advised me that it is impossible to change dates as computer confirms automatically !
negative	i called back and another person said they will raise it with another team as they can see there seems to be an issue !
negative	i called again and they said nothing can be done unless i pay £_00 to make changes !!!!
negative	any way long_story short , from what was supposed to save me money has become really expensive so we are now not going and ruined our valentine weekend !
negative	thanks bravofly !!
negative	useless !
negative	do not use !!!!!
negative	should be shut_down !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	well what can be said about alpharooms …..
negative	fairly cheap ?
negative	well yes .
negative	but at the same time uncommunicable could also be said and '; you get what you pay for '.
negative	mainly just one thing should be said in particular do not under any circumstance book with them !
negative	i have never ever_dealt_with a more unprofessional company … don ' t ruin your holiday for the sake of a few pounds off .
negative	it ' s honestly not worth it .
negative	i made that mistake … twice .
negative	neively originally booking a cheap trip to ibiza in 0000 where alpharooms placed us in a room with two single beds ( after requesting a double ).
negative	on our return i complained and received a 00_%_discount .
negative	so seeing an opportunity for a cheaper trip i decided to use it on a trip to new_york with a transfer at reykjavic from london .
negative	big_mistake .
negative	not only did it take more_than several phone_calls and emails to alpharooms to actually establish our travelling vouchers and baggage_allowance ( we were told two bags for the hold and then just one , then two again ..) encountering a range of ' customer sales representatives ( 0 out of 0 were english ), the rest were foreign who could barely understand , nor speak_english fluently themselves ( great idea for customer_service placements ).
negative	but when we finally arrived at the airport we were told curtly by the iceland air representative that the sales_person i ' d spoken to at alpharooms who ' d wished me and my girlfriend ' a happy holiday together ' had booked us several rows apart on all our flights !
negative	he politely did his best to rectify this and booked us together on our main flight at the back of the plane to new_york from iceland - but for our 0 hour flight to iceland from london we were sat over 0 rows away .
negative	my girlfriend was hugely distressed , especially as it was her_birthday too .
negative	it was simply awful .
negative	on our arrival in america i emailed and complained to alpharooms .
negative	i received a curt reply saying they had ensured we were now seating with each other again on the journey back ( so admitting they had booked us apart ) but even more amazingly then then blamed me saying it was something they couldn ' t guarantee and that it wasn ' t their fault !
negative	simply unbelievable
negative	needless to say i came back and emailed them .
negative	its taken a further 0 emails to finally get to a senior customer sales representative .
negative	they ' ve all rudely passed responsibility away from themselves .
negative	so i ' m not seeking_legal_action_against them .
negative	what kind of travel company decides to book a party of two several rows apart on a flight , after you ' ve stated you ' re travelling together .….
negative	clearly not a proper one .
negative	but operates by filling planes like buses with no thoughts to the customer .
negative	please_please_please i implore you … give these_guys a wide berth and go with well_known booking agents such as expedia , thomas_cook , trivago … anyone would be an improvement !
negative	they ended_up pretty_much ruining two holidays , don ' t make the same mistake we did !
negative	_______________________________________________________________
negative	my reply > to alpharooms reply below
negative	as you ' ll see alpharooms has since responded to this email in much the templated way that they contacted me when i raised these issues with them .
negative	they ' ve done this on several review sites .
negative	so for fear of any mistruths i ' ll simply state my reply here
negative	___________________________________________________________
negative	the simple matter of the fact is alpharooms , i did state we were travelling together , several_times .
negative	so the fact you have the audacity to blame me for not specifying this ( when i did and your staff_member said ' oh that sounds nice ' before seeing fit to sit us several rows apart ) is sheer madness .
negative	as i ' ve already stated i ' ve started legal support for this matter and i will be getting my money back .
negative	along the way also ensuring that any other potential_customers don ' t have to suffer in the way that i did with such a company as yours .
negative	they dont even deserve one star !!
negative	this company are ripping people off !
negative	they have done this to many people judging_by the reviews .
negative	sadly , i did not read these before i sent my perfectly good iphone .
negative	they quoted me £_00 and offered me £_00 !
negative	they then sent me an_email knowing i was displeased with this and so offered me £_00 .
negative	frustratingly , they have credited my bank_account with £_00 !!!!!
negative	i asked for the phone back many_times but they are charging me ten_pounds .
negative	i am_currently in a dispute with them and am seeking further advice as they are clearly a bad company out to commit daylight_robbery !
negative	avoid at all costs !!!!!
negative	!
negative	con no : zdbysw000000
negative	i ordered a large_amount of furniture from home discount website .
negative	i received an_email from them on the 00st oct just at 00 : 00 saying they ' ve dispatched my goods , but it didn ' t mention which courier .
negative	on the 00nd , i contact home discount at 00 : 00 to try and find out the courier and they came back quickly saying it was xdp and gave me a consignment_number which i looked up .
negative	on the tracking_information , it said : 00 oct 0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 00 :_00am to 0 :_00pm .
negative	so i had to rush home from work , taking a taxi to get back in time , which cost me £ 0 and greatly irritating my boss .
negative	getting home at 00 : 00 , i breathe a sigh of relief as the tracking_info stays the same , there ' s no card , so i sit_down to wait .
negative	this was bad service because the company had not bothered to contact me to let me know they were even delivering on this day .
negative	so i sit .
negative	and i wait .
negative	00 : 00 goes by .
negative	0 : 00 goes by - i am ringing to find out the problem but the phone is engaged .
negative	engaged .
negative	how on earth is not a proper phone system to taken calls ?
negative	i am literally just ringing a landline .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	the girlfriend gets back at 0 : 00 so i taxi back to work for the afternoon ( another £ 0 ).
negative	i continue calling and finally get someone at around 00 : 00 .
negative	he tells_me that ' there has been ' an incident ' in portsmouth ', so the van driver has decided to do his round backwards and to disregard the eta information .
negative	that the delivery will be delivered by 0pm without_fail .
negative	so from 0 : 00 onwards , with no delivery , i am watching that tracking_information like a hawk .
negative	refreshing the window every 0 seconds .
negative	at 0 : 00 , up comes the status 00 oct 0000 00 :_00pm all barcodes 000 exception carded .
negative	i am running down the single flight of stairs to the front_door of my block of flats so fast it freaks my girlfriend out .
negative	there is no card .
negative	there is no delivery van .
negative	there cannot be a card put through my door because there is no letterbox .
negative	the delivery van has not visited my road because it is a no - through road which takes about 0 minutes of cautious reversing to get a taxi out , nevermind a delivery van .
negative	so i ring the depot , there ' s no answer .
negative	i leave a message explaining the issue .
negative	it ' s strongly worded but no shouting or swearing asking for someone to call me back .
negative	it ' s now 0 :_00am on the 00rd oct and no - one has bothered to call me .
negative	so yesterday , i was not contacted to be advised a delivery was taking place , the driver apparently decided to change his route and therefore failed to deliver it , and subsequently recorded a false entry in the database .
negative	i am £_00 down , my boss is annoyed at me , my girlfriend has had to wait in all afternoon yesterday and again all day today , and i have not had a single communication from this company .
negative	terrible , terrible service .
negative	by contrast , dpd have been keeping me appraised of another delivery of audio_equipment i ordered through amazon , just like they always do , and should be arriving today between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , and i am sure they will - they usually call me 00_minutes before they are popping round .
negative	currently , my consignment has this status 00 oct 0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 0 :_00pm to 0 :_00pm .
negative	i have absolutely no confidence this will arrive and my girlfriend has resigned herself to waiting in all day because we cannot trust this company .
negative	do not ever use this company .
negative	it is terrible .
negative	customer_service is as bad as none existant , i paid an extra £ 0 to get it delivered in 0 - 0 business days , it has been 00 days and still not come !
negative	brilliant !
negative	ordered headphones paid extra for next_day delivery three days on still_waiting .
negative	they now say they have took the money but wont despatch the item as there is a discrepancy with my address .
negative	what a load of rubbish .
negative	cant find a number to call them .
negative	so they have took my money but wont send goods .
negative	please dont order from this company
negative	i tried signing_up for talk_talk home phone and broadband and got booted off the line 0 times .
negative	i gave up .
negative	my nan was unfortunate enough to get through and sign_up and she ' s had problem after problem and also reports the customer_service is lousy .
negative	they may claim to be cheap but i would recommend anyone to ...
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	sound went on my htc_desire , called htc and they didn ' t want to know .
negative	i went and got an iphone 0 and now have the 0s and no issues .
negative	not impressed !
negative	being a perfectionist it took me long time to find the right pair of glasses and at first_glance i thought direct sight was a dream_come true .
negative	the price was reasonable , the ratings were high and they were my dream pair .
negative	i ordered them as soon as i could .
negative	yet some how the whole_thing turned into a nightmare .
negative	first they were a month had gone by still with no glasses , i ' d called them countless on times being given the same false hope of arrival every time .
negative	in addition my optician had told me that my eyes were deteriorating and that the longer i spent without them the worse they would get .
negative	when i asked for compensation they refused and wouldn ' t connect me to any sort of supervisor .
negative	i proceeded to wait patiently .
negative	the next week i rang up furiously , screaming down the phone asking " where are my glasses ", they cancelled my order without permission and that was the end
negative	they regularly don ' t turn_up for collections or delivery and claim some useless excuse like ' there was nowhere to park ' or ' there was no response '.
negative	they would have to actually attempt delivery in order to realise the fact that there is an almost permanently empty parking space on my drive and the road is wide enough with no markings to pull up for a prolonged period .
negative	on top of this , my workplace is on a business park with enough space to pull up , let_alone park , for an entire football team .
negative	they claim all_sorts of excuses but fail to realise that all the delivery locations i have specified have cctv so can easily prove that they are lying .
negative	it is only because of the suppliers that these issues have been sorted .
negative	how can a company with such a poor reputation from across the country detailed so much on the internet possibly receive business ?
negative	cost .
negative	pay peanuts ...
negative	i can however say one thing , they are consistent , but it is consistently useless .
negative	i ordered some ray - bans on the 00st of july_0000 with the promise of there 0 - 00 days delivery by the 00st of august i still had not received the glasses !
negative	i first contacted them around the 0th of august wanting answers as to when my glasses would be delivered i received no reassurance all i got was something completely_different that didn ' t answer any_questions !
negative	they couldn ' t even guarantee that my glasses would even turn_up !
negative	they should at_least state that all orders are drop shipped !
negative	so i promise you this smartbuy sunglasses ( not very smart at all ) you haven ' t heard the last of me !
negative	i will be taking this further !
negative	i have only recently received the refund which seemed doubtful at the time !
negative	so order from this company if you want to order from a company which is registered and hosted in australia , the stock comes from_hong_kong and they have a uk unit where the returns are sent to !
negative	who don ' t even have a contact number just a pre_- recorded_message which just irritates me even more !
negative	poor_excuse for a business !
negative	bad practice and even worse customer_service !
negative	i went and bought the sunglasses from a opticians that sell them !
negative	and i sugest others do the same for the sake of £_00 it isn ' t worth the risk !
negative	they are criminals , charging £_000 for cancelation .
negative	but that ' s nothing compared to customer_service i have received .
negative	not helpful and patronising .
negative	i have got agreement with manager to get the charge smaller , week_later nobody knows about the agreement ( apparently also person who introduced himself as manager was not a manager ).
negative	after loosing calm tone , reciving agreed lower cancellation charge was conditioned ( blackmailed ) only if i send written apology !!
negative	!
negative	joke , joke !
negative	!
negative	they have routinely left very expensive parcels on my door_step .
negative	have left parcels with neighbours but not put the correct information on the note , and on on occasions when a parcel was left apparently left on the door_step , but wasn ' t there when i got home , they had no record of who the parcel had been sent by on their system .
negative	if you are a retailer please have more respect for your customers than to use this service .
negative	we ordered tickets 0 months_ago for justin_bieber and the concert is tomorrow and we still don ' t have our tickets !
negative	we can ' t get inn touch with anyone and when we phoned fedex they said they don ' t have a package with our tickets to send out to us .
negative	worst of all these were tickets that ' had to be replaced with our original tickets which were fake .
negative	transaction_id_0000000
negative	if you want to buy a buggy that ' s not fit for purpose then be my guest my daughter is only 0 months and my buggy is currently back with them for the third time having collapsed with my daughter in it and i repeat for the third time !
negative	i love my quinny buzz well actually i used to love it now all i risk is harming my child every time i put her in it no refund offered no brand_new replacement only told there is nothing wrong with it .
negative	why i would send my buggy off three times for apparently nothing is beyond me !
negative	i ordered a bunch of 00 roses to be delivered on valentines_day for the missus .
negative	price was competitive not amazingly cheap , they arrived on time on valentines_day in a large box .
negative	the missus opened the box to find 00 roses , 0 of which were broken and one which didn ' t have a head and nor was the head in the box meaning that the rose must have been headless when they put them in there !
negative	i complained and was assured that this is not the usual quality of their products , they sent out a new set .
negative	when we received the new set we again only received 00 roses which all looked like the cheapest battered roses money could buy .
negative	another complaint and 0 weeks_later i am still_waiting for my money .
negative	my advice - don ' t use them at all costs more hassle than its worth , get friendly with a local_florist same - day delivery and two_weeks_later the flowers still look amazing all for only £ 0 dearer than iflorist !
negative	i ordered with this company for the first time and was told that my items would be received by 00 december at the latest .
negative	they never arrived and i contacted asos who intially did nothing .
negative	then i got an e_- mail saying my order had been returned to them and queried why i hadn ' t completed the returns slip !
negative	i was then told that my order would be cancelled and if i wanted the items i had to re - order them but they are now out of stock .
negative	i asked if they could send the item that they sent originally and was told they could not do that !
negative	the item was a christmas_present ( which i made them aware of ) and now i have to find an_alternative at the last_minute .
negative	the support and system is really crap , they limit legal businesses as well and should avoid at all costs
negative	i ordered a parcel and sighed when i got the email_saying it had been dispatched with yodel .... knowing full well how awful they are !
negative	this time i waiting in all day on the day the tracking_information said it was out for delivery - nothing .
negative	contacted the seller again this morning to complain ( as complaints to yodel are usually ignored / responded to with ' we don ' t know ) and i was assured that the parcel was out for delivery again today and that i would get it today .
negative	around lunchtime i rechecked the tracking_information .
negative	the parcel was apparently delivered to me last_night at 00pm ( even_though yodel only deliver until 0pm ) and i had apparently signed for it !
negative	even_though i was fast asleep in bed by this time .
negative	i can only assume that yodel forged my signature ( so they ' re fraudulent as well as unreliable ) and stole the parcel for themselves ....... absolutely_useless !
negative	i was given a hour hour delivery slot - great - i thought !
negative	half an_hour after that delivery slot ended i rechecked the tracking_information to find that they had apparently attempted delivery but no one was home !
negative	i had been home all day !
negative	after trawling_through their awful automated menus on the customer_service line , i finally found the local_depot number on a forum website ( it ' s not listed on dpd website ) and managed to speak to a human_being .
negative	the man at the depot contacted the driver who said he attempted delivery and was here for 00_minutes and left a calling_card - ( i have a locked mailbox and it wasnt there !)
negative	so i can only assume they just couldn ' t be bothered to deliver ..... i ' m wasting another day waiting in tomorrow for the ' redelivery ( i . e .
negative	first attempt in my view ) so we shall see ....
negative	it was all straightforward until they emailed me and said they ' d found a fault with my phone .
negative	it worked_perfectly well and i only wanted to sell it as i ' d upgraded and need some extra cash to put towards my holiday .
negative	i now don ' t have the box as i didn ' t need to send it with the phone .
negative	so i ' ll get less selling privately .
negative	not at all happy .
negative	will be using mazuma next time ...
negative	also received an_email after i ' d sent the phone saying they hadn ' t received it ( rude , give me a chance i work full time )
negative	not impressed !
negative	paid for an early morning delivery of an item .
negative	been sat in all day waiting and still no delivery at 0 . 00pm .
negative	i have been calling the company all day , and ran up a rather big mobile bill in the process as i was just left on hold , with no sign of anybody answering .
negative	i have emailed them several_times , and no response to the emails either .
negative	the website has a tracking facility which at present is telling_me that my item hasn ' t left the depot yet , but is also saying that my delivery was signed for at 0am this morning .
negative	the information supplied gives a surname of who signed for the parcel , but funnily_enough it is neither my surname , nor my partners , or actually any of my neighbours either .
negative	no card has been left to say it was signed for by somebody_else .
negative	my delivery actually required me personally to sign for my delivery , and to show my photo id too , now since i have both my passport and driving_license , obviously whoever " signed " for my parcel couldn ' t have showed my id .
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted by this company , and would seriously recommend that people steer_clear of them .
negative	if you order something online and know that this company will be the courier , i urge you do not place the order !
negative	!
negative	i am now out of pocket because of losing a days pay waiting around for them , i have run up a huge bill trying to get hold of them , and i ' ve lost the item i should have received .
negative	extremely angry , and looking to further my complaint about them .
negative	i sent my iphone_0s to them yesterday .
negative	i went on to my account today to find they ' d knocke the price down by £_000 because the phone " tested faulty ".
negative	there is a tiny cosmetic mark on the front and when i rang customer_services i was told that this classes the phone as faulty .
negative	the advisor told me that they sell the phone on so they can ' t accept cosmetic damages !
negative	i ' m absolutely_disgusted that because of a tiny little mark they won ' t pay the price that the phone is worth !
negative	the fact is , it costs £_00 to make the repair to fix the cosmetic_damage so they ' re expecting to make a huge profit out of taking_advantage of my " naivety ".
negative	well i ' m not giving them that satisfaction .
negative	i ' ve requested the phone back and i will sell it on myself for what the phone is actually worth .
negative	rip_off_merchants , avoid at all costs !!!!
negative	!
negative	bad communication
negative	slow delivery
negative	average value
negative	wish i could give a good rating but sadly , in this case , i can ' t .
negative	overall a very bad customer experience .
negative	been waiting for my delivery for over a week now .
neutral	thanks beautybay and sorry for the negative_feedback .
neutral	we ' ve ordered a lot of times through mine and my partners account .
neutral	on 0 separate_occasions the website fell over so despite trying for over 00_minutes each time we gave up and ordered from eat .
neutral	we ' ve also found they add a £ 0 delivery charge on some restaurants , but if you went on the restaurants own website and ordered through there delivery is free for the same order value .
neutral	will keep ordering but remain cautious !
neutral	good range of clothing , and an ok customer_service .
neutral	purchased an acoustic_guitar from dv000 an_hour before the next_day delviery deadline .
neutral	the guitar didnt arrive next_day .
neutral	when i called customer_services they explained that there had been a warehouse issue but it would be shipped and i would receive the following_day .
neutral	guitar arrived the following_day and is great , just wish they had let me know that it hadnt shipped originally so that i didnt sit around waiting for delivery !
neutral	the trophy was poorly made .
neutral	you can tell that they put hardly any effort into the work , for example , the box was completely ripped on the side .
neutral	the star piece on the trophy can be told that you simply just glued it on , this made it look like you didn ' t even make the glass part of the model .
neutral	when they actually glued on the star , it was badly glued because their was a lot of glue coming out of the side .
neutral	it seems really good on the website but in reality , it didn ' t really feel_like a trophy .
neutral	i done a hpi check on my car just incase there was any_issues with the car and to put my mind at ease before folking out £_00 , 000 .
neutral	yes it does the job yes the car was clear with nothing to report but at a cost of £_00 for nothing to report i think is expensive .
neutral	could at_least give you 00_% back if nothing to report on car .
neutral	i bought a washing_machine from appliances_online because john_lewis could not offer recycling and connection services on that particular model and this washer wasn ’ t available anywhere_else .
neutral	what a mistake that was .
neutral	the purchasing process went_smoothly and communication was great – they gave me a delivery date , called and emailed to remind me of it and on gave me a delivery slot on the day , which i thought all was very good .
neutral	up to the moment the delivery men have arrived .
neutral	the old appliance was fully disconnected as requested .
neutral	nothing was ever said about taking appliance out of the kitchen .
neutral	access to the property was easy .
neutral	the delivery people arrive and pretty_much immediately announce that they cannot take away the old appliances because there is not enough room to pull it out of the corner without moving the fridge .
neutral	i am no expert so i believed that and after a couple of minutes of hesitation and regret that i didn ’ t go for john_lewis accepted the new appliance and signed for it .
neutral	my husband arrived in the evening and pulled the old appliance from the corner on his own within two seconds .
neutral	he didn ’ t even apply much effort to do that !
neutral	and he is no body builder .
neutral	to make the matters worse i called the customer_services and asked for a recycling and connection charges refund and to my great annoyance the lady on the phone kept_repeating that what happened was the matter of me not looking into recycling terms and conditions properly .
neutral	i wish she didn ’ t repeat it so often because before this conversation i had no_intention of writing this review .
neutral	i had another look at my emails from the company and terms and conditions and found a warning about access to the property but nothing about awkward kitchen design or about the fact that delivery men were not expected to lift any appliance at any point .
neutral	i hope the machine works because i can imagine what a nightmare it is going to be trying to sort this out .
neutral	extra 00 pounds and you get a 0 year guarantee from john_lewis , this seems a much_better deal to me .
neutral	et utroligt højt kortgebyr ( mastercard ) på 00 kr !
neutral	som jeg_ikke føler at der bliver gjort ordenligt opmærksom på ( og selv fakturaen nævner det kun indirekte ved at lægge gebyret til buketprisen ... så ser det jo nok lidt mindre farligt ud ?).
neutral	desuden er hjemmesiden sådan indrettet at det_er_meget svært at hoppe frem og tilbage i bestillingsprocessen , så_jeg 0 . måtte starte forfra et_par gange ved fejlvalg 0 . på betalingsskærmen ikke kunne gå tilbage for at se hvorfor at prisen med_et var 00 kr højere end jeg_havde regnet med , og derfor blev nød til bare at betale for ikke at skulle starte helt forfra igen .
neutral	desuden er_der 00 prisintervaller fra 000 - 000_kr på div .
neutral	buketter .
neutral	på billedet ser man buketten til ca 000 - 000_kr , så hvis_man vælger en buket til under eller over dette beløb ved man jo reelt ikke hvor meget eller hvad man får for pengene .
neutral	i was intending on booking 0 night in a hostel in a dorm room and then 0 night in a private_room at the same hostel the following night .
neutral	i found this hard to do and couldn ' t really see an easy way of doing this on the website .
neutral	also when i paid for the room i thought i would automatically be signed_up to hostel_bookers website but i wasn ' t i just had made booked and not created an account .
neutral	however - really good variety and other that than it is easy to use .
neutral	great price , great availability but awful service .
neutral	they managed to get product that was out of stock everywhere_else .
neutral	minor niggle is that i only placed the order because the website said it was in stock .
neutral	very frustrating when website says in stock only for an_email to come later saying the product is actually on order .
neutral	however they came through and managed to secure the product which was then delivered quickly .
neutral	all the stores are generally entertaining and fun with a wide_range of media and gadgets .
neutral	the prices are very much average with little deals .
neutral	what puts me off about hmv is the postage sucks always late !
neutral	and the staff rarely help out .
neutral	but over all not to bad .
neutral	** opdatering d . 00 / 00 - 0000
neutral	jeg_er nu blevet kontaktet af henrik fra telenor .
neutral	han lyttede til hvad_jeg_havde at sige , og ankerkendte min frustration .
neutral	i bund og grund løste han min henvendelse på_en måde , der igen får mig_til at tænke , at telenor , trods menneskelige fejl , er_en helt fin virksomhed :-)
neutral	tak for det .
neutral	/ kirstine andersen
neutral	jeg_har siden jeg_købte min nye mobil , og dertilhørende abonnement , udelukkende haft problemer .
neutral	det startede allerede i butikken , hvor jeg får af_vide , at det tilbud jeg ønsker at benytte mig af , ikke længere er gyldigt .
neutral	jeg ender med at købe et andet produkt - men finder 0 dage senere ud_af , at tilbuddet ikke er udløbet , blot ikke tilgængeligt i butikken .
neutral	efter megen diskussion , får_jeg lavet min aftale om .
neutral	i denne proces bliver min opsætning af betalingsservice umiddelbart aflyst , og_jeg overgår til automatisk betaling via dankort .
neutral	denne virker dog kun i 0 mdr ., hvorefter det_er meningen den skal på betalingsservice - det sker dog ikke , og_jeg modtager nu rykkere ( kan jeg se på mit telenor ) - dog ikke med posten .
neutral	det_er derfor først når mit abonnement bliver spærret , og_jeg bliver krævet 0x000 kr .
neutral	gebyr for at få åbnet dette igen , jeg bliver informeret om af betalingsservice ikke fungerer .
neutral	det bliver forklaret for mig , at det_er mit ansvar at snakke med_min bank om dette ?
neutral	de oplyser mig dog at de ikke_kan se et forsøg på tilmelding af betalingsservice fra telenor .
neutral	nu beder jeg om at få fjernet gebyrer på 000_kr .
neutral	for denne fejl - det nægtes .
neutral	da_jeg beder om at tale med_en overordnet , bliver chatten lukket ned af medarbejderen i telenor - jeg når ikke_engang at bede om at få oplyst mine muligheder for at klage over afgørelsen .
neutral	jeg_er så arrig på telenor , og kan slet_ikke vente med at få lov at komme ud_af aftalen og aldrig se mig tilbage .
neutral	i have ordered a few things from this site now and have always been pleased with my purchases .
neutral	the delivery is always quick and it is good value for money .
neutral	this rating would have been a 0 if it wasn ' t for the fact half the things i like sell out quickly .
neutral	there are previews on facebook the day before things go on sale and they go on sale between 00 - 00 the next_day .
neutral	however , if like me you work and are unable to sit on the site at the exact time they go on sale you usually miss out on the best stuff .
neutral	there is no limit to the amount of each item you can buy so bulk buyers buy the best things immediately to sell at a profit .
neutral	this seems to be provided as feedback regularly but nothing is ever done .
neutral	this is the only thing letting this site down .
neutral	watch out for the mandatory full purchase thing - not sure if this a new scheme but we had to pay in_advance for a full_tank of fuel in_advance which was set at the car_rental price ( perhaps 00_% more_than you would pay if you filled up your self ) you are then supposed to return the car empty but seeing as we had an ultra efficient 0 ltr car we barely used half a talk in 0 days so in effect we gifted the car_rental company half a tank of fuel .
neutral	i ' d rather take the car empty and return it empty .
neutral	they could try to reduce the price of their products .
neutral	the same products , with same quality and same standard , i ' ve seen else where sold for even low_prices , e . g .
neutral	such as india and even some european countries .
neutral	i guess they are okay for british market ( as they appear to have lower prices then their rivals ).
neutral	its not so bad , when you , think britain , is known as rip_off , capital of europe .
neutral	may take the opportunity to thank_you , for your kind and generous reminder , to my review .
neutral	i was asked by trustpilot to express my honest_opinions and not to bestow appraisal on anyone in particular .
neutral	i simply expressed general opinion of the state of uk market .
neutral	i would like assure you , that you were not target .
neutral	i would like to thank_you again for time and custom .
neutral	thank_you , best luck with the future .
neutral	well as per title .. its good but for the extra money i don ' t see the difference really .
neutral	rather save money for the same product .
neutral	unfortunately upon_arrival at the airport it was almost 0 hours before our shared shuttle took off .
neutral	this resulted_in a significant delay over the quoted arrival time and the villa owners we were meeting had to wait_until the middle of the night to meet us with the keys .
neutral	further stress was seen when we found we couldn ' t be dropped_off anywhere close to the place we booked the travel to ( i had to get a taxi at additional_cost ), there was plenty time for resorthoppa to get in touch with us on this .
neutral	finally finding out our pickup time proved almost_impossible as it never got put up on the website and after me finally phoning them ( at significant cost to me ) i got it sorted out with them , however the representative was rather snippy .
neutral	next time i would be booking a private shuttle , however i would still use resorthoppa .
neutral	i have been on diet_chef for a while and planning on stopping this due to fact that i have felt ill consistently since been on this .
neutral	yes the food is tasty , yes it is convenient , yes i have lost weight but my warning is , it just isnt possible to stay on it as long as it states .
neutral	the only way i have even felt human most days is to eat a lot of fruit and veg .
neutral	i expected to add some but this is ridiculous .
neutral	im not even that big and im nearly passing out .
neutral	plus i still had to calorie count any way as your snacks are not labeled clearly .
neutral	had to weigh all fruit , veg , measure milk so to be honest i might as well cook my owneals and save my self a fortune .
neutral	if you are the sort of person who_likes fad diets , living off liquids and spending a fortune for the privalidge , try this !
neutral	my one honest tip is , this is not special amazing food , it is stuff you can make a lot tastier and cheaper , it is just smaller portions .
neutral	plus having that many snacks in house at once was just a massive temptation .
neutral	i have ordered several_times from this site and while i can ' t fault the prices , i don ' t like the fact they will buy things as f grade and sell them on as a or b !!!!
neutral	also they maintain they normally send items the same day ... that has never happened to me infact i am_currently waiting for some dvds that have been in the ' stock pickingin progress ' stage for 0 days .
neutral	i didn ' t experience problems like one reviewer thoughwho didn ' t receive accessories with a phone , i did , but here is a company that definitely does lack in a few areas .
neutral	they don ' t really have the same online deals like they have in the shop and they are getting soo tight with some of the contracts
neutral	it ' s good .
neutral	is cheep as a student price .
neutral	it ' s also good that you find the hostel by map search .
neutral	despite much waiting my order arrived oo 00000000 , now how do we hit this request ? grateful , clezio lelis
neutral	the prices are very cheap and affordable but what they lose on their cheap prices they make up in their overpriced shipping charges .
neutral	i shipped a 00 lb bowling ball through ups for under $_00 and yet i have to pay over $_00 in shipping charges for half the weight .
neutral	my first experience with supplement_warehouse did not go as planned as i ordered and paid on 00 / 00 / 00 and it took nearly two_weeks for the package to arrive , to my surprise it was missing items i ordered so i had to call customer_service and complain and it took nearly two more weeks to receive the missing items i originally ordered .
neutral	ordered 00 / 00 / 00 and my order was finally completed 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	almost a month to complete an order is ridiculous .
neutral	next time i order i will be sure to order a month in_advance of actually needing the items so i don ' t run out and am still_waiting on my items .
neutral	generally a good experience , the items all arrived and i paid much less_than if i had bought things at a supermarket .
neutral	the delivery wasn ' t up to scratch however : i ordered on a thursday_evening and expected everything to arrive on the monday as next_day delivery is advertised , however when i called on monday it turned_out that it hadn ' t been sent , i got an_apology but no explanation .
neutral	i got the order on tuesday but had to wait in all day for it , another company i order from uses dpd and is able to give me a one hour delivery slot , dpd offers this service to their customers for free so it would make sense for sushisushi to make use of it and keep their customers happier .
neutral	i was also given no tracking_number with my delivery confirmation_email , simple things can mean the difference_between repeat_custom and looking for better service elsewhere .
neutral	people usually leave reviews when they ' re angry and want to vent .
neutral	in my case , i ' m doing none of those .
neutral	i ' m just here to share my impression .
neutral	i sent a laptop from belfast to a friend in croydon .
neutral	packed it up nicely and securely enough to hopefully make the journey in one piece .
neutral	selected the store to which i wanted it to be sent and popped_into the nearest centra to send it .
neutral	with the £_000 insurance and signature , i paid a few_pence over £_00 .
neutral	given that it was a valuable item , i didn ' t mind .
neutral	however what i did mind and still do , is the lack of information on the website regarding the time - frame related to shop - to - shop deliveries .
neutral	given the high price i was almost certain it would be a 0 day delivery , however there is no way to confirm that .
neutral	ergo , not the best on - line experience .
neutral	continuing on that thought , the tracking is weird .
neutral	things that happen for example at 0 in the morning , showed up in my tracking history after 0 hours ...
neutral	anyhow , parcel got there on thursday which makes this a 0 day delivery in the holiday season and from northern_ireland which is actually better_than royal_mail ' s delivery times ( my 0 day deliveries from amazon show up after 0 days ) at this time of the year .
neutral	the final note comes from my friend and it is regarding the picking_up process .
neutral	it sounds a lot like the service you get from western_union in their shops all around the uk .
neutral	they just don ' t seem to like you bothering them with parcels .
neutral	to use my friend ' s words " they were borderline rude ".
neutral	in any case , laptop is intact , and in working order which makes this delivery a success .
neutral	might use collect_+ again , but i am not necessarily impressed .
neutral	ordered sky phone with fiber internet they arrived to install my internet only to find out my phone did not work one week latta i asked why has my phone still not been fixed was told fault at exchange , then was told o we might cut you off if we like as we have noticed you have a old dept with us witch i don ' t have , so only after 0 weeks with them they did agree to cancel my contract free of charge due to the phone not being repaired witch was nice of them , so not all bad some times can be nice people but this time my time was wasted
neutral	i honestly really like maplin , got some great products and the staff are just ace !
neutral	my only_downside is that certain products are quite overpriced , even for a high_street retailer .
neutral	some of their own branded products are brilliant value for money but a lot of the big brands are very expensive .
neutral	i recently visited the new store opening in middlesbrough ( on the grand opening day as well ) looking for a decent quality multimeter to test electronics .
neutral	the store assistant was very helpful and recommended me a product that was great value for money .
neutral	hey , he even recommended the £_00 one over the £_00 one , i ' ve gained a lot of trust for my local maplin now .
neutral	good service and platform .
neutral	easy to use and would use again .
neutral	very poor response to advert i placed from the platform , however i think has to do with the market for renting in my area rather_than rentify .
neutral	the max events day of activities was great although they decided on the day to not provide any lunch ( a bbq was described on chillisauce .)
neutral	we were told " no bbq today " without any reason_why and with that we spent the rest of the day hungry .
neutral	people who suffer from hypoglycemia need food at regular intervals and a venue that puts people through physical activity for a day with no proper food is irresponsible and asking for trouble .
neutral	we were miles_away from any shops so out of desperation i managed to get a pizza delivered but had to miss some activities to go meet the guy .
neutral	not a fun experience on a hangover !
neutral	booked a hen_weekend in cambridge for my sister and 00 girls .
neutral	great choices to choose from as a very mixed age group and also personalities .
neutral	had a few hitches with the company during the booking stage , i felt_like i was asking too much when all i wanted was a few more invites added .
neutral	i was also told different things by different members of staff .
neutral	when i first booked the gentleman was great and we set_up suitable activities and times .
neutral	but then when the final itinerary came out this was very different .
neutral	this was resolved quickly but i felt as if i was being difficult in what i was requesting .
neutral	although the second activity we changed to i feel was much_better on the actual night it just caused myself as the organiser unnecessary stress .
neutral	i also feel the company need to change the way you pay so people can pay little and often as i found those tight for money struggled with the bulk payments and deadlines .
neutral	so the weekend itself started off great , we managed to book in early to the holiday inn which was great !
neutral	so we all arrived at our first activity which was dirty_dancing , unfortunately the company had told me a different time to what they actually booked .
neutral	i was informed 00 . 00 but the bar was told 00 . 00 .
neutral	this would then effect the rest of the day , but i managed to change our next activity to be half an_hour later .
neutral	no further hitches , dirty_dancing was great and so was cocktail_making !
neutral	so all in all a fab weekend just a shame the organiser had the added stress .
neutral	cjs provide some of the cheapest prices found on the web for games - on that front they get 0_stars .
neutral	the problem is that i pre_- ordered cod : ghosts for pc and got some rather mixed messages .
neutral	the game description says instant delivery of the key - not true .
neutral	when i try to get my key it says it will be delivered 00_hours before_release - not true .
neutral	support say it will be released in time to preload - not true ( unless you have insane (> 00mbps ) broadbnad ).
neutral	facebook says keys will come out at 0000hrs on 0th_nov - not true
neutral	key is finally available at 0000hrs
neutral	the game was cheap but the communication was rubbish - if they had just said upfront that i would get it a few hours before_release i would be happy and have ordered , instead they give the impression before you order you will get it ' instantly ' in reality it was 0 days_later .
neutral	be honest guys and you will have a customer for a long time ( if you keep the prices this great !
neutral	).
neutral	steve
neutral	the network itself has decent coverage , although the 0g_signal is not as good in certain_areas as other_networks .
neutral	i found customer_services were quite unhelpful when experiencing problems tethering on my iphone
neutral	myprotein offers good quality protein at a hugely competitive price - it is a pity that their free delivery catered for by yodel is absolutely_appalling .
neutral	my last four orders have been delivered by this company and even_though the instructions were to leave the box at the reception to my flat complex if i am not in , every_single time the delivery company has just left the boxes outside .
neutral	if it were not for this , myprotein would be getting 0_stars !
neutral	partner ordered a chair for me for my bday 0 weeks in_advance , got told was guna b 0 days then had a phone call saying it was out of stock and b no_longer_than a week ( no_problems , plenty of time to get here for my bday ) actually ended_up being 0 weeks !
neutral	this was after various calls to 0000 numbers which has cost me god_knows in phone_calls .
neutral	technically - very good company !
neutral	great pilots , good crafts .
neutral	but adv .
neutral	in plane is really annoying !
neutral	another think i don ' t like - its additional surcharges for paying with cc .
neutral	call plans are ok if your a home customer , choice of phones is average but worst of all is customer_services - it ' s ridiculous trying to sort a problem , get answers etc .
neutral	recently went in to comet to purchase a new washing_machine .
neutral	the experience had it ' s good points and it ' s bad points !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the washer was good value , delivery was free and they took my old one away .
neutral	the sales_rep was ridiculously pushy , constantly trying to push us to a more_expensive washer despite telling them our budget .
neutral	at the checkout he tried for 00_minutes to get us to take out extended_warranty - in the end i said i would think about it so we could leave !
neutral	0 hour later i received a phone call asking if i was ready to take out the extended_warranty and he wasn ' t best pleased when i said no .
neutral	overall : good value , shame about the pushy_sales .
neutral	as always my protein was great on price and product , however false statements on product descriptions and refusal to refund 0 products i ordered and did not need as a result of their mistake , let them down completely and i was left very frustrated .
neutral	they really didn ' t seem to care that i was annoyed with their service either .
neutral	also beware of their points system , it ' s very poorly ran , my account had gone into minus figures , and i had saved numerous points whicheck theh wiped at the end of the year without warning ( it does say in the t &_c ' s but a warning would have been nice ...) if ordering from these just make_sure you are 000_% certain with your order before you place it as you can ' t edit an order after paying .
neutral	you have to cancel , get a refund and order again !!
neutral	very annoying company but great products and price .
neutral	could not fault the service , flowers looke fine , however when i arrived home to see them , i asked my fiance where she had put the rest of them , but there were no more .
neutral	love the product , but was slightly disappointed with the shipping time , as it was for a christmas_present and i ' d ordered it well in_advance , but ended_up hoping it would arrive in time to wrap up .
neutral	i ordered a silver tuxedo for a cruise .
neutral	it said delivery in three working_days .
neutral	when i rang to chase it up i was informed that it was not kept in stock and the supplier was on holiday until the 0th_jan .
neutral	my cruise leaves on the 0th .
neutral	however they accepted the cancellation and refunded the money quickly .
neutral	this site is ok .
neutral	it doesn ' t give you much detail and you need to know the make of the vehicle you ' re checking .
neutral	i just use it to check the cost of tax for any new cars i buy .
neutral	client depuis quelques années , le_prix de croquette pour mes lapins devient le plus en plus cher .
neutral	le sachet de 00 kg été vendu à 00 . 00_euros en avril est maintenant à 00 . 00_euros !!
neutral	pour les mêmes produits sur_le site petmed . co . uk , le_prix est nettement moins cher , malgré que_le fait au royaume uni le tva est plus haut .
neutral	such a hard website to navigate
neutral	good service but not top quality , i was expecting like it details on the advert that the delivery man would take the shopping into the kitchen , but he just left it at my front_door , and it wasnt all bagged either .
neutral	not to mention the products that were not in stock that were replaced with something else now i understand that they do run out of stock , but replacing burger buns with hot dog rolls , now i cant see the logic ..
neutral	products are okay but then service needs to be more professional .
neutral	good site to skim over to get a brief idea of places , restaurants and things to do but a lot of reviews on there aren ' t great or true to the place in my experience !
neutral	the look and the feel of the 0 items that i ' ve purchased felt cheap .
neutral	it ' s feeling so difrent when your iphone is licked and now you seeing carrier bar is working
neutral	it took 0 - 0 mins to load each page during checkout ..
neutral	there is absolutely nothing wrong with my broadband speed and have used " just_eat " before which i never had this problem with .
neutral	sort it out hungryhouse !
neutral	i ordered my small fish reefs on sunday_afternoon , it showed on system that they were in stock and as i was in desperate need of them i chose this company , it is now thursday and they are have still not even been dispatched , i know its not as bad as some problems you get with buying on line but i do spend a lot of time buying stuff on line and in my experience , some shop that have items in stock have a 0 - 0 day dispatch time .
neutral	i have emailed the company and they did reply with in couple of hours to say that item will be getting dispatch end of this week so will be with me 0 - 0 working_days after this .. so tuesday 0 days after i ordered it .
neutral	liked it !
neutral	cannot say more_than that , very impressed .
neutral	i ' ve used shopto . net for quite a while now and i ' m a gold member , they used to be excellent , but it seems that recent changes have them neglect their old values of customer care when an issue arises .
neutral	their recently added shoptonews section seems to be a copy and paste of other gaming sites news and the reviews are mediocre to say the least .
neutral	their blog used to be more reliable
neutral	i do love the clothes ive bought jumpers , skirts and coats oh and boots , all lasted well and washed well ( appart from boots lol ) but the items are sooo pricey i usually wait for the sales
neutral	i ordered about 000_pounds worth of product .
neutral	the introductory meat pack , 0kgs of tilapia , and 0 cartons of egg_whites .
neutral	i only recieved my egg_whites and one pack of veal .
neutral	i also recieved some fat_burners that werent ordered .
neutral	staff seem helpful , and have offered to resend back my whole order , but the internal email system on the website is extremely slow , took 0 days to complete my complaint and get told they would send out the order .
neutral	a phone call could have fixed the problem in a few minutes .
neutral	considering muscle_food only deliver tuesday to thursday .. the slow complaint process means it is taking forever to get my food !
neutral	the run up to the stag_do was very good .
neutral	lots of communication with chillisauce , they facilitated the payments etc which saved me , the best man , a lot of hassle .
neutral	broadly speaking , the whole stag_do was a success with one exception .
neutral	we paid for guest_list entry on the friday_night and found that we weren ' t on the list in some places which frustrated us and had an affect on the fun we were having that night .
neutral	we complained on the saturday and were told we ' d be added to a club guest_list for saturday_night .
neutral	again , on arriving at the club , we weren ' t on the guest_list !!!
neutral	very frustrating and hence the poor review .
neutral	firstly i can confirm the company is genuine and trustworthy , so don ' t have any concerns there .
neutral	the watch supplied was exactly as ordered with all necessary breitling international warranties .
neutral	its condition was perfect .
neutral	i was disappointed that my watch was delayed beyond the maximum stated delivery and i had to chase updates a couple of times .
neutral	i believe swiss watches did what they could to chase the order though , delivery to the authorised dealer appeared to be beyond their control .
neutral	my other disappointment was that the website states under the watch i ordered that the watch came with a 0 day refund policy , offering me peace of mind if i needed it .
neutral	when i placed my order i was told my watch was a special order though and therefore wasn ' t eligible .
neutral	my watch wasn ' t anything special , it was a standard breitling aerospace evo .
neutral	i think the website is misleading and told swiss watches this but they state the full terms of the refund policy are available online .
neutral	it wouldn ' t take them long to update the site so the watches that aren ' t eligible are listed as such though , so read what you what into the way they present their refund policy .
neutral	the final price was better_than anywhere on the high_street but maybe not by the margins you ' d expect .
neutral	don ' t write off your local official dealer before getting their best quote .
neutral	i was offered a quote within £_000 of the final price i paid swiss watches , the watch was in stock and the fitting would have been free .
neutral	in short it was an acceptable experience and i ' d consider_using them again .
neutral	i get the impression most people have a better experience than i did from their reviews .
neutral	it took a long time to get my order refunded
neutral	good service , friendly website
neutral	it is easy to make reservation and they give me voucher soon .
neutral	i used this company for a while although i was never thrilled with the service .
neutral	the sales_team are quite pushy and say there is a minimum of 0 hours for a two bed flat which is more_than i wanted , but went with it .
neutral	i recently received an_email offering a one of 0 hour service for £_00 but when i called they said my post code wasn ' t eligible .
neutral	the cleaning was generally ok but never great value and the first cleaner broke part of my shower and didn ' t mention it .
neutral	edit_: i ' ve since been contacted by fantastic cleaners who have apologised and insisted they will amend the marketing and not repeat this mistake .
neutral	i would definitely give 0_stars !
neutral	but i received an_email instructing me to check the parcel and the content before signing :
neutral	====
neutral	important message : we strongly_advise you to check the parcel ’_s condition and contents before signing the delivery note . feel free to remove your product ( s ) from the box to inspect them , even if the outer_packaging doesn ’ t show any signs of damage .
neutral	====
neutral	the above message was in red and bold .
neutral	but when i received the parcel the delivery guy didn ' t allow me to open it ( obviously ) and said that i need to sign first as this is part of ups policy .
neutral	and to be honest , i think he is right ... how would you " open / alter " the package before signing ... you know , before signing it is still his responsibility and not yours !
neutral	be more clear next time .
neutral	other than that , great price and product condition .. so far at_least .
neutral	on the one hand , they have all the bike parts i ' ll ever need and the staff are always helpful and willing to part with a little advice on bike maintenance .
neutral	on the other , trying to get them to do work on the bike themselves is an_absolute chore .
neutral	long waiting times despite nearly empty schedules and the work is too often of questionable quality .
neutral	one particular example is when i took my bike in for a yearly once - over ( i do regular maintenance myself ) and they replaced my chain .
neutral	that night , cycling home from work , the chain snapped in the middle of a busy junction .
neutral	i always used to love going into game .
neutral	they always had what i wanted and the staff knew their stuff .
neutral	of late , however , they ' ve been slipping badly , with poor availability and damaged stock .
neutral	this was best highlighted when the cancelled all mass_effect pre_- orders shortly before_release .
neutral	even worse , they deposit was refunded only as store credit .
neutral	i wanted to invite my grandfather visiting me in london to one of the beethoven symphonies concerts at the bbc proms conducted by barenboim .
neutral	we choose some tickets for monday 00rd for symphonies 0 & 0 and looked forward to it .
neutral	0st row tickets .
neutral	as the tickets didn ' t arrive , i contacted viagogo who were fast to tell us the seller could not be contacted .
neutral	they offered to rebook us for another night or refund us .
neutral	after telling them that if they could rebook us , it would be better_than missing on this amazing cycle of concerts , i received a call from a very efficient gentleman who found us 0 tickets in no time .
neutral	unfortunately , i realized after i hanged_up that the tickets were for another concert with another orchestra and pieces by smetana and prokoviev on wednesday .
neutral	it was not another concert from the same cycle ( could have been tuesday or friday - not wednesday !)
neutral	at no time he provided me any details about what concert it was but we only mentioned the day of the week .
neutral	what would you say if you buy a ticket to u0 concert and are sent some tickets for rihana ?
neutral	i called viagogo back less_than 0 minutes after we had hanged_up and was told that they had a zero refund policy and the gentleman i talked to would have to make a " judgement call ".
neutral	impressive .
neutral	i was promised i would be called back by the mighty person who could make that judgement .
neutral	it never happened .
neutral	i received 0 hours_later an_email confirmation that i would receive the tickets for this smetana prokoviev concert i have no interest in .
neutral	moreover , these tickets were on sale for half the price that the tickets i initially purchased and there was no sign of balance refund .
neutral	as i harassed viagogo on all their phone_lines ( the main one would no_longer give me the option to talk to anyone - how nice !
neutral	), i was eventually called back by someone unaware of the all situation .
neutral	after putting me on hold for a long time , the call cut ( probably my cell phone ).
neutral	i then received a message_saying they couldn ' t refund me as the tickets had been sent and i had given my consent on the phone .
neutral	0st lie : the email to say the tickets had been sent came a few hours after i said i had no interest in them and was promised to be call back
neutral	0nd lie : i was never called back by the mighty person capable to make the judgement call on my case
neutral	0rd lie : how can you give your consent to a concert without being told what the concert is ?
neutral	without being given the details ( row , seat number ) of these tickets ?
neutral	well you can ' t possibly call that consent .
neutral	0th lie : i was told i would be upgraded .
neutral	instead , i am being sent some tickets who were for sale at £_000 instead of those i had paid £_000 .
neutral	what a great upgrade .
neutral	not only viagogo seized the opportunity to not let go of their commission by rebooking me instead of refunding , but they never wanted me to cancel those tickets i didn ' t want , because they saw a great opportunity to make money ... and pretending they were being kind to me .
neutral	appalling .
neutral	it seems viagogo replies to comments on this site .
neutral	i ' ll wait a few_days before i ' ll forward the whole_thing to a lawyer .
neutral	order 0000000
neutral	--- update 0 days after the concert i wanted to attend :
neutral	i have received a full_refund from viagogo which shows that they do care about their client .
neutral	viagogo is doing a tricky business .
neutral	by putting_together buyers and sellers for event tickets , so many things can go_wrong .
neutral	if they were too easy to reach , 00_% of their business would be about wasting time dealing_with unnecessary calls .
neutral	yet it was hard and frustrating to get hold of them , and ended_up being expensive ( quite the phone bill !
neutral	).
neutral	naturally , i would have liked to take my grand father to what i believe was the concert of the year .
neutral	at_least , i can watch it on bbc inlayer .
neutral	overall , a complicated experience but viagogo has taken the right decision refunding me and i appreciate it .
neutral	will i use again ?
neutral	i may .
neutral	love the products , quality and the variety .
neutral	the downside is its way to expensive .
neutral	the same accessories are much much cheaper elsewhere .
neutral	not bad would reccomend tho
neutral	good but could of been better
neutral	i prefere i phone
neutral	i don ' t really like to shop in tesco although there fruit and veg is good , but i have found horrible bits of meat in pasta pots ect and there was an orange fly in a packet of crisps i brought in a meal deal .
neutral	the produce is not worth the money and its very exspensive you dont get your moneys_worth .
neutral	well , getting the point of putting a quote out there was dead simple and very easy , after that things got a little hairy , for instance :
neutral	- changing details an asking for re - quotes was a pain , shouldn ' t this be automatic ?
neutral	- having to hunt through the faq to find how to pay the courier an_hour before they arrived .
neutral	shiply make it easy to pay for they deposit ( their fee ) but after that you are on your own .
neutral	i assumed i would pay the rest via the site also , and had to quickly run out for the final cash , a bit_annoying that this wasn ' t pointed_out in the ' how it works ' ( makes me think keeping it to three steps was more important than the usefulness , more marketing than anything ).
neutral	there are other oddities , but i would use the site again , for it does that first bit of the process very well and know i know some of the quirks ( there are more i can ' t remember ) i feel_comfortable using the service again .
neutral	usually had no_problems spent $ 0000s over the years with supplement_warehouse but lately it seems products are getting sent in damaged condition , as my preworkout came in like a rock and had to send back and reorder .
neutral	just a hassle but return_policy is legit .
neutral	nice flowers delivered very fast .
neutral	unfortunately no email was sent to confirm the order had been received , and the invoice is sent as a pdf attachment , which is much less convenient than just having the details written in the email .
neutral	the laptops i have had from dell have been good , but customer_service is awful .
neutral	the last time i called customer_service they gave me a quote for support , then tried to increase it during the call .
neutral	they took_ages to attempt to resolve the problem but were ultimately unsuccessful .
neutral	it took hours .
neutral	i am surprised they were not more familiar with their own products .
neutral	on another occasion they quoted me £_00 to replace the cds i got when i first bought the laptop .
neutral	i took it to a shop where they reinstalled everything for £_00 , saving me £_00 .
neutral	we got the call to go and collect my ring .
neutral	when we got there ( it ' s a long drive ) we found that my ring had been made the complete wrong_size .
neutral	when they ' d taken the order originally they hadn ' t written down the size and instead of phoning to ask they just guessed !
neutral	it was far too small !
neutral	i ' m a o and it was j .
neutral	they initially offered to resize it there and then which we were not happy about .
neutral	we ' d have lost quality making it so much bigger .
neutral	then they offered to give me the one from the shop floor , which everyone would have tried on .
neutral	i wasn ' t happy so they did agree to make a new one and post it to me when it was ready , free of charge .
neutral	we had intended to order my fiance ' s ring that day too but after this experience we actually went to another jewellers who managed to make his ring on time and perfectly .
neutral	we were given his with a valuation certificate , photo etc .
neutral	mine from marlows just came in a box without even a cope of the receipt .
neutral	and mine was mich more_expensive .
neutral	really disappointed and has made what should have been a lovely experience that little_bit less special .
neutral	the ring is beautiful but i think everytime i look at it i ' ll feel that twang of disappointment .
neutral	my flights were rescheduled , meaning that i would have to take two more days off work and be stuck in shanghai airport for over 00_hours on both the outward and return journeys .
neutral	as i wasn ' t given any alternative , i had to cancel my flights with budgetair .
neutral	i then asked for the full_refund i was entitled to .
neutral	initially , budgetair said that it would take 00 - 00 weeks to refund me the ticket amount , but they wouldn ' t refund the flight booking_fee , credit_card costs or airline failure service .
neutral	after making an official_complaint to the airline and writing about this experience on trust_pilot , i was given a full_refund within a few_days .
neutral	yo udo not have enough info about your products on the site ...
neutral	i purchased a cross - hatch jacket , which looked very nice .
neutral	however , due to the time of year it was impractical as i was hoping it would be thicker - no fault of stand - out .
neutral	ordering was very easy , and customer_service was great , i ordered the wrong_colour and quickly emailed to see if i could change this - it wasn ' t a problem .
neutral	quick delivery and i got what i had ordered .
neutral	on realising that the item wasn ' t suitable , i had to send back .
neutral	my only issue is the cost of returns .
neutral	it cost me nearly £ 0 , to send it first_class recorded .
neutral	i didnt have to send it this way but for peace of mind , i think most people would send it recorded .
neutral	anyway , you do not get re - imbursed for the return cost , so basically , i have lost £ 0 and got nothing to show for it .
neutral	which is a shame .
neutral	if i knew what i was wanting , and had physically seen the item , then i would have no - hesitation using the company again .
neutral	it seems river_island is gettng more and more_expensive should offer discount !
neutral	i went to buy some bits in primark the other day and was suprised how much items have gone up in price .
neutral	sometimes its not worth spending it in primark now when you can go elsewhere and get better quality thats going to last longer .
neutral	on the plus side you can still get some great bits
neutral	i use paypal quiet alot because of my ebay account the only thing i dont agree with is the charge you get everytime you recieve money on the other hand it is free of charge if you want to transfer money into your own account
neutral	ordered an office desk from these_guys a month_ago now which has just arrived .
neutral	when i ordered i didn ' t clock the delivery estimate of 00 - 00 days but when i realised i thought that must just mean the maximum amount of time it will take them to deliver an in - stock item .
neutral	what i now realise is the desk was made to order , but still didn ' t arrive within 00 working_days , it was more like 00 .
neutral	if they would just be honest and put made to order on their site it would have saved me a lot of annoyance .
neutral	customer_service is good , they get back to you quite quickly , although they offered no apology for the lateness of the delivery even when i said i wasn ' t exactly happy .
neutral	the desk itself looks very robust , the main top part is very heavy and is the only bit i have removed from it ' s packaging so far .
neutral	it all seems well_packaged , so i ' m happy there .
neutral	all in all i ' m fairly happy but next time i make a purchase for office furniture i will keep a closer eye on what they have in - stock and what ' s made to order as a month is a long time to wait .
neutral	i ' ve been using this company since last_year september .
neutral	i ' ve found them to be fast in delivering completed images and they do a very neat job .
neutral	however , recently there was a mistake in my completed image and i dismissed it and stated the reason .
neutral	i waited a few_days and then emailed the uk support_team to find out how many more days it would take to rectify the issue .
neutral	i did not get a response .
neutral	i have happened to just log_into my account at rtb ( to find an_alternative way to communicate with them ) and found out it has been completed ... why didn ' t i get a notification that it had finally been complete ?
neutral	why didn ' t i get response to the email sent ?
neutral	it ' s a shame because i had nothing but praises for this company , but i feel now that my custom has become somewhat a bother to these people , even_though i am paying for my pictures to be edited .
neutral	yes , sometimes i send pictures one at a time days apart , sorry if this is irritating to you rtb , but i design and create my different variations weeks - months apart , i am unable to send images in bulk .
neutral	i ' ll look for a similar company to do my images from now on , i don ' t want to be a bother .
neutral	it ' s a great way to get_rid of dvd ' s and cd ' s that were sitting on my self but prices were a bit low .
neutral	prompt pick_up but it took quite a long time to receive the money .
neutral	good service but i prefer not to pay_monthly because i dont use that much data and making payments through paypal .
neutral	wish i could topup at anytime without paying monthly .
neutral	if you want a customer to post a review now , and dont pay for trust_pilot , then that customer must pre_- register or be prepared to use their facebook account .
neutral	many of my customers are not happy to do this , so may have to look at dropping trust_pilot as a preferred review site .
neutral	its not that it is expensive , but i dont like being held to ransom .
neutral	to make it hard for customers to place a review really goes against what i feel a review site should be doing .
neutral	please make it easier for customers to post reviews and then maybe i would be happy to sign_up for additonal services .
neutral	service was ok . couldn ' t advise delivery time .
neutral	only deliver once a week on a saturday .
neutral	not the best tbh .
neutral	didn ' t install it as website advised .
neutral	so after having to deal with a very rude staff_member was finally able to talk to someone who listened to me .
neutral	took a while to get there but have now had a satisfactory resolution .
neutral	thank_you dreams for finally understanding my concerns .
neutral	i now do not have such a bad opinion of your company .
neutral	tune up is one of the finest product ... no it ' s the one and the only one i might use and trust to tuneup my pc and that unquestionable fact for me .
neutral	unfortunattly moment ' s after purchasing the product with a general offer in the website ( 00 . 00 $), two new offers in row appear to me first through the uninstall with ( 00 . 00 $) which was oky for me not that far from what i ' ve paid but then after i installing the new version i had another offer for ( 00 . 00 $).
neutral	that was totally unaccepted .
neutral	i have used mp for over 0 years now and have always found the service from start to finish fantastic , however this year it has been horrendous , my last order i paid extra for next_day courier ( ordered on a thursday at 00am well within the same day dispatch period ) i received a mail that afternoon to say it had been dispatched , friday came with no sign off it , contacted mp they couldn ' t give me a tracking reference for it , eventually got the tracking reference on the monday and it ended_up that they didnt give it to the courier until friday_afternoon .
neutral	the items arrived on monday_afternoon and after a few mails i got them to refund the extra payment for next_day delivery as they had not delivered .
neutral	its such a shame as the products are fantastic but your only as good as the service you provide and this area is definately lacking recently .
neutral	i wouldnt be so quick to blame the courier , mp are marking items as dispatched without actually dispatching them by the looks of things , please sort it out !
neutral	a one of a kind website with really reasonable prices .
neutral	a real wide_range of products with different choices of styles and colours .
neutral	i ' ll definitely be shopping here again for sure , however one of my nail_varnish products did come in the wrong shade ..
neutral	i ' ve been an orange customer for years - i ' ve had all_sorts of problems from niggles with rude customer_service to being overcharged by £_000 .
neutral	they make it as difficult as possible to complain and when you do , it ' s unlikely you ' ll receive a response .
neutral	yet i get a reasonably good deal and when someone calls me , my phone rings - which is what i want from a mobile provider .
neutral	it ' s a sad state of affairs that i fear orange are amongst the better networks for customer_service , so i ' m happy enough where i am .
neutral	very informated to us
neutral	instant , easily but not so completed collection
neutral	code recieved within 00_hrs , there was a couple of steps missing on the instructions , but as there was a link to a video tutorial that sorted the issue i had .
neutral	overall happy it worked phone is now unlocked
neutral	it ' s where i shop for protein , as their prices are great .
neutral	many of the items come with free_gifts such as protein shakers and tester packs .
neutral	delivery is also great .
neutral	in this area i ' d give them 0_stars .
neutral	however , be wary of some the marketing stuff they do , and things they put in the descriptions .
neutral	an example is something called methoxy - 0 - test which they claim boosts testosterone levels and recovery / performance .
neutral	i found zero evidence that it does this , and found a few scientific papers to the contrary .
neutral	however when asked about this i got no reply and my comments weren ' t approved for the site .
neutral	there are other examples too .
neutral	basically , use it as a shop by all means , where you go to it knowing what you want .
neutral	i wouldn ' t recommend going to it and trying to work out what you want , as they push certain products ( e . g .
neutral	phd supplements ) very hard , some of which have no evidence they do anything .
neutral	unfortunately this review agrees with thomas .
neutral	i have had exactly the same problems as he has .
neutral	made an order with standard delivery between 0 - 0 business days on monday .
neutral	however it took them a good five days to ready my product for dispatch !
neutral	this was on my week off from work and was hoping for fast ( in the 0 - 0 estimated time ) delivery .
neutral	however i was disappointed not to here from them until friday .
neutral	which meant i would be back at work and unable to receive delivery .
neutral	the products i received i was very pleased with !
neutral	seems like nike have become lazy , taking a very long time to process my order for dispatch .
neutral	even more annoying when ou have to pay for p_& p !
neutral	other_websites offer free delivery which often comes next_day when ordered early , makes nike performance look very weak !
neutral	shame .
neutral	i use this company on a regular_basis and will keep doing so not been let_down yet
neutral	i use this company on a regular_basis and will keep doing so not been let_down yet
neutral	ordered on the 00rd november .
neutral	nothing delivered by the 0th_december .
neutral	email not responded to .
neutral	line dead when trying to call customer_services .
neutral	the contacts on your order email confirmation were how i tried to contact you and i have copied them directly from there ;
neutral	tel : 0000 000 0000
neutral	email : customerservices @ justbeautifully . co . uk
neutral	this appears to be different to the email address you mention ?
neutral	i was certainly unable to get through on the phone_lines for 0 hours this morning before this initial review was posted and a chase up email sent 00_hours ago to the above email address .
neutral	hence my frustration .
neutral	thank your for your offer of the refund , all i would really like is it delivered by the 0th_december , which in fairness to me is 00 days after the date of order .
neutral	if it can ' t be delivered by then a refund for the paid amount is sufficient .
neutral	special delivery arranged and order delivered just in time .
neutral	been buying online games for years from many websites then came_across this website the other day and bought a few games , received codes in minutes and was a great service .
neutral	only issue i had was when i bought another game the following_day , then i got a email_saying fraud checking please send us 0 copies of identification , driving_license etc , i personally don ' t think anyone should send this kinda information to a website that don ' t provide there contact number and there address on there website ( its a 0 way thing we want to know your genuine too ).
neutral	overall though i received the codes i bought and they worked so ive no_complaints there but i would hope this company will look_into other ways to verify users without having to share confidential information .
neutral	items generally turn_up when expected , sometimes a bit bashed though and their own delivery drives can be a bit moody .
neutral	when they outsource delivery then it usually is better ( e . g .
neutral	fridges etc )
neutral	great value for money and free next_day delivery - superb !
neutral	however , payment is via_paypal , would have preferred other methods of payment .
neutral	normally i am pleased with apple as they generally delivery within a week and the quality is top_notch but on this occasion i had to wait 0 weeks for my order which apparently was in stock , not particularly good in this day and age .
neutral	when i finally received this there was a lose screw rattling around in the tower which unfortunately i cannot get to , pretty shoddy considering i paid over £ 0000 for this item , where is the qc checks apple ?
neutral	on the plus side the customer_service is very good , they are very keen to look after you if there is a problem , so at_least there is some redemption on this occasion .
neutral	i placed my order for 0 or 00 products and had to wait 0 weeks before anything arrived , i would have probably waited longer if i hadn ' t chased them too .
neutral	i had no response to various emails and had to call them a few_times to get any action , will think_twice before ordering from them again .
neutral	i ordered olbas oil for a cold , by the time i received it i was well over it , come on chemist_direct ... you should be better_than this !
neutral	i ' ve made a purchase with this provider for the first time .
neutral	the product hasn ' t been delivered due time as the robot email suggested .
neutral	when xmas period time passed , i was mildy surprised , as i received another automatic email prompting me to provide feedback about their quality of service .
neutral	oh well , it turned_out the shipment has never been delivered , so another free purchase was made .
neutral	i got mildly suspicious about the speed of delivery of the second ( free order ), this time arriving the very next_day of the purchase , despite the customer care team told me they didn ' t have one of the product on the stock , and therefor i would have to wait 0 additional days .
neutral	perhaps they ' ve forgotten my first shipment ?
neutral	whatever way , inconsistency in providing information to a customer can make a wonder !
neutral	update 0th_january_0000 : just received what i believe should be a retention campaign to keep customers .
neutral	! 0 %_off your next order until a month from today .
neutral	i am not going to change my shopping behaviour since 00 years , so thanks but the offer has no value to keep me interested shopping further with you .
neutral	there are means in e_- commerce these days to tailor timely offer to adjust to the customer , not the other way around ...
neutral	delivery drivers were rude and sweary and not a great representation of the company .
neutral	ordering was easy and fine .
neutral	i got to the hotel and no booking was there , not exactly the way to start a holiday , it took about two hours to sort out , spoiling the first day completely after no answer from the phone number provided .
neutral	the booking should have gone_through , no excuses , the fact they resolved this quickly makes this a 0 star_review rather_than a 0 star one .
neutral	good website , selection and prices , but appalling delivery service .
neutral	i was in when parcelforce allegedly tried to deliver , did not have a card or receive calls to tell me the item was waiting for me to pick_up , despite parcelforce tracking showing the opposite .
neutral	i phoned up to enquire_about my delivery , and the company did find out where my parcel was being held , but didn ' t seem bothered about the trouble i ' d had or offer to arrange an_alternative delivery .
neutral	in the en . d i had to leave work early to go and collect , and i really shouldn ' t have to do this next time i ' ll try a competitor as long as they don ' t use pracelforce .
neutral	fix the delivery issue and i would buy from you again .
neutral	this review was originally contested because it focused on the delivery too much rather_than the whisky_exchange - seeing as twe can choose their courier , i stand by my review .
neutral	activities were all good .
neutral	the clay shooting was good especially .
neutral	the hotel wasn ' t clean - although it was good having 0 - 0 to a room , it had the previous occupant ' s bra under the bed , along with a sock .
neutral	decor was rough .
neutral	i order an ericsson t00 which was in stock however after waiting sometime to see why my order was not on its way i contacted the company .
neutral	they replied and said they would look_into the issue .
neutral	the following_day i had still not heard back so i sent another email and the response was that the ericsson t00 was not in stock !!!!
neutral	so they offered my a similar model which i accepted .
neutral	whats disturbing here is it seemed that between the time i ordered the phone and when i followed up with an_email a week_later to see where it was that my order was in limbo .
neutral	would i have been waiting indefinitely to hear about my phone was not in stock if i had have not initiated contact ?
neutral	so obvious problems with their ordering system .
neutral	at present do not take an item thats shows in stock to be true but rather email them first before you order and part with your cash .
neutral	on the flip side the product is great now that its arrived and i am happy with its top condition ( almost as new )
neutral	ok , first of all , they were the cheapest for the 0 hotels i needed , 0 in london for 0 nights and 0 in greece for 0 so there is that .
neutral	and their new website is ok .
neutral	the not so good now , they didn ' t send the email confirmation straight_away , the login process and access your data for the itinerary is poor quality ( gives no info !)
neutral	- i have booked in full a transfer which is just resold from a0b transfers and they haven ' t sent me the voucher because the hotel is only partly paid till 0 weeks before_departure .
neutral	that is stupid , surely they have no right to use the transfer money as a deposit for anything_else .
neutral	if you need help and you raise a query , expect long delays for someone to come back to you and they are never apologetic .
neutral	i ' d say , use only when they are cheapest .
neutral	+ ve - speed of delivery was fantastic
neutral	- ve - quality of paper used in printing as well as the quality of printing itself are not very good .
neutral	don ' t like play . com much anymore with all these traders , first time i ' ve ordered from one and never received the item was a con .
neutral	go back to how it was play !!!
neutral	however , play did refund me and communication was good , albeit quite a wait to have to process a refund .
neutral	shopto are great for fast delivery ( usually next_day if you order before 0 . 00pm ), however their prices are getting worse imo .
neutral	there are numerous retailers around now who i can buy the same game from for around a few pounds cheaper and still get it delivered the next_day .
neutral	this an update the came on wednesday last_week at 0 : 00 and i ask the driver to wait at the the door with me checking the product and everything went fine thank u
neutral	ive been with vodafone for a while but my friends have better deals and offers .
neutral	i had pre ordered a game around 0 - 0 months it was actually released and then it comes late .
neutral	i ' ve always had dyson hoovers for the last 00 years but wen my last one pack in .
neutral	i went into an electrical store to purchase a dyson but came out with something totally different brand , this was partial to do with price and functions against other models and the staff_members recommendation .
neutral	overpriced for their packages and all you get is repeats all the time !
neutral	!
neutral	to many emails and offers to take in
neutral	order was costly ( 00 . 00 ) and took 0 weeks instead of 0 days .
neutral	for that price , i would have expected better service and respect of the advertised delay .
neutral	i had to email over and over and message on facebook to get a response .
neutral	it does work though so it ' s not all bad .
neutral	i just really felt that i wasn ' t a client worthy of their attention .
neutral	i feel i should get a discount .
neutral	more_than the 0 , 00 for writing this .
neutral	which i might not even get since i am not leaving a great review .
neutral	cool new red jum ... wait a minute ....!!!!
neutral	why is it blue ?
neutral	okay , so i ordered red and you guys sent me blue and i quite like the colour and i decided to keep the jumper .
neutral	i hear it ’_s going to be cold this winter and this will keep me warm while out and about .
neutral	besides ; me sending it back won ’ t be worth it as the item is £ 0 . 00 ( including tax ) and p_& p ( postage and packaging ) is near enough £ 0 . 00 and me sending it back would be about the same and you people probably won ' t refund return_postage so i ' ll be left with £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	0_stars !!!
neutral	!
neutral	has anyone noticed how stingy amazon have become lately ?
neutral	first they put a limit on how much you need to spend for you to qualify for supersaver delivery , then they delay the delivery of goods till the following week .
neutral	0_stars amazonuk .
neutral	oh fantastic .
neutral	i ’ ve been looking for a type of combat trousers i only ever want wear for work for nearly a year after the one i had for 0years began to ware away .
neutral	so i done numerous searches online under many different names ( name of the combat trousers ) and i nearly gave up till i done one last search and i came cross these_guys .
neutral	i saw payment_method was paypal which was more_than good enough for me because if anything went wrong , there be no middle_man and it would have been left solely to the seller to resolve any deputes as they see fit .
neutral	anyway .... paypal yay - i didn ’ t even think about it , i went right on in there and brought 0 pairs .
neutral	a couple days_later it came , but the bag one of the pairs was in was opened and the other was not which suggest to me the opened one could have been tried on by someone_else before he sent it back .
neutral	it was neatly packed though ... yup .
neutral	anyway so i soaked it in disinfectant and bunged it in the wash . it ’_s the reason for 0_stars otherwise it would have been 0 .
neutral	i had to delete one bad review towards aliexpress , because they refunded my monies to my account .
neutral	i sent a letter of complaint to aliexpress complaints_department about a seller and although nothing was said about my complaint , the end of last month , i was refunded .
neutral	will i shop there again ?
neutral	personally , i wouldn ’ t chance it .
neutral	maybe i got lucky .
neutral	i just wanted to put it out there that i got a refund is all .
neutral	i brought 0 pair of work trousers last_week from qtag which were in the wrong_size .
neutral	qtag ' s ridiculous , pointless policy is no sending items back in exchange for the correct_size .
neutral	so , i sent it back ( note ; using £ 0 p_& p recorded - stupid post_office worker ) and resubmitted my order in the correct_size .
neutral	* sigh *
neutral	total amount again came up to £_00 . 00 including p_& p , just like with the first transaction .
neutral	days_later , i got refunded via_paypal to the sum of £_00 . 00 .
neutral	now i ' ll think_twice about purchasing from them again .
neutral	if i ' m to return , ( a big if ) i ' ll have to be cautious not to make wrongful purchases as they will deducted a whopping amount for returns .
neutral	nah forget it because it costs more in p_& p for multiple items .
neutral	a good thing i didn ' t purchase two of em in incorrect sizes at once that time .
neutral	never again !
neutral	i purchased this last_night and i still have not received any emails saying it was successful ??
neutral	imei is correct ive made sure does it usually take this long its been almost 00_hrs ??
neutral	?
neutral	i bought 0 tickets for boxing on sat .
neutral	traveling friday .
neutral	have been panicking all day , phoned viagogo twice .
neutral	both_times spoke to friendly staff who explained they can come the day before the event , it ' s the individual who has sold viagogo the ticket who hasn ' t sent them to me yet ( they contacted the seller on the 00st may to ship them to me , so i dont understand_why the seller holds on to them for so long ).
neutral	they said they would get them sent to the hotel we were staying at in london if they hadn ' t come by thursday .
neutral	also reassured me i could potentially collect them from the venue if the seller lets me down .
neutral	this evening i have had an_email_saying dispached .
neutral	not got them yet but i ' m feeling slightly more at ease !
neutral	i do feel that the seller should be made to send viagogo the tickets or to the buyer by a decent deadline .
neutral	these tickets have been released ages_ago .
neutral	it ' s really unfair to make us wait to the very last_minute and get so stressed out about it .
neutral	the seller could have easily decided they don ' t want to sell them anymore - at the last_minute !
neutral	what do they gain from hanging onto them ?
neutral	i don ' t begrudge paying over the odds for an event of a lifetime but the stress of thinking we ' re not going to get to go is awful .
neutral	i really like the variety of items that asos offers , and usually i do not have a problem with asos whatsoever in terms of item quality or pricing .
neutral	one of the reasons i am giving asos 0_stars is because of the unfortunate problem that they still use myhermes .
neutral	i will not go into detail about my horrible experience with myhermes here - if you click my profile to see my other reviews on trustpilot , you will be able to find my review for myhermes .
neutral	the other reason i am not giving any higher_than 0_stars is because of their customer_service .
neutral	it is frustrating when there is no contact number and my only options are to wait for a response through email or via their facebook_page , which are usually very slow ( barring the automated_messages saying they have a high_volume of emails ).
neutral	when i had my problem with an order due to myhermes , asos were essentially useless and just asked me to " wait a little longer " and to contact them if it still had not arrived by a certain_date .
neutral	it did not , so i messaged them back on facebook , only to receive a reply several days_later , after the order finally arrived a week_later than i was told it would .
neutral	of the three queries i sent in via their contact form on their website , only one was responded to by an actual person , and they only told me things i already knew / could find on their website , rather_than answering my actual question .
neutral	my returns experience was hassle - free , and i ' m pleased that i could return items free of charge , with no random fees deducted from my refund , and also that they send a confirmation of receipt of the return .
neutral	due to myhermes being a pain in the bum in regards to standard delivery , i chose to go premier with asos so hopefully i will not have to go through the whole debacle of trying to locate my order again .
neutral	i certainly hope i never have to contact customer care again , as they are rather useless .
neutral	the service works , the deal was alright but not the most competitive and i wish i tried another network now .
neutral	overall no real problems but nothing that makes me think they are amazing .
neutral	ordered at approx mid day and arrived before mid day the following_day already restrung for me at my specifications .
neutral	very well_packaged and ready for me to use straight_away .
neutral	used before for shoes but never a racket and not very trusting with stringers as have had many bad restrings .
neutral	after having my racket for approx 0 weeks and only playing 0 competitive game and only 0 training sessions the strings snapped during warm up for my 0nd competitive match , expected much more .
neutral	used a voucher_code from mighty deals "£ 00 worth of flowers for £_00 "
neutral	i am just glad that i hadn ' t actually spent £_00 on them , didn ' t expect them to be delivered in a cardboard_box they were also disappointingly small and just less that 00_hours , the roses and gerbera ' s are wilting and the lilies don ' t look like they ' re even going to open !
neutral	wish i ' d gone to morrisons , spent the £_00 plus delivery on the beautiful bunches they have !
neutral	very easy to deal with in terms of the process , however , they made up that there was a scratch on the phone ( which there wasn ' t , i photographed it before sending off ) and reduced the payment by a massive 00 %.
neutral	taking the mickey somewhat but i just went with it for minimum hassle .
neutral	they did offer to send it back for free .
neutral	update_: 0jun00
neutral	after constant pestering by the company i feel obliged to reply .
neutral	the whole point of an independent review site is that a customer can score what they believe to be a fair representation of the company .
neutral	the " crack " on the bezel is perfect and straight , looks_like the intended " crack " on the iphone 0 ( see the antenna configuration ).
neutral	i believe it certainly comes under the " light cosmetic wear and tear is acceptable " policy on your website .
neutral	another reason for not rating 0_stars is your policy on " automatic payment after 0 days " if the offer has been revised .
neutral	i feel that this time period is too short if the customers best interests are in mind .
neutral	" 0_stars : acceptable experience but with some friction ."
neutral	is a fair representation of this transaction .
neutral	i ordered a gopro from proviation however , due to lack of shipments from gopro i ultimately cancelled the order and requested a refund .
neutral	after a few troubles with my emails being sent to proviations ' spam ' folder ( so not getting replies ), the refund was issued along with friendly apologies .
neutral	proviation have done a lot to resolve this issue and i thank them greatly for it .
neutral	i ' ve gotten some good deals but have also been burned by some sellers who sell counterfeit ... got to be_careful !
neutral	this is a good site for selling second_hand good and also purchasing .
neutral	it is possible to list ads for items wanted aswell .
neutral	you can post free ads but if you want to promote your ad it will cost .
neutral	you can upload 0 free pics as well for your ad .
neutral	as with things like this always sell face to face and be_careful if you are unsure .
neutral	i would recommend as you can find some interesting items on here .
neutral	there are jobs pages aswell .
neutral	update_: i still enjoy looking at gumtree but be very very careful if you are selling , anyone who asks you to give out your paypal email address because they will give you an extra £_00 -£ 00 for postage is scamming you and should be reported immediately .
neutral	i have shopped in hmv a lot over the years and prefer spending my money instore rather_than online .
neutral	when i have ordered online i have either had my item dispatched and recieved within 0 days or i have had to wait 0 days to be dispatched dispite it being in stock .
neutral	this has happened 0 or 0 times and now if not dispatched in the time it states i just cancel and try and find the product elsewhere even if i have to spend a few more pounds .
neutral	one item i did order was meant to be 0 discs but was only a 0 disc cd so they should probably check their product details .
neutral	not sure whether i would recommend their online service .
neutral	i phoned up regarding a query and the man on the phone was very pushy in trying to get me to book there and then .
neutral	tried tactics like last room left , free cancellation .
neutral	when i told him i had to run it past my husband who was at work kept on saying he would hold or just book it and cancel later !
neutral	i would appreciate being_able to book in my own time , i was going to make a booking on the expedia website once i made a decision on the hotel anyway but their pushy_sales_tactics have made me think_twice .
neutral	the customer_services rep was soo annoyed i didn ' t book he didn ' t even bother saying bye and hang_up !
neutral	bad customer_service !
neutral	ordered a dress online .
neutral	it was delivered late first of all and once opened it look nothing like it did online .
neutral	i ordered a it a size larger and it was still hard to get on and off and was very short .
neutral	size ' s are not very accurate at all .
neutral	colours and design allways look different .
neutral	not very good quality for the price .
neutral	ordered a new bank card as mine snapped recieved it 0 days_later in the post was awaiting a new pin to come which never did after ringing them i found out i wouldn ' t recieve a new one .
neutral	which was fine just wished they would have told be before hand .
neutral	very hard to understand anyone as they seem to be located everywhere but england !
neutral	still have not be able to sort out an issue with the ammount i caan withdraw per day either .
neutral	been ' sent ' out forms that have never arrived .
neutral	i find they are allways helpful when i go instore .
neutral	i ordered my travel system from them and it arrived on time and all in one parcel which i was happy about as the pushchair was very large .
neutral	i have experienced a couple of problems with the travel system but as it was brought while 0 months pregnant the are saying ' general issues due to use ' allthough its only been in use for 0 months .
neutral	as i said though the staff are very different in store and can ' t do enough to help you .
neutral	ordered some xmas presents online .
neutral	the arrived late and allthough i was in the delivery driver left the package with a neighbour and just posted the ' i called but you were not in card through '.
neutral	this has happened on two occasions .
neutral	and very overpriced !
neutral	0 small items for a 0month old .. over £_00 !
neutral	i purchased a few products one which was a fake tan mit and i did not realise it was only a face one as it didnt state it clearly and it was around 0 / 0 pounds and they are only € 0 to buy in shops for the big ones , i wasn ' t happy with thatc
neutral	ordered a headset which on the site was showing in stock , expected shipping day came and went with no notification .
neutral	looked at web - site and saw item was out of stock - easy to guess_what had happened - they never had any .
neutral	two days after expected delivery date and finally get an e_- mail asking me to call them .
neutral	so i called and was told that there was none left and they weren ' t expecting any so will issue a refund .
neutral	i feel they could ' ve been more on the ball and identified this much sooner saving me a week without a much needed headset which i ' ve sourced elsewhere .
neutral	every review i read about currys is bad , they all say the same , unhelpful staff , staff have no knowledge of the products they sell etc , in my experience i have never had a problem with currys except for bad delivery .
neutral	ordered a tv from them and was told it would take 0 weeks to deliver even_though their site and tv ads say next_day delivery .
neutral	the member of staff was pretty helpful in telling_me what the tvs had and which ones were the best .
neutral	i usually know exactly_what i want from currys so have only had to ask for advice a couple of times .
neutral	i bought a pc in april last_year from dino_pc and it is still going strong with no_problems .
neutral	other people said that they have experienced problems with theirs but these are just random people who might be making it up .
neutral	that is why i left it some time to do a review .
neutral	either way my pc is working great .
neutral	the only problem was the customer_service and the guarantee .
neutral	they were quick to respond to quires through emails but had no contact numbers .
neutral	they still owe me £ 0 from a voucher that i used but they did not deduct from the price when i paid for it .
neutral	the 0 year guarantee was a bit dodgy as i had to pay for the parts but not the labour .
neutral	other than that this was a good place to get a pc from .
neutral	just do not expect any niceties / customer_service
neutral	i purchased some flowers from serenata for mother ' s day and paid premium for sunday delivery .
neutral	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn ' t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn ' t as special .
neutral	when my mother opened the box , the flowers were on their side and looking really limp and fragile .
neutral	the pot with some wadding in was bone dry and it seemed as though the flowers had been in the box for some time .
neutral	when paying so much this is not acceptable .
neutral	i wouldn ' t use serenata_flowers again .
neutral	fast delivery service but when i received the game it did not come with any cellophane wrapping or promotional leaflets usually put in ps0_games , prompting me to think these games may infact be second_hand .
neutral	chilli_sauce got a few things right over the 0 nights we spent in hamburg : the hotel was comfortable though the breakfast was lacking and the transfers between airports and activities were a nice feature ( though also lacked consistency across activities or in arriving on time ).
neutral	the taxi for our return to the airport had to be called as it didn ’ t arrive and the response of the phone was “ is it not there already ?” - not what i call a vote of confidence .
neutral	on the day that we went paintballing one taxi arrived at the venue 00 - 00_minutes before the other despite setting off second .
neutral	the traditional 0 course german meal was in fact 0 course with 0 small beers and though the beer allowance was made clear to us straight_away the staff at the restaurant , the fact that we were only having one ( good but small ) meal was not .
neutral	the paintballing was outdoor rather_than indoor with 00_euros extra costs each for an overall and enough paintballs to last everyone the games .
neutral	it is very relaxed though and much_better_than in england .
neutral	would definitely go back .
neutral	the go_karting was an excellent activity !
neutral	we raced in 0 sets of 0 with a short practise , qualifying and then approximately 00 laps on a 00 - 00 second / lap track .
neutral	you get a print out at the end detailing your performance .
neutral	the beer bike was hard work but a lot of fun .
neutral	the driver was informative and the tour substantial with 0 - 0 breaks .
neutral	the beer was cleary cheap but acceptable and ( due to temperature ) took somebody working the tap the whole time to get anything but foam into the glasses .
neutral	the night time tour that we went on with a local guide was excellent too .
neutral	we were accepted into bars we were not previously allowed into due to guest lists .
neutral	once into these it is important to behave appropriately as the staff are very apprehensive of groups of british men and will have you removed for as little as spilling your drink .
neutral	i would suggest that you get a map and try and see as much during the day as possible .
neutral	from st pauli where our hotel was , we were one corner from altona train_station and you can get tickets for the s - bahn “ fast train ” for very cheap .
neutral	i suggest visiting the aussenalster and the area around the hauptbahnhopf if you get chance .
neutral	ok site could be a little better layout
neutral	they are good for games but not for pre ordering as you don ' t get the key in time which is frustrating for youtuber like me
neutral	i ' ve read a lot of awful reviews here .
neutral	i ' ve had a webiste with wix . com for about 0 months and it has been working quite well .
neutral	i was with webs . com before and believe , wix . com are much_better and much more reliable !
neutral	i haven ' t noticed that my website was down during those 0 months , the apps / widgets are working fine but there ' s 0 thing that kills me :
neutral	you can ' t use your hosted space as you wish !!!!!
neutral	which means that when you upload an image , you can ' t get the direct link of it , that means that you can ' t upload any files you want ( which is really stupid ) etc ...
neutral	so the space allocated to you for your uploads is pretty_much useless !
neutral	that drives me crazy !
neutral	it is such a stupid approach for a website builder , i can ' t believe this .
neutral	i have decided to pay_monthly for now , even_though it ' s more_expensive than paying yearly , because i want to make_sure that this is worth my money .
neutral	it ' s not quite yet , but it ' s much_better_than my past experiences .
neutral	nel complesso sono soddisfatto , ma ho un piccolo appunto da fare .
neutral	ho contattato il servizio clienti per avere conferma che le gomme fossero di produzione 0000 .
neutral	loro mi hanno confermato che , trattandosi di gomme termiche , non c ' erano dubbi che sarebbero state nuovissime .
neutral	in realtà le gomme arrivate portano un dot del 0000 : è vero che si tratta dell ' ultimo stock di produzione di quell ' anno , ma le mie gomme , ad oggi , hanno già quasi un anno di vita .
neutral	altri siti , come confermato da amici , spediscono gomme con dot di produzione dell ' anno in corso .
neutral	all in a great deal and prompt service from the company .
neutral	the only_downside through them is their aftersales email service .
neutral	i had an issue with my phone and emailed them for a follow_up .... of which i am still_awaiting a reply and that is now 0 weeks .
neutral	i was able to sort my issue out through my main provider , however i feel the 0rd_party company should at_least have communicated back to me , at_least for just a follow_up to see how i got on or if the issue still exists .
neutral	waited for over a month to get my phone unlocked , but glad to have it finally confirmed .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	the good :
neutral	it ' s great how they can offer to beat everybody else ' s price by an extra 0 %, that ' s their only forte .
neutral	the bad :
neutral	if you make big order they always take a long time to process it , sometime they don ' t have the stuff in stock and they have to order it and that takes 0 - 0 business days for them to get the order and another 0 - 0 business days for you to get your order ...
neutral	it ' s ridiculous , sometimes you have to wait 0 - 0 weeks for an order .
neutral	and they will ignore any claims you make if any of the items of the shipment was damaged , so if it something broke in your shipment , good luck hearing back from them ...
neutral	i know i didn ' t .
neutral	good service but i ordered an adroid ace and it said on the o0 website i could get bbc_iplayer which was actually incorrect .
neutral	bought a £ 0 , 000 . 00 pc its worth every_penny and im very happy with it , and the time it took to get here was very quick just a shame that i turned it on and it keeps crashing due to the graphics_card being faulty and have to send it .
neutral	just you pay all the money for a pc , and you just want it to work straight off but thats life .
neutral	i found the case , wasnt put_together 000_% properly .
neutral	just shame about the customer_service , wasnt very helpful when telling_me what the problem was and wanting to do everything by email instead of the phone .
neutral	my pc dont work how can i send emails ... phone would be 00x better :/
neutral	great place , in good spot with nice night club , everyone seen friendly , cheap would be wonderful if the materass were bit more comfortable anyway i will suggest to anyone
neutral	the webpage is easy to use and great for any given occasion .
neutral	from the first moment you start to build your shopping_cart everything is simple .
neutral	the follow - up emails that i received with a little sense of humor were a nice_touch even when there are so many of them .
neutral	at one point i received three 00_%_discount emails for the same order .
neutral	the only one and huge problem is the product itself .
neutral	not only did i order a beautiful mix of flowers that looked awesome on your webpage but i order the deluxe version .
neutral	and what i find out is that the person who received the flowers was delivered the vase the flowers and the balloon all separate and also there were just a handful of flowers .
neutral	everything from the logistics planning to the customer_service follow - up are great ways to satisfy the customer , but if your product doesn ' t at_least fulfill your customer ' s expectations then the service as a hole will be lousy .
neutral	orange customer_services is decent .
neutral	you don ' t have to wait forever to get through to a human and they are always very chirpy and helpful .
neutral	when i had to call for a replacement phone in the past , i found them to be quite rude , in terms of asking if i usually allowed a three year_old to put my belongings down the loo and suggested that i should have been supervising them better .
neutral	this was the only time i have ever felt quite angry with them but , as with most companies , if they are taking your money they are excellent , as soon as you owe them money or you want something from them they become quite rude !
neutral	they are better_than many providers ( i . e 0 ) but probably not the best out there , i think i stay with them out of habit , more_than because i get a brilliant deal with my contract .
neutral	my friends are staggered that i pay over £_00 pm and only receive free texts and my handset isn ' t all that either ( which i ' m stuck with for 00 mths !
neutral	).
neutral	been using them for years , loved the price_match guarantee , but on my last purchase they didn ' t accept the price_match and decided to charge me more .
neutral	be wary , i ' ll probably cancel my order and order it from the other source who is cheaper .
neutral	the delivery for boohoo has been great ( ordered twice ).
neutral	however the quality of the items is left to be desired .
neutral	they are quite cheap but the first item i ordered ( a white quilted jacket ) had black dots randomly on it .
neutral	i never returned it because it seemed like hassle but now i never order clothes and warn_people if they are contemplating it .
neutral	i bought some shoes and they ' re good quality but again unfortunately had a few random marks .
neutral	this means i won ' t be ordering items form here often .
neutral	with my most_recent order , i selected next_day delivery because i really needed it today , but it didn ' t arrive .
neutral	it wasn ' t a problem with the courier either ; i checked the bp website and they said it still hadn ' t dispatched more_than 00_hours_later even_though it ' s supposed to be guaranteed same day dispatch .
neutral	so be warned ; you may have to wait longer for your order than you ' ve been told .
neutral	that said , the products are generally good value for money .
neutral	i just wish they would expand their range a bit .
neutral	some nitrite - free beef jerky would definitely make me a customer for life :)
neutral	i order bed and mattress , i get the mattress without the bed ... and they promising delivery of the product in 00_hours ..
neutral	still they have in stock those beds and keep selling them and i waiting for my bed 000 hours and on the order tracking says - awaiting shipping and nobody telling_me when i get my order , nobody answering the phone , and on my emails just a reply with working hours , it was my last time when i buy something from world stores
neutral	if they don ' t care about the clients it should be your last place for shopping
neutral	finally i get my bed :)
neutral	the website was quick and easy to use , the main thing that let my experience with double0_tickets down was that the tickets did not arrive until very last_minute and i found myself on the phone to them various times having to try and trace where my tickets were to ensure they would arrive in time .
neutral	i found the customer_service quite poor as the woman seemed vey unsure and gave me false information about when i would receive the tickets .
neutral	she also seemed very against the idea of changing the address to that on my hotel so that i would definitely have the tickets in time , as this may have caused more hassle for her .
neutral	saying this , i have finally got my tickets today in special delivery but any later then i would have been unable to go to the concert which i payed just under £_000 for .
neutral	the only good thing is that it `_s cheap .
neutral	the seats on the plains sometimes smell .
neutral	still better_than ryanair though .
neutral	dan
neutral	the site is fairly easy to use , better_than all these so called ' chep flight ' sites that just send you to easyjet or ryan_air ' s websites .
neutral	jst be_careful about the baggage_allowance , insurance , car_hire etc they try to sell you along the way .
neutral	international services definitely requires improvement .
neutral	prices need to bejustified
neutral	a group of 00 lads on stag wanting to have a good time !
neutral	having shelled out all that money , we would have expected more !
neutral	chilli_sauce did not have to do any of the leg work as we told them what we wanted , thye priced it up and we went with it .
neutral	not a good experience , will not book again and will tell friends and family not to book with cs either , suggest trying red seven ( sufficient good experience )
neutral	i like itunes but it has got very expensive .
neutral	i recently ordered a brake roller repair kit and a custom designed poster .
neutral	the poster was designed and a proof sent for my approval within hours and the design was perfect first time .
neutral	the only thing that let the order down was that the repair kit and poster were send in the same parcel and due to the weight of the repair kit the poster arrived with several creases in it and doesn ' t look 000_%.
neutral	for the price i would have expected it to arrive in a cardboard tube at_least .
neutral	i found it dissapointing that i could not get a sample on the internet before ordering .
neutral	when i phoned to find out about it i got told different reasons .
neutral	the first time they were going to send me a copy for free .
neutral	then the second time i phoned because via e . mail they were unwilling to send me one , the person i spoke to was quite rude and told me a different_story to the first person i spoke to .
neutral	the only reason i ordered from this website is because i can not find the same invitations anywhere_else but i wont be using the website again .
neutral	the poor website design hampers the experience of shopping on this site .
neutral	i used to shop from here regularly but the website re - design over the past_year or so makes the experience frustrating .
neutral	i ordered home mobile_broadband with the 00day rolling_contract but the process was far from smooth .
neutral	it took multiple phone_calls with different advisors to get my order processed and neither advisor was clear about the pricing of the package .
neutral	i had one salesman continuously try to sell me additional sim_card which would save me some money - but i had to repeat that i did not want this and wanted the mobile_broadband only .
neutral	the actual service has been good so far but getting there was a pain to say the least .
neutral	the actual product and delivery were good and on time but i had problems placing my order .
neutral	my first attempt resulted_in an_email and a text the following_day saying there was an issue with the order , after being on hold for about 00mins i finally got through only to be told that there was a problem with my payment and i would have to place another order .
neutral	it would have been much more efficient had they just said this in the email to begin with .
neutral	after figuring_out my billing_address was incorrect on my saveonlaptops account i went to change it only to find there was no option to do this on the website .
neutral	the account management tool on the website is very poor and i was forced to create a new account again to place the order .
neutral	i feel that an improvement to the website and the way in which order problems are communicated would be very beneficial for future customers .
neutral	prices on products are great but the shipping is pretty high .
neutral	i can usually make out cheaper on large purchases from supplementwarehouse . com , but the discounts are not enough on small orders .
neutral	well_organised , user_friendly and reasonably_priced will be taking a look at other courses on offer staff always available to help .
neutral	hat the hidden_costs , but still the cheapest !
neutral	et très bon tarifs .
neutral	mais la prestation en a été autrement .
neutral	la voiture , louée via hertz , était dans un état déplorable , sale et avec_des détritus a l ' arrière .
neutral	peu satisfaisant .
neutral	i recently went to tenerife with a friend and the company gave me all i needed for a cheap flight and cheap accommodation .
neutral	however , when we arrived in playa las americas the hotel had no_idea who we were and was unaware of any booking ...
neutral	bearing in mind we arrived at nearly 00pm so it was nearly the end of our night and we had nowehere to stay .
neutral	luckily the hotel staff were very helpful and we were transferred to a much_nicer , larger hotel for free ...
neutral	result !
neutral	i love the speed in which you can order things from next .
neutral	i hate the way they automatically gave me a next store card .
neutral	i did not want a store card and yet i couldn ' t pay for my things until a month later when my store card statement arrived .
neutral	really annoying .
neutral	some of the palest foundations were still very orange and muddy looking
neutral	my name was spelt wrong on the cheque so had to he sent back therefore delaying cashing of the cheque
neutral	overall prices are higher then competitors .
neutral	however - worth to check for offers .
neutral	especially with discount coupons .
neutral	great delivery service .
neutral	finally received my order after 00 working_days .
neutral	happy .
neutral	apologies for the previous comments . make correction that the delivery may take up to 0 month or more to make people aware . i bought different argain oil , but will be keeping this from wowcher us well .
neutral	their website just isn ' t very well_done , its often tedious to find things , and it takes a long time to add things to cart .
neutral	also , their shipping_costs are outrageous .
neutral	however , they have phenomenal deals on products that keep me coming_back for more .
neutral	flowers where a gift to my nan for her_birthday and she loved them along with the little cake we included however they where delivered a day earlier_than requested when we kne she would not be in so nan had to go and collect them herself which wasn ' t great .
neutral	too expensive , and can not cancel the order before wtf
neutral	had a text_message_saying funds had been transferred , nothing has arrived in my account !
neutral	now thinking cashgenie will still try and take the repayment even_though i didn ' t recieve the loan .
neutral	i would still use the online shopping service provided but am aware of possible occasional disappointment .
neutral	usrd this co a few_times and helped_me out when needed .
neutral	horse - lovely
neutral	zebra - amazing
neutral	ostrich burger - so tasty
neutral	ostrich steak - they didn ' t send any :( and all they would do is put a credit on my account but i ' ll never order again and i feel ripped_off .
neutral	thought the prices were steep !
neutral	paid 0x the face_value without knowing until the tickets arrived .
neutral	im sure the event will be great but i probably wouldnt use again .
neutral	dont like to be ripped_off .
neutral	upgrade nag screens ruin my experience of bd .
neutral	you have no business spamming me like that - as a result i will not be renewing .
neutral	the prices are good compared to other_places , but what is wrong with there delivery options ?!
neutral	i ordered a in - stock rat 0 mouse , delivery was expected after 00 - 00 working_days !
neutral	ridiculous_amount of time required !
neutral	overall , i would recommend that you try them out at_least once for the good range of flavours they have - which was my primary reason for using them .
neutral	just allow a few extra days for delivery and hope that you ordered a good flavour :)
neutral	i will most_likely use them again thanks to some of their prices and range of flavours , just hope next time the flavours i choose taste more like they should be ;)
neutral	i used twice the service of booking . com and from customers point of view all was good .
neutral	however after_speaking with couple of friends working in hotels , i got a different perspective of booking . com methods , that are very aggressive , particularly against small independent hotels .
neutral	a huge_range of products available but no depth of customer_service ; the whole experience feels very impersonal .
neutral	no_frills , cheap flights to european destinations .
neutral	when price is more important than luxury .
neutral	i ordered £_000 worth of pc parts to build a pc from aria as i found their site yet again very easy to use as i have the last 0 or 0 times i have bought products from them .
neutral	i have never had an issue with the website , delivery of the items or the items that were delivered ( i . e .
neutral	no faults ).
neutral	unfortunately i was given a fan which had a fault with one of the wires into the connector .
neutral	i thought that i would call their customer_service to thought things out , only to hear that you can ' t return items over the phone .
neutral	i thought this was rather peculiar and questioned further about the return of the item .
neutral	i was told i would have to pay for the item to be sent back unless i wanted to come into the store , but before 0pm .
neutral	i thought this was strange again and then discovered that they are allowed 00 days to check for a fault .
neutral	so having received every part for the pc within_00hours of ordering it from the website , i could then potentially be without the faulty part for 0 weeks allowing for delivery .
neutral	i informed aria about the problem through their website and explained i could not afford to send the item back and that coming into the store before 0pm would prove probably too difficult .
neutral	i was immediately sent a code to put on a package to return the item , to then find out that i still had to pay to send that package and i had just received the standard returns and delivery procedure offered by aria .
neutral	i personally believe this has been a poor customer_service and response to a customer who has spent in excess of £ 0000 at aria over the last 00 months all over a £ 0 000mm fan .
neutral	it ' s the first fault i have had with any part yet i believe aria have failed to deal with the problem in an adequate way .
neutral	my friend ordered a part off amazon , it was faulty , they sent him a fresh one out with the return instructions and paid postage included .
neutral	that is the kind of customer_service which is acceptable .
neutral	it didn ' t take 0 weeks until he had a working part , he didn ' t have to call up to be told he had to return it online , he didn ' t have to complain_about their service and he wasn ' t ignored by their customer_service team in addition to not having to pay any return costs despite aria informing_me they could refund any postage for it for up to £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	overall i believe amazon won with their customer_service as well as providing by enlarge lower prices .
neutral	i wonder where i will be tempted to get my pc parts from in the future ...
neutral	have brought from amazon many_times and mostly i find good prices and delivery but have also had some issues in the past when the goods aren ' t shipped by amazon themselves but via other sellers .
neutral	i brought a digital slr camera earlier this year which i didn ' t realise until afterwards was actually being sold by a company in germany via amazon .
neutral	the delivery due date came and went and when i contacted the seller they told me it had been lost in the post and that they would refund me !
neutral	to be fair they refunded me quickly and no harm done but my advice would be to check the good are actually being sold by amazon and not one of their partners .
neutral	also its a shame amazon don ' t pay proper taxes in the uk - will think_twice before making large purchases there again .
neutral	i ordered a nook which i was expecting within a day or two .
neutral	however the stock ran out but staff was corteous enough to call me and let me know and gave me a choice to cancel my order .
neutral	great service , quite fresh and lovely flowers .
neutral	ordered it for my friends birthday and it was a surprise .
neutral	she loved it but when i saw the greeting card i was disappointed .
neutral	instead of nice greeting card which i paid for , it was the free card which was sent to her .
neutral	it was too_late to do anything so i had to just deal with it and say nothing about it .
neutral	i would definitely buy flowers again but would not trust with anything_else .
neutral	groupon do a lot of good deals , offering nice savings on items and days out etc .
neutral	but a lot of their deals ( on physical items especially ) are just over - hyped .
neutral	they say you ' re saving 00_% but in fact if you shop around a bit the saving is more like 00_% or even 0 .
neutral	for example , i bought a hoody for £_00 instead of £_000 .
neutral	so a big saving right ?
neutral	well it turns_out the deal was by a rip - off company who sells at stupid prices .
neutral	i wasnt actually saving any money since i could ' ve got the hoody at the same price from the manufacturer online .
neutral	the occasional gem does pop up so i always visit every day .
neutral	£_00 for a round of golf for two was the best deal ive_seen .
neutral	we bought 0 of those vouchers and saved a good £_00 during the summer golfing season !
neutral	game . co . uk is just ok .
neutral	speedy free delivery on their many products .
neutral	they offer reward_points on purchases which are nice .
neutral	the company also tends to have exclusive offers such as the special ' epic ' edition of gears of war 0 .
neutral	their negatives are :
neutral	0 ) their lack of customer_service ( in my case anyway ).
neutral	i messaged them twice about minor things and they didnt respond .
neutral	this is rather worrying - what if i ever have a real problem ?
neutral	0 ) their prices are normally quite uncompetitive .
neutral	you just can ' t charge £_00 for a game that has been out for over a year !
neutral	0 ) many items such as older games and action figures are out of stock all the time .
neutral	pre_- ordered xbone expecting it to be delivered the day before or at_least at an acceptable time on launch day .... paying close to £ 0 for delivery to have it arrive at nearly 0pm when i could have ordered elsewhere and picked_up at the previous midnight i find dissapointing
neutral	delivery was very quick , although the driver did have to phone my partner to find her address , which spoilt the surprise somewhat - he could have phoned me or just checked google_maps etc ...
neutral	also , the flowers looked fairly tired , which is a shame because at £_00 i ' d have expected better frankly .
neutral	this is the second time i ' ve been disappointed with seranta ; i won ' t be using them again .
neutral	i was happy with the product i purchased but delivery was very slow .
neutral	i personally find the site a nightmare to navigate .
neutral	the search feature is next to useless .
neutral	it ' s easier to use the ' site :' operator on google (" keyword " site : amazon . co . uk )
neutral	the recent ( not that recent ) feature update that allows anyone to sell on amazon also unnerves me a little_bit .
neutral	i use amazon because it is a big company that i can trust and is generally cheap , but i find it miss - leading when amazon is ' displaying ' a product that they do not sell .
neutral	they only get 0_stars because when i do order , it ' s fairly cheap , items usually get dispatched before the expected date , and the free super_saver delivery is actually pretty quick !
neutral	i placed an order on the 00th of december and was promised delivery on the 0rd of january , on the 0nd of january i received an_automated email_saying my delivery date had been changed which annoyed me but i thought because of the busy christmas_period etc this could not be helped so let it go .
neutral	then on the 0th of january i received another automated email_saying they could not deliver again , i thought this was very poor and didn ' t even tell me when my order would be delivered !
neutral	so i emailed customer_service and to be fair the guy who dealt_with my complaint was very professional and explained why my items had been delayed and offered to split my order so i could receive part of my order .
neutral	what annoyed me the most was advertising items on their website which can be delivered by a certain_date but cannot follow this through because the item are not in stock ??
neutral	anyways i ' ve been promised these items tomorrow but we shall see , i doubt ill use g0m again .
neutral	needs to be a better / fairer middle_man .
neutral	fees way too high .
neutral	paypal takes a lot too .
neutral	need a competitor badly .
neutral	will not let you withdraw decimals !
neutral	so winnings were £_000 . 00 .
neutral	wouldn ' t let me withdraw the 00p .
neutral	fix that , and they would be decent .
neutral	had good and bad_experiences with the company .
neutral	when it works , great .
neutral	( slow delivery though )
neutral	main problem is that , twice , i have been sent the wrong product .
neutral	first time , i was sent a fake ' replica ' item .
neutral	did get a refund .
neutral	second item i received a wrong product , it was a bigger version of the one requested .
neutral	customer_service is great .
neutral	however , they have to contact the supplier , so it all takes a lot of time to go through the stages .
neutral	most of the time , saving a few pounds from amazon isn ' t worth it .
neutral	great site , well made .
neutral	however , companies can claim against all reviews that don ' t put an order number !
neutral	seems bonkers as most won ' t take the time to come back to update proof !
neutral	definitely not somewhere i shop often , however was surprised to see how many people actually in the store !
neutral	very busy despite the poor prices on most items .
neutral	well firstly , this was meant to be a supprise , but the delivery failed as no access to the building , i questioned this , as the building is fully staffed from 0am - 0 :_00pm and had a reception with directions to deliver , i was told that the package was mis_- scanned and the driver came back and delivered the parcel within an_hour of my complaint .
neutral	serenataflowers did a great job , flower are lovely and the girl i sent them too really really loves them , however her special supprise was ruined when i was forced to phone her before they eventually arrived to be on the lookout for a package .
neutral	not happy with the delivery company .
neutral	after hearing such positive_reviews about this company i decided to proceed with my order of selling my ipod_nano .
neutral	initial estimate of £_00 seemed very good indeed compared to other 0rd_party companies , however i then received an_email to say that it had ' less_than 0 scratches on the front ' and decreased the value to £_00 . 00 , although still a fair price i accepted , but i know for a sure that the equipment was in pristine_condition when it left , so i would like to know where the ' scratches ' appeared from .
neutral	would i recommend them ... most_likely as it was a smooth_transaction .
neutral	nice pizza , too expensive
neutral	would have been 0_stars but as the database on there side has been down so unable to save my progress .
neutral	all in all a very enjoyable course & will_definately use again in the future ( hope there system comes back online by then !)
neutral	great idea but when withdrawing money you dont get all of it they keep some after advertising on the site it costs notjing as they make their money from advertising which is lies
neutral	the shirts are outstanding , so much so i ' ve purchased 00 of em '.
neutral	the service provided is another issue all together ... no matter what shirt you buy it never seems to be in stock .
neutral	0 weeks appears to be standard for delivery know matter what you want .
neutral	dunno if this is just so that my money is sitting in there account for a while for whatever_reason .
neutral	even if by chance one of your shirts are ready & you happen to have purchased 0 , they will wait_until the other is ready before delivery , coincidently around the 0 week mark .
neutral	also .. they wont inform you of any of this , its not until you loose patience & phone up & ask that you ' ll get any information out of them .
neutral	i ' ve come to the conclusion that there ' s one person out the back making shirts on a loom .
neutral	my record so for is fastest - 0 0 / 0 weeks , slowest - 0 weeks .
neutral	the shirts are fantastic , the rest is just frustrating .
neutral	i find that theres not enough information on what products they regularly sell , only information on the special_offers
neutral	ordered some sunglasses after finding a great deal on groupon ( props to that guys ) on a sunday_night .
neutral	the order processing took a little longer_than_expected which is fair as the deal must be very popular .
neutral	my main problem with my order was that in ups .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they delivered my order to an entirely random address where i don ' t live .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they promised to collect the mis_- routed parcel and delivery to the correct address on the same day ... and didn ' t .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they finally delivered my parcel , but to a neighbour without leaving a card at my address !
neutral	and this was all in the middle of the queen ' s jubilee weekend so my sunglasses will have been floating around some ups van / picking centre for almost a week .
neutral	not good ... but hey , that ' s not sunglasses_shop ' s fault .
neutral	also , the instant message chat help service isn ' t working too well .
neutral	i was passed around 0 separate operators and ended_up giving up and calling to get help when tracking incorrectly delivered order .

neutral	a few hours ago , i purchased two tickets for the kanye west show at hammersmith apollo this sunday ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
neutral	after_reading reviews for viagogo on various websites , i am now close to tears at what seems to be the inevitable prospect of losing a couple of hundred quid .
neutral	i wish i hadn ' t purchased them in the first place .
neutral	after paying £ 0 . 00 for " express delivery ", i assumed i would be receiving the tickets by this friday at the latest .
neutral	however , i ' m now extremely doubtful this will happen .
neutral	the quality of the furniture is fantastic and we love our new dining_set and nest of tables .
neutral	however , the customer_service team are poor .
neutral	i called twice to change the contact phone number , and add an additional mobile number , neither of which were added to the delivery instructions .
neutral	this resulted_in the delivery can waiting outside my house ( due to a cancellation ) and a subsequent voicemail to the original phone number ( which we changed as i don ' t get any signal on my mobile at work ).
neutral	the delivery driver sounded a bit hacked off , but i explained that it was the fault of the customer_services .
neutral	good job the driver hung around until somone was coming to the house .
neutral	my partner wanted some funky patterned wellies for triumphant victory in the schoolyard fashion competition .
neutral	she bought almost exclusively on design ( pattern ) rather_than functionality or price but we were pleasantly_surprised at the price of those she chose in the end .
neutral	delivery was very quick , no_qualms about the service at all , but we can see why they were so cheap .
neutral	the pattern is fine and i ' ve no doubt they ' ll keep her feet dry but they ' re an awful shape .
neutral	loads of ' bagginess ' at the calf that folds when you walk .
neutral	they ' re almost comical .
neutral	it ' s a shame for her as she wanted wellies people would turn to look at , now she ' s panicking that they might do exactly that !
neutral	tip : know what you ' re buying ..!
neutral	!
neutral	oh , and care less what your peers think .
neutral	;)
neutral	id_0000000
neutral	i can not understand how it seems to take so long for the tickets to be dispatched .
neutral	as i know these tickets have been released and people on ebay seem to have them in there hands already .
neutral	i would prefer some update on my order states as the website is crap at this even the track your order page !!
neutral	as reading the reviews below its not looking promising
neutral	to your reply 0 days before the event is taking the mick as i know the person selling the tickets will already have them in they were released months_ago how do i know to trust the person who is selling the tickets , have you not noticed the other reviews you have here stating that people have had problems with getting tickets in the past i do not see many happy customer reviews
neutral	have been using pet_supermarket for a while now and not had any_problems until my last order .
neutral	for some reason our company name was not put onto the box so the delivery company were unable to deliver without speaking to us and rearranging .
neutral	instead of us receiving the food we ordered on the saturday , it was monday before it arrived .
neutral	not a major issue , but one that meant we had to buy food elsewhere to cover the gap .
neutral	prices are not much cheaper_than other_places to be honest .
neutral	probably wont order again .
neutral	liked it , good service
neutral	slow process and still_haven ' t got my cheque after 00 days !
neutral	the items were collected on the 00st_march and still havn ' t had my cheque even_tho they did email me on the 00th_april saying it will be with me the next working day - that was a week_ago and no sign of it .
neutral	they also state there processing time is 00 days , it has been 00 !
neutral	i have no emailed them asking if my cheque may of been lost and waiting for a reply
neutral	if they do finally pay up i will have no problem with the delay as i am in no rush for the money , but there website should state that the payment can take up to a month !
neutral	i first purchased a 0000 rolex sub from watchfinder in may 0000 but not quite happy with the watch ( even_though this does not reflect on the fine service provided by tommor holland initially ) i continued searching watchfinder web_site and up came a 0000 sub which was my sons birth year . having made enquiries about part ex the 0000 sub with the 0000 with sam beer a deal was struck and i sent off my watch to watchfinder . a couple of days_later i recieved a call from jonathan brett saying i had to pay an extra £_000_pounds due to the watch having a small chip on the glass , now this is the problem . this chip was already on the watch when i recieved it ( in the 0 weeks of owing the watch it has been stored well and only worn twice ) thinking that due to the cheap price this is what you obviously get , obviously this was missed before sending out to me or some member of staff is telling porkie pies .
neutral	my 0000 sub is great but i feel that watchfinder have squeezed an extra £_000 from myself and that has left me with a slight bad taste !!
neutral	!
neutral	ok so i loved sky go when it came out and the recording aspect .
neutral	problem is that sky is far too expensive for what it is .
neutral	the films are 0 - 0 years old unless you want to pay for box office .
neutral	the other channels just don ' t float the boat , 000 channels and nothing on .
neutral	the only thing i now watch is the footie 0 - 0 times per_month , so i ' ll be off down the pub and will get properly oiled on the £_00 i give to sky .
neutral	some pretty good prices , but hate that you have to sign_up with a paypal account .
neutral	i received the printer i ordered promptly , although a kind neighbour came to my door to inform me that it had arrived there the day before .
neutral	i hadn ' t met my neighbour before , so it was a good job she was honest , otherwise i may never have seen my printer !
neutral	the printer works_fine , and so far i haven ' t had to sample the aftersales service .
neutral	i ordered 0 chairs and 0 desks .
neutral	my email to ask for delivery date was not replied .
neutral	and no one contacted me for delivery of chairs in_advance .
neutral	however , i was contacted in_advance for the separate delivery of 0 desks .
neutral	although it was confirmed that the delivery would be in morning , the lorry didn ' t appear in morning .
neutral	when i called the company , i was told that it will be delivered in late_afternoon .
neutral	close to 0pm , i called again and was told to wait for call back .
neutral	no one called back and the desks were not delivered either .
neutral	in the following_day , the lorry turned_up unexpectedly .
neutral	the problem to me is some extra days off work to wait for the deliveries .
neutral	then i found that the desk size was not what i expected .
neutral	i checked the invoice , and it is very likely my mistake .
neutral	so i asked to return the desks .
neutral	i was told to pay £_00 +_vat for returning the desks , which in my opinion is quite expensive for £_00 +_vat desk .
neutral	as i ' m putting in a replacement order , so the collection can be done with new delivery .
neutral	so i asked whether the costs can be reduced .
neutral	i was told they will still charge the same amount .
neutral	this policy is not totally unreasonable but could be more considerate to customers .
neutral	used to because the portion sizes are shrinking , but the meal prices are increasing .
neutral	nevertheless , still amazing food
neutral	good but a bit_pricey and delivery wasn ' t rapid .
neutral	order clothes that came very quick ( ordered on sunday they came tuesday ).
neutral	one item was missing ... when i put the order in it said low stock ... and the item did not arrive , so i worked out they didn ' t send it and lucky refunded me for the item without having to ask .
neutral	failed to inform me that they were not going to send that one item .
neutral	i will use them again .
neutral	good website .
neutral	bought a bra , and only after paying was i informed they didn ' t have it in stock .
neutral	disappointing having to wait so long for it , as i wouldn ' t have ordered it if i ' d known it was out of stock
neutral	i should start by saying that the laptop i ordered , was itself fantastic and in perfect working order .
neutral	however , for a 0 - 0 day build , it took 00 days for me to receive it , over twice the expected when you factor in shipping .
neutral	on top of the late delivery , the mouse i ordered was not included nor was any explanation as to why it wasn ' t included , i was forced to call their support_team myself and enquire , only to be told that they were awaiting stock and then that the mouse i had ordered had been_discontinued .
neutral	arrangements should have been made to inform me that this was the case .
neutral	that being said , the people themselves were very pleasant and not at all defensive .
neutral	the matter was resolved swiftly and with no hassle , although i did have to wait for a while before my call was answered .
neutral	haivng had two parcels from amazon recently dropped over the back fence , the second lanfding in the snow and being left for the weekend by initial review would be much lower .
neutral	( amazon replaced the damaged goods without any fuss - proves how cheap hdnl must be !)
neutral	however since my partner caught one of the drivers and had a discussion they have since started leaving our parcels with neighbours .
neutral	i aplaude the thinking that leaving the parcel in a secure place would be helpful and they didn ' t leave it in plain sight , but sadly this was let_down by the fact they could no see over the fence and obviously had no consideration for the contents of the parcels .
neutral	whilst they continue to undercut the post_office amazon will still be using them so the problems will_continue .
neutral	my advice - help the drivers apply some common_sense and ask for parcels to be left with a neighbour .
neutral	they paid out for all of my items that i sent , which i was happy with .
neutral	however the courier didn ' t turn_up on the day they were supposed to after waiting from 0am_till_0pm .
neutral	i emailed to ask why they had n ' t arrived .
neutral	that worked and they came few hours_later .
neutral	when they turned_up i said i thought she was coming the day before she just shrugged .
neutral	the process of the stuff getting there , being_processed and sending the check is fast approaching a month and am still_waiting .
neutral	having used chilli - sauce for my hen_weekend last_year with some minor hiccups ; ( chilli - sauce didn ' t confirm go_karting numbers until last_minute even_though provisionally booked 0 months prior , so indoor go - karting became out - door as not enough karts at completely_different venue , * however they apologised and compensated ) i recommended them to a friend .
neutral	when my friend booked with chilli - sauce she specifically requested the ibis hotel at explore lane bristol and we ' d stayed there on mine and loved how close it was to prism which was in our event .
neutral	however around 0 weeks prior we ' d discovered the ' rep ' had booked the ibis hotel at temple - meads .
neutral	the rep wouldn ' t except responsibility and was adamant the hen didn ' t request explore lane when we were all there that day and know she did .
neutral	we ended_up having to go to the travel lodge hotel instead which alright was only 0 minutes walk extra but the stress would ' ve been easily avoided if communication would ' ve been sent via_email soon as it was booked .
neutral	overall they did ' good '
neutral	placed an order with garden best buys .
neutral	over a week_later , i ' d had no communication from them ( apart_from a ' rate your experience ' email , ironically ).
neutral	i emailed to ask if my order had been dispatched , and when i might expect to receive it .
neutral	only then was i informed that the item was out of stock , and offered a refund .
neutral	in fairness , the customer_service was good once i got in touch , and the refund was given immediately .
neutral	but the fact that the plant was out of stock , and i received no notification until i chased the order was disappointing .
neutral	all my friends and i had heard of gak , so when i said i ' d been ordering my next guitar from there , it was no big deal .
neutral	i placed my order and got my confirmation e_- mail , and my account was debited .
neutral	the next e_- mail i received was completely unexpected , it was telling_me that , even_though the product was listed on the site , even_though they ' d let me place my order , even_though there was no indication that the product was out of stock , it was in fact , out of stock .
neutral	not only this , but it wouldn ' t be in stock until 0000 .
neutral	i needed it in time for xmas .
neutral	so i accepted this , these things_happen .
neutral	but then it suddenly occurred to me , that now i needed to wait for my refund to come through before i could buy a replacement .
neutral	in no way am i blaming gak for the time it took for the refund to come through , i know there is multiple factors that can contribute to a few_days delay in refund , but the fact is this delay could have been avoided had gak not falsely advertised a product on their site .
neutral	the site should indicate beside the product that it is out of stock but i ' ll receive it in the next delivery and when that delivery is .
neutral	i essentially paid for a promise , the promise that one day , i would receive my guitar , but not any time soon .
neutral	i have always used gak as a sort of catalogue for products , whenever i ' m in the market for a new musical instrument i look on there , because it has literally everything .
neutral	now i understand , they don ' t actually have all those products , they just have the ability to order them in one day if you happen to be foolish enough to order it without ringing them first .
neutral	so my negative_review is based on gaks misleading website .
neutral	i could have rated it lower but i do believe i may use gak again , but i will 000_% phone or e_- mail first to check the availability of the item i require .
neutral	the prices are sometimes cheaper_than elsewhere but can cause hassle , shipping times can be good or very poor .
neutral	i found that i couldn ' t save items to my basket which was so annoying when i wanted to order something later , also i believe they don ' t have a paypal option which causes hassle and made me feel unsafe .
neutral	the site itself is a good idea and reasonably easy to navigate after a while however the constant changes with lack of respect for what the users want is disgraceful .
neutral	especially with the new ' timeline ' major changes that affect the users are forced upon them and make the site confusing and annoying however it is still a good place to connect to friends you can ' t see in person a lot .
neutral	although the website is a little hard to navigate and the pictures are not the best quality the clothing and items are very nice when received .
neutral	my order was a little delayed however nothing major .
neutral	some of the sizing can come up a little weird ( ever when measured by their size guide ) however the quality is good .
neutral	i had published my review about the company called roompaddy about tricking their customers in booking a room to rent which doesn ’ t exist and then charge full sum of money from their accounts in_advance without them even knowing about it , then refuse to refund it trying to buy the time for the money to sit on their accounts .
neutral	i wrote a short review which soon was removed because roompaddy made a complaint about it .
neutral	a couple of days_later i have received an_email from <_private data_removed > asking to provide some proof that transaction has taken place and only then to reinstate my review .
neutral	i have provided the required documents without delay , but my review was not published and <_private data_removed > requested to modify my review because he said there was not enough information about the whole_process between me and roompaddy .
neutral	i have explained that my review was genuine and it reflected my experience showing how i felt about it .
neutral	but <_private data_removed > still insisted that review should have been modified promising to publish my review as soon as i do it .
neutral	soon after i have modified my old review and put more information into it .
neutral	but <_private data_removed > did not keep his promises and made an unbelievable third request to modify my review stating that “ scam ” is a swear word .
neutral	i could not believe such ridiculous statement made by <_private data_removed > and was appalled by his unhealthy interest to keep my genuine review out , hassling me with his emails with overwhelming demands , making false_promises he did not keep .
neutral	now i can see that other people had the same experience as me and managed to post their comment .
neutral	my review however has never been approved by <_private data_removed >.
neutral	london is famous as the place for knowledge since ages and there are hundreds of colleges and universities to serve the world and nation .
neutral	we are proud to be the citizens of this historic city of uk .
neutral	wanneer je het product zelf komt halen moet je zo lang wachten .
neutral	jammer dat deze shop al enige zoveel heeft dus wachten moet dan maar .
neutral	easy to book , pleasant staff and on - time flights .
neutral	just unfortunate , that they feel it is acceptable to charge for pre_- booking seats .
neutral	some stuffs can be really cheap
neutral	too expensive though
neutral	it ' s a good site for doing bookings , but many people use only for control clients telephone_numbers .
neutral	this is my first time using hostelbookers since 0000 .
neutral	the last time i used them was on a rtw trip during which , on more_than one_occasion i have arrived at a hostel with my hostelbookers reservation email , and the hostel has had no confirmation of the booking so rooms were not available or suitable , or in the worst situation we were charged the rack rate when it should have been the rate advertised .
neutral	i hope things have improved since then .
neutral	i can ' t really complain .
neutral	it arrived and was a good price compared to elsewhere .
neutral	however , it arrived 0 week_later than_expected due to it being out of stock ( i found this out by phoning up , but when i ordered and even when i spoke on the phone , it said it was in stock on their website ).
neutral	the other annoying thing is , i only received one email to confirm my order but then nothing from them on .
neutral	i had to constantly login to access the status of my order and the messages that had supposedly been sent to my email regarding the dispatch of my order , definitely weren ' t sent !!
neutral	anyway , like i say , it arrived and i ' m happy about that .
neutral	i think i probably would use again , but only if the price of any product i ' m wishing to buy is significantly_cheaper_than elsewhere , otherwise it ' s not worth the hassle .
neutral	but i also want to point out that this was just my experience and i ' m sharing it , however , there are probably people who had better experience and no doubt people who had worse , so you just have to take the majority i guess .
neutral	i bought the experience for " afternoon_tea at kensington palace " and found that :
neutral	a ) they send you a voucher in the post , which may take up to 0 days .
neutral	so if you are looking for something last_minute , do not buy from lastminute . com .
neutral	b ) the price " on the door " is actually cheaper_than buying with lastminute . com .
neutral	you also have more choice if you pay " on the door " as there are numerous different_types of tickets , and afternoon teas .
neutral	the experience itself was great , but i would not buy from lastminute . com again .
neutral	mixed feelings .
neutral	i was very excited once i ordered my tag_heuer 0000 because i have always been a huge_fan of tag_heuer .
neutral	after waiting from the 00th of february until the 0st of april the glasses finally arrived .
neutral	unfortunatly they were the wrong ones whoch looked completely_different to what i had ordered .
neutral	so i sent them back .
neutral	then a few_days_later i got an_email_confirming they had receved them and were sorting_out the lenses .
neutral	after those 0 days of sorting_out the lenses they had sent them off .
neutral	to my suprise they had sent them to the wrong part of the country despite having my adress .
neutral	after having the glasses sent back to them so they could send them off to the right person they finally got hear on the 0th of may .
neutral	i am extremely pleased with my glasses but as much as i love the product i would not take the risk going back .
neutral	overall thank_you very much and great email co - operation and friendly staff who are very useful .
neutral	i ' m happy with this site
neutral	have been on ebay for nearly 00 years , and live by it .
neutral	only slight_issue these days is that buyers seem to be under the impression that they don ' t have to pay if they win .
neutral	ebay always swing into sort , but it does create extra hassle and is putting me off selling that often on there .
neutral	i have been customer to this company for years although their prices are good i have to admit their cigs is useless
neutral	the service was average .
neutral	arrival - we travelled late arriving in turkey in the evening and had to wait the best part of an_hour for other passengers to arrive from their flight .
neutral	although the resort_hoppa representative was very friendly , we were extremely tired and had no real explanation of how much time we might have to wait .
neutral	departure - the app that we were told to download didn ' t allow us to find out our pick_up time , so i had to call them .
neutral	this was very tricky because the turkish representatives spoke little english and so i had to ask our hotel reception staff to speak with them for us .
neutral	all of this was pretty stressful at the end of our holiday , as we were panicking that we may need to arrange alternative transport .
neutral	booked a webmaster package for £_00 to help set_up and run my own business .
neutral	found the html and php sql training very useful .
neutral	the learning style did take me a while to get into but once i got it the course was quite addictive and i spent hours on it .
neutral	i then purchased their key 0000 skills course for the adobe dreamweaver package but found this completely_different , the style of learning was different and hard for me to follow .
neutral	they should follow the same training structure throughout all their courses as the video based stuff isn ’ t as good as the interactive courses .
neutral	emma was very helpful on chat today .
neutral	i use them about for 00 parcels a week , within 0 years i have only have about 0 minor hiccups and 0 parcels gone_missing , but again it ' s from about 000 parcels .
neutral	i definitely do not like the way how they scare you with insurance .
neutral	i understand it is where they make their money , but is not ethical to do it on our fear .
neutral	reasonable insurance / industry standard is more about 0 %, but they have it about 0 . 0 % from content value .
neutral	that insurance factor is the only reason they get 0 / 0 , otherwise it would be 0 . 0 / 0
neutral	oh_yeah .... it is somewhat hard to connect to customer_service chat .
neutral	the worst experience regarding delivery services !
neutral	still i gave it 0_stars due to a good soul working at the depot who did everything he could to sort out my problem .
neutral	monday_morning got a text_saying " your parcel will be with you today " as i was on my way to work , called in sick and ran home .
neutral	and waited , waited and waited , at 0pm decided to check the website and track my order , when to my surprise it says " your parcel was sent back as it was a duplicate order " huh_?
neutral	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn ' t think too much about it .
neutral	0 :_00pm came by and i finally decided to call a customer_service number i found online .
neutral	she then tells_me that i wasn ' t at home when the driver stopped by ...
neutral	what ?????
neutral	that ' s a lie !
neutral	have been on the sofa watching stupid tv_shows all day long waiting for the driver , he never came !!!!
neutral	she then checked the gps and it was confirmed that the driver had been nowhere_near my place .
neutral	she then tried to contact the driver unsuccessfully + the depot also unsuccessfully .
neutral	its now 0 : 00 and she tells_me she finishes at 0 and as she cant get thru the driver nor the depot i ' ll have to call back in the morning !
neutral	hahahaha you gotta be joking , keep trying !!!
neutral	i didn ' t miss work for nothing !
neutral	at 0 . 00 , after being on hold she finally manage to get thru to the depot and came up with a ridiculous story saying the driver had gone to the wrong_address and the person at that address had said they ' d already got their item .
neutral	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
neutral	i now had to call currys to sort out this issue in order for them to re - deliver my parcel and as they refused to allocate me a time_slot i then arranged for thursday .
neutral	thursday 0pm , still no parcel , i called customer_services again and to my surprise there is no record on the system regarding my parcel .
neutral	i called the depot and its is confirmed that my parcel hasn ' t been dispatched and also that they don ' t know where it is .... is this for real ???
neutral	i lost my temper and had a go at the person talking to me .
neutral	mr kwame then after apologizing a million times said he will find it and sort it out .
neutral	0 hours_later he called me back , he had located my parcel and was gonna send it to my house .
neutral	it arrived at 0pm .
neutral	thanks to mr kwame i didn ' t have to waste another day waiting for nothing .
neutral	everybody else i spoke with were useless , specially customer_service , if they can be called that .
neutral	by choice i ' ll never use them again .
neutral	i dont like how there isnt any paypal option to pay .
neutral	good variety of restaurants available on the site , with some new entries that i can ' t find on any of their competitors ' websites .
neutral	nothing special about the website as a whole .
neutral	they do offer some form of customer_service ( which i haven ' t tried ), but they take no responsibility for actually getting the food out to you .
neutral	can ' t see the functionality to store favourites , card_details , etc_., which would be good for repeat orders .
neutral	worth a visit though .
neutral	it has everything you need from asda , all your shopping needs for your everyday need .
neutral	though i have to admit i find the site a little time_consuming , and to be honest i do prefer to shop in - store , theres a little less choice in - store but your in and out in a time scale you want and you can pick the fresher packs .
neutral	i use game to purchase all my games for xbox wii etc ..
neutral	just a little disappointed that they are struggling and are closing most of there stores down .
neutral	i don ' t even know where my nearest store is anymore
neutral	over the recent months i have started to see the customer_services slip in my local_stores ; not to mention that the prices are creeping up and are become less competitive with other out lets .
neutral	because of this it means i have been looking elsewhere for my items and to be honest finding them cheaper and with better customer_service .
neutral	i am just generally un - happy with the overall service and value i now get from argos .
neutral	hi , i received the outfit reasonably quickly but when it arrived i noticed the dress had a hole on the seam .
neutral	i decided to not send the outfit back for an exchange as i was unsure if i would receive the replacement in time for when i needed it .
neutral	i do not fault the service and delivery but disappointing that the outfit was faulty when it arrived .
neutral	lynsey thomas
neutral	my first purchase was a black knitted dress from the site , the dress came in the post in a couple of days , very good delivery service !
neutral	however when i opended the parcel the dress was crumpled up in a plastic_bag inside and the material felt very cheap !
neutral	the fit was not very flattering and i felt that i could have bought the dress much cheaper with a better quality at a shop like primark !
neutral	the hasstle of returning the package to a collection shop and filling in the forms meant that i have ended_up keeping it !
neutral	i think the return_policy should be longer .
neutral	i would be wary of purchasing from the site again as my dress looked a lot better on the site , and for a garment that is so simple to get right i would be afraid to get anything_else !
neutral	the clothing on the site is quality and the pricing is reasonable enough .
neutral	however after recieving the wrong_size item i sent it back at my own_expense and was told to wait a maximum of 00 days to be processed .
neutral	it was processed on the 00th day and i was told the correct_size would be sent out as soon as possible .
neutral	00 days_later and still no sign of it in the post .
neutral	i have used the site before without any_problems but since this i have realised that their returns_policy is a joke .
neutral	has highly put me off using them again .
neutral	i have purchased from here a few_times for e_- cig liquids .
neutral	they are ok but i have had a few batches that didn ' t taste right .
neutral	i always order the same liquid but it ' s just not a consistent flavour .
neutral	the last one i purchased was so sweet it made me feel sick and has put me off .
neutral	i received my package on time however the packaging for the fragrance i bought was partially opened , wrinkled and damaged .
neutral	the item was bought as a present to someone_else , which makes it even more disappointing .
neutral	we have been dealing_with mdp for around 0 years and we have experienced many issues with them over the years .
neutral	mainly down to incorrect orders unfortunately .. often the products are wrong , aren ' t included , wrong sizes etc ..
neutral	but i do have to say they always sort the problems quickly and at their own cost .
neutral	parcels often arrive damaged , which you could put down to the delivery company or the thin boxes that are used .
neutral	we have tried to find other_companies who have an order process as easy as theirs but nothing compares at all ( including on price ) so we just stick with them and deal with the mistakes .
neutral	let me say before starting this review .
neutral	shop - to . net are still one of the best websites for buying your video_games from .
neutral	they are very hard to beat but .....
neutral	i have been using shop - to . net for over 0 - 0 years now and have a great knowledge understanding on how they work .
neutral	over the years with the growing population the service has suffered in my option .
neutral	for example .
neutral	i used to pre_- order games a lot from the site .
neutral	never would a game be processing over night .
neutral	it would always be dispatched the same day as processing .
neutral	to this day i don ' t understand_why games are being process overnight as no one is in the offices or warehouse !
neutral	since the website was updated ( sorry i cant remember when the update happen ).
neutral	it is really difficult to use and i find really confusing .
neutral	it never seems to load very well , even waiting over a minute sometimes for it to load a page of 00 games .
neutral	the forums were taking away and have never been replaced .
neutral	i used found them extremely_helpful .
neutral	even little matters i had , i could always ask the forum for help .
neutral	the forum moderators were fantastic .
neutral	but now gone .
neutral	i could go on but will stop here .
neutral	if you are new to shop - to . net it is one of the best game buying websites around and are hard to beat .
neutral	for me as a long time user i feel the standers have slipped .
neutral	i made mistake on tickets listing , i have pdf tickets , not a paper tickets , but listed as paper tickets .
neutral	tickets are sold , now i am asking what to do ?
neutral	sent printouts to buyer ?
neutral	and who can guarantee , that the printouts will not be multiplied , i will get my money ?
neutral	transaction_id_0000000
neutral	quick delivery really good service and simple to use
neutral	the prince0 foundation and practitioner course was good , although a bit too formal in its language and tone for my taste ( more practical examples would have provided more insight ).
neutral	the course is thorough and is logically structured .
neutral	i ' m sure the people behind it have given the material and the way it ' s presented a lot of thought .
neutral	the team behind e_- careers were helpful and accessible at all times by chat and e_- mail .
neutral	i did find , however , that the course itself came with a lot of non - mandatory , but highly_recommended extra - costs , such as buying a manual and exams .
neutral	this was , however , stated beforehand , but people need to be very aware of this when buying the course out of own pockets .
neutral	all in all , i found that the course was worth - while , although - for me personally - not as learning as a face - to - face course where the tone is more informal and questions are easier to ask in person .
neutral	the initial flights are reasonable but no better_than other budget_airlines however the hidden_charges are far worse in my opinion .
neutral	charges for a bag , check in online dont checkin online .
neutral	the comfort of the flights i have taken has generally been ok .
neutral	pre orded ps0 console in plenty of time to get on release day as surprise gift for husband .
neutral	then was going to leave it up to him to buy games as i cannot_afford them as well .
neutral	then a few weeks before launch ( when to late to pre order from anywhere_else ) was then advised that to be able to get order i would havd to change to a package including an extra controller which he would never use for extra £_00 .
neutral	ish or game and controller for extra £_000 . 00 ish .
neutral	so i had to ruin the surprise to be able to borrow money off husband and know what game to get .
neutral	felt bullied into buyinv more_than i wanted .
neutral	negative_feedback from my friends made me a stay_away from amazon , but the positive_feedback i read from forums made me write this comment .
neutral	i want to buy a watch from amazon but i am a little_bit_unsure_about the risks involved , like limited support from amazon or from third_party sellers .
neutral	anyhow , i will have to decide first .
neutral	good points : woolworths seems to attract you in as if there is something you think you may need or you may have actully thought it never had it
neutral	bad points : woolworths never seems to be open and all the shelves look bare these days .
neutral	low qualiy rubbish if it was their own_brand stuff especially tools
neutral	general comments : a fantastic shop with nothing that i ever feel worth buying
neutral	vistaprint is a useful site for me as a budding avon rep whose hands cramp something chronic after writing out my information 000 times on the order forms .
neutral	i have been able to pick_up a rubber stamp at a reasonable_price , and was lucky_enough to catch the free postage offer this time around .
neutral	i do rather object to the almost constant emails i have been receiving , however .
neutral	vistaprint , i will buy what i want when i want and need it , i do not need to be showered with emails about " special_offers just for you !!!
neutral	", which nine times out of ten are entirely irrelevant to me .
neutral	i will keep shopping there , because the products i have received * have * been of good quality ( and i really do need the stamps !).
neutral	i will be attempting business_cards next .
neutral	all - in - all , if you can handle getting a plethora of emails a couple of times a week , vistaprint are a good place to pick things up from .
neutral	i have used glasses_direct before and am always over the moon with the glasses i receive .
neutral	last time i ordered from them last_year there was an issue regarding the ' free tint ' offere they were running at the time .
neutral	rinning customer_services proved useless but my issue was dealt_with once i emailed .
neutral	i have recently had my eyes retested and found that my prescription had altered slightly so looked again at glasses_direct , all the frames i liked seemed pricey so i decided to try a few frames on a home_trial basis and wait for a groupon_voucher to come up .
neutral	luckily i didn ' t have to wait long and the same day my voucher came through i received an_email from glasses_direct saying they had a 00_%_off frames offer .
neutral	brilliant i thought , suddenly the frames i thought were out of my price range were affordable so i promptly ordered another home_trial to check the frames i wanted and placed an order .
neutral	unfortunately , like last time , the promotion was misleading and not available in conjunction with my groupon_voucher .
neutral	this put me in a difficult position as i had already paid for the groupon_voucher and so felt that rather_than waste the money on that i had to make the purchase .
neutral	i could have chosen less expensive frames but didn ' t want to be stuck with frames i didn ' t like .
neutral	i am now looking_forward to receiving my new frames , am just disappointed that once again i ' ve felt let_down by the incentives to purchase .
neutral	all in all great place to learn a new language .
neutral	sometimes i have problems with page loading and wont load some exercises , tried customer_services and did everything they recommended but still not loading recording exercises .
neutral	its annoying because i cant complete the tests .
neutral	i have used this site so many time for the information about latest fashion products i have also buy so many items from this site , and our product is really awesome .
neutral	placed my order using the 0 % match guarantee as well as coupon for $ 0 off , but even after this they only beat the competitor ' s price by less_than $ 0 .
neutral	shipping ate up my savings .
neutral	00_% fee just another name for booking_fee ?
neutral	thought there was no booking_fees ?
neutral	at_least prices were cheaper then the other website i checked though their tactics seem misleading ..
neutral	i did end up booking a few more others .
neutral	we ' ll see if my reservations are honored .
neutral	this shop is an okay one .
neutral	all the stuff is ridiculously over priced compared to other_sites like amazon . co . uk .
neutral	i only really use it if i need to get stuff quick and can ' t be bothered to search for a cheaper price .
neutral	i have had a few_times where i have reserved an item and got to shop to find that they are out of stock which is annoying .
neutral	well , i purchased " steelseries siberia " headphones and i assumed that everything would be nicely_packaged .
neutral	however , that was not the case .
neutral	it arrived in a very messy box , which had steelseries box inside , so that ' s understandable .
neutral	however , before opening steelseries box , i noticed some damage to the box and when i inspected the headphones , i saw plenty of dust and some " cloth particles "?
neutral	i ' m not quite sure how to describe them .
neutral	the plastic box on which the headphones were laying down was also damaged .
neutral	return transfer in mallorca didn ' t turn_up but after persistent emails to resorthoppa customer_services we were given a refund for the taxi fare we had to pay for to get to the airport on time .
neutral	not sure what the story would be if we had missed our flight .
neutral	i think it ' s important people realise resorthoppa are an agency for transfer companies so its not entirely their fault if a company is bad , they obviously do need to scrap some in mallorca altogether if they don ' t sort things out though .
neutral	we followed the procedure of confirming our pickup times etc .
neutral	everything was confirmed , we had the pickup time of 00 . 00 .
neutral	well 00 . 00 came and went .
neutral	got to 0 . 00 and we started panicking , tried to call the " emergency contact number " over 00 times and it just had an announcement in spanish on the other end .
neutral	we got a spanish speaker to help us and we found out the so called emergency number was just a mobile phone turned off .
neutral	it was like this all day .
neutral	we tried every other number that funnily_enough stopped_working , even_though it was fine the day before when we used it to confirm our pickup times .
neutral	it was like the transfer supplier had decided to just take a day off and turn off all their phones .
neutral	customer_service has been good since we sent in a complaint , shame that the transfer company in mallorca is unreliable and the actual service wasn ' t provided .

neutral	a week_ago i ordered a crocodile costume for my son ' s school assembly .
neutral	i needed it quickly so i chose next_day delivery .
neutral	sure enough the costume arrived bright and early the next morning - no_complaints there , although i do think £ 0 for delivery is a bit much !
neutral	( oops , i think that was a complaint !)
neutral	anyway , my son came home from school eager to try the costume on before the assembly .
neutral	normally i dont mind him wearing fancy_dress at home but this was a big_mistake .
neutral	the costume shed little green hairs everywhere he went .
neutral	a week ( and several_times around with the vacuum ) later and i ' m still finding them .
neutral	so straight after the assembly i had to lock the costume away in a cupboard and it won ' t be seeing the light of day again .
neutral	a [ 0 - year - old ] crying shame !
neutral	some of the highest prices in the e_- cig game but saying that there customer_service has alwayse been good and there red labell tobacco juice is next to none if they sorted there prices it would be a 0 * companny
neutral	verry good price !!
neutral	but the tast was verry unplesent :-( i had to add extra flavouring to get_rid of a very harsh and chalky taste but as i say verrry good price
neutral	i ' ve bought and sold on ebay many_times , and i think its a fantastic website once you know what your doing , but intially it will take a while to fatherm it out , which is a shame .
neutral	what else lets it down is obviously the ' con ' artists on the site that will sell you something that doesnt ever arrive or mislead you into buying things , but this is not ebay . co . uk ' s fault
neutral	my 0nd order was the biggest disappointment of any online purchase i ' ve made .
neutral	took over 0 weeks to receive my order , but it ' s hard to argue with their prices and ease of price_match .
neutral	if this new 0rd order can arrive within 0 - 00 days i ' ll change to 0_stars .
neutral	i visit chemicaluk every so often to look at the latest clothing as it ' s one of few places in the uk which fully promote street / skate wear brands .
neutral	i used to buy from the store quite regularly however i feel the emphasis has gone more towards typical high_street brands and styles rather_than sticking to it ' s original roots of streetwear and the pricing of new products when you include tax is at top end of the rrp .
neutral	the website has also now started to sell designer fashion wear which are at the top end price bracket rather_than promote the smaller low key streetwear brands which offer good value and something unique , i guess the unique element has gone_missing somewhere and it feels no different to any other menswear site online , which is not exactly a bad thing but is the reason_why i don ' t really shop at this store anymore .
neutral	the delivery is usually fast and efficient , easy check out service , great range of the latest music software etc , overall 0 out of 0 for the reasons stated above .
neutral	used these a few_times , prices are ok but service seems to have slipped a bit recently .
neutral	used to get my orders within 0 days , now it takes 0 - 0 days which is annoying when you want your stuff quickly .
neutral	order from gameseek all the time but this game never arrived to day after launch on the friday wasn ' t sent to the thursday very late in my opinion . everywhere_else order from the game arrives between 0 and 0 days before launch . if you don ' t mind waiting a extra day for your game i recommend gameseek if you like it on time or a little early order elsewhere .
neutral	the overall process was ok but the delivery charge is expensive and wasn ' t particularlyquick .
neutral	i ' m returning the boots i bought because they didn ' t fit , which at_least i can do in store but will lose out on delivery .
neutral	i wouldn ' t use ellis bvrigham online again .
neutral	i ' m not sure how i ' m supposed to rate a company before i receive the product that i ordered from them .
neutral	the website was a little tough to use .
neutral	none of my searches brought back results , so i had to manually search for everything , which was a pain .
neutral	but the prices are great , and that ' s what matters .
neutral	won ' t use again but was satisfactory
neutral	ok i have a mixed review here with some good points and bad points .
neutral	i have been saving up for a gaming_pc for a long time and a friend_recommended cyber_power .
neutral	i explored the market and found cyberpower to be the cheapest for what you get .
neutral	i was surprised at the amount of customization and really impressed with how simple it was to do .
neutral	i ordered my pc and within 00 days it arrived .
neutral	i was very impressed that i received a phone call to say it had been sent and a text asking me if i wanted to change delivery dates as well as a tracker sent to me to tell me the very hour it would arrive at my house .
neutral	all 0 / 0_stars for this aspect .
neutral	now the day it arrived i had a few friends over to all set_up the pc since we are a group of nerds and upon setting it up and turning it on a bsod came up .
neutral	i reset the computer and got the error_message checksum does not match computed checksum .
neutral	me and my friends tried to re install windows to fix this with no luck .
neutral	this really frustrated me because after forking_out the amount of money for this thing i expected it to work from the word go .
neutral	so in this aspect 0 / 0_stars .
neutral	so the next_day was a weekend so i could not phone tech_support but decided to email them .
neutral	a gentleman called chris mckay emailed me back pretty fast which i was surprised about because it was a weekend probably out of working hours too .
neutral	now chris was extremely_helpful and explained to me how to fix this issue through simple easy steps which worked through changing some of the profile settings in the bios and now i have a working pc .
neutral	overall cyber_power has excellent pricing , brilliant customization , brilliant service on delivery and amazing tech_support to say it was out of hours on a weekend .
neutral	downside the computer did not work on arrival which is a major flaw especially went i paid so much .
neutral	but mistakes_happen when building pc ' s , can ' t always get it perfect every time .
neutral	i ordered late on the 0th and it has yet to ship , of course payment was taken straight_away .
neutral	i was wary before ordering so i ordered £_00 ( 0 items / phone stuff ) so i ain ' t overly upset if it doesn ' t come .
neutral	i emailed them 0 days ago , took them today to answer .
neutral	they sounded polite , apparently it ' s because of the holiday so there ' s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there ' s no mention on the site ).
neutral	i shall see what happens from here .
neutral	update
neutral	i received my order a few_days ago and everything is as it was described on the site and came well_packaged .
neutral	however i ' m still annoyed from before .
neutral	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
neutral	whether they have delayed site updates or what i don ' t know why but whoever i emailed should have known my order was already shipped and never confirmed to me when it was shipped after i asked them to .
neutral	the site itself is not bad , they need better customer_service and to stop lying to customers about 00hour shipping that doesn ' t exist .
neutral	it ' s an alright shop but isn ' t anything special .
neutral	the clothes in my opinion can be a hit or miss and some items intended to look expensive are just tacky but have an extra £_00 added on .
neutral	they have some nice stuff because i ' ve bought a jumper there that looked lovely and also a pair of shorts aswell as basics but even these i could buy cheaper elsewhere at the same quality .
neutral	i attempted shopping online with them once last_year but the accidentally ( just bad luck ) canceled my order but left it a long time before telling_me so half of the stuff i wanted was sold out .
neutral	customer_service was okay however they agreed to give me a money off code because of the issue yet i never received this until i had to email them once again asking for it .
neutral	i haven ' t actually used it yet ( and i assume it will have expired by now ) but it was only 0 %_off anyway and i haven ' t seen anything online that i ' ve wanted to buy from them since .
neutral	i will shop at there stores from time to time but it just isn ' t really my favorite shop .
neutral	they finally emailed my code after about 00_hours , not what i was expecting at all .
neutral	but the code worked , and was the le version on top of it .
neutral	would i use sg again ?
neutral	not without_hesitation , but they are cheaper and just maybe i was just a bit unlucky .
neutral	the company issued an invalid price comparison and canceled my order .
neutral	after i sent an_email explaining how i achieved the price all they did was resend me the reason_why they cancelled the order and said to file another ticket .
neutral	i ' d rather pay the extra $ 0 or so for a supplier who will respond with a human response .
neutral	i paid for a return_flight
neutral	outbound
neutral	klm
neutral	manchester to lagos ( 0nd april_0000 - 0am departure time )
neutral	stop over at amsterdam
neutral	inbound
neutral	flight : klm
neutral	lagos to manchester ( 00th_april_0000 - about 00 . 00pm departure time )
neutral	payment included flight ticket , sms and mail alert as well as the premium package plan .
neutral	issue
neutral	i have been debited but still_haven ' t gotten my invoice and confirmation as well as detailed itinerary as i have scheduled on d site .
neutral	even you numbers provide are not reachable , this is becoming worrisome as i have been debited already . i have sent a full detailed mail with payment details to d email addy on your site service @ tripsta . co . uk
neutral	the transaction number designated to me by your mail delivery system is 0000000 .
neutral	kindly attend to this as this is of great concern .
neutral	i ' ve brought tickets ( thursday last_week ) for v_festival this weekend .
neutral	i ' m slightly_concerned with the delivery time .
neutral	we are planning to leave for the event on thursday but when should we actually expect the tickets ?
neutral	if they don ' t get posted until wed / thurs then we won ' t be able to leave and get there on time !
neutral	so how long do we leave it for tickets to get here before we look_elsewhere to purchase some more tickets ???
neutral	i ' ve noticed quite a few bad_reviews where people have not received their tickets !
neutral	any help appreciated
neutral	roses were well_packed and delivered on time but it was a very small and pretty shabby bunch for £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i could have got a much_better valentines bouquet for less_than half the price from morrisons .
neutral	it seems to be impossible but is true that official_iphone_unlock team can really unlock iphone s and they have been done 000 unlocks a day !
neutral	its just amazing !
neutral	printed some orders of service for a funeral and while they were extremely_helpful , efficient and had good prices the finished booklets all had a yellowish tint to them .
neutral	the blacks were clear and defined but the greys appeared faded / yellowish , which was a real_shame given the time it had taken to put_together .
neutral	it was acceptable but didn ' t look as professional as i had expected and due to the occasion i didn ' t have time to take them back for a refund / replacement .
neutral	i have two iphone0s which are locked by carrier .
neutral	one is softbank from japan and another one is us at & t .
neutral	two months_ago i tried pre_- order the japan iphone0s unlock .. until now still no news .. i tried email to u guys but didnt get any reply or refund .. i ' m very disappoint ..
neutral	yesterday i tried one more iphone to see whether the feedback of your customers is real or not .
neutral	so i bought the at & t iphone0s unlock service from you .
neutral	it goes well .
neutral	then what about my japan iphone0s ?
neutral	i can ' t get refund ?
neutral	why no reply ..
neutral	please reply me if you see this review .
neutral	but the way it ' s still lucky for me .. this site is not completely fake .
neutral	there are so many fake unlock web_site out there .. other_sites i tried to put incorrect / fake imei to test and they replied it ' s valid iphone and ready to unlock ... lame ..
neutral	i ' m sure the coach service they offer is very good , just be mindful to use a disposable email address when enquiring or booking via their website as " sophie " from national express will spam you relentlessly with " offers ".
neutral	this is the second time i have used glasses_direct .
neutral	the first time it took more_than 0 months for my glasses to arrive .
neutral	this time i have been sent the wrong glasses .
neutral	i need the glasses next week so will not have time to send them back for a replacement .
neutral	** edit - glasses_direct did call and sent out the correct glasses in two days without asking for the other pair to be sent back .
neutral	prices are not that competitive compared to buying off a more reliable website like amazon .
neutral	sellers are also put at a disadvantage where they can ' t leave negative_feedback , so the buyer always has an advantage over the seller , which can be bad when you open a case with ebay .
neutral	the selling fees can be very expensive when you sell an item over £_000 so this can discourage users from selling expensive items on ebay .
neutral	sembra novella duemila
neutral	ma la brutta copia a ah aha ha hahahah aha
neutral	great website , easy to use and understand .
neutral	delivery service was very poor on my recent_purchase , disappointing .
neutral	i ordered a trophy which i heard via_email ( a few_days after ordering ) wasn ' t available ( despite still being shown as for sale online ).
neutral	due to the timescales i went with another trophy which wasn ' t ideal but the best fit .
neutral	a few_days_later it arrived .
neutral	i would mark 0 . 0 out of 0 if i could
neutral	the items arrived in promised time and acceptable condition .
neutral	however , there are no previews on save the date or thank_you cards .
neutral	which i guess would be fine in most_cases , but in our case they couldn ' t type the special character in the middle of my name .
neutral	and without preview we didn ' t find this out until we received our order , so we had to manually correct on each card as it was too_late to order new cards .
neutral	i think , the website should have a preview on everything considering the amount each customers spends .
neutral	also , from the website it wasn ' t clear , that there will be no difference_between the thank_you and save the date cards .
neutral	as the evening invitation had evening invitation on the front , we wanted to use save the date cards to invite guests to our afternoon drinks reception celebrating our_wedding abroad .
neutral	but as the save the date ' s were the same as thank_you ' s we had add decorations to make them presentable .
neutral	so overall we were disappointed with the order .
neutral	we ordered our_wedding invitation form here previously and they were lovely , so i guess we had higher expectations
neutral	i booked with prestigia once , since i found that they had the cheapest price on trivago for a hotel in mallorca .
neutral	i initially booked 0 double_rooms and 0 single room , but then i wanted to cancel the single room , so i contacted them .
neutral	the agent was very helpful .
neutral	and i actually got my deposit back in 0 week .
neutral	i sold tickets on viagogo for muse concert that was in riga on 00 . 00 . 0000 .
neutral	i got email on 00 . 00 . 0000 that i was payed and after that , hell started !
neutral	it ' s about 0 months passed and i didn ' t got the money !
neutral	i contacted viagogo customer_service ( which is worst customer_service , ever !)
neutral	and was informed that " there ' s payment issue ", than they asked me to call paypal to claim my payment , i called them but paypal could not find any payments on my name .
neutral	than i contacted viagogo again several_times , via_email and via phone and every time answer was " there ' s some issue , will try to find out what ' s the problem ".
neutral	after 0 months of payment , this company even can ' t say what ' s the exact problem with my payment !
neutral	today , i have sent viagogo last email , after that , i ' ll contact directly to their management ( i was lucky to get direct phone number & email ) and if no luck , than will ask my lawyer to help me to get my money .
neutral	update # 0 :
neutral	as i can ' t respond directly to viagogo representative , i ' m updating current review .
neutral	as representative told ( you can see the reply from viagogo ), company has sent money i have refused it .
neutral	the truth is , that i have not refused anything ( maybe paypal had , not me ).
neutral	i didn ' t got email from paypal to claim payment , also there was nothing in my account .
neutral	i searched for the transaction_id that viagogo sent me and also was not able to find it .
neutral	i responded viagogo via_email & facebook to , sent screenshot of transactions and waiting for response but without any luck .
neutral	also i didn ' t got any payment today , as representative promised .
neutral	so i ' m still_waiting for resolution of my problem till tomorrow , then i ' m going to contact viagogo management directly .
neutral	update # 0 :
neutral	at last , contacting a lot of people in viagogo & paypal we solved problem .
neutral	the reason , why i could not get money , was the paypal registration country .
neutral	i was registered as an ukraine citizen & ukrainian accounts can ' t accept payments .
neutral	that ' s why i could not get payment .
neutral	so after contacting paypal and getting this info , i used my sisters account and got the money .
neutral	i think that viagogo could find the reason of the problem when contacting with paypal , but didn ' t .
neutral	now it does not matter .
neutral	thanks to the guy , named prab from viagogo , we solved problem .
neutral	topcashback offer some great cashback rates on a range of purchases but the payout speeds are so protracted .
neutral	it takes months to get payouts .
neutral	i understand this is often to cover return periods but the system employed to keep you updated is poor and the ability to contact topcashback is poor and often blocks you from contacting a member of staff by giving you an_automated_reply .
neutral	on the upside , the ability to turn cash into tesco points is brilliant , shame it ' s capped at £_00 a year but that ' s up to £_000 in clubcard rewards !
neutral	brilliant !
neutral	the website is great and extremely easy to use and navigate with any winnings paid directly into your account , no having to claim in store .
neutral	however , the odds of winning are ridiculous .
neutral	especially if you are hoping to win more_than a tenner .
neutral	vodafone seem to have started charging more and more for their service compared with other_networks .
neutral	as someone that couldn ' t care less about formula 0 offers through their sponsors i would rather pay less and lose this " benefit ".
neutral	from experience vodafone customer_service can be incredibly hit and miss , like no other .
neutral	one phone call you get someone who ' s lovely and would go our of their way to help you and then you get someone who very clearly cannot wait to hang_up on you .
neutral	something that really needs to improve especially if they insist on being expensive !
neutral	i ' ve been with the aa for years on my breakdown_cover but when it recently came to renewal my price hit the roof .
neutral	telephoned them and managed to get the price back down , received three different quotes in the post after that .
neutral	having spoken to a number of advisor ' s as a result of these quotes coming through the post i was assured my lower_price would be charged .
neutral	surprise_surprise when they took nearly double what they had quoted me .
neutral	i have now cancelled my breakdown_cover .
neutral	wouldn ' t touch their insurance with a barge_pole , i ' ve had a quote every year that i ' ve been driving and theirs is always one of the most expensive quotes i get .
neutral	time_consuming , especially when you think you are almost done and then its try , try again until hey_presto you can actually book some semblance of the tick you were after , great idea , but needs streamlining and if a ticket is not available it should not show up as available .
neutral	the price is good .
neutral	however , as far as i could see they did not tell you before paying that you would need to provide_evidence to show you are not a fraud .
neutral	what if i had not had such evidence , and yet still would have paid nonetheless ?
neutral	for some reason after a while they seemed to change their mind and send me the code anyway ... am i no_longer suspicious then ?
neutral	i understand the need to dig out frauds , but needing to provide_evidence after purchase is ridiculous and needs to be made more clear .
neutral	to end on a positive however , the code did arrive quickly once the former was sorted .
neutral	my mother ordered me a ted baker ladies watch a couple of week_ago .
neutral	we have it the 00 working_days delivery estimate but it has still not arrived !
neutral	we have emailed wowcher twice but still no response !!
neutral	!
neutral	i signed_up to quidco a few_months_ago , and i am generally pleased .
neutral	but , why is there no general ' contact us ' feature ?
neutral	my clicksnap thing refuses to work as it states i have the wrong log in details .
neutral	i tried to contact quidco , and found i could only view some useless faq_section which does not allow you to send them a message .
neutral	the mobile checkins are great as these are not included in the retention fee , but sometimes the app has problems and you cannot check in .
neutral	on the whole , i like this company and all of my transactions with them have gone_smoothly .
neutral	delivery and dispatch are usually quite quick , and they often have huge discount days .
neutral	the problem with this site , is firstly , the swatches of the products .
neutral	it is impossible to tell what shade you are in their foundations , and even some of the nail_polish swatches are completely untrue to real_life .
neutral	secondly , the quality of the products varies so much !
neutral	you can buy a product , love it , then repurchase it and it will be horrible !
neutral	i don ' t understand_why they don ' t have better quality_control .
neutral	even some of their more_expensive products have problems .
neutral	i bought a lipgloss from their mineral range and the packaging is so bad you can barely get any out of the tube !
neutral	not sure if i would buy anything again .
neutral	i have used this company many_times since i found out about usn ' s 0hr protein as they seem to be the only company that sell it .
neutral	but up until recently i have had no_problems with their service with parcels arrived as intended on time with no damages .
neutral	however 0 of the last 0 orders have been messed_up .
neutral	first i received the wrong goods and i had to make arrangements for them to deliver the correct goods and i was offered some loyalty_points to compensate for the mix_up .
neutral	then my next order was fine but the one after that which was my most_recent order there was another mix_up and this time the parcel had not arrived as intended .
neutral	when i phoned i was told that the parcel had not left the warehouse and after a bit of haggling i was offered a refund on the delivery onto my card or the amount refunded as loyalty_points .
neutral	for the life of me i still do not understand how firstly someone can put the wrong products into a box when they surely have some piece of paper with the exact name of the items on them and then secondly how the parcel could not be collected from the warehouse .
neutral	its not exactly rocket_science .
neutral	yes it was sorted in the end and i received loyalty_points but only after chasing after them about compensation , i mean this should be offered be offered straight_away and apologies should be made for the mix_up .
neutral	they should also offer more_than just a refund of postage cost , perhaps a discount on your next order or something of this sort should be offered as these mistakes should not happen and especially not on more_than one_occasion .
neutral	overall i was impressed when i first started ordering from this company but after recent performance , i am very dissappointed and if it weren ' t for the protein_powder , i would have gone back to monstersupplements where i have had no_problems with orders being mixed up .
neutral	order number 000000 parcel delivered late
neutral	order number 000000 wrong items delivered
neutral	i am due to go on holiday in july and thought this would be great for some cheap and cheerful clothes , how wrong was i ?
neutral	they have very few select items that are 00plus therefore i now have to go elsewhere and spend extra money al because they don ' t cater for the bigger lady .
neutral	overpriced , sure ; the food is nice .
neutral	but £_00 for one pizza in this current economic_climate ?
neutral	seriously , have a word .
neutral	used viper active bars for a 00 mile super marathon , £_00 . 00 and i felt no difference with them .
neutral	also used them for a football_match , results were nothing spectacular .
neutral	all products vastly overpriced , would probably be satisfied if i only paid about £ 0 .
neutral	will look_elsewhere for similar products , and i advise you to do the same .
neutral	really please with the suit i bought however one of the suits was super slim and this was not what i purchased ( or described in the description ) from the site .
neutral	i sent the suit back and had to chase for the refund and communication was poor although i thankfully have been refunded .
neutral	been with virgin_media on and off for a while now .
neutral	due to my job ( as an it specialist ), i need fast , solid broadband .
neutral	virgin always seem to offer some pretty sweet deals , so i normally end up with them ( in an area that they serve anyway ).
neutral	our current package is tivo , 0 virgin hd boxes ( tivo in front room , hd box in the 0 bedrooms ) and 000mbit broadband ( that is connected via sockets to every room in the house , including 0 offices ).
neutral	overall this 000mbit feeds about 00 internet connected devices .
neutral	virgin seem to have a problem with stability ( and not really just at peak_times )..
neutral	when it is working ( about 00_% of the time ) 0 of us can be hammering the internet ( including me with large server backups etc ) with fantastic speed .
neutral	however , occasionally we can end up with dropped connections , the pbx ( phone system ) being dropped randomly then an_hour later it ' s all fine .
neutral	previous to virgin we had bt_infinity ( 00 mbit , managing about 00mbit on average ), and that was rock solid .
neutral	never missed a beat .
neutral	if that + sky for 0 rooms wasn ' t so damned expensive we ' d have stayed with it .
neutral	when we placed the order with virgin , they got it all wrong .
neutral	the guys turned_up to do the install and were a box short .
neutral	then when they sorted this out virgin added another £_00 to our bill ( which admittedly they refunded as a " good will ").
neutral	their tech_support is generally " turn it off and back on " and can often be more of a hindrance than a help .
neutral	however , if you manage to get through to level 0 , or a senior tech , then things tend to get sorted out a lot quicker .
neutral	overall .
neutral	for bundles of features and seriously quick internet at an affordable price i would recommend them .
neutral	if you want a faultless connection 00 . 0 % of the time , i would probably say spend the extra and go with bt_infinity and sky +.
neutral	machinemart is a great one stop_shop for all you tool and machinery needs .
neutral	there is a large range of items in stock ready for immediate collection and great advice from staff too .
neutral	the prices are not wonderfully competative so its worth seeking price matches if possible although their vat free events make prices far more desirable .
neutral	their range of clarke tools are ideal for the diyer although i wouldnt rely_on them proffesionally to earn the mortgage although thats reflected in the prices compared to the likes of makita and dewalt .
neutral	thornaby store has superbly helpful staff .
neutral	well_done .
neutral	basically .
neutral	i have used cjs a few_times previously and they have always delivered quickly and efficiently , however i decided to use the random auto_key feature for steam to see if i could get lucky and get a nice game that i dont already own ( and if i do then give it to a friend double bonus ) however one of the keys was doa and would not work on steam regardless of what combination of letters / numbers and copy / pasting didnt solve the problem , after contacting the site for assistance i read that i could take upto 0 days for a response about it , kinda frustrating but im sure they will sort it out , hell they usually sort it out double quick :_p
neutral	easy - to - use website
neutral	ordered an asus transformer for my gf for xmas on the 00th_dec ( was charged instantly for it ), website said it was in stock and advised delivery within 0 days due to the busy_period , which i thought was fair_enough as long as it arrived before_xmas .
neutral	however alarm_bells rang when the website had my order status as ' new ' even 00 days after i ordered so chased up via_email as that seems to get a response rather_than wasting time on hold to the customer_service line , vanessa was helpful but seemed unable to do much .
neutral	item finally arrived on the 00th , i was glad to actually receive it given all the bad_reviews but their customer_service really is poor and they mislead you with delivery times & stock_levels which is not on , especially over xmas !
neutral	thankfully my gf was understanding when it finally came !
neutral	!
neutral	their prices are cheaper_than elsewhere but only order from them if a ) you are prepared to wait 0 - 0 wks for the item b ) you don ' t mind it coming with us plugs c ) you can put up with poor service and not hearing anything about the status of your order until literally the day before it arrives seemingly out of thin_air !
neutral	lots of branches open 0 days .
neutral	bought a camera bundle online .
neutral	arrived in a week all good .
neutral	i used to love vodafone as a network and think no one compared , however , since they released ' sure signal ' they seem to have lessened the signal_strength .
neutral	my calls seem to drop so much more , and i am no where near as happy as i used to be ...
neutral	one whole month i had to wait for compensation payment for a parcel that parcel0go had lost .
neutral	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
neutral	many_times with the livechat i was sent away and told to wait with no direct answer .
neutral	the people ( i ' m_guessing they were people on the other end ) were rude and not very helpful at all .
neutral	that was until today when ashley was able to sort out my refund giving me a number of payment options .
neutral	he gave me direct answer straight_away without making me wait .
neutral	although my experience with the company thus_far was awful i must_say ashley turned it around :) i would recomend the company as the prices are very good but i would suggest cover as parcels do get lost and you wont get the value of the products unless your covered .
neutral	all in all i see that there are some workers who literally carry the company .
neutral	hopefully all the hard work will be noticed and due praise and promotion given .
neutral	thank_you ashley :)
neutral	when i found flights to rome for 00 a head i thought it was a great deal .
neutral	with all the extra costs it ended_up being so much more .
neutral	also they have lowered their hand_luggage_allowance to 00kg and charge a whopping 00 quid for a 00 kg back for check in .
neutral	if you cantravel with just hand_luggage you do generally work out cheaper , but it ' s never as convenient and the airport is generally quite far away from its description
neutral	i have had several experiences with delayed shipping - stocking out of products .
neutral	if you say you have a product , make_sure you have it .
neutral	we had a great time in glasgow with the activity day being a massive success .
neutral	we did a lot of things for the first time and got to do them together as a group .
neutral	the comedy night was also fun , however we were lucky to get in as chillisauce did not confirm our booking with the venue .
neutral	we therefore had to pay for our own food and were stuck standing in a corner with a pillar in the way of the stage so we could not see .
neutral	i ordered my glasses on the 00rd of feb_0000 ( now 00th_march ), i have a very basic prescription ( 0 . 0 in both ) so i assumed it would take up to 00 days to get them .
neutral	i ' ve tried_emailing to see when i can expect them since at the moment they are apparently still in ' the lab '; but i never get a reply .
neutral	seems like they spend more time leaving time on here because the comments are public than they do replying to customer emails !
neutral	their prices are good and their website is nice , but it stops there - fingers_crossed i don ' t have to wait as long as other people have had to !
neutral	update_:
neutral	ok i just received an_email , the frames i ordered were out of stock ( however they are still on the website with no out of stock message ), i ' ve asked for a different frame - lets_see how this goes ....
neutral	i have been made aware that the new frames will be dispatched on monday ( today ) and should be with me mid week - they also wavered £_00 since the frames i chose were more_expensive that the original pair .
neutral	if all goes well , i will up my rating since i have received awesome support and money off .
neutral	well i am a long_term just_eat user .
neutral	i think on the whole this is a place i can be happy ordering from .. when things go right , but when they do not ... you are up some sorta creek with no paddle .
neutral	i have been waiting for a refund for over a month .. have called ... told someone would contact me .. not happened .
neutral	tried to use the online_chat thing .. omg ...
neutral	i had a revolving argument with the man ( sandeep ) about how it was my fault for not having the information he wanted .. even_though he could not find the same information .
neutral	grr .
neutral	so still_waiting for refund but kinda gave up now .
neutral	other issue is .. the point shop !
neutral	had so much cool and terrible stuff , but it did not matter as it was free if you had enough points .!
neutral	wooo ... but .. now i have enough points , what can i buy ??
neutral	hmmm xbox ?
neutral	wii ???
neutral	speedboat ?
neutral	!
neutral	?
neutral	.... no .
neutral	i can use my points to " be in with a chance to win " cinema tickets .
positive	i spoke to the policy store to get advice and everyone there was so helpful and friendly .
positive	we ordered personalised thank_you cards for my son ' s first birthday .
positive	they are lovely .
positive	a really good service with extremely_helpful staff .
positive	an operator called jenny helped_me with an international shipment and looked in depth into a query for me .
positive	i will_definitely use again !
positive	it ' s hard to trust a cd_key website , but when i decided to order after seeing so much positive_feedback about this site , i thought i ' d try it , purchased 00 months xbox_live gold for £_00 ( bargain ), ordered through paypal , within a minute i received email with the cd_key which shows on the back of a card like you would get from retail .
positive	i simply redeemed the codes and right away , it worked .
positive	legit website , superb prices , awesome job !
positive	ordered the item on the thursday and was delivered on the friday of the next_day !!!
positive	i had one very happy little_boy !
positive	would most definitely use again !
positive	and the item purchased was £ 0 cheaper_than other_retailers in the high_street !
positive	and £ 0 cheaper_than amazon with faster shipping .
positive	a trusted seller
positive	after years of chopping and changing supermarkets finally finding one that does everything it says on the tin has been difficult .
positive	sainsbury ' s is the closest one to that mark , the online ordering and delivery service is 00_% foolproof , although i do find i have to switch off the substitutes as some of the replacements are questionable .
positive	delivery is always on time , the driver is polite and understanding , and they take a number of cards including electron and solo !!!
positive	which is a bonus for most people ( unlike tesco !)
positive	products are not always the cheapest however are great quality and easily replacable if they do not meet my standards .
positive	the nectar card is great ...
positive	i use it everywhere i go and it saves me a fortune over the year ( last_year over £_00 just over a weeks shopping ) sainsbury ' s has an easy layout of products allowing you to just pop in and grab or spend an_hour doing the weekly_shop , i do find i spend time wandering around the home section though spending more money than i needed to and buying items that i don ' t actually need , its very clever the way the layout is in sainsbury ' s !
positive	( or i have no self control lol ) staff are always friendly and helpful and seem to have gone_through a reasonable level of training .
positive	the scan as you shop gadgets are fab , it makes sure you don ' t go over budget on your shop , the only annoying part is when you get up to the till and have to have a re - scan !
positive	although you can help yourself here , make_sure you scan everything that goes in your trolley or basket , the more sainsbury ' s can trust you with your shopping the less likely you will get re - scans !
positive	i would also like to point out in this review that i have a disabled relative who also uses sainsbury ' s in a number of stores across the country ( mainly as i live in essex and she is in shropshire ) we have never had an issue borrowing any form of wheelchair or acquiring goods from the top shelf at any of the 0 stores we regularly use , they also have ramps for the cash machines and a lower machine for wheelchair access .
positive	all in all a great all_round supermarket !
positive	we have been purchasing items from 0000rpm for the last 0 years .
positive	our small business relies on fast_shipping / deliveries and good quality products , which is exactly_what we get from 0000rpm .
positive	any_issues with a delivery are sorted within a very short_space of time .
positive	my exprience of 0000rpm has always been and i hope will_continue to be reliable , professional , quality and great budgeted company .
positive	items we have bought include , printers , inks , cds , cases , flash_drives , cd readers , speaker systems and various hard ware / motherboards / soundcards etc .
positive	we are overall very satisfied with thus company and shall continue to purchase items and spread the word about them .
positive	update most drivers on my laptop .
positive	it ' s hard to sum up how refreshing it is to see a company like this .
positive	the prices are smack on and some of the best around and you ' re at a great advantage , not having to wait on parcels being received if you purchase serial keys .
positive	i ordered mine for guild_wars 0 and had the serial code in about 00_minutes with no issues_whatsoever .
positive	the customer_service is great , as you ' d be able to see if you read the below reviews , with any_issues being called up on with detailed and sincere explanations .
positive	you just don ' t find this these days .
positive	i also ventured over to the facebook_page as i was waiting and read about how they deal with the empty boxes and unused discs that they end up with through people buying serial keys and found that they ' ve recently sourced out recycling firms that can handle both .
positive	not only that , they use carbon neutral servers to host the website .
positive	the company not only treat the customers with care but also everything that they affect in doing their business .
positive	i was totally dubious and actually genuinely worried_about what i ' d paid for and how reliable it would be but all of my concerns were laid to rest .
positive	you ' re in great hands when dealing_with ziip and if anything was ever to go_wrong , you know they ' d do their best to correct it quickly , efficiently and intelligently - without the usual and hideously commonplace shady business attitude .
positive	i will_definitely buy from here in the future .
positive	i am a repeat customer due to one reason , the prices can not be beat !
positive	after going down to my local dreams store i had no_idea what i wanted after half an_hour i had purchased 0 beds and one tempa mattress .
positive	i opted to have the beds installed as they have the storage underneath and i never wanted all the hassle getting it right .
positive	come the morning of delivery had a call to say the guys would arrive at half 0 and they was here on the dot .
positive	dave and seb was the installers and i could not fault them at all very polite and professional and cleared up all the mess they made unlike some company ' s .
positive	overall very satisfied !
positive	very quick easy way of getting some cash .
positive	placed an order for brake levers on the wednesday_afternoon and choose the free delivery option .
positive	i unexpectedly received the delivery the next morning , very happy !
positive	rhea
positive	i unlock my iphone 0 ios 0 . 0 . 0 with bb 00 . 00 . 00 in just one day an half .
positive	the website is very easy to do make orders and in just one word .....
positive	professionals .........
positive	i give them 0_stars
positive	tks too official_iphone_unlock
positive	cheapest , large_selection and they will beat other prices
positive	great company , fast delivery .
positive	perfect !
positive	i have never had a problem with yodel and have always found their staff to be very happy and friendly .
positive	the parcels are always on time and they keep you well informed as to when your parcel was dispatched and where it is now .
positive	great service !
positive	supplement wearhouse is one of the best sites for researching as well as purchasing supplements for your workout_needs .
positive	not only is it easy to navigate , it is consistently the lowest priced supplement webpage around .
positive	it ' s accessible and helpful to all types of people , weather a novice or a dedicated gym rat .
positive	fast and reliable company , good quality cables and great value
positive	this is amazing im speechless
positive	i really enjoy the products that i receive from supplement_warehouse and the low price definitely helps .
positive	the addition of many samples with my orders is also something that separates the site from others !
positive	great business .
positive	hey there !
positive	i highly_recommend you to do not worry to deliver your iphone blindly to official_iphone_unlock ....
positive	have purchased two games from cdkeys . com . au
positive	one was swtor , the other bf0 .
positive	both deliveries were quick , cheap prices , and no hassle .
positive	will be buying all my cdkeys from here
positive	i ordered a grade a phone for my dad .
positive	wasn ' t very sure with second_hand phones , but the phone arrive as if it was brand_new , ordered 00 am received the phone next_day .
positive	that is super_fast delivery .
positive	i would highly_recommend them
positive	i bought a phone for my nephew , super_fast delivery , great customer_service and excellent product .
positive	highly_recommend .
positive	will buy again
positive	i ' ve never found any other hostel booking website to be as efficient , cheap and easy to use as hostelbookers .
positive	000_% recommended to use hostelbookers instead of hostelworld !
positive	fast delivery , everything as i ordered , the best prices on the whole net , very happy with my second purchase from them !
positive	excellent selection .
positive	reasonable prices .
positive	and cracking customer_service when required .
positive	definitely buying here again .
positive	tried to get tickets for me and 0 friends to see taylor swift in concert at the o0 ...
positive	this was impossible on ticketmaster as they sold out ridiculously quickly .
positive	searched for tickets on google and double 0 came up .
positive	brilliant service , quite expensive compared to original prices , but i have the tickets !!
positive	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you !!!
positive	!
positive	very fast delivery , good prices and very helpful assistance .
positive	i recommend it to anyone who_wants to make good deals .
positive	this humble shop is a small paradise for hobbyists who collect blind boxed quirky figures / charms / etc .
positive	these_guys do the opening and identifying for you , so you know what exactly_what you ' re paying for , instead of dishing wads of cash on blind boxes in an vain attempt to finish your collection ( not speaking from personal experience -- honest !).
positive	if you think that sucks the fun out of collecting , then they do sell unopened boxes to fill the needs of those feeling lucky or want a surprise .
positive	dinkybox also has a nice collection of japanese figures ( such as pinky street and revoltech ), as well as books and manga supplies .
positive	they don ' t quite have the biggest_selection around , but it ' s a nice shop with a reliable service and great prices .
positive	i ' d say it ' s worth a browse .
positive	i ' m usually skeptical_about buying clothes online since i ' ve have problems with many sites but yesstyle is one of the few i ' d say is pretty good .
positive	the clothes are very attractive and there is a really big selection of styles .
positive	the website itself is very easy to browse and its easy to find what you ' re looking for .
positive	delivery is super_quick , especially if you choose clothes that ' ship within 0 - 0 days '.
positive	i ordered on sunday_night and it arrived today -- rather quick for clothes that are imported !
positive	all the shirts and jumper fitted_perfectly and i will_definitely use this service again .
positive	my only gripes with the site is that the delivery is quite expensive , but understandably so since the clothes are imported from asia .
positive	i think its best to order lots of clothes at once so that the delivery fee is worth it .
positive	plus , you get can free delivery if you order enough .
positive	another problem is that many of the clothes are one - size only , and mostly suit to a medium to petite frame .
positive	they don ' t seem to really cater to anyone who is a uk size 00 and above , much to the disappointment of some my friends .
positive	if i could give cultpens more_than 0_stars , i would .
positive	one of the best online stores i ' ve used !
positive	very quick delivery ( arrived in less_than 0 days ) and an easy to use website .
positive	i would not have been disappointed if my package came a bit late in this busy christmas_period , but i ' m surprised that it managed to arrive today !
positive	the products i ' ve ordered is good quality and exactly_what i was looking for .
positive	would use this website again , once i run out of supplies .
positive	reliable , quick delivery .
positive	very easy to personalized your own card .
positive	the selection of cards are fun and quirky too .
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	i am not sure how i came_across this website , maybe a google_search and i found the amazing , money saving deals .
positive	the main and most_important thing on their website is the competition pricing .
positive	what this is basically is you go to a different website where its listed for cheaper , supplement_warehouse doesn ' t just match the price , it gives you it for much less .
positive	great website and company , will recommend to friends and family , and use the service again !
positive	easy to use site , great range of products although not everything i wanted was on the site , fab prices , great service i would recommend to others and will buy from them again x
positive	usually deliveries thats say they are next_day to northern_ireland from england are not , this was , i was quite happy .
positive	product arrived in perfect_condition and i got a very polite email which i will quote , " thank_you for your business and of course if i can help further , please don ' t hesitate to get in touch .
positive	kind_regards .." so you can see why i gave this 0_stars
positive	i receive my camera in 0 days without paying any aditional charges .
positive	i was very skeptical when my friend told me about this website and all the great deals .
positive	i looked it up today and found every product i have been doing research on .
positive	the deals the have on the website were beyond anything i have ever_seen .
positive	all the free products made it that more enjoyable and allows me to try things i would have never thought of trying .
positive	i am exstatic when i see a product i have heard about and they have a promotion on it .
positive	i can always find something to help boost my results and the description they give help me choose the correct ones without any doubts .
positive	i will be back with more friends for more purchases !
positive	ordered a pair of long_distance new wayfare glasses which arrived 0 days of the dispatch date and in total 00 days from order date .
positive	the online order progress keeps you informed every_step of the glasses pathway .
positive	not a scratch on the lenses and no_problems with my perscription .
positive	couldn ' t find a better price online .
positive	my one regret , not selectspecs fault , is that i did not look in the shops at what i was buying online .
positive	if i did i would have chosen the colour havanah instead of dark havanah .
positive	my fault entirely so guess the motto is try before you buy .
positive	house_network were great all_round .
positive	the price was fantastic , saving us about £ 0000 on estate_agent fees .
positive	they took lots of excellent photos of every room , all making the house look great .
positive	they also gave thorough descriptions and a floor plan .
positive	they sent us statistics regularly .
positive	they were always easy to contact , and got back to us very quickly with any_queries .
positive	we chose house_network after viewing a property they were marketing as we found them cery helpful .
positive	overall we would definately_recommend them for the price and service .
positive	my phone was locked for 0 months i was looking for online solutions all over the web , this is the only dicent and trustworthy i found .
positive	i highly_recomend this guys .
positive	thanks alot .
positive	very happy with the packaging and the fast and i mean fast delivery ...
positive	for the amount i bought and not getting charged extra postage for it i was very happy .
positive	i would definitely_recommend chillisauce .
positive	they were great at giving advice on what hen_party would be suited to us and answered any_questions that were asked extensively .
positive	they provided us with a really enjoyable hen_party
positive	i have rated incrystals earlier this month , and the service only keeps getting better !
positive	i ordered 0 gifts yesterday , and received them today .
positive	you have made 0 people very happy this christmas .
positive	thank_you so much
positive	sarah xx
positive	easy to use website , fast and secure .
positive	collection is easy to organize
positive	downside ( very small one but ...), pity collection times can not be more specific than 0am_till_0pm for example ?
positive	not parcel0go ' s fault would be a nice addition in my opinion to their website .
positive	also a surcharge for using paypal is disappointing as i use ebay and paypal a lot !
positive	support staff both on facebook and website all very helpful and knowledgeable , a credit to their employers !
positive	trustpilot is a flawed system .
positive	you can overide the authorisation code normally by typing in a sequence of numbers ( 000000 ) or letters ( abcdefg0 ).
positive	you can reply as a company even when you are not the company .
positive	i cannot understand_why companies are paying good money for such a system .
positive	i bet after a few seconds , this comment will be deleted because trustpilot is also an unmanned system , no body is ever checking .
positive	only if it is in the interest of trustpilot .
positive	i ordered my canvas from hellocanvas , it came two days after it was shipped , and it is top quality !
positive	add that to the fact it worked out at £_00 - £_00 cheaper_than i could get anywhere in shrewsbury .
positive	will_definitely be going back to this group as i redecorate my flat !
positive	would definitely_recommend using this company to anyone .
positive	product was in excellent condition and arrived the next_day as promised .
positive	will be using this service again
positive	no_complaints .
positive	would use again .
positive	posted phone on the thursday , received money in my bank by tuesday .
positive	very good service and very easy to use .
positive	definitely support these_guys , they ' re a great bunch and always very helpful .
positive	ordered shower doors .
positive	arrived within a couple of days and very well_packaged .
positive	very grateful .
positive	will_definitely_recommend !
positive	super_fast_shipping !
positive	friendly staff , very helpful !
positive	nice easy shopping_experience with game code available within a few minutes of completing transaction and worked with no issues .
positive	had to have verification via text_message due to having a different e_- mail on my paypal account compared to one i used for cjs but no issue with this and worked easily and quickly .
positive	would deffo_use cjs again
positive	the plumbing engineers i used from pgs were friendly , punctual and did high_quality work .
positive	they give convenient time slots , and more_importantly , call half an_hour before the engineer arrives to avoid you having to wait in all day .
positive	this is the third time ive used mazuma , each time we have found it so quick and easy .
positive	we always get argos_vouchers , and always have that within a few_days , but we are kept in the loop via_email to let u know when ure fones been received and when ure argos card has been sent out .... im so happy with the service that i havent even considered trying out another company ... and we will_continue to use mazuma twice a year to recycle our old_phones .
positive	keep up the good work !
positive	!
positive	this company is so cheap and them delivers of the keys is so fast .. i am so happy with the servies of this company ... " like "
positive	great service , quick delivery and all for a very affordable price !
positive	very smooth pleasant_transaction
positive	i have never written a review for anything before but i honestly am so pleased with my service and product .
positive	i am 0 and a half months pregnant and have just bought a new mattress .
positive	it ' s so hard i have been in real discomfort with my back .
positive	i decided to order a memory_foam topper and after searching the net found zleeps to be the cheapest .
positive	i ordered a silver topper it came within 0 working_days and i got two free memory_foam pillows !
positive	very pleased very comfy .
positive	don ' t be put off by bad_reviews these people were either very unlucky or the reviews are fake .
positive	i am going to be recommending this site to friends and family
positive	boohoo from the start of my order were fantastic , great communication_throughout and all their products were a great price .
positive	the only_suggestion to customers would be is if you are in a rush for your outfit to pay extra for delivery as standard delivery does take a while .
positive	i had seen a number of isofix car seats on the market and struggled to make a decison .
positive	i then came_across the britax isofix seat on precious_little one and read the customer reviews and product specification .
positive	it was high in the safety ratings and also has a recline feature .
positive	the car_seat when it came was high_quality and was dispatched very quickly .
positive	as always great quality & service provided by precious_little one .
positive	the item was just as expected , and arrived in great condition and super_fast .
positive	i would recomend to anyone .
positive	this site is very user_friendly , easy to navigate and find what you are looking for , as well as lots of information on each hostel .
positive	it is also cheaper_than hostelworld .
positive	fast dispatch , item exactly as_described , great price !!!
positive	!
positive	i needed a wetsuit and had found the site link on an info board down at the lakes where my friends jetski .
positive	i found the website very easy to use and found a suitable wetsuit at an extremely reasonable_price within about 0 minutes of looking .
positive	it was a thursday and needed it for the weekend so ordered next_day delivery but realised it had to be before 0pm and i placed the ordered at 0 . 00pm but it still came the next_day !!
positive	i was so stoked and it fit me perfectly .
positive	now anything i need for the water i ' ll be coming here first !
positive	need some booties next :)
positive	had a great weekend cheers_guys
positive	i like the choices i have while shopping here .
positive	they not only have a large_selection of supplements but they are at great values .
positive	his products are excellent and the quality is perfect .
positive	services also very friendly .
positive	my only option to book a hostel .
positive	no booking_fees and payment protection is the best .
positive	wanna save a hella good amount of money use this website bra .
positive	i was really impressed with the speed of dispatch , low_cost ( ie , free !)
positive	delivery and the lovely saving off the rrp of the lens :)
positive	there is only one thing sweeter than being_able to choose your very own trove of tasty goodness to be delivered direct to your door .
positive	no , not the exceptionally good price for such a service .
positive	the truth is that service makes any good deal all the sweeter and mr big tops are no exception .
positive	community engagement and loyalty driving are two things that i love to see in a company ; the team over at mr big tops do this so very well !
positive	whether it ' s frequent giveaways or their great engagement and conversations on twitter and facebook , they ' re clearly very much in love with their product .
positive	let ' s face it ; who wouldn ' t be !
positive	if you love candy , vintage flair and charming service , you really should at_least try one box for yourself .
positive	being_able to have your favourite sweets delivered to your door in snack sized packages on a regular_basis is heaven for a sugar lover !
positive	the perfect website for anyone who_likes to have a bet .
positive	odds from a wide_range of bookies and best prices are clearly highlighted .
positive	also really useful for checking things like historical price changes and statistics for the prices of different bookmakers .
positive	i mainly bet on football and horse racing and just about every market i need is on there .
positive	if you bet even just a couple of times a month , you really should be using oddschecker to get best value !
positive	it can be a struggle finding the perfectly fitting frame and sending something away to be framed can take an age .
positive	then l found this site .
positive	with a range of different frames and whatever size you want , with a range of mounts , it was really simple .
positive	all l had to do was measure the item l wanted framed , pick the size and dimensions of mount and they sort the size of frame for it .
positive	couple days for it to be delivered .
positive	will be using them again .
positive	the item l ordered from here arrived quickly and was brilliant quality .
positive	i was looking for something different for christmas_present and loved the range and prices available on this site .
positive	the items l ordered arrived quickly and were great quality .
positive	also delivery was well_packed to ensure little chance of damages - other_companies should take note !
positive	really impressed with them and will_definitely be using them again .
positive	i had been needing a new watch strap for a while but l really wanted to get the right one to go with the model of my watch .
positive	i had been struggling to find it until l came_across babla ' s .
positive	they didn ' t have the strap on their site but had an option to put in my make and model of watch and they would source the strap for me .
positive	it took them no time at all to find the correct strap and have it sent out to me .
positive	i would definitely use the site again and recommend it to others .
positive	they are ok
positive	transfer from halifax to bv takes minutes
positive	i suspect they have automated_system for deposits , which is nice , not like in goldmoney . com when you wait for days
positive	did some withdrawal months_ago , no problem , fast and good
positive	fees per_month range from 0 usd to 0 usd for each metal
positive	overall they are ok
positive	secure because they send sms ( 00 pence price ) to phone of activities

positive	i am a massive fan of asos and have been for years now .
positive	it ' s such a pleasure using their site ; really easy to navigate and ( being a picky girl ) i love the search and filter functions .
positive	my favourite part is most_likely the saved items page , this has been so handy since it was introduced i really hope it stays as i now find every site that doesn ' t have this to be quite a pain .
positive	i don ' t often return things as sizing is generally spot on with their own branded clothing and the brands they supply , but when i have had to return it has been free and the refund is actioned really quickly .
positive	as far as issues with orders or products , this is where they shine .
positive	i had an order turn_up with a product missing ( the top of the package had been sliced , i assume at the courier depot ) and i was refunded straight_away as a replacement could not be sent .
positive	on another occasion a product turned_up and had a defect so i emailed customer_services , then shortly_after received a response offering compensation ( part refund ) so i was really chuffed to have a resolution , and a positive one !
positive	i wholeheartedly_recommend asos , really great company .
positive	would recommend mazuma to everyone one who asks about selling a phone .
positive	really fast reliable from beginning to to end .
positive	00 out of 00
positive	got my 0 pair free_trial which took no time to come , was happy with 0 of them so ordered them .
positive	easy online form and as soon as i had my prescription they took no time to send them out .
positive	very happy with the service .
positive	i ordered from elitekeys today as i wanted to get into wow as i have just stopped playing my other mmo due to it being pay0win .
positive	i had a looka round numerous sites for a long time thinking which one is a honest and true trustworthy website to buy from .
positive	i stumbled_across elitekeys the website looks professional and not all buy gold buy gold cheap price ect like the other_sites i was looking for game keys from , i came to here also and read the reviews before purchasing and everything seemed legit .
positive	i ordered my copies of the game and after 00_minutes i got an_email with attached photo ' s of my game codes which is a more satisfactory idea as you know they are more then likely to be legit and someone hasn ' t just copied the code into an_email and maybe got to code wrong .
positive	personally i will be ordering from this website again it is a good reliable source to buy from professionally set and hassle_free .
positive	plus from what i see delivery time is quicker_than the estimate of 00_mins - 0 hours , thats always a bonus !
positive	!
positive	when looking around for a case for my samsung note 0 , there were many available on ebay but none actually stated they were for a note so didn ' t want to buy just in case .
positive	i came_across this website and the description matched exactly_what i was looking for .
positive	purple is my favourite colour and delivery was when it was expected .
positive	i ' m very happy with the service that i received and the product i purchased !
positive	they were great !
positive	they always came_across very professionally , friendly and helpful .
positive	i didn ' t feel under pressure .
positive	loved the reviews on the digitalrev youtube page and this is what convinced me to make a purchase with dr , i obviously looked everywhere online and researched for many weeks for a new dslr and came to currys uk , amazon uk , and then digtalrev .
positive	the price_match was very reasonable with dr so i chose them and i ' m very happy with product and will buy other products , such as lenses with dr , in the future .
positive	delivery was very fast and had a online tracking_system with dhl .
positive	very well_done dr !
positive	placed an order for 0 identical sd cards however only one arrived in parcel two days ago .... no sign of the other one .
positive	have e_- mailed regarding this but heard_nothing .
positive	so unfortunately the price wasn ' t so good , paying for two and only receiving one !
positive	would ' ve been cheaper on high_street after all and not the hassle , i ' m disappointed as this is my first order .
positive	****** update *******
positive	have received email and was offered full_refund or replacement for missing item and requested replacement as i really needed the sd_card .... so i am going to upgrade now to five_stars as they were very helpful .
positive	will review again when replacement hopefully arrives !
positive	**** update ********
positive	replacement card arrived by registered post as promised .
positive	would definitely now use this company again as their customer_service is excellent when things don ' t go to plan .
positive	supplement_warehouse has all the products that you could possibly need and more .
positive	i am a returning customer and i will not go anywhere_else to get my products .
positive	the price_matching option is the best solution to finding great products for even greater prices .
positive	i ' ve used gear0music loads of times and pretty_much rebuilt my drum_kit with the things i ' ve bought off them .
positive	my cymbals were always immaculate when they arrived and even_though all the pieces of bubble_wrap and cardboard were a pain to get_rid of , it was well worth it .
positive	staff were very friendly when i rang them up with a query and they emailed me everything i needed to know within minutes !
positive	i ' m actually due a delivery today so as long as it turns up , 0 / 0 every time :)
positive	i really rate these_guys - its very rare that i shop on line and get the feeling like 0 .

positive	very trustworthy and will_definitely use again .
positive	i cant_believe_how easy it was to use etyres .
positive	one simple phone call was all it took .
positive	the lady on the phone was polite and really helped_me understand what tyres i needed to go for .
positive	i made my selection , booked the most suitable day for me , sat back and relaxed .
positive	the day of the fitting came .
positive	i received a call from the fitter promptly at 0 . 00am who said he would be there at 00am and at exactly 00 . 00am he turned_up .
positive	the fitting was done quickly and efficiently , he even took away my old tyres !
positive	" all included in the service ," he said .
positive	he then asked for my signature , showed me how to tighten my bolts properly and was on his way .
positive	the whole_thing took under half an_hour which is an eye opener compared to the 0 hour wait i suffered at kwick fit .
positive	overall i cannot_fault the prompt friendly and affordable service i received .
positive	i was very happy with the case when it arrived . it looks great , you just can ' t get great unique designs like this in the uk .
positive	it fitted my samsung_galaxy_s0 perfectly .
positive	the only issue i have with the case is i use an aux cable regularly in my car to play music through the stereo and you have to push the cable quite firm to fit past the silicone casing .
positive	other than that delivery time was great and i ' m happy i spent the money on a decent good quality case
positive	fast , simple and all you need to get the right informations and make a safety reservation !
positive	i have used quite a few cd_key websites and without a shadow of a doubt simplycdkeys is the best out there by_far !
positive	my pre_- order was delivered the day before_release so that i could preload the game which is perfect for my under par internet_connection .
positive	other orders i have placed also arrived around 0 minutes after making payment at the checkout .
positive	if you have any sense at all then you will shop with simplycdkeys and never buy your games from anywhere_else again .
positive	i was very surprised at how fast and simple ordering from go0arena was .
positive	the delivery was so fast .
positive	i received the cd_key within 0 minutes of placing my order !

positive	they make it even easier for you to return items you decide you don ' t like by simply taking to your nearest high_street store .
positive	i would have no reservations_about recommending shopping online with them
positive	i recently_purchased the simcity 0000 serial_number online .
positive	i had never bought a game online like this before and was unsure if it was a good idea , i thought maybe i should just go into_town and buy it from a shop like the good old days .
positive	my friend_recommended cjs to me via a link on facebook .
positive	he told me that he buys all his games direct from cjs as they process orders automatically and you get your serial_number straight_away unlike_other_sites that can leave you waiting days sometimes even weeks to reply with a working serial_number .
positive	i paid via_paypal and was instantly able to view my new simcity serial_number , i entered the code in the origin console under the ' redeem product ' tab and began downloading the full version of the game ...
positive	happy days !
positive	:)
positive	i would recommend cjs to any gamer that does not want to pay full price for a game !
positive	why pay full price when you can go to cjs !

positive	it is cheaper and faster_than any other website .
positive	no booking_fee is the best feature .
positive	we chose nortlander in the first place out of all of the other travel companies because of how cheap the package was .
positive	also because they were literally the only company to focus on what they could give us rather_than what all the other_companies couldn ' t do for us i . e .
positive	they didn ' t bitch about the other_companies and just gave us the best deal they could .
positive	throughout the semester they helped_us with anything we needed promotion - wise .
positive	emails were replied to almost every time with speed .
positive	when we had to expand the trip from 000 to 000 due to massive sign_up numbers , they allowed us to do so within 0 days of finding out we needed more spaces which took a huge_amount of pressure off us as a committee ( a lot of people were very annoyed that they werent in the first 000 ).
positive	during the trip , all of the reps were well liked by everyone .
positive	noise complaints and situations were handled well .
positive	all events in resort were run as planned and relatively on - time .
positive	overall , from my own experience and from speaking to anyone on the trip , nortlander helped make this the best trip to date for dcu snowsports .

positive	ordered a edimax apn from them , which arrived_promptly - though the courier delivered it quite late at around 0pm - kudo ' s to him for not turning around to head for home and leaving it for the next_day .
positive	ive purchased from kikatek on quite a few occasions already , but the other day was the first time ive actually had to contact them after a possible bodged firmware update for the apn i ordered .
positive	their support was very professional and were more then willing to help .
positive	fortunately i had also contacted edimax before emailing kikatek support and had everything sorted out so i didnt require an rma .

positive	when these_guys say ' next_day ' delivery - they arent kidding !
positive	!

positive	if you are looking for a cheap nightstay but you are not too self confident in terms of your orientation and organisation skills , hostelbooker will help you , it s very comfortable to chose time and place on their page and they will you show wide offer , all presented in convenient form , and setting the matter after your choice takes honestly 0 min . if it seems that something happen and you could call off your travel , you can choose the option of payment protection when you are booking , so that your 00_% paid at booking will turn to another booking . thats a good possibilty , because the planned travel is never 000_% sure , but undoubtly i will_continue my booking with hostelbooker so my money stay there like in bank . and another matter , once my credit_card wasn t valid , they asked the hostel s manager to let me pay all at arriving , that was really nice of them and solved my problem in this case
positive	and they also remind you about the travel , giving details and that helps a lot
positive	i ve used that service many_times and they never let me down

positive	having heard many bad_reviews on various sites about the different mobile recycle companies i was dubious to try it , but i find putting stuff on ebay a hassle now days so didn ' t want to do that .
positive	i decided to give mazuma a chance .
positive	i was quoted from the website £_00 .
positive	i posted my phones off .
positive	a day later i had an_email_saying the phones had been recevied and a cheque posted out .
positive	the very next_day a cheque for £_00 arrives through the door .
positive	i was absolutely amazed .
positive	i got a fair price for the phones and the payment within 0 days of posting my phones off .
positive	i will_definitely use mazuma_mobile next time to recycle a phone .
positive	thanks mazuma

positive	will use them again and again and again .
positive	a +
positive	da ich beruflich häufiger auf die fähre von und nach england angewiesen bin und mir die ökonomischste verbindung wichtig ist , habe_ich im vergangenen jahr viel zeit damit verbracht den besten anbieter zu finden - bis ich auf aferry gestoßen bin und mein suchen endlich ein ende hatte .

positive	i ' m always a bit_wary buying expensive items online from a company i know nothing about , but i will most definitely use them again when the tyres on our other car need replacing .

positive	i can ' t praise them enough !!

positive	their reminder emails were very helpful and their pricing was fair
positive	nice selection of latest clothes , good delivery time , and also they have a decent sale on almost constantly .
positive	best online shop for contemperary clothing .
positive	ordered a dozen_times and never any_problems .
positive	ordered a few fragrances from this comany , and the prices are best you are going to find in the uk .
positive	shipping takes around 0 - 0 days , but is free so i guess it isn ' t that bad !
positive	packaging is also top_notch ..
positive	great service , great prices , would highly_recommend !
positive	00 / 00 i could not find any faults with the process

positive	i even di my car_insurance through them .
positive	i shopped arund and found the best deal , then went through top cash back and saved even more !

positive	i sent it from london , it was picked_up from my house and went to birmingham .
positive	i booked this in on thursday_morning and this was picked_up and delivered by friday .
positive	it was not that expensive and i was shocked at the service .

positive	amazing !!
positive	!
positive	great weekend handled well by chillisauce , didn ' t have any worries ... and the hotel was much too fancy for a bunch of hairy ars * d men on a stag_do !
positive	next_day delivery for a good cost ( only £ 0 . 00 not £ 0 or £ 0 ) and the jacket i bought cheaper_than other_websites .
positive	so far , very good .
positive	it ' s quick to book and review .
positive	... this be a great website !
positive	love the layout , searching for products is easy and love the support they give .
positive	even on the rare_occasion where we ' ve had to chase something up or we ' ve had a problem with an item they ' ve been quick to rectify and offer a fast and friendly service .
positive	i have used thedrinkshop . com for quite a few_years and not only have i found their large_selection of alcohol at competitive_pricing , but their service delivery is top_notch too !
positive	with fast dispatch in quality packaging , i really can ' t fault them .
positive	the best dedicated online games shop on the web - great games , great prices , speedy dispatch , texts / emails / picture updates to let me know that my order has been processed , packed & sent .
positive	if you want pre_- ordered games to arrive on time or even ahead of schedule then shopto is the place to go !
positive	i have been exploring many websites that deal with mobile recycling but i was recommended mazuma by a few friends saying how quick and easy it was as well as great value for money so i thought id take a gamble .
positive	i have to say this is probably one of the most efficient and outstanding websites i have come_across .
positive	not only was it easy to place an order , but the efficiency from when i sent the phones to you to when i received confirmation that the money was transferred to my account was astonishing !
positive	literally about 00_hours it took .
positive	the money i received will now be going towards a few special presents as its my mums 00th coming up as well as my son oscars first birthday coming up .
positive	thank_you to all the staff who work for mazuma , you are all a credit to yourselves and i will be recommending your site to everybody !
positive	!
positive	we have ordered from printer land on a number of occasions and have always received truly excellent service from start to finish .
positive	i cannot rate them highly_enough .
positive	their advice on products is accurate and fair , and the efficiency of the ordering_process could not be better !
positive	first time buyer from them .
positive	they have the lowest_prices i have found and great deals !
positive	who don ' t like free_stuff !
positive	i can definatly recommend this site to anyone_looking to cash in on an old laptop .
positive	i came accross many sites and this one offered me the best price , i was a little_wary at first but there was no need .
positive	i got an_email_saying my laptop had been recieved the following_day after posting and a quote a few_days_later .
positive	my quote after inspection was £_00 lower_than my orignal but for a valid reason and the price was still more_than i expected .
positive	after accepting the re - vised quote i had the money in my payal account in no time !
positive	:)
positive	learn ' t so much .
positive	i was unsure at first , whether to put my tv on the wall , as i had always had it up the corner on a stand .
positive	my lounge isn ' t the biggest in the world , and every time i moved my furniture around i always felt_like the biggest corner in my room was sucked up by my tv .
positive	i rang home av , and spoke to ian , i told him my worries and concerns , he listened and gave me helpful advice .
positive	i didn ' t feel pushed or like he was trying to sell me anything .
positive	i arranged a time for him to come out and show me where he thought would be best for my tv to be mounted , and asked for a quote .
positive	working full time , i didn ' t think he would want to come out on an evening , but he was flexible and fit around me .
positive	happy with the quote , i asked him when he could do it .
positive	just 0 days_later , ian & jamie returned to hang my tv on the wall .
positive	one word describes how it looks - amazing !
positive	!
positive	i am so happy , and they even hoovered up after themselves .
positive	thanks home av , i will_definitely be recommending you !!
positive	all the best for your future .
positive	i really_appreciate to use the dial to save service as it provide me lots of facilities to get in touch with my relatives .
positive	best aerline to go in a holyday trip
positive	is the easiest_way to find your perfect holiday
positive	is the easiest and fastest way to shop
positive	tesco is the best food shop , the best prices end the food is very fresh .
positive	a greate companay , greate mobile deals !
positive	thank to mazuma_mobile , it was a greate experience , mazuma help me u sell my old_phones at a gtreate value . thanks
positive	supplement_warehouse is a great escape from the overpriced stores that offer the same product .
positive	it is very obvious the supplement_warehouse strives to offer you the best price for supreme products because of the amazing feature they have which is comparing a competitor ' s price and if a competitor ' s price is lower , supplement_warehouse will automatically make it less_than that lowest_price .
positive	i am an extremely_satisfied customer .
positive	i highly_recommend this website / service to any individual who plans to delve into purchasing supplements .
positive	i have been using printing . com for about 0 years now and i cannot thank enough for their fast and high_quality service .
positive	i recommend you guys to people all the time !
positive	thanks .
positive	i must_admit i was slightly skeptical ordering from digitalrev , especially because i had never_heard of this site but went_ahead with the purchase of my hs00exr fujifilm camera based on excellent reviews i had read about their services - i was not disappointed !
positive	the product was so carefully_wrapped as to avoid any damage .
positive	i thought there may be some hidden conditions attached due to the cheap pricing of the product , however this was not the case and they guarantee free shipping on their website with covered insurance ( not many sites do this ) and my mind was put at rest .
positive	the camera is absolutely new and perfect and i would definitely be ordering from them again .
positive	they keep you fully informed of delivery through the tracking_number and provide regular email_updates .
positive	perfect site !
positive	000_% would recommend .
positive	i ' ve booked a hen_night through a company before and wasn ' t verly pleased with the outcome of the night so was a little_apprehensive at 0st about booking through a company again but due to the limited time i had to book s ' thing as it was pretty last_minute i decided to investigate a little .
positive	originally when i put my options into the boxes at the beginning i went all out to see what the prices would end up at , it was a little expensive but after_speaking with mike agar (??)
positive	a consultant with hen_heaven who was extremely_helpful , we managed to get it to a price i thought people could afford and would still hopefully be a great night out .
positive	unfortunately our hen who is australian was stuck in oz due to visa problems and some of the guests decided not to come , but 0 of us went along and made the best of it .
positive	so manchester here we came ..... in the afternoon we did a cocktail_making session which was so much fun and we managed to drink enough for everyone that should ' ve been there .
positive	we didn ' t know we were getting nibbles at the end of it which was an added_bonus to soak up some of the alcohol .
positive	the meal and club_entry in the evening was at tiger_tiger which was fab .
positive	tiger_tiger has 0 floors to it so altho we had to be in there before 00pm to get our free entry it didn ' t really matter cos it was already quite busy and we spent most of the evening in the 00 ' s / 00 ' s section .
positive	the hotel was right in the centre of everywhere we needed to be so we saved money on taxi fares and it was very comfortable .
positive	the only_downside to the evening was that in tiger_tiger they questioned us about the 0 complimentary bottles of champagne we were to receive and also about the payment at the end , they accused us of trying to walk out without paying so i had to keep showing them the email from hen_heaven proving that we were to get the bottles and that everything was paid for which was a little embarrassing but overall we had a great night .
positive	like i said before i was a little_apprehensive_about booking through a company again but hen_heaven made things so easy that when the hen eventually gets over here i may well be booking through them again .....
positive	traded in a couple of idevices with no_problems at all .
positive	recieved a decent amount by cheque .
positive	communication was excellent throughout .
positive	will certainly use again .
positive	i rang customer_services at 00 : 00 on 00 / 00 / 00
positive	i had miss placed all my phon numbers and had no way of getting them back i needed one contact asap and i spoke to a guy called michael he was a star !
positive	he found it no problem at all and has made my day .
positive	i cannot_fault anything from this company .
positive	we first bought a sideboard and a telephone table .
positive	then afterwards we went back for a table , mirror and bookcase !!
positive	the quality of the furniture is next to none and the price is even better compared to other oak_furniture i ' ve seen .
positive	everything from service in store to the delivery men where fantastic !!!!
positive	thank_you !!
positive	it makes a change to see excellent customer_service like this !!
positive	!
positive	amazing site !
positive	instant key delivery , very happy what more can you ask for =)
positive	very happy with service .
positive	item dispatch was fast as was delivery .
positive	quality of clothes was high as was printing .
positive	very happy and would definately_recommend .
positive	0 * company :)
positive	there are a number of hostel booking sites , but hostelbookers seems to have more options without charging any fees .
positive	last_week i got last_minute tickets through viagogo to the chelsea flower show which was incredible !
positive	despite the short_notice i got great value tickets , delivered well in time for the show .
positive	i have used them many_times before and never once had a problem with tickets or using the site which i personally find clear and easy to use .
positive	i would strongly_recommend viagogo , especially for when looking for last_minute tickets .
positive	it helps me save money on my supplement_needs :)
positive	last weekend in budapest was fantastic thanks to the guys at chillisauce !
positive	from start to finish everything was well_organised , involved brilliant activities , was great value and saved us heaps of time .
positive	i ' ve actually been on a chillisauce do before , but thought it was all down to the hard work of our mate .
positive	now i know better .
positive	would i use chillisauce again ?
positive	it ' s a no_brainer - yes .
positive	i ' ve never had any_problems with magic_madhouse and i ' ve ordered from them > 0 times now , the cards come within 0 days and the cards arrive in an immaculate_condition .
positive	i can ' t think of any_problems i ' ve had with them and their loyalty service is second to none .
positive	we purchased little life toddler reins in fairy wings style .
positive	my daughter absolutly loves the design as she feels she has her own bag instead of wearing reins .
positive	the zip compartment is just right for a small teddy and a cup of juice .
positive	the strap is strong and not too long .
positive	the delivery was quick and all in all a wonderful service .
positive	we are very happy and will shop with coz mole again .
positive	i ' ve been using this website for around a month now and i can ' t say anything wrong with it , they have good prices and a good collection of games , this paired with a quick delivery system for the cd_keys is just fantastic
positive	the website was well - designed and very friendly to new users , providing helpful information at a glance on the left pane when booking ( e . g .
positive	00h internet / wifi , luggage room ).
positive	love the website !
positive	i ' ve bought two guitars from richtone , and the service has been great both_times .
positive	both arrived exactly when they should have ( which was next_day delivery ), and the two guitars were set_up beautifully .
positive	not sure what more you can ask for really !
positive	there are quite a few different sites on the internet where you can buy cd - keys to games for a discounted price , if , like me , you are not interested in owning the physical media and would rather just download the software .
positive	by experience , i can say that the only site that never tried to cheat me or sold non - working keys is oks , and i tried quite a few .
positive	if there does arise a problem ( which is inevitable with any shopping site ), their support was always quick to answer my questions and helped_me out very fast .
positive	you can also follow them on facebook , where they generally reply very fast to questions about new products or post announcements regarding new games .
positive	overall , i can definitely_recommend buying there .
positive	[_name ] made sending my parcel so easy .
positive	even when i got it wrong , [_name ] fixed my mistake quickly and efficiently .
positive	a credit to your company !
positive	!
positive	great meat , great service !
positive	i will be using weston gourmet again .
positive	i ordered the althena bodycon plunge dress from missguided on the october 0rd , my dress then arrived the next_day with free delivery which i was so excited about !

positive	0_stars !!

positive	this was a great company they were very quick ( almost scarey ) but never the less pleased with the end_result
positive	thank_you for your great service and knowledge when i made my purchase .
positive	deciding on the correct high - end watch was not an easy decision , but the knowledge and information i received was fantastic .
positive	it is our second family purchase from xupes . com and i am sure there will be many more to come .
positive	i was a back seat passenger in a taxi , en_route home from a night out , i was sleeping in the back of the cab when i woke_up in a cloud of smoke .
positive	turned_out the taxi was driving too fast for the weather_conditions and bounced off 0 cars on either side of the road .
positive	, i took the registration of the cab i was in just in case he wasn ’ t insured , and ended_up getting another cab home , suffice to way this time i was wide awake .
positive	put my case though accident_advice helpline and gave them the only piece of information i had , the registration of the cab , they did all the work for me , tracked down the cab driver , cab company and all the insurance details .
positive	they were very informative from the start and helped_me through the whole_process , which was a lot_easier then i anticipated .
positive	three months later i got a cheque in the post for £ 0000 , could not have asked for a better company to deal with my case , highly_recommended , and would defiantly use them again if i ever get into an accident , hopefully i don ’ t but you never know .
positive	very quick , efficient and reliable company , d

positive	great service .
positive	helpful on the phone and quick delivery .
positive	i decided to use mazumamobile based on the great reputation they have for customer_service and i wasn ' t dissapointed !
positive	the website was very easy to use and only to a couple of minutes to place an order to send three phones .
positive	the price quoted was up there with the other_websites too .
positive	the pack to send the phones in arrived the next_day and again was easy to use with the forms to submit already completed .
positive	free p_& p too .
positive	i went for the option of a cheque and this arrived two days_later , even in all the postal delays due to the snow .

positive	the service when i phoned up could not have been better .
positive	i was told about the difference in chairs and also what was the best size table for my decking and rattan warehouse were correct in all aspects .
positive	just all put out and i have to say what a lovely set of furniture it looks , the cushions are sooo nice as well ..., not those cheap thin ones i have seen on some sets i have viewed .
positive	a really good website with a back up and sales_team who really know their stuff .... and the delivery driver was also friendly and couldnt do enough to put furniture in the garden , and my garden is 000ft long and the decking is at the back !
positive	!
positive	just a really good website and great ' real_person ' experience !

positive	brilliant website , fantastic staff to follow_up the easy to use website .

positive	i wouldnt use anywhere_else to find info about a movie than here , it has it all .
positive	the review system could use a bit of work as films are always rated loads of 0s and 00s to try and balance the scores out but if people would just rate them properly then it would be so much_better .
positive	id still give it a 0 out of 0_stars though as everything else just works so well .
positive	google is by_far the best web search_engine around , nobody does things half as good as these .
positive	also i am very happy with the way google android is coming along with each release it is getting better , cant_wait_till they are up there giving microsoft a run for their money in the home os markets .
positive	shopto are in my opinion the place to go for your games , cheapest prices in most_cases , a great reward system in giving you points that equate to cash to use for future_purchases but best of all the superb fast delivery times .
positive	i have ordered items as late as 0pm and received them the day after , never had a late item delivery , in most_cases i have had games a day or 0 before_release_date .
positive	couldnt praise them more and cant really ask for more from a company .
positive	everything was there as advertised and we ' ll packaged .
positive	what more could i want .
positive	really good service and very quick .
positive	was also impressed with the security as i used a different email in sign_up to my paypal addy .
positive	was quick fix to verify !
positive	i was astonished by the speed of service .
positive	i ordered twice , and both_times the products arrived the next_day , which is remarkable given the small postage charge .
positive	saved 00_% over the next cheapest alternative - all_round excellent service .
positive	i have used eframe twice now and have been very impressed with the speed of the service ( considering the frames are custom made ) and the quality of the product .
positive	i will_definitely use them again .
positive	thank_you so much sky tour !
positive	i had booked and then cancelled a flight reservation from sky tour .
positive	however , it took a long time for the amount to be deposited back into my account .

positive	and finally the money was returned to me by my bank .
positive	the response and reply from sky tour customer support was very prompt , efficient and helpful .
positive	thanks again sky tour !

positive	i tried to move my transportation business on the web by creating a simple , yet practical reservation system that increased my traffic .
positive	starting from the technical aspect of setting_up the web_site and continuing with the logo and web_design , firm branding and seo enhancements that would attract more clients to my site , pph freelancers were there for me ; not only to successfully complete the task i was assigning them , but also to give me insights on how to set_up my service more efficiently .
positive	what ' s more important is that when i didn ' t know how to find what i wanted or had questions , their awesome customer support was there to assist me and help me move on .

positive	i witnessed a 00_% increase of traffic in my business via the online reservation system in at about 0 months .
positive	thanks for that pph !

positive	simply_games have always been a reliable online presence for me and with the big names failing in their customer_service obligations lately ( game ' s delivery time is terrible and amazon have whacked their prices up now that hmv and play are gone ) they ' re well placed to take a lot of my custom .
positive	i ordered bioshock_infinite and within a couple of days it had been despatched by first_class post and arrived 0 days before_release .
positive	would ' ve been with me a couple of days earlier even , but for the atrocious postal service in my area .
positive	the icing on the cake was that the game dropped in price by a few_quid after my copy had been despatched and , without having to be asked , simply_games had reduced my invoice to the new lower_price .
positive	a great , and hopefully long_lasting , retailer !
positive	i ordered a playstation 0 , an extra controller and gta v , all works great apart_from the extra controllers left analog is a bit loose so it doesn ' t spring back to the centre - would be nice to have advised that on the page , other than that it works great .
positive	all in all great buy , cannot complain for the price at all , plus the quick delivery .
positive	very good .
positive	i cant_complain one bit not only did i get an amazing price but i also recieved my codes instantly .
positive	payment was quick , simple and fast .
positive	i withhold complete_aquatics with high regards , there customer_service is second to none .
positive	when i got in contact with complete_aquatics when seeking a new aquarium , i wanted someone who could prescribe an aquarium with corresponding accessories specific to my needs .
positive	i spoke to a gentleman named chris who dealt_with my order promptly and efficiently , he had all the time in the world for me ( 00_minutes on the phone !).
positive	as i ’ m quite a novice when it comes to aquariums , he gave me allot of tips , ideas and recommendations for my newly commissioned aquarium which i purchased directly from complete_aquatics .
positive	advice varied from landscaping ideas to livestock and the initial setup process for the aquariums ( very helpful indeed !
positive	).
positive	the order and delivery was seamless ; delivered within three working_days from date of purchase .
positive	prior to delivery , chris gave me a courtesy_call to give me a confirmed date and time for the delivery .

positive	everything i needed to get me started .

positive	thanks a lot !
positive	hostelbookers is cheaper_than the competition and at worst as reliable and at best far more reliable .
positive	earlier this year our company began contracting out proof reading of marketing to grammar genie as a trial due to the high costs of proof reading and copy editing we were paying to our print management company .
positive	the member of staff we dealt_with was sharon .
positive	the service from her was very quick and efficient and and attention to detail was unprecedented .
positive	we sent off numerous marketing campains to her to be checked , and thought they were grammatically perfect .
positive	we were somewhat mistaken to say the least .
positive	in 0 days sharon had uncovered dozens of errors , and edited the documents for us giving a list of all the changes she had made .
positive	not only that , she changed and reworded many sentences to make everything flow better .
positive	sharon has since worked on our company website , legal letters , employment contracts and all our marketing .
positive	i cannot reccomend the services of grammar genie enough .
positive	very reasonably_priced , and worth every_penny .
positive	i would happily_recommend to others , great experience dealing_with this company .
positive	super_fast delivery , i placed my order just after 0pm , it arrived the morning next_day !
positive	packaging was also very good ... fantastic service , would definitely_recommend

positive	i ' m yet to have anything break en_route .
positive	would recommend twe to a friend , and in fact it was recommended to me by a friend in the first place .
positive	got a tub of retro sweets as a present for a friend ' s four children .
positive	hopefully they ' ll love it .
positive	one of the review says that the tub was not nearly as full as the picture implies : i would have to disagree .
positive	i bought a few extra bits to add to the tub so that there were four of each of the more popular items ( popping candy , for example ) and had difficulty fitting any more in there !
positive	i signed_up after trialling the product for a week and was amazed at how simple everything was .
positive	they certainly picked a good name for the product !
positive	i ' ve found that the software can do an awful lot , but the way in which it ' s presented makes all the difference .
positive	i was all setup and emailing candidates within minutes .
positive	i ’ ve found their technical_support to be very good and they are always updating the product with customer suggestions .
positive	such a breath of fresh_air from my previous software which shall remain anonymous :-)
positive	tracking_number and communication through email let ' s you know where your product is and when it will arrive which is well decent .
positive	the site itself has got really wide_range of clothes , definitely should be able to find the brand you like and it ' s got a mint sale section , well worth a browse around , you ' ll find something you like easy .
positive	i bought a new laptop and wanted to sell my old .
positive	i searched the net and found the best price here !!!

positive	i ' ve checked !).
positive	never had a problem confirming my reservation through them or checking in with my reservation at hostel locations across the world !
positive	highly_recommended for students and young people looking to travel on a budget !
positive	as always with the whiskey_exchange the parcel was extremely well_protected and was delivery next_day via parcel_force .
positive	the prices you can ’ t beat and the descriptions of the taste , smell etc is usually spot on .
positive	i would recommend this company to anybody who_wants top quality drink at extremely competitive_prices .
positive	cult_pens could not have provided a better service if they had tried .
positive	i asked if they would price_match another offer i had received which they had no issues with at all which saved me a great chunk of money and even included next_day special delivery at no extra_cost .
positive	email communication was absolutely impeccable and i received replies within minutes .
positive	i deal with three different people via_email but each was extremely_helpful and willing and seemed like they were working as a team .
positive	the same was experienced when i rang up to place the order ; very pleasant and courteous .
positive	the item was delivery on the exact date i asked for and was in immaculate_condition with superior packaging ; i did change the delivery destination and postal date after_placing the order but there were no issues at all in doing this so again another great positive point .
positive	overall , a brilliant service and i will_definitely use again as and when i need .
positive	i mean there is not much i can say accept the fact that the prices are low and the time in which i received the key was under 0 min .
positive	no reason not to give 0_stars .

positive	the items were very well_packaged especially the hdd .
positive	will be buying a new monitor from them soon .
positive	thanks
positive	well i was supposed to have a reunion of sorts with my rebel girl gang from college and was not sure what to buy as it was summer .
positive	my problem was that i was supposed to meet on the weekend and was really caught up at work .
positive	so during a chit chat with a colleague at my work she suggested to buy a dress online .
positive	she in the same breath suggested to check out miss rebel .
positive	being summer i wanted something flowery and vibrant .
positive	in the evening when i logged_into missrebel . co . uk it was in for a surprise for the share range and cost at which they sold .
positive	unbelievable !
positive	gosh , it was a crisis of plenty !
positive	trust me it was tough to decide what not to buy !
positive	the summer collection was so beautiful .
positive	and it took me 00_minutes to decide on a long summer dress with flower patterns .
positive	not easy for a girl huh !
positive	but most who i had heard from about internet shopping came with a warning about the problems in delivery .
positive	but due to work constraint i gave it a shot !
positive	this was wednesday_evening and i was set to meet my four friends on saturday .
positive	guess_what miss rebel delivered the dress at my home soon after i came back from work on friday .
positive	and that really made my day !
positive	so when i went for the reunion , i received compliments from everyone .
positive	i would strongly_recommend missrebel !!!
positive	keep rebeling gals !
positive	!
positive	they were able to answer the questions i had about my course in a clear and helpful manner
positive	quick and easy .
positive	money transferred to my account same day they received my phone .
positive	should also say i received full_amount unlike some other similar companies who knock off money for small defects / marks / small scratches to the phone .
positive	have used mazuma a number of times in the past and will_definitely use again in the future .
positive	spoke to reshmee who was extremely professional , brilliant and courteous over the phone and not to forget her super efficiency for sorting_out our complicated flight pattern and being extremely patient when we had changed out minds on a hotel that we had booked .
positive	extremely knowledgeable and knew_exactly_what we would be looking for .
positive	will always continue to use reshmee to book our away holidays and will always recommend to friends and family !
positive	always a good selection , competitive_prices and first_class service .
positive	i ordered rad new vans that i couldn ' t find on the high_st , cheaper_than other_websites i found them on .
positive	urban_industry has a great browsing system and interface .
positive	only took two days for the order to arrive .
positive	shame i already got mud on them ...
positive	eagle saver is great and fast !
positive	from getting your dvd ' s put in their system for a quote to getting the check in the mail it was all so easy and effortless !
positive	they did an outstanding job with keeping me up to date with what was going on and i got my check really fast too !
positive	way to go eagle saver i would recommend them to anyone in need of selling dvd ' s !
positive	i was very pleased with my order that was a gift !
positive	the person loved it and the fact that it was personalized because she can never find anything with her name on it !
positive	she loved it and i loved it !
positive	this autocentres is the best i have ever visited , i had a flat back tyre so having limited options i called the aa for road side assistance , having more knowledge into the flat tyre , it was just a slow puncture .
positive	the aa man suggested , to go the local garriage which was only 000 yards from were i was stationed .
positive	my son had come_across this eden tyres & servicing from an app called near me , which located this garage ( by chance ) because it was the closest in my area .
positive	the loverly polite staff took a look at the tyre described that it was a slow puncture , so they offered to examine the tyre , so the polite staff , took care by placing a sheet over the driver ' s seat to stop it getting dirty and examined my car for free .
positive	this was a total shock to me , it was such a reliable examination , no exaggeration , it was also a fast examination , only sitting in the waiting room for only 0 minutes .
positive	to my surprise they had repaired the puncture free of charge what a survive .
positive	they did not try to sell any tyres , but told us the truth .
positive	i asked how much they charge for a replacement , and to my amazement they told me that it only cost , £_00 and where i normally go in chesterfield it cost £_00 , what a saving .
positive	so to conclude i will_definately be visiting again , and if you are in the local area of 0 & 0 pentrich road ( opposite screwfix ), giltbrook industrial park , giltbrook , nottinghamshire ng00 0uz ., near the ikea , please give them a visit because they have amazing services at great prices and such a polite and willing service , which everyone will warm to .
positive	please give them a ring at : 00000_000000
positive	so far so good .
positive	the prices can ' t be beat .
positive	good customer_service if you ever have to speak with them on the phone .
positive	i have been using ebuyer for my pc builds for well over 0 years now , and i can_honestly say i have never had an issue with the service they provide .
positive	their free delivery is a blessing , and their charged shipping is at a reasonable_price for those times when i ' ve needed things through next_day .
positive	all items are well_packaged , with plenty of " stuffing " to keep components safe during_transit .
positive	they stock a wide_variety of products ; from value for when you ' ve not got the cash to shop for big name brands , to said big name brands .
positive	though it should be said whether you shop for either they are all of a high_quality .
positive	defaults in products happen , and that isn ' t the fault of the company shipping the product to you ( unless they make it of course !
positive	); so on the one or two occasions that i ' ve been delivered a faulty product , i was very pleased that i had absolutely no issue with the returns service ebuyer provide .
positive	their response to my issue was quick , and i got my replacement quickly .
positive	i know this review sounds_like a massive advertising campaign for ebuyer , but given the many years i ' ve been using them and how well i ' ve been treated as a customer i think it ' s well_deserved .
positive	i look_forward to many more years of great deals , and happy shopping !
positive	fantastic service and quick delivery .
positive	product arrived in excellent condition and with adequate packaging .
positive	will_definitely be using again .
positive	sold old htc_desire with a broken screen for £_00 .

positive	hi ,
positive	i just wanted to thank the team at parcel0go for making parcel sending so easy .
positive	i sent a parcel with them in january and had no_problems , then received emails from them with offers so i logged on to send another .

positive	i have to say the everything was brilliant :) i had a few queries when sending my parcel and wih my account so was in contact via the live_chat a couple of times and the team ( charlie , sammie , stephanie ) were very helpful and attended to my every need .
positive	it is a very simple and easy process and i would recommend parcels0go to everyone .
positive	the collection was made on the scheduled day ( by city_link ) at 0pm and was delivery was made to the recipient 0pm the following_day .
positive	i am very pleased and advise_anyone who reads the negative_comments to ignore them , parcel0go are 0 *****

positive	after ringing and speaking to a friendly , helpful sales man , i arranged to view a new rolex at their maidstone offices the very next_day !
positive	tom holland was very professional and knowledgeable about rolex ' s .
positive	the sales room is very secure and you are made to feel very welcome .
positive	i would definitely_recommend watchfinder and am already looking at more watches to buy .
positive	thank_you .
positive	he reservado muchos hoteles con esta empresa y nunca he tenido problemas , recomendable 000_%.
positive	a . a . a
positive	amazing people , amazing company and amazing service i am lost for words when it comes to the service from this fine establishment and i can_honestly truly say that me and my co - workers and friends are very happy all together .
positive	keep up the good work !
positive	really fast , simple and easy !
positive	would reccomend to everybody !
positive	i sent my phone off on the wednesday and the money was in my bank on the thursday so it was a very fast service .
positive	got a cheap last_minute deal with these people .
positive	the rep was great , the hotel fab and the skiing great .
positive	would go again , but doubt i will ever get that price again , £_000 for the week !
positive	bought two or three times and always the advise of the women on the phones is excellent .
positive	everything fits and if there is ever an issue they always sort out there and then .
positive	good prices and a vast_range of skiwear .
positive	one of the best on the internet .
positive	the instrument to everywhere .
positive	the gateway to shopping paradise .
positive	how would we work , play or pis $ without them ?
positive	fantastic range , amazing service and fast delivery .
positive	all that , everyone has .
positive	these people have this plus they have the best price on the internet .
positive	they should be the biggest and best for outdoor , camping and skiwear anywhere in the uk .
positive	no doubt they will be .
positive	i have used overclockers . co . uk a lot over the past_year , every time the service has been excellent .
positive	i ' ve had problems with most of the other online pc component retailers in the uk , but not a single_issue with overclockers .
positive	i highly_recommend them as first choice .
positive	i occasionally buy from tesco online and the delivery is always very fast regardless of whatever postage i choose .
positive	i bought mobile phone last_year off them for roughly £_00 delivered .
positive	took about 0 days to arrive but strangely i ended_up getting a postage refund , tesco said it was delayed : s , so the phone only cost £_00 delivered :)
positive	great service every time :)
positive	so many people down - voting carphone_warehouse because of yodel .
positive	yes yodel are terrible , and they shouldn ' t legally be allowed to call themselves a delivery company .
positive	and yes , carphone_warehouse shouldn ' t be using them .
positive	there is an obvious and simple way to get around this though .
positive	select the " deliver to store " option .
positive	i read all these reviews and decided to give this a try .
positive	it worked beautifully !
positive	the phone i ' ve been wanting for a while ( nexus 0 ) on the contract i wanted ( cheap as chips ) when i wanted it ( next_day ) with no_fuss whatsoever !
positive	avoid yodel at all costs - but don ' t miss out on a good deal because of it .
positive	maybe carphone_warehouse will pull their finger out and give these_idiots the boot eventually ... but until then you can still use them , get good service and a great deal too .
positive	most painless mobile i ' ve ever got .
positive	txtnation provides a 0st_class service in internet & mobile solutions , txtnation is not a company to keep up with the times the goal is to be an industry leader & present new innovative products to the client .
positive	ordered more_than a few items from deep_blue now and always receive items in a timeous fashion .
positive	when i ' ve called into the shop for some info prior to ordering the staff have always been very friendly and knowledgable .
positive	bottom_line is if you need any training gear then give them a try , you wont be let_down on service and you just might save a few bob .
positive	nothing to complain_about with this company .
positive	competitive_prices and promptly posted a packe to send my phones off in .
positive	the following_day i got an_email to say my cheque had been posted and lo and behold there it was the following_day !!
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	after royal_mail increased their prices i have been looking for a good quality service with good pricing .
positive	i decided to give transglobal express a go , the item was collected promptly and arrived in great condition the next_day .
positive	i would recommend transglobal to anyone , their prices are much_better_than going direct with some of the companies which is a big plus for me .
positive	i will be using them again in the future without a doubt .
positive	not having a clue about domains and servers etc , petru was a fantastic help to me , and was able to sort this as i couldnt with any instructions as i have no knowledge , you have a great team and i have been using 000 reg for almost a year now and i have never had any_problems so thank_you
positive	ordered on thursday had envelope on friday , recieved phones on monday had money through same day by card payment overall no_problems unlike_other services who changed the price once sent phone back , very good customer_service
positive	i ' m very happy with my shop on line , the delivery was fast ...
positive	i will buy much more ...
positive	i have to sat the slot games are big strength of kerching - there are obvious titles like ghostbusters and da vinci diamonds but lots of others to enjoy too and i have had some good wins to boot !
positive	:) having said that , i really_enjoyed roulette too .
positive	customer_service is good and i have never had any_issues with payouts / withdrawals etc .
positive	so i ordered call of duty : ghost key from cjs_cdkeys i didn ' t have to wait even a minute and i got my hands on the product very fast processing and very reliable !
positive	i will use this company on my future_purchases , thanks cjs !
positive	well first when i saw these prices i thought " what the hell , these games can ' t be that cheap " and so then i came here and read about this site which made me conviced it was a real deal !
positive	so i ordered few games and it took like about 0 hours , which didn ' t bother me aaand the keys worked !
positive	:) only thing that there were weird was that they wanted my photo and name , but i was okay with it .
positive	im going to keep using this site from here on :)
positive	have only directly purchased two games through this site - sid meier ' s civilization v and dragon age : origins - ultimate edition , but my direct group of friends has collectively ordered over 00 games and the results are almost always the same - cheap prices , almost immediate delivery of the cd_key .
positive	i did have to wait a bit for the dragon age key , but the effort from the team to keep on top of things through customer interaction was brilliant .
positive	definitely sticking with this company for my game purchases .
positive	also the extra step of having an xfire for live_chat goes above and beyond any of the other_companies around .
positive	00 / 00 - 0_stars .
positive	definitely_recommend to anyone_wanting to buy cd_keys ( or even replacement disc / box / manuals !)
positive	they have the biggest_selection and they even still carry jack0d and oxy elite pro !
positive	their prices are beyond fair and even give you a better deal if you find a better price else where .
positive	seriously there is no other reason to go anywhere_else .
positive	my first experience of cex has been very smooth , indeed .
positive	i wanted to trade - in the game , rayman legends for wii_u . cex had the best trade - in price for cash , so i signed_up and went through the process .
positive	one of the highlights would have to be the mailing label being absolutely free .
positive	excellent !
positive	then , it was as simple as packaging up the game and posting it through the nearest postbox .
positive	within 00 or so days , they had received it , processed it and sent the cash via bank_transfer .
positive	simple .
positive	not the fastest way , sure .
positive	but via post , not bad at all .
positive	being so simple , i am sure to use them again in the future .
positive	i have often heard of cex , but had never used them before .
positive	so , it was a nice surprise to find that their service was very straight - forward and smooth .
positive	i highly_recommend them !
positive	earlier this year , i needed a replacement power_supply for my computer .
positive	scouring the internet like i normally do , i found that ccl had the best deal and good stock_levels .
positive	and with a few simple clicks , i created the order and awaited the despatch email .
positive	it arrived in good time and everything was in order .
positive	simple as that .
positive	on a side note , i don ' t understand the bad_reviews on trustpilot .
positive	i ' ve been using ccl since 0000 when i bought a laptop from them and have never had any_issues with orders , then or now .
positive	and because of that , i look_forward to ordering from them again very soon .
positive	i hadn ' t heard of hifix before , but they were the cheapest when i was looking for some qav speakers , so i tried them out .
positive	not only did i get the cheapest price and free delivery , i also got fast next_day delivery !
positive	i ' d definitely use them again and it ' s comforting to know there are other shops online that cater so well for hi -_fi items .
positive	great service , would happily buy stuff from them again !
positive	i came_across 0000rpm when looking for some writeable dvds on ebay .
positive	they were shipped very fast and had the best prices i could find on the internet here in the uk .
positive	the next time i needed discs i just searched for 0000rpm on google and came_across their website .
positive	prices were slightly lower_than on ebay , but you do have to pay for delivery :(
positive	the range is better on their website , but like i said , you pay for delivery .
positive	personally , i ' d prefer it if prices were a little_bit cheaper but still with free delivery ( since they don ' t have to pay ebay fees ) but you can ' t have everything .
positive	still , highly_recommended if you want blank discs in the uk
positive	the perks are amazing , and they have a ton of stuff to choose from .
positive	i am very impressed with the discounts on the close to expired stuff that saves us a ton of money for quality supplements .
positive	i would recommend liberty_flights to anyone that smokes e_- cigs .
positive	the have great value products and they are good .
positive	also lots of variety .
positive	i bought the 0cm topper to replace my 0cm egg shaped topper from argos and man what a difference !
positive	the one from memory_foam warehouse is by_far a superior quality then the argos and was almost the same price .
positive	therefore the argos one was returned after 0 night .
positive	will_deffo be back here if i need more .
positive	instant rns alert .
positive	it ' s exactly_what every investor needs .
positive	keep it up
positive	very quick delivery product as expected and even cheaper then the manufacturer ' s website .
positive	plus free next_day delivery
positive	used printing . com in exeter to have booklets printed , the service was great and the staff all to happy to help with any_queries i had .
positive	everything was delivered on schedule and the printed booklets looked fantastic .
positive	i love this webstore - the navigation is silky smooth and the site very easy to read and the prices for the watches i was looking at are lower_than most other_sites out there .
positive	fast delivery too .
positive	thanks
positive	very prompt service .
positive	definitely use this company again
positive	i was referred this website from a friend and i ' m extremely happy with the pricing and the ease of shopping .
positive	so many options !

positive	they immediately provided a refund with no_hassles !
positive	0 * customer_service

positive	i will buy from supplementwarehouse again .

positive	schedule .
positive	i like them so much .
positive	best 0 star website
positive	simply excellent service all_round .
positive	would highly_recomend to anyone .
positive	i was very impressed that they double_checked with me that i wanted the item shipped to a different address .
positive	there was a technical fault and my item wasn ' t shipped , but when i emailed to enquire what was happening , the lady who dealt_with my email was very helpful , sorted the issue out straight_away and refunded the postage_costs .
