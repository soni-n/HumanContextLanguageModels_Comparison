negative	we have been charged this amount before by holiday autoes for a 0 day holiday .
neutral	the company obviously did not have the item in stock and would return the money to me .
neutral	does nt matter whos fault is it you will end up on losing side
neutral	was told that the last address would be where the new tyre would be put on .
negative	they never accepted that their servers are have problems .
negative	we had one of our account - entire reseller disabled because they claim some domains within a cpanel / subscription overused resources ( clearly not an unlimited hosting as claimed ).

negative	when they called me they claimed to be her majesties revenue and customs calling about tax credits .
negative	all i can say is buy you pc etc from somebody_else as i will be doing in the future and also i will be recommending this to other people and buisness .
neutral	seeing amazon grow over the years has been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different_types of goods .
neutral	however , way too expensive .
positive	from your pre_- workout to your post and everything in between , they have it all right here , super detailed_descriptions and pictures so you know exactly_what you ' re buying and you don ' t have to deal with any of those annoying salesmen trying to get you to buy everything on the shelf .
negative	spent_ages uploading photos to an album and when i clicked on ' order prints ' it wanted to me to upload them again .

positive	the bus was waiting when we arrived at alicante and picked us up at the hotel on time .
positive	thank_you for all your input , which sometimes is not always there with other_companies .
positive	sure you can buy most of the titles they sell elsewhere ( steam / origin / uplay etc ), but they sometimes have good deals on that aren ' t running on the other_sites , they ' ve nearly always got discount vouchers , and you can even trade some of your games back in ( i think any that use gmg ' s " capsule " thingy )!
neutral	i believe a lot of small improvements can be made but the it team ( if they use the site ) should be able to recognise most of these .
neutral	buymobilephones of course didn ' t have any malware or popups that i am aware of but it ' s not a good frontage for a site for first_impressions .

negative	i was then met by a complete jobsworth at the warehouse claiming he doesn ' t know what to do as the computers are down today .
negative	for goodness_sake , don_'_t waste your time , energy and goodwill .
neutral	but the down_side was the first guy that was sent out with just a plunger couldn_'_t unblock the toilet , the second guy sent out the same day with a jetting machine couldn_'_t unblock it ( but he had a remote_control ) the next_day sent billy who was the best but was limited as the equipment that he had wasn_'_t as good as the second guy & had to jet from the drain to the toilet .

positive	if only all companies were like this .
negative	i did offer for them to credit note me as i wanted some more_expensive items as an_alternative but they refused !
negative	my hunch is either the company are extremely disorganised and have lost my return package , or they decided the gloves are not resaleable without the cardboard label so not to give a refund .

positive	even if you don ' t shop online very much , just using it for essentials or one - offs like car or home insurance , buying phones , booking holidays etc , get ' s you so much money back .
negative	** another update **
negative	no card was left .
positive	always been very impressed with this company , thats_why i always use them , i have no_complaints about anything they '_ve done , all '_s really good . would always recommend .
neutral	i purchased a hoodie for my grandaughter who is petite , when the top arrived it was way too small , but she was able to return at no cost to herself , and received a larger item which fitted her perfect just a few_days_later .
positive	i would quite happily_recommend them on my present experiences .
negative	i decided to buy this ring as i didn ' t want to end up with no ring at all .
neutral	it takes you ages just to pay your invoice , and to make a complaint about someone not paying you again is far too complicated .
negative	00_minutes so far .
neutral	acceptable experience , but not desired quality .
positive	-- price is affordable -
neutral	none of the people i recommended to sign up thinks it is worth it .
negative	of course they don_'_t bother answering any of my e_- mails .
negative	zero_stars avaoid like the plague !
neutral	i ordered a belt for my printer and phoned after a week to see where it was only to be told it was out of stock for another 00 days !
negative	from the tracking it seems to leave the depot and return to the depot on a daily_basis .
positive	lets_hope i dont need them all !
neutral	but i had no confirmation of my order for a week and i could not get any response by email or phone .
neutral	way back in june , my wife bought some pre_- packed strawberries from sainsburys .
neutral	when she was cleaning them she noticed several blue pellets in the base of the pack in contact with the fruit .
positive	would definately order from here again !
neutral	finally , 00 days_later , olotels send me an_email_saying ' i checked into the hotel , and as a result , i will be charged in full '.
positive	everything that was requested was there and definitely worth the money .
positive	would definitely use again .
negative	rest_assured i won_'_t be using them again
positive	i use rapid at_least once a month and have yet to have a problem with any aspect of their service .
positive	really good product ranges and much cheaper_than the shops , even with postage taken into account .
negative	to sort out , we then left bt . 0 years later we moved_into our current property , there was a telephone line here that bt stated was not in use , they came in and re - connected it .
neutral	so if i ' d transfer today 000 € then i ' d lose (( 000 * 0 , 0000 ) - 0 . 00 ) - (( 000 * 0 . 0000 ) - 0 . 00 ) = 00 . 00 € usnig transferwise .
negative	later in the day i received an_automated email_saying my items would be collected the next_day (" saturday 00nd " - their spelling ).
neutral	!
positive	i reccomend to everybody .
negative	other than an offer to look_into the issue when i cancelled the flowers for going awol and an assurance someone would contact me within_00hrs ( a week_ago ) iflorist have ignored my communications during the last 00 days .
negative	guess_what - no sign of the parcel .
positive	you always find somethig new
positive	so , all in all , a good service and an excellent price .
neutral	they keep a reasonable stock of brand items unlike_some , but we have seen them change their management style .
neutral	the hotel was really busy - lots of people staying just a night so cleaning was really important - and they did it well .
positive	don ' t hesitate to use it !
neutral	organised service and friendly , but unhappy with the price after doing further research .
neutral	if you dont want hassle and peace of mind , book with someone_else and pay that little extra .
positive	despite the fact that it wasn ' t their fault that i hadn ' t received the order , they were happy to send out a repeat order without any fuss and were extremely_helpful .
neutral	generally , the prices are pretty good on expansys , offering cheaper alternatives to expensive branded products .
negative	help
positive	delivery prompt and very efficient .
positive	i doubt there is a company that could come up with a se better_than google .
positive	starts to work immediately after installation and gives the excellent quality of sound .
neutral	i agreed as everything was correct .
negative	unwilling to accept feedbacks to help them improve , i will not recommend this company to anyone . they might be good for people who just want to host one site and not too worried_about monitoring their website performance .
negative	i could have got it from another supplier for £_00 more .
negative	i booked online to have my exhaust checked and when i turned_up , the man at the garage was very rude and said i didn_'_t have an_appointment because i hadn_'_t phoned .
neutral	further to the above apparently negative_comments : an unsolicited refund of the additional postage_charges has_been received .
positive	every product is very well displayed and categorised professional_manner ,
neutral	the site ' s tricky to navigate if you don ' t know what you ' re looking for , so it ' s best to browse somewhere_else and then come here with the exact product you want in mind .
positive	picked_up quickly , flexible with drop_off .
positive	would definitely_use them again if the need arose .
neutral	the lack of any customer service , delay in canvas arriving despite paying the extra for next_day delivery has taken the edge of my first experience with this company .
neutral	?
negative	do not buy from notrotek , they have made my 00 year_old very unhappy .
positive	they constantly beat everyone on prices and often get lots of exclusives offers .
negative	i had placed an order online for my partner ' s birthday as she only likes this one type of flower .
positive	i would choose talktalkbusiness any day of the week over xln !
positive	but muubaa understand this and make the process so easy and pleasant if you need to swap a size or return etc .
neutral	and insurance that we didn_'_t want - tried to cancel no luck .
negative	had to fight to get my money back .
negative	so i called orange ( 00p each call to customer_service !
neutral	not the most confidence inspiring experience , but looks_like it should work out ok , and for a good price .
neutral	so far , it all tastes nice enough , and i feel that i got my money '_s worth , but there '_s no way that three_times as much would be worth £_000 .
negative	i had lost my receipt and one of 0 pack had been worn so i was unable to do much about it - although a trip to trading_standards has_been contemplated .
positive	a fast and easy transaction .
negative	i will make_sure that i keep all of the evidence for this situation so that when a " reputation " company comes along in 0 years time ( yes this has happened ) and ask me for proof then i will be able to accommodate !
negative	when i picked_up my car , the airport was packed with families picking_up cars and after waiting for an_hour was charged an additional 00uros ( thirty five euros ) it appeared on the bill as “ others ” when i challenged this i was told it was because it was late .
negative	if you leave a message on voicemail , no one gets back to you .
neutral	i did not enjoy my experience with this company and will not be using them again .
positive	viagogo is where you go when ticketmaster is sold out .
negative	couldn_'_t access webmail for several accounts under one domain .
negative	i am disappointed to have lost money and would not advise others to use this company .
neutral	i was disapointed because there was no air_con an we got bitten to death !
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	i looked for a card and there wasn ' t one .
positive	very pleased and would order again .
positive	delivered very quickly and the delivery service was great .
negative	i am getting quite concerned - the customer service officials are polite but can offer no assistance of any kind .
neutral	makes you want to got to the stores and buy a laptop knowing you can get it replaced straightaway
negative	from my first contact with them regarding the issue it took them 0 weeks to replace the faulty unit , plus i had to contact the manufacturer to arrange the warranty cover myself !!
positive	in other words it has almost everything that every web master ( not just beginner !)
positive	companies don ' t want any bad_reviews as it will stop people from paying them for rubbish service .
neutral	wasnt easy paying the discount price .
negative	stay well away buy tickets from direct site !!!!!!
negative	i was put on hold for 00_minutes , then she came back and told me she was escalating the problem and would phone me back within 0 hour .
negative	now off to check sellby dates on stuff after_reading reviews .
neutral	the hotel were fair , and agreed they would allow olotels to move the reservation to a future date free of charge .
negative	at that stage the watch was also available at other outlets for the same price .
neutral	replacement was sent and instead of courier delivery ( which would have been unnecessary ) i opted for a free bow_tie , but was a little disappointed that the free bow_tie was black when the shirt i ordered was also black .
positive	don_'_t think you could beat that for service .
neutral	if one was going to be out of the office , the other was fully_informed on the latest update .
neutral	in our case we did supply the reviewer with goods , but the user obvoulsy ordered something_else from elsewhere and got mixed up .
positive	0 .
negative	of course , by now the other outlets had sold the watch .
positive	since receiving the watch , i have recommended iconic_watches to a number of close friends who are considering purchasing a luxury watch , and i shall continue to do so .
neutral	other_providers offer this .
neutral	so to get a 0 star review based on user getting an item super quick is harder as we , as good retailers do this in our sleep .
positive	would recommend as they do not deserve the bad comments they have .
positive	cheap products and good quick despatch .
negative	wasn ' t collected until thursday and now on monday , it ' s still not their .
neutral	after a couple of weeks and a few more issues , i now have two lovely matching bedside_cabinets .
negative	they took my money and even_though i kept asking for the tickets they cancelled the day before .
neutral	come on sainsburys , time to put the care back in customer_care .
neutral	good or great service can only be measured on company ability to deal with things that go_wrong .
negative	two of my friends bought their tablets on other_websites for cheaper price than mine and got theirs after two to four days .
negative	i spent a considerable time and effort to spell out all the inaccuracies in his ridiculous email .
neutral	i bought two_pairs from glasses_direct , i have one pair with normal lenses with a blue tint , and another pair with the dark green sunglasses lens fitted .
neutral	however , they are like any other estate_agent after that , they don ' t do anything pro actively , you have to chase and hassle all the time to get any information or if you want your sale / purchase chasing up .
negative	again and found out nothing , they had no_idea if the tv had been dispatched .
negative	when i asked how long before it would be back to normal i was told i had to contact vodafone to find out .
negative	then she finally understood and promised to call me back that day after she investigates the matter .
negative	they never collected and , sure_enough the agent went home .
positive	even better was than on the day of arrival ( i ordered this a 00 at night and it arrived two days_later !)
neutral	it '_s a good idea , but the " sell ' em a tiny amount so they '_ll buy more " ethos they seem to have is too transparent .
positive	they have some of the best customer_service i ' ve ever used , and they ' re very quick at replying .
neutral	i love fb and i use it constantly .
positive	keep doing an awesome job guys .
positive	i been using collect_plus many_times as ebay seller , they have really good prices and so many shops around where you can drop your parcel even after work .
neutral	whilst the first laptop has worked as i would wish after purchasing the 0nd as a backup i put it aside .
neutral	i am not happy and am in the process of finding out what my rights are and taking this matter further .
neutral	so not at all impressed
positive	very impressed with the pricing , advice and speed of dispatch .
negative	ordered some 0 x 0 prints and received prints which are 0 . 0 x 0 .
negative	all they seem interested in is selling me an overpriced second_hand kindle .
neutral	second lot of shelves - not damaged but still some wrong_size .
neutral	eventually found email address to contact you .
negative	really disappointed
positive	great customer service ( rare in this day & age ).
negative	my mother explained to the florist that they had been cancelled so the florist said they would be free as it was their mistake .
negative	every week i had the same message back " we apologise for the delay , we expect the item to be with you by next week ".
negative	i have left messages on their answerphone and emailed them but no replies received .
positive	i wish everyone paid out so quickly !!!
positive	the information provided on the website during the build process , the quality of the e_- mail communication and the speedy and accurate delivery have all been first_class .
positive	i dont normally bother writing reviews , but have to say that the service that we received from russ at glasses 0 you was fantastic , and were over the moon with the finished_product .
negative	!
negative	had to leave my car in short_stay car_park which i then had to pay for on return .
positive	all the disputes iv head with them as a buyer and seller have been handled very well , and they can not be held_responsible for the conduct of all there users , though it would be nice if sellers could go back to leaving negative_feedback where necessary .
negative	! oh well they just cut me of !!!
positive	friendly service , perfect communicaton .
positive	however if you but from a random company , this is like buying the same item off of ebay , albeit a new item off [_external reference_].
neutral	but .
neutral	the specification for my machine was quite high for running xphe , but the performance is very poor .
negative	it '_s description sounded perfect .
neutral	i was told that it might not be perfect and its not .
neutral	first lets get something very clear i have had 0 triple glazed windows fitted that were fitted to perfection and the units themselves i cant recommend highly_enough .
neutral	casino ' s need to think more about their players and not just the money thats coming in .
positive	he sorted_out any little problems , and we felt he had our best_interests in mind the whole time .
neutral	i find some of the clothes a little chavvy at times and a bit dated .
negative	i therefore packed it myself and arranged for a courier at a cost to us of £_00 . 00 to deliver it back to proridermobility . com
negative	just had an extremely arrogant chap call me up from chess to tell me that i owe them money and that because i have ignored all their efforts to contact me over this debt his department the escalated debt department were now dealing_with the matter .
positive	everything comes really quickly & i have never had anything damaged or broken because they pack things so well .
neutral	always seems to be trying to trick you on the website .
negative	placed an order with tekshop000 on 00th_jan_0000 - for sony htsa 0 . 0 home cinema kit £_000 . 00 .
neutral	how long does a parcel take from lancashire !
positive	;)
neutral	can '_t complain_about the price of the arran jumper i bought for my husband , but the website said that it was 000_% wool and the label in the jumper says 00_% wool 00_% nylon .
positive	i will mmore than likely make a purchase in the future and will have no_reservations on recommending precious little one to anyone , fabulous service a **** company .
negative	yodel were no help either and lied to me that they would get someone to phone me back on my twice failed delivery .
neutral	good workers friendly & helpful , let me know how things were going .
negative	having unsuccessfully tried to purchase some items their non - appearance several weeks_later is really frustrating .
positive	great staff
negative	i ordered a macbook from them and paid extra to get it delivered on a saturday as i work full time 0 - 0 through the week .
neutral	we ' re with bt at the moment , have been for around 0 years .
positive	some of the mega deals are superb !
negative	i rang shedstore the day before to find out whether it would be a morning or afternoon delivery .
negative	i am now just passing this to my credits card '_s insurance department .
negative	potential_customers of yodel - please think very carefully before using yodel as your delivery source as it could have a damaging effect on customers future_purchases with you .
positive	yes you will pay more !!
positive	the cheapest comparison website for hostels
positive	very pleased with the service at perfume - click , great value , well_packaged and delivered super_quick .
positive	great exchange_rates , easy to use website , professional service , great communications , all add up to the perfect addition to holiday preparations .
negative	whereas this is big lie
positive	to sum up , i can definitely recommend printerland whether it is for printers or printer supplies and will use them again in the future .
neutral	but , this is the only time i ' ve had problems with them .
neutral	i have still not had my free_spins yet , so . since my cool off , nothing has changed .
negative	however , there wasn ' t even a comment or e_- mail to apologise for the inconvenience .
neutral	once the second booking was created we carried on with the payment .
positive	because the website explained that their collections are anywhere between_0am - 0pm , i expected them to be collected at the later time but , to my surprise , they turned_up at 0am the next_day !
negative	i ordered flowers for my aunts 00th_birthday to be delivered to her house but despite having her address and postcode interflora contacted me to say the florist had been unable to find the house which seems incredible i don , t believe the florist really tried as the house is on a main rd its not hidden away so i gave interflora a possible place where my aunt may beshe was having lunch out for her_birthday but i wasn , t 000_% sure she was there but the florist went there and just left the flowers without making proper enquieries , interflora sent me an_email to say the flowers had been delivered but then interflora rang me the next_day to say that the place where i thought my aunt was had rung them to say she wasn , t there so the flowers were left there another 0 days before the florist picked them up again and i found my aunts house on google earth and sent interflora directions i was very dissapointed that my aunt hadn , t had the flowers on her special day and i didn , t get an_email to say my aunt got the flowers in the end but my aunt wrote to me i won , t ever use interflora again the service was appalling the flowers were in a basket so they didn , t need making up like a bouquet and i stipulated that the flowers would need to be delivered by 00 noon
positive	even better price buying via quidco .
negative	who wanted to talk more about the membership i enquired_about .
negative	update_:
negative	asda stores limited ,
negative	its worth paying a little more to buy the stuff from a retailer who actually has a clue how to run a business .
negative	i was told that they were signed for by someone i ' d never_heard of .
negative	they also seem to know nothing about them , constantly miss - sexing them so people end up with an unwanted litter .
negative	totally not amazon ' s fault , after all .
positive	!
positive	snapped it up .
negative	now ill get the same message as everyone_else which probably wont work and receive no explanation .
negative	because i can '_t even get a response from their so called customer service team .
positive	emailed firstly but it was the weekend .
neutral	there was no attempt made to take his details so i couldn ' t follow_up on his visit .
negative	this is over 0 times my fully comprehensible insurance cost at home to drive .
positive	and it ' s easy to search all possible accommodation out !
neutral	update 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00
negative	until then , please continue to pay your account in the usual way .”
neutral	hopefully future encounters with ba will be better .
positive	ordered on saturday and got in on tuesday .
negative	there are so many up and coming companies and games that are far better .
negative	they suggested to me a form of words for a letter to be sent by recorded delivery .
positive	we will_certainly use them again .
positive	delivered by two very friendly smiling faces .
positive	they arrived the next_day well_packaged
negative	i got annoyed with the guy , who then checked the account and admitted that he was wrong .
neutral	not happy , but ordered 0 breakfasts at a stupid cost .
neutral	however the only reason for the three star_rating and not five is that the products build_quality is decreasing rapidly .
positive	would thoroughly_recommend could not fault the quality of service or product .
positive	i have bought toys for my two caique '_s ’ and they are great quality , i know they are safe for them ; they even put them in categories for the parrot ’_s size so i know they are suited for my parrots .
neutral	order was delivered on arranged day , but was unfortunately left by a secluded door , with no note of the delivery through the main door of the address .
neutral	the cabin_crew did nothing to resolve the situation , so i was left sitting in the wrong seat .
negative	again there was no explanation .
positive	otherwise there is an area cut through the rocks that leads to flat rocks where you can jump into the sea safely .
positive	thanks very much for your superb , and extremely professional service .
neutral	i think virgin games needs to update there casino more often and offer better bonuses like deposit matches and free_spins for new game releases , just a pound bonus puts a smile on everybody ' s face !
positive	after choosing the best printer for my requirements the delivery was the very next_day !
negative	god do i wish i hadn_'_t .
positive	will use again .
negative	partmaster website is rubbish , next_day delivery doesn ' t mention no sat delivery , you pay through the roof for a lousy controller !
negative	the answer was perhaps i did not have enough money in the bank .
neutral	the plus point is that i have an acceptable mobile case at an acceptable price .
negative	busy claiming a refund of my deposit from official_iphone_unlock , who seek excuses in ther tc ' s stating the service has been delivered , although i never accepted and proceeded with the upgrade to full factory_unlock and settling the oustanding balance .
neutral	order agreed and dispatched on schedule , but the week end intervened - they tried to deliver on a saturday , no one in , so no delivery .
positive	fantastic company 0 star
negative	upon ringing up customer_service to try to sort out my endless problems i have been met with rude , abrupt and ignorant customer_service agents and i am yet to have any of my problems solved .
positive	booking the hostel was extremely fast and painless and literally took less_than a minute .
neutral	this particular client has quite a high spend with me and i may lose a considerable_amount of business as a result of this .
negative	few_years_ago , was contacted by their telephone sales dept .
negative	all thru february i kept asking when it would be ready kept getting emails saying how busy they were what a backlog they had .
negative	this was insisted upon but i refused .
negative	they have only actually been in touch since this review ?
positive	like many others , i came into contact with this courier through purchasing off amazon .
neutral	the reason i am upset with the missed appointment is because my wife and i had decided to go to our caravan for the remainder of the week and wanted to get the windscreen repaired before we traveled .
neutral	update - after posting this review my issue was quickly resolved - so thanks to the team for jumping on this .
negative	" its either one of these or one of those " im told - being two different rated tyres .
neutral	received 0 tablets in a cardboard_box about 00x00x00cm with loads of paper packaging .
neutral	the price changed and came to the amount agent mentioned on the phone .
negative	by this time i had already brought some tickets from another website as viagogo had said they were not available .
negative	i am interested in learning more about the 00 days refund / return_policy with cpw and what the implications are of a forced repair service .
negative	grest waiting
neutral	apologising and offering to make ammends to the way i was treated by there p . r customer team .
neutral	who does eat cold poached eggs ??
positive	the points above did not bother us at all .
neutral	still a good deal but the inconvenience and loss of weight resulted_in me giving 0_stars .
negative	before you buy from grippy ask yourself the question " once ive bought these tyres and arranged time off work - will i mind when they dont turn_up and offer me a slot 0 days_later so i can do it all again ?".
neutral	i spent an unhappy hour strugging to find another source of help on the internet .
neutral	i ordered a couple of bottles of torres 00 , my favourite brandy , and the experience was satisfactory , more or less as i would have expected .
positive	it has been running well apart_from a couple of hick - ups but apart_from that it is perfect .
negative	my experience is very unique and trustpilot has deceived me .
neutral	also , they have mis_- advertised sizing of products that i have purchased resulting in too little area of an acoustic tiles product arriving ( by a long margin !)
negative	john said :-
positive	why would anyone pay full price from petshops when you can buy direct . delivered to your door and at a fraction of the cost
negative	terrible !
negative	but i did not receive any news from them until nov_00th which is more_than 00 business days . so i asked them to cancel my order . i got a mail from them on that particular day that saying they did cancel my order and i ' ll get back my money with in four days .
positive	i visited a store in brecon at the weekend and was impressed by the competent staff and good range of products .
negative	the online support was not very helpful so far .
neutral	the packaging was a black polythene bag with the shirt inside in a cellophane bag which had been ripped open in order to put in a bow_tie i had also ordered .
neutral	the hamper arrived beautifully boxed but the granite slab was unprotected in the hamper and arrived broken .
negative	contacted them immediately and gave all order details and told my account would be credited within 00 days ?
positive	great service , cheap prices , very fast delivery with great communication via emails to let me know the processing .
neutral	it ' s about gaining the best immitation item you can find at a lower_price .
neutral	too many hidden_charges in virgin usage not told until i told them i was switching then tried to offfer a deal , but could , nt match the savings that talk_talk allowed us to make .
positive	the site is easy to navigate and the products are high_quality , great service from simply_supplements .
negative	we ordered a kit for a charity football match that was due in 0 weeks from date of order and sent all the relevant_information and order was confirmed , was told order was on a 00 day service but as we had ordered so far ahead it was not an issue .
positive	good kit at great prices .
positive	despite that am more_than pleased with glasses_direct and i recommend it to everybody .
negative	didn ' t receive my order on the day i was supposed to so the next_day i phone up .
neutral	on a positive note your complaints team have been quick and efficient , i just think you should be more selective with who you chose to work with .
neutral	i would look around for a better designed product next time , hence i can '_t recommend this company .
neutral	but for most people the tiny trays you receive can be eaten in two or three mouthfuls .
negative	the vent i ordered was promptly delivered but with 0 of the 0 components badly broken and parts missing .
negative	somebody was telling porky pies as my wife goes and picks up the tower unit and i plug it in guess_what nothing had been done .
neutral	expect to get what you pay for .
neutral	but hell , they knew pretty well it was a rip_off when they pushed me for it !
negative	nothing but trouble , keep thining ill try again but always some issue !!
neutral	when i placed the order , it was meant to come with a free ' naked rub ', but this did not arrive .
negative	they also need to improve their customer service by answering emails and at_least answering phone_calls .
negative	i specifically stated i need this rings before 00th of august and wanted to make_sure i will have it delivered to the store on time .
negative	so i decided to contact them via their online email form .
positive	just what they offered - right on time - good price - and they sent me a text to say they had been delivered
neutral	the camera mounting bracket will need to be removed before the camera can be fitted to the bird box .
negative	chat again , 00_mins later , and 0 connections to chat i had my phone back and internet_connection on the mobile .
negative	now they are adding fees to the account and threatening me with their legal team who will apparently pursue me .
negative	i always leave a note on the door to say leave on the doorstep if no answer ( we are in a rural_area and our doorstep is very secure ) but only yodel are unable to carry out the customers wish '_s like their competitors .
neutral	prices are significant savings compared to other_websites , but delivery is very slow .
positive	i got a delivery a few_days_later and all arrived in one package , which made it easy to store until i started work .
neutral	we need to try cloths on its a simple fact of purchasing .
positive	they have a service where they will beat another company ' s price by 0 % which i have personally been able to use .
negative	failed to collect parcel twice rebooking both times , if you can avoid using them do so , no compensation for my wasted time .
positive	delivery to ireland within 00_hrs great product thank_you ( a refreshing way to do_business )
positive	i ' d been looking for the 0000 prevail red / black helmet at a 0000 sale price unsuccesfully for a while when ' up popped your fairy rutland_cycling offer '.
negative	what shocked me the most is that i arranged them to contact me regarding my order about a month and a half after_placing it and he just repeated what was in the emails they were sending .
positive	don_'_t think i will need the 0 years warranty , but great to have just in case anyway !
neutral	the only problem was that when i got to the hostel that night , no one was at the front_desk .
positive	this time i tried the payment direct through my bank_account and this service was excellent .
negative	if i lived closer id be down there collecting it in person !
negative	my wife and i had to take days off work for this ' service '.
positive	give amazon a try , you will soon realise why many people swear by it !
positive	francisco quiñones .
negative	in fact i received an emailing another 00_hours_later stating that my handset had been recieved followed_by another email only a few minutes later downgrading my original_quote by over £_000 !
negative	after 0 emails to customer_services and 0 months on i am still_waiting on my product i paid for .
neutral	the delivery came on the right time but only with wrong_size .
positive	they keep making all these changes but you get used to it .
neutral	i was not satisfied with your service .
positive	bought this lighter because it has so many uses , tough , reliable , ideal for when i ' m walking in the hills , confident it won_'_t let me down .
negative	i can ' t express how bad the customer_service was with just the same generic email being sent to me each week and not telling_me anything .
negative	then i found out that the property , who i never gave my credit_card_details had charged it again .
negative	ended_up having to cancel my direct_debit with the bank
positive	they were definetely the cheapest and were very friendly whenever i rang them .
neutral	two hours_later no one phoned i phoned again to be told " we are waiting on the warehouse so i have nothing to tell you " where is the warehouse china no cant be i have had items delivered quicker from america .
positive	wow !
neutral	i always check wickes first because they are always cheaper_than homebase and b_& q .
negative	bank is not involved at all .
neutral	overall it would have to be price that bought me back as after_reading other comments i suspect that many more_expensive items that are advertised as in stock are actually only ordered from the suppliers after receiving payment from the buyer . maybe i ' m wrong but it seems that many other buyers have had a similar experience .
neutral	i have been with o0 for a number of years , around about 00 i would say .
positive	arrived quickly and was easy to setup and use .

neutral	airport security have more important scenarios to attend to after all .
positive	i did notice 0 different sets of flowers with £_00 difference in the price_tag both had the same picture - which made things confusing .
positive	they both came after 0 days .
neutral	they also have a daily free game you can do and collect eggs till the end of the month for guaranteed free_spins and / or cash but you only ever get 0 egg which = a spin .
neutral	their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price , with the cheapest line installation around .

positive	never had to claim , but feel re - assured they ' d be on the case .
negative	after a month of using it the phone started to crackle and pop while we were on it , the internet was intermittent and to be honest it wasnt worth us having it , then we started getting bills for the dissconnected numbers and charges for call outs and dissconnection charges . of course i went up the wall at them and everytime i phoned i got the line ' we are sorry for inconvenience_caused ' you guessed it foreign call_centres !
negative	the helpline is not helpful .
negative	if you do try and use the website to find a property the only search criteria is by country !

neutral	what kind of business sends a middle management employee on a 0 week business trip with no cover ?
positive	i was particularly impressed with the hat and it will be just great for our cowboys and indians kids ' camp .

negative	when i asked why he has not taken the time to call me today i was informed that they could not deliver today and when they sorted the routes out tomorrow they will ring me and let me know what is happening .
neutral	beware of fitting costs when buying one of these products as it bumps up the price of your purchase .
positive	all in all , i would definitely use them again and highly_recommend them !
positive	i ordered a shower tray and a new sink from wd and it was a bit of a disaster as , even_though it had loads of packaging the courier managed to break the tray .

negative	i don ' t reccomend to anyone !
neutral	having the repeat all the above when i try to dial another number , or the number i was dialling was engaged or with no answer , this really gets my nerves .
positive	so , thanks to the negative_review ( from someone who was unlucky_enough not to purchase from john_ryan ) i found one of the best , british made mattresses and one of the nicest , most knowledgable companies to do_business with .
neutral	its good in principle but for me not worth the hassle when selling

negative	where is my gift_voucher ?
neutral	it can become very expensive when booking a lot of places , and especially when you ' re booking one night ' s accommodation that ' s possibly only costing you 00_euros , it costs you 00_% again just for the privilege of booking with them .

neutral	de plus ils s ' excusent , font un geste commercial en créditant notre_compte client ( pas notre_compte en banque , on est d ' accord .) de 00_% du montant de_notre commande ( à utiliser comme bon nous semble sur_le site ).
neutral	layout and feature overhauls aren ' t uncommon , and after they are introduced it doesn ' t seem to matter what people think - the changes are permanent .

positive	the information required was simple and straight_forward .
neutral	i ordered my item , paid for it and then 0 days_later i received an_email explaining that this item wasn ' t in stock and wouldn ' t be for the next 0 - 0 weeks .
negative	every time i contact them i don ' t get an answer as to where the refund is and get told they ' ll contact me but never do .
positive	well_done shopto !
negative	my advice is if your making a large purchase , don ' t do it from here .
negative	zero or less would be more appropriate .
negative	and not acceptable .
negative	awful service , rip_off thieves , unhelpful customer_services dept .
negative	i don ' t want your stupid marketing stuff ( let_alone pay for it ).
positive	my first_port of call now for all kitchenware .

positive	a positive_experience which should be the case when an expensive item is purchased online .
neutral	the retailer suggested they ' re supposed to * actually * attempt delivery and are obligated to wait for 00_mins at each address or they really get in trouble .

negative	0pm - no flowers .
neutral	further communications from delivery company poor , leaving us to chase up via mattressonline .

negative	my preference in this matter would be for you to deliver the items as i did pay for them and for a full delivery service anyway .
negative	then go to your local tyre shop .
neutral	the crack has resulted_in about 000 - 000g spillage .
negative	0 days_later got a phone_call to say the store had been broken into and they had taken my item . strange that the thieves went for my £_00 item when the store was selling £_000 items and these are still being advertised on their website so obviously the thieves did not bother with them ( perhaps they only like cheap items ??)
neutral	they rely_on their global brand to create the impression of trust and use deceptive and misleading sales_tactics to lure you into a false sense of security .

neutral	notwithstanding this and my wasted day , i waited in again 0 days_later for a technician .

negative	third lie .
negative	postal service very slow ordered on 00 december 00 .
negative	i then started telephoning them .
negative	apparently the customer is not right at all here and the management is beyond poor and could not have sounded more disinterested if she tried .
negative	not learning my lesson ordered a hells kitchen knife block & knives rrp £_00 . 00 wowcher offer £_00 . 00 got voucher ordered knives early september . still_waiting despite mailing complaint to wowcher who passed complaint to ' gadgets & gifts ' who i think are asociated with wowcher though i have no proof but the garden games were from g & g .
neutral	i am now not at home for another couple of days which means that i can '_t set_up my home office and get it all working .
negative	en appellant plusieurs de ces personnes on me fait comprendre que je devais refuser les condition écrite en tout petit :
neutral	day started well in nottingham on my stag_do with paintball which was awesome , we then went to book into our hotel rooms to find there had been not rooms booked and we were left waiting for approximately an hours ( vital time on your stag_do ) eventually we where put in a taxi to the other side of town moving us away from hooters where we had to be in 00_mins .
negative	when i phoned up 0 weeks in i was told a replacement was sent out same day so waited a week only to learn i was lied to .
neutral	final update
positive	i am satisfied , thanks .
positive	i ordered a t - shirt in the evening , they posted it the next_day , it arrived the day after that .
negative	you can ' t do business like this .
neutral	the free products seem great but if you put them in and then check with the shipping it will add $ 0 . 00 or 00 cents for the " free " item .
positive	some of those were recently released games as well .
positive	i think everyone should be on it , there ' s literally no reason not to be !
positive	they delivered on the day that they said and the product arrived in one piece .
negative	they are pleasant enough on the phone , but cannot help as apparently it is impossible for them to talk to hermes and hermes will not respond to customers !
neutral	i also am still fighting to get a refund for an item i have not received , it was ordered 0 weeks_ago and i thought it would be the highlight of my boyfriends christmas , but sugarush love have been slow and difficult , not to mention unapologetic !
neutral	their reply was quick and accurate but many replied in their own language which i found hard to communicate with .
negative	0 days_later i received an_email_confirming it had been delivered - long_story short and numerous_calls later i was assured they had cancelled the contract , they were aware a new phone had been fraudulently obtained by another person and i would hear nothing further .
negative	then i saw this site .
neutral	if they truly have the item in stock , you ' ll usually get a " it ' s on its way " email the next_day or so and everything is nice and fast .
negative	i cancelled my contract due to them not being to match a deal with t - mobile , that ’_s where the problems started !
negative	this was also convenient for me as carrying the packed items to a post_office would have been difficult .
positive	great comms , helpful service when i needed to exchange my purchase for the next size up .
neutral	as they use hotelbeds as their supplier you may as well go direct to them .
negative	i ordered some green tea pills on a saturday and i waited until weds and thought it was odd i hadn ' t had an_email to say they had been dispatched .
positive	good value as well .
positive	had a couple of items delayed by a few weeks until i got the keys , which was done by their helpful callcentre staff .
negative	if you actually want the ability to use your phone i would recommend using a different service .
neutral	i will be looking into the " supply of services and goods_act 0000 " to establish whether regus are in breach of contract by not carrying out their duties adequately .
negative	no delivery paperwork had been left , there were no assembly_instructions and the roll of roof felt was ripped and had holes in .
negative	what a horrible experiance .
negative	what if the address doesn ' t even exist or they say they haven ' t received it , because the address seems a bit wierd to me .
negative	hi guys ,
negative	i would strongly_advise anybody not to purchase from these_people as you can hardly call them a company !!
neutral	polite cabin_crew otherwise but bland food .

neutral	good joe browns range and £ 0 . 00 next_day delivery is great value .
neutral	have bought from this site and found the good '_s suitable for the older members of the family , nice stuff though , postage fast and return '_s are no problem .
neutral	i believe more support needs to be added for members to learn together and stay motivated .
negative	refund tx code : reffurniturein0000000000000000000 - f00
neutral	that '_s the best way he said he could describe it - ok but nothing special .
negative	when paying for 0 full years family insurance - it should have clearly_stated that it does not cover trips more_than 00 days .
neutral	presumably they get overly busy .
negative	so i rang customer_service , the man was very helpful , and refunded me half my shop .
neutral	were not as helpful as they could have been when i had problems !

negative	they have agreed to the refund but just aren ' t paying back the money .
positive	so far the samsung laser_printer ordered seems good .
neutral	mobile is just about acceptable
negative	i would not expect to complain to a supermarket to be told to go and speak to the farmer .
negative	yet it is they who owe me money !
positive	the first website i look on when i require new gear - everything very well priced , with excellent , helpful staff always happy to assist .
neutral	the porch is an open porch near to the main path so if they did deliverer the flowers anyone could of stolen them . on the postive side they did redeliver some new flowers but a few_days_later and i still paid for next_day delivery .

negative	omg suprise_suprise !
neutral	i have emailed regarding this and had no reply .
positive	but the tracking was great - told me within the hour when it was arriving and allowed me to have the option to leave with a neighbour .
negative	they operate 0 hour slots ( allegedly ).
neutral	delivery was quick - by 00 . 00am next_day so full_marks there .
neutral	we completed the necessary paperwork and went off for lunch and a pint .
negative	a lot of good reviews here about this company , but 00_% of them have never had to claim .

positive	i ordered a product but picked the wrong_size so contacted them and was able to resolve the issue easily with no complications or delay .
neutral	they told me they ' d post it to me the next_day ( as they ' d run out of stock and were getting a new load delivered ).
negative	how can so many errors be made every time ?
neutral	having made my order i was then informed that glasses i had ordered were no_longer instock and should not have been showing .
positive	i have recommended it to several friends all of who are as thrilled as i am as they can now afford the best for their pets .

positive	superb !
negative	i had the services installed and they were fine , however plusnet then had issues and they had a message about it on the phone , they came to check the line and said that they had found an old master socket under the carpets and they need to access that , however we said that wont be possible unless they want to pay the damages , which they said they wont do , they did not want to even send another router to check if that was the problem , however the connection was on fibre and dropped out so many_times that i was unable to use the net , so i went to orange ,
neutral	i ordered a pc which was delivered next_day ,
neutral	i have went down this road as it '_s still ok but i would have preferred to actually get " cash " xxx
positive	0st_class prices
neutral	sure_enough it '_s loud enough i can hear it from outside , so i can only assume the driver doesn_'_t know how buttons work - god_knows_how they figured out how to operate a vehicle .
negative	so after almost 00 months i gave them their marching orders .
positive	gains in deadlift and squats are much_quicker_than i thought it would be compared to the first few weeks of no supplement with training .
positive	they are a one stop shop for all electronic accessories and a whole lot more , all at excellent value for money .
negative	do you not care about the next generation who will inherit the planet from the rest of us ?
neutral	however , [_external_reference_] pay our automatically which makes_life a lot simpler
negative	please do not buy from , thus promoting , this shop .
negative	what a shame they can offer very competitive_prices but their customer_services badly lets them down .
negative	i had to contact them on a weekly_basis as they never contacted me bar 0 phone_calls basically telling_me that they were still_waiting for the item from their supplier .
neutral	their price was far cheaper_than anywhere_else on the web .
neutral	about three_weeks after paying the fridge_freezer , which actually requires some on site construction , was delivered and assembled by a separate courier company who could not have cared_less ( amazing for such an expensive product ).

positive	the veteran players i met laughed when i told them that not only had my first hand played online , but my childhood was spent at poker the virtual field and of course games for kids online .
positive	i would recommend this store to everyone !
negative	avoid argos !!
positive	he was friendly and cheerful and gave us good advice about unpacking and inspecting the items .
negative	no explanation was given so i checked the website and saw again that it had simply been cancelled .

positive	the price_match plus 0 % markdown option is what sold me .
positive	excellent printing speed and excellent quality printing .
negative	ordered a simple treatment product for furniture .
positive	whether this is down to m0yp or the royal_mail , i don ' t know .

positive	we have tried " doggy cds " thunder shirt , rescue remedy in his water , pet calms .
positive	i travel a lot and tend to vary my hostel / guest - house booking websites depending_on the places fellow_travellers have recommended to me and whether they are advertised on a particular website .
positive	useful as i lose receipts !
positive	they were perfect and even got the plastics with it that i didn_'_t expect or been quoted from the local manufacturer .
negative	i do not like being_ripped_off !
negative	be warned they are trading on amazon and not shipping out items but taking the money !
positive	very good if they arrive on time
negative	i was after three genuine apple ma000g / b iphone leads but being as apple wanted £_00 per lead , i thought it might be best to have a quick look round to see what deals were on .
positive	i personally think p0g should not use them as a supplier .
neutral	then you could in theory go through it all again .
negative	result ?
neutral	excellent quality .
negative	i ' ve made many complaints to them , but nothing seems to get done .
positive	the service was very good and i would highly_recommend diamond_geezer .
neutral	very useful service but customer_service is generally pretty bad .
negative	don_'_t expect an_immediate_response but will not give up on this without a fight .
positive	have used musikding 0 times now , and each order has got from germany to england in under a week , well_packed and with email_updates !

negative	southbank
positive	i also found the prices to be excellent .
neutral	the delivery not so good .
negative	it ' s now friday and i have them .
positive	i can_honestly say that i did not think i would be able to afford a new computer after losing my late beloved partner , but gimmitech and paybreak made this all possible for me for which i am truly grateful .
negative	they could deliver the next_day and leave in a safe_place .
negative	placed order with woolworth for some canvas_prints .
neutral	that said delivery was very fast and the price of goods and shipping very reasonable and i would still use fragrance_direct if i could be sure these problems didn ' t happen again .
neutral	perhaps i '_ve been lucky , but i suspect this company is fairly small and can '_t cope with the demand .
neutral	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
negative	rang them up recently , and was told that this is not so .
negative	plus , i found the website awful .
negative	i tried to ring customer_service but the line was dead .
negative	tried to order from vet medic and set_up an account .

negative	still_waiting for my goods after 0 weeks .
neutral	i have only bought one thing from myprotein , i don ' t wish to be bombarded with reviews .
positive	i didnt write this review until we had used them for 0 weeks .
positive	doible0 were clear and upfront with their pricing which i appreciated .
negative	i won ' t be holding my breath for the goods .
negative	the driver tried to telephone the store but couldn ’ t get through .
negative	not only that - but as the situation was an_emergency - instead of replying back to me via_email or calling me , the company decided to send a letter .
positive	the glasses are slightly thicker than what he has purchased in the past from a high_street store , but that could be down to the frame and tbh is not noticable at all unless you really look .
positive	i have used these_guys hundreds of times and only had 0 breakage and 0 lost parcel . not bad i say !!
positive	festive_lights had a huge_selection of beautiful garden solar_lights .
neutral	messaging no_longer works at 000_% sometimes you send a message more_than once or not at all .
neutral	we got a message from the customer_services team a couple of days_later to say that they were going to give me a full_refund and that has_been done so i have changed my rating from 0 to 0_stars
negative	they failed to follow my request to terminate my line and it took about four months from original request for them to finally disconnect their line , whilst i had switched within two_weeks of request to my new provider .
negative	despite this , i ' m not too disappointed , because indeed , ' quality costs more ' and boohoo . com is one of the many who reinforce this creed .
positive	the extremely_helpful know their stuff team offered me a full_refund with a next shop voucher or an_alternative product completely in my favour worth alot more which is what i took . i would strongly_recommend this irish company and will_definitely only use them from now on and will be back soon .
positive	i was able to have the delivery when i wanted it , the 0 hour_slot helped_me to plan and the guys were great - my central_london flat is in the middle of lots of building development and they had a very short time_slot to reverse into the site , get the bed and mattress out of the van , up some stairs , into a lift , 00 floors to the flat , and then remove the old mattress via the same process in reverse .
negative	what are the children making them getting paid ???
neutral	they are expensive but i like their designs albeit finishing on some furniture has_been disapointing .
positive	hadn ' t heard of the company before but received a 00_%_off discount_code from vodafone so decided to give it a go .
neutral	i found that the rates were the same as before and nothing different .
neutral	however , after another email to nicecans , they replied_saying they were very sorry and that they ' d been overwhelmed with how many orders they ' d got and they were really sorry that they hadn ' t got in touch before .

negative	after a little break of dealing_with myprotein i decided to give them another shot .
positive	nice and easy to book , very good deal for those on a budget and only a few pounds to secure booking .
negative	please do not use their service if you don ' t want to get ripped_off !
positive	overall , this is my go - to site for purchasing supplements .
neutral	you have suggested various_options which will provide a better service .
neutral	i ' ve used liberette for a few_years now .
neutral	could get a better deal somewhere_else .

positive	i ordered quite late and still received delivery next_day .
positive	this is the first time i have used this company and i am very impressed . they keep you informed every_step of the way and i received my item the next_day . highly_recommended to all .
neutral	that was a good while ago and still no reply , usually customer_services are reliable and fast , so now i don ' t know what to do with my item !
neutral	not fantastic .
negative	i phoned the number and found myself going to the voice_mail for a gas and property maintenance company - so are yodel now using gas engineers to deliver parcels ?
neutral	i have been a member of my local costco since it opened many_years_ago and i have been a regular customer and a huge_fan .
negative	and a bit of customer_service would have been nice .
negative	these self ( deluded ) awarded references are , in my opinion , completely false and very misleading as i will now tell .
neutral	the fabric is very good quality , the problem is the mechanism .
positive	thanks , dave justice
negative	absolutely outrageous !
neutral	i ' ve got 0 posters from the walking dead from them .
neutral	a bit disappointed to be honest .
neutral	i actually ordered a youview_box direct from humax last_week , and that was sent in a strong cardboard_box and packed with additional airbags to insulate the product from the inevitable rough handling by couriers .
negative	rant over !
negative	they also blocked my account for unknown reasons and haven ' t yet sent me a letter to help me reactivate the account .
neutral	the delivery was terrible , i paid for next_day delivery but my nicece never recived them they said i that they left them in the porch .
neutral	we only saw the olympic rep once - she showed us the transfer mini_bus and left us - pretty useless but we didn_'_t want a rep and welcome drinks and all that stuff
neutral	however i did receive the money back for the delivery
negative	called again today , i want to cancel the contract .
positive	they quickly agreed to collect the item and replace it .
positive	they had what i wanted , it came quickly .
neutral	message from jack saying order processed and awaiting tracking_details .
negative	i told him he missed my cut_off date by 0 days so he should be ale to get them delivered tomorrow .
neutral	wish there was a schedule , you can never know when the bus will arrive .
negative	i wish i could rate the review 0 . 0_stars as the only thing that let it down was the fact they had been sent standard post instead of recorded and it ' s unfair to mark it down when they did send the new items as per their website details .
positive	there are videos as well as written units so if you learn best through either option , they are both presented to you and easy to use !
neutral	packaging can arrive well boxed but on occasions like my last order in a big empty box left to rattle around .
negative	trevor dodds
positive	never a disappointment
negative	now i can ' t be bothered to top up my phone just to waste money on a customer_service of a tablet that i bought because it was supposed to be over 00_%_off the original price .
neutral	i have ms and as a result i have problems with swallowing .
negative	finally i was answered at 00 : 00 by ( name_removed ).
negative	i work in customer_service myself and if i spoke to customers the way they do , i would be sacked !
positive	this company deserves much praise for what it provides !
neutral	i contacted them about my insurance_policy and they didn ' t even have me registered as their customer .
negative	it also still says the tickets are not available . they also told me that the tickets were from a 0rd_party seller and that they have to contact them to get my money back which is absolute lies because the third_party seller does not receive the money for the tickets until 0 days after the event !
neutral	also i have had trouble with shipping and even just paying for the orders .
neutral	not to bad .
negative	status : successfully authorised transaction .
negative	it was an_email obviously for another customer , with what they ordered , their full name , their city , bank_details , all of it , right in the email .
positive	delivery was fast and everything was in good order , for an excellent price .
positive	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
negative	i wanted to switch because talk_talk '_s provided wireless router is poor quality and they do not offer support on privately provided routers .
positive	no booking_fees , and there ' s always nice hostels and hotels .
neutral	if i know i am going to get them after the weekend i wouldn ' t order online and just go and buy from a shop !
neutral	can ' t even use it .
positive	helen couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
positive	i have used viovet on three or four occasions over the last_year and will happily continue to do so .
negative	bought insurance for me and my whole family .
neutral	i chose electricshop as they were the cheapest reputable store i could find on the web .
positive	i was sceptical at first , but i ' m_glad to say i was pleasantly_surprised by how good panamoz was .
negative	they are based in america but use the co . uk tag presumably to fool people in the uk .
neutral	firstly , the website has a slightly seedy vibe about it which i can only say comes from experience if you have been on any malware ridden sites offering ' free games ' or whatever .
positive	will use them again without_doubt
neutral	the game will still work on your console and have english instructions etc
positive	cophi
neutral	i believe that a reduction of that much was unfair .
positive	the guide book you get with it is great .
neutral	during this process i have spoken consistently to two case handlers from cr on a number of occasions .
negative	also the rooms went up in price the second time of trying to book .
neutral	i had spent over £_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
positive	ink is really expensive and i have limited funds so it '_s the driving force for me with regard to whom i buy from .
positive	does exactly_what it says on the tin - service quick easy and money received in no time - would use them again and recommend them to anyone .
neutral	there is not much latest material .
positive	really reliable and relevant searches .
positive	fast and efficient .
negative	their staff on the phone can see that i am being charged too much but cant understand_why or do anything about it .
neutral	makes me wonder if i hadn ' t have phoned , would anything have been said to me ?
negative	this is a totally unreasonable .
neutral	probably wouldn ' t of happening if the box was packaged in another with bubble_wrap or something .
neutral	thankfully we had included our phone number in the purchase procedure and that was showing on the box and allowed the recipient to call us .
negative	why don_'_t you do this ao . com
positive	you also get a clue as to what else you might need to order or what you may have forgotten to order .
positive	never had any_issues and customer_service are quick to respond to my inquiries .
positive	seatwave was ideal as they offered a collection service right next to the o0 , which is great when you are buying at short_notice or are worried_about receiving tickets in time .
positive	would happily use again .
neutral	hence only 0_stars because of their disinterested customer support
neutral	somehow i don_'_t seem to have luck with internet providers .
neutral	to be fair the product was good and well_packaged and they did respond quickly to queries .
neutral	fast delivery but i thought the product was a bit over priced .
neutral	i ordered my item 00th_october , and after emailing and leaving messages for 0 weeks i eventually got a reply , it promised me my item next couple of days , sent by a women .
negative	maybe if it goes_smoothly they are great but what makes a good company is how they treat you when there is a problem .
positive	which in a winner in my book !
negative	terrible company .
positive	gobsmacked by the deliveries choices available , ok so i paid a little extra to have
neutral	amateur mistake seeing as paypal says delivery address and you inputed it also .
neutral	i made an order 0nd july on some shoes .
neutral	overall , an excellent company to deal with but the delivery service lets them down in my opinion
negative	all i can say is avoid them like the plague if you value your hard_earned cash .
positive	i can really recommend jgd crafts without_reservation
negative	he said that i had already received a refund .
positive	fast delivery .
positive	you cant ask for better service and i am very pleased that i chose ipad_recycle .
neutral	i have used holiday_autos for many_years and have always been very satisfied .
negative	i am back to work tomorrow can '_t take phone on the ward so thats another day .
negative	please beware - i do believe i will eventually be refunded but connstant checking / ringing and emailing with no response is very frustrating .
negative	avoid like the plague .
neutral	good connectivity and decent customer_service .
neutral	never rated a company before on the web .
neutral	there are few explanations on the grammar and structure of sentences which is one of the main crucial areas of learning a language .
positive	customer service is also good , though once booked , the hard work is being done by the company you book with .
neutral	d ' où mon inquiétude .
negative	they even refused to provide information about their company , even their address .
neutral	a hire_car was arranged through avis , we only had around 0 people in the queue in front on us but the wait was still well over an_hour .
negative	0 / 00 from me .
negative	i would be weary of the effectiveness of any close dated product .
neutral	another comment : the website is confusing to use if you want to book one way transfers out of resort as the boxes refer to inbound flights and the wording swaps around between pages - maybe look_into it .
neutral	but there is no common_sense in trustpilot .
negative	the lady said not to worry as the delivery time is never longer_than two_weeks .
positive	i have recently got my ilr processed with the help of imperial_visas , i am greatly satisfied with their service .
positive	excellent service from the company and the carrier .
neutral	think about it .
neutral	i hate hidden_costs , like credit_card commisions .

neutral	the security personnel did arrive on the scene and after explaining to him why i do not understand her concerns he gave me a very valid security reason for not filming the footage that i wanted which was totally different from the way the ba staff lady explained to me .
neutral	?
negative	same sometimes happens with sound too .
negative	a while ago we used them , and a scream boxed set ( amongst other rejected items ) which were in very good condition were rejected on the grounds on " damaged artwork ."
neutral	i also paid for the tracking service and like everyone_else have not had a tracking link , my girlfriend just text me to say they have still not arrived and she finished work at 0 - 00 .
neutral	i informed her that i am not happy with this and she agreed that it will be fine to pay for 0 people on one card and 0 on the other .

negative	they directed me to you .
neutral	two things spoiled it : firstly , having chosen an agent where a " printer not necessary ", since i was asking for a parcel to be delivered to me , i was asked to print a label and stick it on the parcel !
negative	as i say , it is not the security_checks that bother me , it is their extraordinarily dismissive attitude_towards someone who is simply trying to buy their products ."
positive	we were very surprised he had them in stock , as promised , the controller arrived the next evening at about 00 . 00hrs .
positive	i ' ve earnt about £_000 so far , just for shopping for things i was going to buy anyway , or using things like their car_insurance search_engine ( which i ' ve actually found to be one of the best for finding me the cheapest quotes ).
negative	i was to receive a call from manchester depot that morning .
positive	we had been concerned that our hirer was a certain locauto ( italian rental ) that has racked up a not inconsiderable volume of complaints , some just shy of fraud .

neutral	my order hadn ' t been delivered , only part , so phoned them up to see where the rest was .
neutral	got an_email on monday to say they had tried to call me on friday ( turns_out they decided to use a different number no_longer in use - why ?).
neutral	we all have enough frustration in our day to day lives without getting it from bt .
neutral	i can understand this extra layer of security when its an expensive product like electronics but it ' s a very low ticket item .
positive	the delivery_men mobiled when they were at the end of the road and they were courteous and helpful on arrival .
positive	the service was great and professionally presented .
neutral	why do some have it and not others ?
negative	next time i will purchase items from a different supplier .
neutral	how does this end up on trustpilot ?
neutral	managed to get a great deal on a return ferry trip dover to calais .

positive	i would always use mazuma now
positive	if you need any information about any movie , it is probably on imdb , regardless of the movie production or country of origin .
negative	the average response time of their servers is nothing to write home about . again our record showed 0000ms , which is not acceptable by the majority of webhosting company . some webhost believes 000ms should be the min .
positive	really easy website and very quick delivery which is free as are any returns should the need_arise .
positive	i will_definitely buy my next game from here !!!
neutral	otherwise i love the product .
positive	they were cheerful and efficient throughout . well_done .

neutral	" hail mary full of grace .
positive	didn_'_t realise buying a bed could be so much fun .
positive	the porters worked tirelessly and deserve so much credit .
neutral	i guess it all depends on the reliability of the merchant to report the sale to top_cashback , which it is not in their best interests to do .
neutral	needless to say it was not a stress_free parking experience .
negative	i have replied to every email they have sent but have never had a response in return .
positive	website very user_friendly .
positive	trustpilot , this is a customer review , and i can supply receipts and other records to support my review .
positive	i wouldn ' t have asked for a sponsorship if i thought they were bad !
negative	it wasn ' t the worry free experience the guarantee offers .
positive	within_seconds i was able to find a hostel in exactly my price range at a cheaper quoted price than any other website ( for the exact_same hostels !).
negative	i was told to keep turning my phone on and off during the day and eventually the number will be transferred .
negative	it would be a 0 minute job to add to the website the fuel_policy choice to enable people to return the car full or empty , the fact that you don_’ t provide this choice proves to me you are part of this fuel rip_off and profiting from it .
negative	generally they arrive two days_later and at a push three .
negative	0st phone_call to ask about transferring number and credit - was told no problem will be done in 00_hours . guess_what . didn_'_t happen .
positive	what surprised me the most though was the price of the watch - i seriously doubt anywhere_else in the uk could have beaten them in this area .

neutral	i received a phone_call from customer_relations ( cr ) about an_hour after i had posted my review on trust_pilot .
neutral	the aol website is quick and easy to use , but as an internet provider , i just cannot recommend them .
neutral	they ' re ok , but i enquired_about ' anytime upgrade ' and was sent an_email_saying i was able to have it , but ring the phoneline to sort . rang phone line . they said i wasn ' t entitled . someone , somewhere isn ' t very familiar with their products and services !
positive	i shop in the store and online and have had nothing but positive_experiences .
positive	can ` t wait to got out in them , ha !
neutral	the process was fairly_straightforward if a little longwinded .
neutral	they suggested i check again which i did and they are definitely all still white .
positive	quick delivery , had no_problems whatsoever .
positive	always use these_guys . just fantastic
neutral	this is not good for someone trying to learn the language .
neutral	but
neutral	openly taking video_footage on a tripod should have maybe let her think that this might have been a misdirected customer and should have changed her approach .
negative	i thought i would give parcel_hero a try .
negative	bouquet was for a dear friend '_s 00st_birthday .
negative	i would love to recommend simplygames as their prices are extremely good and they appear to run a very tight ship but this simply isn ' t the case .
negative	i had to write to them asking about their online job application forms !
neutral	other rooms were small with tables and chairs next to the pool or with terraces walked through by other guests .
neutral	nice concept .
positive	all in all an excellent service and i would highly_recomend them to anyone .
negative	they are worse than useless - the entire company !
neutral	so sort it out and make it clear to customers !
positive	my only_suggestion would be to make the website a little more streamlined for product ordering ( the scrolling through supplements and multiple pages is a bit tedious , but it certainly isn ' t a deal_breaker ).
positive	i selected the item i wanted , i then went thru the simple checkout system and paid for it and 0 days_later i recieved it - perfect !
neutral	so they basically charged me double .
neutral	one was a delivery for a fridge ( 00000000 ) where they decided to leave a card but felt they didn_'_t have the time to bother buzzing my door .
neutral	breakfast was very good - maybe over ambitious for the space available .
negative	i am now 00 weeks pregnant and have been without a washing_machine for 0 weeks because of this company !
negative	bottom_line : if you want a lot of cards through your door , order with a company that uses_yodel but if you want a parcel , forget it .
positive	i ' ll be going to hostelbooker . com to book the rest of my hostels for my backpacking_trip through europe , thank_you !
neutral	i don_'_t like flowers being delivered in boxes .
negative	now , i ' m told my original documents are lost by the bank ( again as though this is somehow my fault ).
negative	0 parcel came around 00 . 00hrs .
neutral	their e_- mail address is a uk one and they display a post_office symbol on their home page .
positive	would recommend and use again .
positive	most efficient organisation , descriptions are accurate , value is good and delivery is extremely fast - couldn_'_t ask for more !
neutral	their lack of any phone customer service is hugely frustrating , especially as i had moved and the website would not allow me to change any details , although i tried five times !!
positive	thank_you very much indeed buyspares !
positive	took insurance for hire_car excess , saved huge_amount of money and the process was as easy as it can get - nice one .
positive	both times the products have arrived well_packed and arrived within a couple of days of payment .
positive	only just got back into home brewing after over 00 years and good to find a shop with everything i need and also friendly , helpful advice as well .
positive	people at work comment on what i ' m wearing .
positive	just after 0 day , i got the email that i ' ve waited almost a year from purchase , unlocking my iphone 0 !!!
neutral	doing that is not very intuitive and my image didn_'_t get attached to the form , resulting in a request to send it before they could deal with my query .
neutral	so whats up then ?
positive	customer_service is also money , they have fixed every issue i ' ve had and always respond within hours of my emails .
neutral	bit disappointing considering the great feedback given through the trust_pilot site .
negative	couldn ' t phone them and they failed to contact me .
negative	booked three direct flights but the airline cancelled this flight ( now wondering_if they were ever offering such connection ).
positive	also the webpage is very clear and well_structured .
neutral	no where near the screen .
positive	i '_ve used blackcircles before so i knew the price would be good .
negative	if something_goes_wrong you sort it as soon as possible .
neutral	hostelworld is a great website to use when comparing hostels , prices , reviews plus they have an interesting blog and spend a lot of time on all social_media .
neutral	we were supposed to start our journey at 0 :_00am on june 00th 0000 via dutch klm .
positive	i ordered an item from amazon on saturday and chose the free super_saver delivery option . on sunday i got an_email_stating that the item had been dispatched to yodel for delivery and i should expect to receive my item on thursday .
neutral	to sum it up , it ' s just market quality crap .
neutral	my last reply was " virgin games has just lost themselfs a regular depositing player " and the chat_host ' s reply was " ok , see you tomorrow " like i just come on for the free games ?
negative	asad @ furnitureinfashion . co . uk
positive	always very helpful .
positive	bought some picks .
positive	can ' t think of any way to criticise amazon simply because their service and products have made my life_easier in every way possible .
negative	in the end i had to leave or miss my flight .
positive	couldn_'_t have been more helpful at the local shop , even_though we ordered on line
negative	will not be using this company again .
neutral	i was worried that someone was going to come along and want my seat through the concert but everything turned_out okay in the end and i forgot all about it once beyonce was on .

positive	i got a quick fast and very courteous service .
neutral	they tried to suggest my buzzer may be on the blink , but i went right down and tested it out .
positive	other than the fact that the prices are so low , they beat any competition ' s price by 0 %.
neutral	they told me my order had been stopped at customs , and they handled my copmlaint greatly .
negative	finish dishwasher cleaner x 0
neutral	!.
positive	i believe that as a newcomer i am not blinded by any bias .
neutral	i accept that .
negative	how could this be when the same week they were still telling_me that no one had looked at it yet ?
negative	if they ' re not , the retailer is in breach of contract and you have a claim under the sale of goods_act .
positive	ordered on tuesday for delivery on friday unfortunately goods were not delivered from manufacturer until friday so order was delayed till the saturday but that was suitable anyway .
negative	0 .
neutral	point 0 - users who provide a 0 star good review actually results in your overall score being downgraded .
positive	i highly_recommend .
negative	i have never ever been let_down so badly .
neutral	unfortunately , they suffer in terms of customer_service .
positive	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back £_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was £_00 . 00 for me ).
negative	bn00 0ql seaford , east sussex tel 00000_000000 called to take a look .
neutral	the repayments are great but the price of the products are very expensive compared to other shops .
positive	ordered my oakleys over the phone and was told 0 to 0 working_days i will have them .

positive	their service is amazing , the speeds are always great , the customer_service is amazing .
neutral	i could track the order online although the stated time_slot for delivery was very wide ( 00 : 00 gmt - 00 : 00 ).
positive	the site itself has a fabulous range of goods , is easy to navigate , and easy payment .
positive	great company , and more legroom than monarch .
positive	very happy to recommend to others and will_certainly be back for more .

positive	the value for money is super as well .
neutral	told them in store we needed a 0 hour_slot for delivery in order to book time off - told certainly however no chance you have to wait in all day - in my opinion we were thoroughly misled - would i recommend - no not unless you have your wits about you
negative	now , raher than being the best , with actual news rather_than dramatised gossip , they have decided to try to compete with the other channels for worst programmes transmitted , oh and then repeated .

positive	they made sure our group walked together , setting a comfortable and realistic ' pole pole ' pace , this was great for morale and enabled us to get the know each other better and therefore be there for each other on the final day .
negative	a terrible terrible company and i would stay as far away from them as possible !
positive	will recommend to all my friends :)
neutral	and service was poor too .
negative	the obvious question that arises from this is , if the £_00 admin_fee is system generated and automatically charged and they can '_t affect / cancel it . who is doing the admin and if it '_s nobody , why are they charging for it ?
negative	here is the email where the said they has passed the refund lies
negative	the girl i spoke to was very helpful , advised that the mattress was in the warehouse but she would get a delay put on dispatch until the 0th_jan .

neutral	the gentleman on the phone was also very helpful , but a fair amount of hassle all things considered .

neutral	i don ' t expect the best customer_service from a website that ' s pushing products like these folks do , but at times they ' re just flat out disappointing .
positive	there is little doubt also that there are some awful hirers out there who don_'_t fill up tanks as requested on return and treat their rental vehicles poorly and thus an air of mistrust has built up .
neutral	absolute diddly squat !
positive	thank_you
neutral	i have only ever ordered items through other_companies but apparently you can buy things direct ?
negative	i was told by the company i was returning an item to that it would be collected on either thursday , friday or monday but not to worry at i would get a txt from yodel telling_me which day and the company arranging the return asked for an_alternative location for the trousers to be left should i have to get out .

positive	not made a claim so can ' t comment on that but the sign_up was easy and they tell you what documents you will need if you ever claim and give you the option of emailing a digital_copy to them to put on your file from the start .
negative	when the order was eventually dispatched it was incomplete , no one informed me that i would not receive two items .
positive	it ’_s great to see a company compete with amazon and beat them of price .
positive	the lady on the phone was very helpful .
negative	annoying again , yet i accepted it .
neutral	i won_'_t move as they are the best there is , but once there is an_alternative i will be gone .
neutral	the supplier offered a 0 night refund which was ok .
neutral	it took 0 & 0 / 0 weeks for my products to arrive althought i think this was due to the mail & not beautycow & i didn ' t receive my free mascara , i will still be shopping with this site but a bit dissapointed .
positive	not the usual continuous banging you get from some of them .
positive	just a few_clicks of a buttons and bam , i ' ve got the code .
negative	then they said that it would be sent the next_day , but it was delayed more .
neutral	the guy i spoke to on the phone was polite and apologised for the error , hence me awarding 0_stars instead of 0 !
positive	great speakers , well packagesd , exactly as_described and good value
neutral	i can only assume that this claimed call did not take place .
neutral	i will find out when making future_purchases .
positive	i have had few issues , but all have been resolved extremely quick and in a very efficient way .
negative	first , i was accused of breaking it myself , even_though it had only been delivered about 00_minutes prior .
negative	0th phone_call to find out what was going on - had to go through the same process again , in pigeon english , to be told that there was no credit on my old orange account , so no transfer to do .
neutral	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
neutral	instead of looking at making the website run faster , produce less errors etc they seem to find it more useful to introduce futile additions such as ' the light box ' ( or theatre mode for viewing picture ) or changing the layout of my newsfeed etc .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone
positive	we plugged this in the minute it arrived and he has calmed down !
positive	those hostels came with prices , making it so easy for me to see what was the cheapest and what was recommended by others .
positive	the flights and connections the car_hire and kept it all within a budget we were happy with .
neutral	however , if you ' re wiling to spend an evening arranging it yourself i believe you could get the same product for about half of the price .
negative	then next moring again i called and she said that she have not got received any email and there is no record that i rang and spoke to anyone .
neutral	but now i only have $_000 i call again and ask where is the rest and was told it was lost in conversion i ask if i can speak to the manager but that did nt really help they would nt admit it was there mistake and would give me any money back what a joke
positive	products was packed nicely to avoid damage during delivery .
neutral	as your order is already on its way we regret it '_s too late to change the following details :
positive	my search for a new mattress came about as a result of a bad previous decision and a very poorly back .
positive	oh but a word of warning , don ' t use tnt or hermes as they receive a lot of criticism , just pay a couple of quid extra and use dhl or ups !
negative	i still_haven ' t received anything , i have had about 0 emails answered with the automated_response of thanks for being patient and sorry for the inconvenience .
positive	thanks again , jay and all the best to you .
neutral	the booking was okay i guess , despite being promised £_00 off if i booked before a certain_date and then never materialising once booked !
negative	akinika is one of the worst companies i have ever had the misfortune to deal with .
negative	after taking the money from my account immediately the glasses didn ' t turn_up for 0weeks after continuous emailing .
negative	bearing in mind the contract is 00 months .
neutral	having the facility to leave delivery instructions was great - my vw bits arrived within 0 days , left in a secure place as requested .
positive	always surprised at the quality of the goods and the up to date styles .
neutral	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
positive	the company called after i made my order to check that i ' d made the right decision , they then called a few_days_later as the mattress was ready !
negative	twice hackers cleaned out my bank_account and although i got money back , it took far too long and they didn ' t give any compensation , even_though it resulted_in bank charges and potentially late bills , luckily i had family to help out !
neutral	i would imagine local trading_standards would have something to say about that .
neutral	it was let_down by the insurance .
positive	website has very clear photos and it was easy to select seasonal flowers .
negative	items never delivered within timescales , when large items are finally received they are damaged .
positive	good communication confirming order & delivery .
positive	the frame that i selected was so cheap it took a nano second to decide .
negative	as it was taken out of the packaging .
negative	back i go to the site and now book 0 more tyres to match the ones previously fitted on the vehicle .
positive	many bigger retail sites can take a lot longer_than that .
negative	whist i realised that being ' big business ' they probably wouldn_'_t care , i felt it worth the time to let them know how disappointed i was with their callous , avaricious attitude .
positive	i seldom have any_problems with components but when i do aria are very good at replacing them .
positive	the country guides provide a good insight to various destinations and the shipping calculator is a nifty idea .
negative	would not shop here again nor recommend to anyone .
neutral	reason being given , to £_00 approximately . if i hadn_'_t been in such a need to book this quickly , i would probably have looked elsewhere . the
neutral	i would avoid them .
neutral	got bf0 ( russian ed ) for 00 £ it was not instant delivery despite the advertising saying it was , i got it after 0 + hours but i did get it in the end .
positive	highly_recommend - we ordered 0 00kg bags of dog_food and they arrived the next morning
positive	!
positive	thank_you , will recommend to friends and family .
neutral	online shop style websites that aren_'_t accurately maintained are one of the main_reasons i ' m still to be convinced that internet_shopping is more convenient , because i ' m now being inconvenienced by the delay .
neutral	i purchased an electrolux chest_freezer the delivery was quick and on time , but when the driver and his assistant arrived because of the packaging it would not go through my door so they asked for £ 0 to remove the packaging as we didn_'_t give them the £ 0 they just left the chest_freezer on the pavement for me and my husband to take in ( we are0 pensioners ) when we got the freezer in we noticed the wheels was missing so i contacted 000 electrical to be told that they could not help and to contact electrolux and they would send me the wheels , i was not happy as i paid 000 electrical £_000 and they did not help me , its now 0 days since my freezer was delivered and still can '_t use it as the wheels have not arrived .
neutral	they eventually refunded 00p , as this was the price of the rub minus 00_%_off , and refused to acknowledge my complaints about their cs .
negative	i signed_up online with carphone_warehouse to tell me when the samsung_s0 would be avaliable for pre order , they called me to tell me and offered me a deal , however the services was poor , the sale man that was talking to me had no_idea what he was selling as i could hear his manager in the background telling him what to say , they then offered me a deal and did a credit check which they said was accepeted and i then paid the £_000 for the phone with the £_000 cash back deal ,
negative	guess_what - 0 :_00pm arrived and no sign of the bike .
negative	had an orange payg sim which had some credit left on it , so i thought i would transfer the sim to ee to use the 0g data .
neutral	on the positive side we didn ' t end up paying extra to change passenger spelling .
neutral	on arrival of the installation engineer it became_clear that most of what we had asked for over the phone 0 months previously had not been updated on the records so we had a desperate morning liasing between the engineer and their customer_service to make_sure everything was as we wanted .
neutral	you sent me the bloody email in the first place .
neutral	the two photos i had on my desktop were similar and it was my fault that i clicked on the unedited one for sending .
positive	when we booked it there was a slight_hiccup on the booking site - not at dealchecker - and i had to speak to an agent .
positive	i feel much_better buying from these_guys rather_than am * z * n too .
neutral	but the help line ( i rang them twice on this matter ) could not explain in simple english one of the most fundamental questions : what exactly the " settle " button does and how do we know the figures it gives is correct - yet every night we are told to press it , print it and throw_away the report it creates .
negative	i called my bank and they claimed a chargeback using visa .
neutral	another thing i ' ve noticed , and i hope this isn ' t just me , is that the prices online are often different from the prices instore .
negative	my fiance thankfully accepted the ring for the thought behind it and is against giving it back .
neutral	also , there seems to be no option to pay the amount straight_away - it seems you need to wait for a statement .
negative	now is the time to support the businesses that will keep employment , culture and our local communities healthy .
positive	thanks for a great shopping_experience !
positive	ordered it right away .
neutral	i '_ve had an old ibm before and they are bullet proof build_quality - the old machine was on xp and getting very tired hence my purchase of this one .
negative	talk_talk is by_far the worst company to deal with .
positive	from website , to ordering , to delivery , to assembly everything was first_rate .
positive	vivek
positive	perhaps some rugs , maybe pictures or something ….
negative	i waited 00_mins at 0000 this moring in the cold .
negative	or its off to the papers i ' ll go !!
positive	write as if you ' re speaking to a friend .
positive	good price too .
positive	i needed a new laptop as the one i had wasn ' t good enough for what i needed .
negative	what else am i supposed to do to get in contact with you ?
positive	i could contact them with all my questions and doubts and they replied very quickly .
positive	dpd texted me giving me a 0 hour delivery slot and sure enough the dpd van turned_up slap bang in the middle of the slot !
neutral	so i ' m not satisfied with your turnaround in getting new games to me .
neutral	so i checked with the airline ( not crystal ) that everything was booked properly and it was .
positive	both packages were delivered rapidly , and were well_packed , with a warning message about accidental injury included in the packet .
positive	the price was the cheapest i could find and with free_postage that made it a double bargain .
positive	great site , easy to use and great delivery times .
neutral	in this case the pump was ok but why risk it !
negative	as well as the rip_off factor , i would also like to question your corporate responsibility .
neutral	i was trying to keep costs down for my brothers stag_do and thought dodgeball looked cheap and pretty fun .
positive	fast response from their twitter account .
positive	i would definitely_use them again .
negative	booked three direct flights but the airline cancelled this flight ( now wondering_if they were ever offering such connection ).
positive	the free returns_policy will not be needed which does not surprise me as timberland are extremely well made shoes .
negative	not acceptable .
negative	i bought 0 for 0 inks for my kodak esp0000 & have just used a compatible from you & the picture is all red & white stripes down faces .
neutral	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer_service lines .
negative	i sent a further email with my phone number which also went_unanswered .
negative	i had complained on the telephone and followed this up with an e_mail , that has_been received , asking for some money to be refunded to compensate for the wrong shorts ( obviously could not return as we had to wear them ) and for the very very poor print quality , to this day , no one has had the decency to reply .
negative	i am certain that sofa works would have been informed well before the day before delivery that it was not arriving on time .
neutral	and the resort was stunning and clean .
negative	i recieved the compressor totally broken .
negative	i also previously placed an order , had the money taken from my account , and then received an_email_saying none of the goods were in stock despite already taking the money .
neutral	but you don_'_t allow two letter names !
neutral	i ordered my duel fuel cooker and in 0days it arrived i wanted to have it installed with ao . com and the only thing that let it down was the fact that they couldn_'_t connect it in my area !
positive	the social_media side of the company is also a bonus .
neutral	we used to use farnell for all our purchases of electrical components .
neutral	booked a one night stay in a city hotel in the uk for 0 people .
positive	great company - we arrived earlier_than arranged and they were there to meet us .
neutral	ebay takes such a huge cut , it ' s almost not worth selling on it .
positive	i am talking to someone within 0 - 0 minutes on their website and i love that they will let me switch to other cities or even countries when i want to watch something else .
negative	internet is shait keeps going off it takes them 0 f_** king weeks to send an engineer over avoid this rubbish company also the phone does work bad work no one should use this company
neutral	item slipped through quality check was offered discount for faulty item but not a great discount
negative	the third part of your scam is the fuel charge .
neutral	e_- bay messages were responded to reasonably quickly and issue was resolved .
negative	don ' t waste your time .
positive	i would like to see them creating jobs for young people - they are a big company and can make a difference to the uks unemployment problem .
neutral	all ok except 0 + weeks delivery .
negative	i ordered a watch for my wife ' s birthday .
positive	children at the pre_- school really like it .
neutral	instead , a clear statement that " all you could do was send out a new one ".
neutral	please train and allow your staff to make decisions to help your customers and not have to clear everything through head_office .
positive	very organised site ,
positive	many_thanks and keep up the good work !
neutral	accommodation was not stag_doo friendly and showers were terrible !
negative	i asked to speak to a manager but hey_ho that would take 00hrs .
positive	have bought many items from overclockers during the past 00 years never have had any_issues with them and always provided good service . they have a vast_range of products aimed at gamers , businesses or for people who wish to work at home .
negative	am_disgusted and furious !
positive	delivery exceptional - arrived on time and on the day requested .
negative	i am still reciving estimated gas bills and because of their mix_up i had a massive bill in jan_0000 of over £_000 .
positive	after ordering my first purchase with beauty - bay a couple of months_ago , it ' s now my first point if call for any beauty product .
neutral	she is really delighted with it and all that is needed now are some birds !
positive	i plan to use them again , and would recommend to a friend !
neutral	at no point did the salesman , edward discuss the additional services mentioned in the terms and conditions .
neutral	i referred a client ( and a good friend ) to regus for a short_term office ( this was before i was fully_aware of how regus operate ).
negative	so they do have the tyres , then they dont have the tyres , then they do have them again , then actually they dont have them !
negative	the next_day i did come home to a card simply saying they had shouted everywhere , obviously some clever take on their name .
positive	recommended by a friend as i ' d not heard of scan before .
neutral	i like the idea of natives and speakers of the language marking your exercises as you can get fast feedback but it ' s not always trustworthy .
neutral	having_read these reviews for trustpilot . co . uk , at_least you have the cahonas to review yourself , but the main flaw of fake_reviews does not seem to be answered .
positive	i am very happy with them so far .
negative	complete amateurs and lazy to boot .
positive	i did not know i could learn so much in such a short time_frame , and i thought i might struggle with the technology but it was all set out and explained in a way that i could easily complete all of the tasks !
positive	i found the service easy , straight_forward and very professional and at the fraction of the cost of a high_street agent .
positive	i recommend them to everybody .
negative	this document should be available to all customer service staff as it should state the time limit to reply to any complaints also stating a limit for the complaint to be dealt_with .
neutral	we ate 0 of the steaks on the day that they arrived , so we still have 0 more in the freezer .
neutral	managed to speak to cs representative who quickly helped to respond to one part of my enquiry to my satisfactory .
negative	we are very sorry to hear this however why would we intend to hold your money if we have gone_through all the hassle of pick_up to avoid
neutral	dpd turned_up at the wrong street again but at_least on this occasion could contact me so could rectify mistake .
neutral	be warned that your account can become limited by paypal at their discretion then when they want more info to lift the limitation it can get very irritable when they keep wanting more and more although you provide what they want
negative	te encontraras con agujeros llenos de suciedad , con hierros oxidados , arañas en lo_que llaman duchas y encima tendras que pagar como si fuera un hotel de lujo , porque nunca se haran responsables de lo_que han ofrecido .
positive	.
neutral	this is why i think busuu should only be used as an additional tool coincide with a language course or book and not a single learning resource .
positive	!
positive	this time i got baffled , clicked on online help , and catherine not only sorted it out but sent me links to the right spot in the order process .
positive	would thoroughly_recommend this company .
positive	it fits like a glove , although it is a tiny_bit long .
neutral	ok , you ' ve sorted out the privacy ( great thanks for that by the way :) ), but now can you look to sorting_out the stability and performance of your website ?
negative	the rest of the orders i ' ve made have taken longer_than a week or two to arrive .
positive	cant_fault them and would highly_recommend .
neutral	i don ' t know why the rest of the order couldn ' t have been sent anyway .
neutral	to be fair spoke to car audio fitters ( none local ) who very helpful , said its not that difficult , again a but , am still trying to get sensible quote from local fitters for doing it , they all say it is a big job .
neutral	also , you need to make it clear that we are supposed to pay extra and book our own seats for the flights .
neutral	!
neutral	mens range is awful though .
positive	have used them before for custom clubs and service is always good .
negative	avoid !
positive	within minutes , i received a helpful telephone_call from tayna regarding the battery fittings .
negative	i ordered a poster from allposters . com who used this service .
positive	always find my best deals on flights , hotels and services .
positive	i really liked the add on options at each_stage - deluxe bouquet , vase , good range of beautiful gifts , cards and even a glossy photo .
negative	again i was not offered any compensation , other than an_apology .
positive	two batteries are even better , especially when they recharge in only an_hour .
negative	from that date non of my bills have been accurate and i found out that my gas smart_meter has not in fact has ever worked since i had it and i have been receiving estimated bills .
neutral	i ordered some stuff a while ago it took nearly 00 days to arrive and needed the stuff for a gig so put me in a compromising position !
negative	yes they do price , yes great pieces . but i have been waiting for my order for over 00 days !!!
positive	without a doubt my go - to music shop .
neutral	even if it was in basket and i ' ve paid . i didn ' t get one item because of an internal error :( also in trousers sizes i can ' t find any measurements and i ' m stuck with 0 pair tooo tight for me that i ' ve ordered in my normal size .
negative	completed 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 : 00 . 000
neutral	i came to a place on the terminal where i wanted to film a suitcase going onto the weigh - in conveyor belt .
neutral	it has gone 0 working_days and my order havent been shipped or taken care of .
neutral	so unfortunately damart really does not meet standards online shoppers expect : tracking , fast delivery , accurate stock info .
negative	the scooter went down the first drop kerb ok but ground to a complete halt when trying to get up the opposite drop kerb .
positive	always able to help when i pop in with questions , and have a wonderful choice in flavours .
positive	!
negative	i can ' t understand_why i have received such little communication ( each time from a different person who doesn ' t answer the points raised in my message ) when surely the worst error a flower delivery company can make is delivering flowers nearly a week late ?
positive	many_thanks .
neutral	the idea is grate i managed to get the job_done but . shiply taking £_00 before paying for a delivery service that ' s the cost of a 00kg parcel under common services ups parcel_force etc . makes shiply only useful for large expensive delivery ' s beyond 00kg otherwise you ' ll be paying double if your items 00kg or less .
neutral	i happened to be in and heard the knock but had i not been the shoes would have remained there in full view ; it is a terraced house with the front_door close the pavement .
neutral	i used to get atleast 0 free_spins a week but now when i do my free games it ' s mostly no wins and i ' ve not had free_spins for a while now .
neutral	having to re - dial the access number , plus the long pin code , then the number you wish to dial is really a pain .
positive	both have crystal_clear waters .
negative	i had to chase them constantly over the next couple of days to be told " it was despatched from our supplier 00_minutes ago " yeah_right !
negative	i haven ' t .
neutral	beware if you buy tickets from this company as they may be cheaper 00_hours_later .
neutral	however was very dissapointed as one of the mascarade masks was damaged , due to poor packing .
neutral	i have disabled chat so i don ' t have to deal with any chat_host ' s anymore !
negative	why this mess ???????
neutral	i sent them an_email about this a week_ago and have still not recieved a reply .
positive	enjoy your new camera kit from digitalrev !
neutral	as far as the watch is concerned that is ok but i was disappointed to find the dial was a dull grey colour compared to how white it looked on the website .
negative	so i rang customer_services and queried this and was told that they can '_t contact the driver but he is aware that i need the parcel today ( 00th ).
positive	i went to mazuma because the song on the advert was stuck in my head , it was so quick and easy to do , and even when we hadn ' t sent the form back they prompted us which was nice and 0 days_later ( from day of posting ) the money was sat in the bank_account .
negative	at the same time i wrote to o0 expressing my disappointment and asking for a formal apology , i have written twice since and am still_waiting a response !
positive	always packed well and with good use by dates .
negative	i asked what i had not done when i signed the new contract that put me in this situation .
positive	if the phone is engaged when you ring their support line they ring you back .
negative	thats just what i thought the last time i had to go . only because it was still open .
positive	in addition , its prices are comparable with the cheapest ( for genuine goods ) on ebay .
neutral	well , good items , shopped few_times . good shopping_experience . worth a try .
positive	most_recent_purchase was an absolutely_beautiful mulberry silk throw in taupe .
positive	he made some calls and got back to me with a price on the focal cms sub woofer which was £_000 less_than everyone_else .
positive	ordering was quick and easy .
neutral	i have then received payment 0 days_later but got a phone same day explaining still wasnt impressed with thecwait .
positive	will_continue to buy goods from them .
neutral	we survived on a few snacks and probably had 0 - 0 good nights at our destination on what we saved .
positive	very fast and reliable service .
positive	some curriers practically throw the parcels at you and then hurry off but not this man , he made sure i got the parcel in my house ok and commented on the traffic in the street ( building site over the road and road surfacing being done so lots of delivery wagons .
neutral	however , i had a ' shipping confirmation ' reply the next_day , and my topper arrived the day after .
negative	do not trust these people !!!
neutral	the seller , however , dispatched the item immediately , and it was received in a reasonable time .
neutral	he made it back and within 0 minutes of him being home , dpd delivered .
positive	thank_you .
negative	" we deeply value your relationship with iflorist and are committed to providing you with the highest_level of service simply because our customers deserve the very best ."
neutral	i was delighted .
negative	nothing has turned_up and have emailed them again several_times , no response , phoned them , no answer .
neutral	cover for my galaxy nexus .
positive	a friend_recommended this to me and we both bought wildstar on here for cheaper_than it was currently on site !
positive	yes you pay for the extra services , however you don_'_t get the extra hasle .
neutral	when it goes well it is average .
negative	it '_s the same old story , i ordered things on the 00 / 0 / 00 on their 00 hour delivery .
positive	quick delivery , cheap keys , professional and quick response from a very helpful customer support .
negative	fortunately it only lasted 00_minutes .
negative	now this is a perfectly normal low gradient ( 0 : 00 ) drop kerb but this scooter was unable to drive up it !!
neutral	unfortunately the airline did change their billing requirements which meant we had to pay early but trailfinders kept us updated and managed the issue .
positive	again , nothing was too much_trouble .
neutral	we have given up on the courier company .
neutral	in the sale they were £_000 each .
negative	when the order was received the company has sent me a completely diffrent order which is much cheaper_than that i had ordered .
positive	once i had finished the book it was uploaded to the website and i was able to track the progress through printing , binding and eventually posting where it arrived 0 days_later .
negative	i have been trying to use the live_chat , the telephone_number and sending messages .
positive	i have sent for several items from procook and would recommend them 000_%.
neutral	always seem to have great offers but never at the time that suits me .
negative	the only way we could get our excess back was to cancel the engineer '_s visit .
neutral	and yes , they send you cheaper alternative and don ' t refund the difference .
positive	thank_you simply_games !!!
neutral	shiply fine be careful book early allow time to go else where .
neutral	a table and chairs and a jacuzzi .
negative	this meant i had no product and no money .
negative	hi ordered items in one order 0 items despite going into store after receiving email to say to collect on two items arrived , rude staff instore and online help unbelievable poor , like trying to contact india , in short close your online account . dont_bother with debenhams much far_superior customer service on the high_street
neutral	but dont use dpd again !
positive	order placed i sat and waited , email arrived a day later telling_me items had been dispatched .
neutral	i will have to think very hard before ordering again , i think i would rather pay a couple of quid difference knowing my item would be delivered in a reasonable time
neutral	a quick comparison of ingredients shows a considerable reduction in the good stuff , which probably explains the lack of flavour .
neutral	ordered tubes which arrived in flimsy box and both had been snapped , charterhoue resent and luckily new tubes arrived ok but still send in cardboard_box , would think that these could be easily squished
negative	i contacted orange , who proceeded with full factory_unlock of the handset for gbp 00 . 00 .
neutral	i do wish they ` d get bigger sizes in .
neutral	while entering the details of the passenger i noticed that the agent had spelt one of the passengers name wrong which i was not happy about as this would have coasted us more if it needed to be changed later .
positive	thanks guys colin
negative	i would never ever go to this company and i would actively dissuade anyone from using it - unless they want a protracted dispute , appalling ryan_air style customer service , and a trip to the small_claims court .
neutral	order tok rather longer to arrive than i expected based on what was said on website . was moved to priority after i spoke to someone on live_chat .
negative	when in ny , for four_months tried to top up and every time calling 000 freenumber , got the same message " have not enough founds to connect my call ", for four_months calling the company to resolve this issue and nothing was ever done .
neutral	many quidco reviews state they never recieved their cashback from this company , but i guess i ' ll have to wait and see for myself .
negative	however they would only do this on the condition that i remove the review i had posted and ceased to post anymore .
neutral	i then had to go on my other e_- mail to verify which i was okay with as it is added security .
negative	0 hours passed and guess_what . no call !
negative	could not wait to see them for real .
positive	the jacket was in perfect_condition and just as per its decription online .
neutral	keep it simply people !
negative	went abroad for a family wedding .
negative	is there any way we can exchange for the correct item .
negative	my story , i ordered a new ( ex display ) sony tv for over £_0k back at the beginning of may for delivery on the friday .
negative	unlimitedwebhosting . co . uk reseller account may not be suitable for people who want to host multiple websites .
neutral	my husband then opened the door to find his parcel being handed_over to a neighbour with no wrapping on it , so that everyone could see that it was a sad daylight therapy lamp !!
neutral	xbox_000 transfer kit .
negative	fortunately my mother has forgiven me for seemingly missing her_birthday .
positive	quick ( the camera arrived within a few_days of ordering )
negative	so they have told me an order has been made and taken the money from my account and no order . the reason was given that they were having issues with the system and the checks were not being made , surely you wont take a payment form us if the credit check was not accepted ?
positive	good job !
positive	thanks
neutral	i feel olotels were too slow to act and this is why i lost out .
positive	i was kept completely up to date as to where the flowers where in the delivery process .
neutral	my order was apparently delivered by the infamous and notoriously crap , hermes ( google it ).
positive	the hotel has 0 restaurants , the main one always serves buffet style food with wide and varied_selection .
negative	february for repair .
negative	i purchased products on next_day delivery - paying a premium to be delivered to a business address .
neutral	delivery was exceptionally quick .
negative	if you are looking for good value find another place
positive	highly_recommended !
negative	the item became_faulty on its fourth use but i did not diagnose the problem to the unit until a few weeks_later .
positive	i just hope i do it justice when i wear it to my first ball :)
negative	it turned_out there was a problem with the phone line that the experts at virgin_media did not pick_up .
positive	very recommended !
positive	i enjoy using hostelbookers because it is a fast tool to gather information about good / cheap hostels .
negative	im told that the tyres are now available but they forgot to make them appear on the site !
negative	i even had a comment from goodprint twitter saying my design was fab surely at that point someone could have said ' hey the resolution isn ' t quite right are you sure you want to continue ?'
negative	i asked why i had not been refunded as i requested in my last phone_call i was told to wait for the call from the store .
negative	guess i won ' t be calling anyone tonight then !

positive	you answered questions i had with a professional attitude .
neutral	we have received a £_00 to shut us up ( as well as the anonymous tray of fruit ) but no one has taken the time and trouble to write to us to apologise for what could easily have been a nasty incident .

neutral	!
positive	it arrived quickly and the site is simple to nagivate along with a great community .
neutral	this is a company that has_gone from being internet only to now having a very large high_street presence ( regrettably something many stores are moving away from ) and at times they are struggling with the extra demand this has put on them .
neutral	in - store - £_00 . 00 . which leads me onto the prices themselves .
negative	im told by grippy that there is " nothing that they can do " which is the most useless , bailout of a phrase .
positive	000000

negative	as others have said , i wish that i had seen this site before ordering .
neutral	how come ?
negative	due from my past order i requested the driver went through the shopping with me so as to verify what was missing .
negative	since i never gave them my card_details , only hostelbookers could have done it -- even_though they supposedly make the booking by paying the 00_% and not the credit_card .
negative	cheers for that .
negative	as i expected no goods turned_up .
neutral	i got an_email back the next_day to say once you send the order it cannot be cancelled .
neutral	overseas call_centre was a let_down both on quality and service .
positive	in fact i even ' like ' them on facebook .

positive	i hardly_ever shop here for myself but i always find gorgeous clothes for my boyfriend :_d on the odd_occasion you find some awesome bits and pieces too .
neutral	!
positive	the site has a feature which enables you to check if the spare / accessory is actually compatable .
positive	i certainly didnt just want to put my personal details onto any old website so it took me a while to do , but after seeing 00k facebook likes and plenty of good feed_back i decided to go for it .
positive	great service , quick and easy :)
neutral	it '_s really not the same as it used to be , i dont enjoy it as much as i did before and i am looking for other_sites to sell my perfectly new clothes now .

negative	please advise .
positive	i have been using loads of different companies to recycle my mobile_phones and let me tell you ; fonebank are just the best .
negative	tried again 0 hours_later and eventually re - booked delivery ( they try hard at this point to charge you for accelerating the service ).
negative	when the package turned_up , the delivery note said both items were present , when only one was .
neutral	however as i say i won_'_t be rushing back !
negative	all boxes perfectly intact on delivery however almost every piece is damaged and scuffed .

positive	i have used them on 0 occasions and they have proven to be very efficient .
neutral	however i wasn ' t as impressed as i had hoped i would be as they didn ' t look like the photo on the webpage .
positive	thanks cjs !
neutral	i ' ve been shopping online alot recently and the reviews here have helped_me alot with deciding who to buy goods from and who to steer_clear of .
negative	late_afternoon as it had not arrived i phoned again and asked for the tracking_number which they gave me , but when i tracked the parcel it showed it had not even left the hub in london .
neutral	it was in a bad state of disrepair and needs to be changed .
positive	watch out for all the free stuff as well .
neutral	the hotel was easy to find and would be ideal for anyone arriving by train although there was also ample free car_parking .
neutral	now i appreciate you have pick - up '_s to make and someone has to be 0st and someone has to be last , this i can accept , but i think being on a coach or hanging_around for over 0 hours on what is in fact a 00min journey is unacceptable , so sorry , having serious thoughts abouth booking again because of this problem , so look into this alpharooms and i will_definitely be booking again .
neutral	bah .
negative	in my opinion they '_ve stolen the money from me because they charged a premium for their so - called saturday_morning delivery .
negative	user : furniture
negative	really , guys ?
neutral	customer_service is poor - i am still_awaiting a response to a delay claim .
neutral	its alright but i wouid use amazon as they are more reliable and legit

positive	so far 00 / 00
positive	yes £ 0000 back in 0 years . what ever i buy in the internet . be it electrical or insurance . i always check through quidco first
positive	i even have the iphone_app ¬ _ ¬
positive	however i can not praise the speed and ease of service .
neutral	the ship , and the crossing itself , were trouble_free .
neutral	if you '_ve ordered and been given 00hr dispatch then make your_own mind up , mine could be delivered tomorrow but i think that '_s pushing it a bit even for santa .
negative	although the courier was polite when she arrived , i found the whole experience very stressful and i hope to avoid this company in the future .
positive	i would happily reccommend this site .
negative	i then receieved a call to say it would be sunday morning to collect from store and what documents would i like saved .
positive	i will use printerland again and again !
negative	on nov 0 0000 i bought a compressor via_ebay for £_00 . 00 gbp .
neutral	as i picked_up the car it had averaged 00 . 0mpg over the 00 miles surepark had it , this is almost half of what it normally gets .
neutral	that delayed things by 00_hours but the end_result was replacements for both parts being immediately despatched for next_day delivery and pickup of the damaged / wrong parts by the same courier .
negative	recently i purchased an active subwoofer from them .
negative	came back to carry out the repair over a week_later , and although having assured us the dishwasher was now working , left us with the original fault and a broken dishwasher .
negative	then just as i was about to pay for a holiday with another airline , a confirmation_email came through followed_by several emails saying my item is still in the basket !!
negative	0 weeks still not received the kit , rang up and eventually got an answer and was fed some story and that the kits were going out any day .
negative	i have stayed in all day and my items have not been collected .
neutral	we were picked_up at 0 . 00am and arrived at the airport just before 0 . 00am !
positive	despite me waiting in all day , my collection did not take place on the date arranged which was disappointing , but the reason i am still scoring 0 is because of the great service i received when i brought this to p0g ' s attention - within minutes , my agent richard_mileham had rebooked my pick_up for the same day that i contacted them ( using a more_expensive service ) - richard was very polite and helpful , so all in all , i am very happy .
neutral	in addition , i stopped being_able to make card payments temporarily and when i called up my bank , they said that there was a discrepancy and possible fraud on my account which when we looked closer was caused by the fragrance_direct transaction which failed to pass full security because the addresses didn ' t match .
negative	vigila si contratas wimdu .
negative	never use orange never !
positive	they have one of the cheapest and professional services around .
negative	email to customer service . nothing .
neutral	overall , i ' d say that the hut is acceptable , but it is rarely my first choice when it comes to buying books , dvds , or games .
positive	whist there were issues they were in no way wanapart ' s fault , in fact they were completely beyond wanapart ' s control , yet they still went to great lengths to resolve them .
negative	looking at the recent reviews , i wouldn ' t have gone anywhere_near them if i ' d known beforehand .
neutral	landed at 00 . 00 , got cases , 00 . 00 booked in with alpharooms for transfer and arrived at our hotel 0 . 00am , now i think this is unacceptable for what should be a 00 min journey .
neutral	the flowers were beauiful .
negative	i said an additional £_000 was more than fair .
negative	after numberous phone_calls to parcel_hero , i was reliably assured that they would be along on the following_day to collect .

neutral	almost gave up .
positive	easy to handle and move around , very good pressure , substantial and robust .
positive	the news was that for the delay and me having to waite for the sub to be delivered to them , they will send me a brand_new subwoofer instead of the graded one on the monday then it to be delivered on the tuesday .
neutral	but at_least they did resolve the problem promptly .
positive	i had a query on the date change and a refund .
positive	really fast accurate service - good quality goods
neutral	on its return it again failed the first time it was used so again returned .
neutral	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
negative	i have only just started to check the amount spent to quantity since i had lenor delivered and realise later the amount i paid i was a nearly a litre down on quantity .
negative	now i have my wedding date set on 00 . 00 . 0000 but have no rings !

neutral	casino would how ever benefit from afew more games to choose from .
neutral	one wonders just why somebody had to mention it to them in the first place that there are people in the queue which aren ' t able to stand for as long_periods as some of the younger passengers .
negative	as soon as they take your money , they just won ' t care any more .
positive	you have to cancel then you ' ve only lost 00_% of what you would have paid .
negative	** regardless of wether the 0000 number is national or premium_rate you fail to acknowledge the fact that i have incurred further charges as a result of your customer_service department leaving my calls unanswered .

positive	great deals , free next_day courier , free 0 yr guarantee .

neutral	the waterproofs seem quite good , trousers are a bit coco - the - clown !
negative	however one has to wonder about quality when the first ring was evaluated at a higher price ( more_than 000_pounds difference ) than the second even - though the quality was supposedly higher .
neutral	i would like to see some reviews from customers who have had to make claims .
negative	in any way i cannot imagine what can be done to fix this situation !

positive	i had been let_down getting hold of a gretsch acoustic by another company ( gear0music ), and spotted that nevada had what i wanted in stock .
neutral	why would your site not let me edit the email address for the company i reviewed , why would it assume the email address was info @ nep . com just because the company is called nep why would any web author make assumptions like that .

positive	i received an e_- mail about a monitor that had gone on offer and when i had a look it was too good to pass up and if i ordered that same day , there was the option of free , next - day delivery
negative	the scam that has really got me angry this time is arriving to pick_up my car , after paying for everything i wanted on line to be hit with additional costs of 000_euros ( in case you think this is a typo , you are right one hundred and ninety six euros .)
positive	i received the order promptl .
neutral	it has cost me 0 days from work , but they have paid for the carpet + vinyl covering for the en - suite , so at_least they have been fair , but if there guy '_s had the right equipment we all wouldn_'_t have had this drama .
positive	i love love supplement_warehouse and get all my supplements from them
neutral	only after accepting it did i realise the £_00 only covered the first four weeks , and the remaining eight_weeks would cost an additional £_000 !

neutral	there is a nice little seating area by the river but this too was colonised by smokers so not pleasant for non - smokers .
negative	i phoned them on the 0000 number which cost me and explained that they had the item at their warehouse and it stated the same info on my online account .

neutral	when i tried to return it they tried to make out that i had dropped it !!
neutral	not so classy , guys .
neutral	in comparison to other major outlets , such as play . com , amazon etc they are often overpriced for the majority of things they sell and have been criticised several_times for not even having the correct price on their in - store items ( my dad got a cheaper cd when the cashier informed him the price was wrong but still gave him the lower_price but besides the point , surely this isn ' t how a business should actually operate ).
neutral	another small thing is that you say you have frozen prices since last_year but despite the loyalty_discount i still paid about £ 0 more than last_year .
negative	march 00th i have placed an order , same day delivery for march 00th , my mom ' s birthday , so i have chosen deluxe flower_arrangement , item called " gorgeous ", paid 00 £ at checkout .

positive	first_port of call for all my audio , audio software , pa requirements
positive	i ordered my new omega_seamaster from iconic_watches in july and simply couldn ' t be_happier with both the service and the quality of the watch .

neutral	the whole point of buying the digital version of a game is getting your hands on the game asap . poor service in my opinion
positive	i ' ve looked online for ages now and wasn ' t until recently i took a risk and purchased some keys online .

negative	i phoned

negative	and i needed to pay £_00 to restore my service .
positive	excellent communication from the store , would recommend to anybody !
negative	she basically argued with me that it is not late at all because it has arrived at customs in my country which is what the delivery day estimation is about .
neutral	i have never had any_problems dealing_with the hut .
neutral	overall they are ok and i still use them , just not for critical stuff any more .
negative	sure enough , we weren ' t the only ones suffering , as another table near us was complaining_about the service .
negative	i was getting more and more frustrated .
neutral	inconvenient for me as i need my order asap .
negative	so once again i called the warranty shop .
neutral	in fact the colour was closer to yellow !
neutral	customer support is not very good at all either , usually stuck on the phone with an indian_call_centre for hours when it should have been done it 00 to 00_minutes .
positive	many_thanks ,
negative	i have recently order the big moving pack plus from this website and i have only received part of the package with no tapes and no pen .
neutral	i waited but the problem continued and was left without access to funds in my clear account all night .

positive	firstly i went directly to the couriers , which i ( wrongly ) assumed would be the cheapest thing to do , and my favourite courier is ups .
positive	however , i would recommend doing your homework first and writing an itinery of the places you want to see as once the card is activated , no matter what time of day , that is classed_as your first day and then its consecutive .
positive	price on website is what you pay , looked at other instant delivery sites mentioning promotions that dont work .
neutral	the problem has now been resolved to our satisfaction
positive	initially the wrong order was sent - but the store could not have been more helpful in sorting things out and in providing compensation .
positive	great
neutral	the company did not leave the vip night club tickets at the hotel reception so we had to pay entry ourselves and have not received a refund .

neutral	tried to cancel greeting card the day after l put my order in , but was not allowed .
neutral	i ordered a rose medley for my wife for our anniversary as she_loves roses , the first problem_arose when i received an_email_stating that the order had been delivered a day early as i had been at work all day i searched high and low for the flowers including asking my neighbours if they had taken them for me but all to no_avail so i rang iflorist ans was informed that the florist had hit the wrong button and sent the email by_accident , fair_enough . the flowers duly_arrived on saturday but though nice bore no resemblance whatsoever to the order made and only comprised of 0 roses and a lot of other stuff . i tried to contact iflorist using their appalling online_chat thing but all i got from ms menla was a standard generic load of waffle that took 00_minutes to deliver . so an not very satisfactory episode which is a shame because i have had excellent service in the past .
negative	i placed an order on 0rd june , till now i havent heard_anything back .
negative	!

negative	then_proceeded to tell me the room was gone ( twin was showing as 0 available and double had " green " availability ) and when i ran another search the room was available again , this time at £_000 .

positive	:)
positive	q - quality of service , second to none .

positive	starting using them this year for my gardening needs .
neutral	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .

neutral	i would use them again , but not before trying out other services .
neutral	' i know about the sale of goods_act ' was her response , which was nice , but tht ' a s a different piece of legislation to the distance_selling regulations 0000 and the oft document is open to interpretation whereas the legislation is clear on leaving the customer out of pocket for returns under the0 day period of the distance sellings regs !

neutral	:)
negative	never !

neutral	their website indicated the item was in stock and so i ordered .
positive	it '_s really refreshing to find a team who care about setting things right .

positive	thank_you both for a wonderful and reliable service .
neutral	the poor klm person who ended_up helping_us at the booking desk and had to face allot of angry customers were very helpful and we are glad they receive such good training .
neutral	when speaking to customer service it was obvious that they did not have a means of tracking order .
neutral	update !
negative	i had a line only contract for several_years with bt / o0 for my mobile_phone , my phone broke so i chose a new phone and 0 year contract in the local o0 shop .
negative	ordered for the first time a few_months_ago from my local_store ( torquay ), and the driver forgot to bring up half of my shopping to the door , and just drove off !
neutral	not happy , because , i got less_than i thought for i - phone . it was damaged in transit while being posted . it was immaculate , when it left me . thanx . otherwise , i am happy .
negative	if a medical company can '_t stock something as basic as a syringe , there '_s no hope .
positive	would definitely use again !
neutral	update_: since submitting my review nevada have contacted me offering an_apology for this issue and as a customer i believe that shows an indication of their intent to remain focused on providing a quality retail service .
neutral	i thought the preview section worked really well and liked the fact we could play with fonts and phrasing .
negative	!
neutral	my other cat was much_easier as i mixed the paste in with his traets and he ate them all up , no problem .
neutral	the only chat_host that took her job seriously was esme but she has gone now .
neutral	unfortunately when first entering our villa our opinion was of disappointment .
negative	do they actually deliver ?
neutral	however , the items i ordered were received by me the next_day .
positive	needed a new battery for my 0000 ac 0 litre saloon .
positive	however , one thing i would urge you to be wary of is unknowingly buying from random companies through the amazon website .
neutral	i was told it isn ' t same day and loads of people had also said the same_thing i did to them .
positive	i like speedy things so this is good .
positive	give them a try .
negative	ended_up cancelling the order .
neutral	should have been confused . com
positive	mazuma are faultless , excellent customer_service team with a quick start to finish service these_guys are always friendly , would highly_recommend - 0 + stars
negative	i have cancelled it before its been dispatched !"
negative	after trying to get them to offer the original price and sending loads of emails i in the end askled for the phones to be sent back .
positive	an easy website to use and always quick .
positive	foncez !
negative	the e_- liquid does not have same intensity of flavour , but it is still better_than other_retailers , however when it comes to hardware of e_- cig , don ' t trust the ecigwizard .
positive	yes , if and when the need_arises .
neutral	can '_t see why they give a time_slot if it '_s purely fictional .
negative	dear_sirs ,
negative	buying from amazon may save you a couple of pounds initially but if they continue to close down small_businesses , causing the loss of permanent , skilled and enjoyable employment , and only providing unskilled temporary warehouse employment , then i think we will all suffer in the long_term .
neutral	unfortunately indifferent to all the others providers .
positive	great site for flogging your bits and bobs , picked_up a great membership deal !
neutral	would recommend for cheap domains , but for the rest of the service , including buying email accounts , head somewhere_else for a much more affordable service .
neutral	a good time save but no cheaper_than high_street stores .
positive	no issues .
positive	i would definitely order from peak_nutrition again as i would be confident that they would help sort out any_problems if there were any .
positive	my laptop decided to die on me so i wanted to get something that was better , and something that could also play games at a reasonable graphics level .
negative	after being a loyal_customer for many years spending thousands of pounds , i will never ever buy anything from them again .
negative	second lie .
positive	previously used for washer_dryer - excellent also , aswell as microwave ( admit didn_'_t both with fitting on that one . lol )
positive	the service provided by this company is exemplary .
neutral	everybody uses social_media now , its becoming boring , especially when you don_'_t know half the people that connect with you !
negative	what is the point of having a mobile company like this rubbish rubbish avoid at your_peril
neutral	it was returned this time using the priority option - it took an unimpressive week to be returned .
positive	thanks !
negative	absolutely awful , i am looking into cancelling my broadband , home phone and have cancelled my mobile contract .
neutral	as we were a party of six i decided to call up the call_centre .
negative	the system has_been down for over a week , have contacted them by phone and email .
neutral	there ' s nothing wrong with this , but it ' s not the same as it used to be where people are selling their used belongings for much less_than it would cost in the shops .
negative	i certainly wont be using them again . and it turns_out ebookers is much cheaper anyway .
negative	when i contacted customer_service i was fed a line and not offered any support or encouragement to use the service again !
neutral	i found love holidays by searching google - and was delighted with how easy the site is to navigate , and then purchase .
positive	value for money , well_done .
negative	it is now the day after the day on which this product was supposed to arrive and i want to go out to see an old friend before he moves to india but i am still_waiting for my delivery and am unable to even attempt to find out what might have happened to my order without spending 00p a minute ( more i think because my phone is a virgin one ).
positive	the course is well_structured , it covers not just main topics like html , xml , php , etc_., but contains a lot of material how to manage your online business as well .
neutral	prices ok , but let_down by needlessly slow delivery .
positive	the only thing i would say is that when we turned the camera on the language wasnt set to english , so we had to download the manual ( the hard copy wasnt english either ) to figure_out how to change it .
negative	still no one has replied !
positive	products were easy to order and all items in stock .
negative	i would never use this company again .
positive	their products are a great quality and value .
neutral	i ended_up paying an extra £_00 for a garanteed delivery slot .
negative	i would rather go to another company or better still buy something else .
positive	i ' ve been making purchases from green man gaming ( gmg ) for a few_years now , pc games / dlc .
neutral	i had a question today which was answered within about an_hour max so not too bad .
negative	they charged her £_00 per_month just for 0000 minutes and unlimited texting .
positive	i found it very easy to order , the communication quick and to the point and the delivery very fast , so that makes me very happy .
positive	i thoroughly_recommend them .
positive	first i acturely phoned to check items where in stock and got a lot of help on the phone on the items i wanted and how they would sound ( speakers ) and all questions i had where answerd very well i acturely orderd after 0 and i still got my items next_day cant get any better really .
negative	received an_email that product had been sent on the 0 january 00 , so it might arrive tomorrow saturday 0 january or 0 january which will be0 week taking out 0 days for bank_holidays .
neutral	customer_service at crystal itself was pretty hopeless , they just wanted to get off the phone as quickly as possible .
positive	i have used photobox . co . uk a number of times .
negative	on their website they say that they reply within 00_hours , still no reply ( 00_hours passed )
positive	dealing_with viovet is a pleasure always , i get the best service , best products and feel that i am a special customer which makes all the difference to me .
negative	i look at their web_page and strangely_enough they are on a fourth floor in a building in london .
negative	come on people , get some ethics and principles or look the words up to know what they mean .
negative	they took my details and told me that the order had not been processed and they will do it again but can see that i have paid the £_000 for the phone , she then said that to put the order through she needs to do another credit check , bearing in mind this had already been done and it had all gone_through , she asked me for the phone number and could not get the number right , so i spoke to the manager who again was useless and did not call me back .
negative	i am so appalled about this companies after service i will not purchase from them again and i recommend the members in my gaming clan to do the same .
neutral	sales people great and delivery_men really good .
neutral	edit
positive	the local fitters were just mechanics of crawley & they put themselves out above & beyond what i could have expected .
positive	they have a big variety of everything “ birdie ”
neutral	had a card from moonpig , poor quality card , almost paper - like .
neutral	it '_s really fast and a joy to use .
positive	i tried a different company as they were offering more money than mazuma , but it turns_out that mpx is a big scam and i would advise everyone to steer_clear of them and trust mazuma over other_companies false claims to be better_than them .
negative	they are ignoring calls and emails ( 0 days now ) but have put a very small apology on the website . ha !
negative	shower of excrement doesn ' t even begin to cover it .
neutral	normally i would have given 0_stars , but not on this occasion .
positive	the recommended retail price is £_00 . 00 so this is very good .
positive	i love it .
positive	just as good as it gets !
neutral	easyjet . cheap flights . you get what you pay for . small seats , & fast turn_around . if money is tight then you can '_t beat them , if you want comfort then this isn_'_t the airline for you . they do " what it says on the tin ", nothing more . having said that crew were bright & chirpy , & helpful .
negative	their worldwide number only works if you provide your card number but after_reading other person ' s experience of facing card fraud afterwards i don ' t feel_like doing this .
negative	feels_like the company has got too big and forgotten the basics .
positive	all previous parcels , including international ones , have been arranged online with no_problems whatsover .
positive	thanks to oneclickpharmacy , i can get essential items cheaper_than anywhere_else .
positive	if you haven ' t tried you don ' t know what your missing .
neutral	i believe this would help in overall sales proffits , and helping the consumer to find the best supplement for them , seeing how supplements are different for every body type .
positive	when i realised my mistake i emailed them on a saturday_night .
neutral	i will_continue to make deposit ' s on virgin games but not like i used too !
neutral	i have now given up and just trying to get a refund .
positive	sheryl .
positive	i ' m so pleased with the quality and the price that i will be buying again !
neutral	i '_ve had issues like this with dpd '_s " attempted deliveries " last christmas as well .
neutral	very quickly delivered .
neutral	iv been using play for some time and watched it grow and grow it used to be excellent but now its just mediocre really delivery issues aplenty and call centers that are difficult to get through to , an ever expanding range of goods to choose from , one word of caution if you buy an item and it gets lost in our great postal system you have to wait two full weeks before you can report it to play as lost .
neutral	i was told that they could not send a replacement , as they only had large packing boxes , and was offered a refund of 00p as this was the price of the product .
positive	it all arrived on time and both me and my wife were very pleased with our purchase !
positive	i find myself browsing through their range for hours !
positive	quick and easy
neutral	they fit perfect , the leather is lovely and soft and they are very comfortable .
positive	.
positive	quality and customer_service are consistent and we will definitaly purchase again !
positive	i bought the item from their ebay store .
neutral	the support contact was very helpful and was just offering to send a new one when i spotted my mistake .
neutral	every order i place i seem to have to return something because the item is faulty , sized incorrectly or not as advertised .
positive	the skins are very good , but it would be nice to see the apple logo through the diablo skins , cut out or transparent .
positive	if you are looking for a web_hosting company - read my honest reviews and make a wise decision
positive	they came quicker_than i expected so it was a nice surprise .
negative	there are other_companies out there which do wayfarers at a cheaper price .
negative	there was a problem with delivery , then the items were out of stock , and i didn_'_t hear_anything for a week .
neutral	before processing the payment the agent informed me the amount she will be deducting of the card and asked my permission .
positive	order process was easy - peasy .
negative	despite allowing any resolution images to be loaded that look brilliant on the screen there is no quality_control at goodprint so my business_cards came to me blurry on one side and fab on the other !
neutral	was happy with the product , no damage and arrived quickly .
negative	twice , a few hours_later , the booking was cancelled by alpharooms .
negative	to sum up anybody who is about to book with bravofly please think_twice as non - existent service and so frustrating approach is hardly to be seen elsewhere .
negative	the window i was given was from 0am to 0pm ( even_though it says 0pm if you go to the " track my order " page ).
negative	their service was dreadful on the phone .
negative	next evening reply from customer service that flowers had been delivered to security who had promised to see i got the flowers the next_day , as flowers delivered at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	very very slow delivery and thank_god i have amazon_prime .
negative	after numerous_attempts to set_up a payment plan that both_parties were happy with i was advised by quickquid to change my payment date so that my account went into arrears and to call them to set_up a payment plan ( as they could only do this once i was in arrears ) after calling i received no help at all .
negative	!
positive	very helpful young_lady advised that my parcels would be delivered the following_day and to ring in the morning to obtain a time .
negative	sometimes i think it would just be easier to bang my head against the wall !
positive	rinsed and in the cupboard in half an_hour .
negative	i ' d rather spend a few_quid more to be treated with honesty .
negative	if the action required was not taken within 00 days further action would be taken .
neutral	the spa however were calling me all day friday to make_sure we definitely wanted our appointment for the following_day ( as i later found out that vanessa had called them on the friday_morning to cancel our appointments - even_though i had asked her to do anything of the sort )!
neutral	buyer_beware - although i still only have half a desk , the customer service that i have since received has_been excellent .
positive	a personal_touch with professionalism and honesty .
neutral	as if i am going to buy more tyres or an exhaust in the near_future .
negative	advised i have no legal right to " not accept " or " reject " the goods based on the fault as the warranty superseded my statuary rights .
neutral	so my sister hadn_'_t realised it was urgent to collect the box and give the flowers a drink . the box obviously needs to make it obvious there are flowers inside !
positive	the condition of the item was perfect , with the box in perfect_condition ( just as it should have been ).
positive	you really can ' t get better_than that .
neutral	there was a very unpleasant musty smell .
negative	company should accept_responsibility for their incompentence .
neutral	not best pleased at the end of a very long day !
negative	they said that payment has never been sent and to re - sent the £_000 again !!!
negative	use this company at your_peril .
positive	i was very pleasantly_surprised to have a call from the us within minutes of ordering , to confirm the order details and ensure shipping details were correct .
neutral	it ' s a great concept . but , a few_years_ago they offered really good discounts on rooms .
negative	their worldwide number only works if you provide your card number but after_reading other person ' s experience of facing card fraud afterwards i don ' t feel_like doing this .
negative	finally , after 0 weeks_later , they said they ' ll send me a returns / refund form for my missing order within 00_hours .
neutral	the delivery was then very fast , and the keyboard is excellent .
positive	i ' ve bought a few items from bureau direct and had great service on every occasion .
neutral	they had 0 months to tell the hotel about the rooms we had booked and our request to be close to each other , it ' s not as if it was last_minute .
positive	very pleased with my new akg headphones .
neutral	i have signed_up to topcashback , the idea is good but i can not find any offers worth taking part in .
neutral	they have seals on their items which means if you break it you can ' t return it which i think is silly as well .
neutral	on opening the parcel it was apparent that the synth had been in and out of the box because the box was not sealed and there were signs of light usage on the unit . may have been an ex - display_unit ?
positive	ordered a road play mat on monday arrived friday .
neutral	booked to usa and got some good tickets , patient people , good prices , was generally very happy .
neutral	they seriously need to look in to how they can improve their ordering system as it ' s quite disgusting paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery of a parcel with at_least 00_% of it ' s expected contents missing .
positive	i would highly_recommend these_guys .
positive	i had a query today and went on to the live_chat , i was dealt_with by sammy taylor who was extremely_helpful and courteous , i got the answer i was looking for and was able to continue placing my order .
positive	the staff are always amazingly helpful and the holidays are so relaxing , i can_honestly say i have not had a better holiday than a james_villa holiday
negative	i am presuming he was the one that told me it was out for delivery in the first place .
positive	twice i ' ve had to return items , and both_times the staff have resolved my problem very quickly ( same day ).
positive	product prices good too .
neutral	one expects a ba staff lady to have more customer relationship skills than the airport security staff and had she explained the concerns as well as he did , the situation would not have escalated to security level .
neutral	so the key points are : screwdriver , insulated , bit type & length .
negative	it wont give me a row or seat number making it virtually impossible to re sell them !
neutral	edit0 : just got my amazon delivery , the guy claims he came this morning and was outside ringing the bell for 0 minutes .
neutral	had to ring company ( phone picked_up quickly by staff ) to find out payment not processed .
negative	so i called and registered my new number and done everything they asked to do .
neutral	funny how they can instantly respond to such reviews and ' sound ' great and concerned to anyone reading them , but then . still do nothing !
negative	the tyres have since dissapeared from the grippy website !
negative	inspired by the midsummer sunshine , this ensemble of seasonal blooms perfectly encapsulates the season '_s charm with a modern twist .
positive	i had no_problems with this company received item quickly and with no hiccups to deal with .
positive	so many sites like this look so dodgy and are but this site is the exception .
positive	beware of less well_known recycling firms who offer you more money as they invariably then offer you a lower offer when they receive the phone - no issues like that with muzumba .
neutral	clever service but reward is poor
negative	the concerts in manchester n they are in london , at a business .
positive	oh and most_importantly his prices are the best around too :)
negative	ordered christmas_gifts from them , money taken from my account immediately , no goods have arrived .
positive	i used hellocanvas through an offer , and am_delighted with the result . i have a previous canvas photo from another company , but there is no comparison , the hellocanvas is far_superior . i selected a water scene from a recent_trip to venice , and friends & family comment on how great it looks , transforming a holiday snap into a canellto !
negative	totally not fit for purpose – utterly_useless !
negative	the other £_00 had been claimed by this greedy bunch as a £_00 ' admin ' fee for each ticket .
neutral	attempted to contact them to find them to be shut from 0 on a saturday , and so now i have to wait_until monday before i can talk to anyone .
positive	p - printer , i purchased a samsung ml0000nd mono laser_printer , it was perfect , easy to set_up and well_packaged .
negative	today i have received a further letter from the debt agency advising they have been instructed by o0 to continue to pursue the debt - this in simple terms is harassment , as i owe them nothing and don_'_t even have a contract with them anymore .
negative	i was told ' no problem ' we will refund you asap but will be charged 00 euros for admin .
positive	will_continue to order from you always , will be placing more orders for ego and more flavours next week !
positive	anita pickering .
neutral	been a customer of g0m for many_years during which time i have purchased guitars , leads , mixers , keyboards and many other music related items , the service use to be a good one - hence my remaining a loyal_customer , as of late i have found the service to be slipping .
positive	we have always obtained great seats for the concerts booked and will_continue to use the company .
negative	i received several calls telling_me when they will be installed , which was all different , i had installers turn_up without_any dates being booked and had meters installed on the 00th_july and still had calls from suppliers asking when i want my meters installed .
negative	the mere fact that they also give you reduced items is rediculous as well , dates were also terrible and required me to eat everything within 0 - 0 days lol !
neutral	the activities ( its a knockout ) and the nightclub were okay other than the fact we were strictly informed to be at club before 00pm for the guestlist_entry and vip ( as paid for ), so we left the restaurant / bar in a rush to ensure we got there in time .
positive	prices are always very competitive but past customer offers are unbeatable !
negative	the shopping_basket had such a poor fitting it fell_off at the first small bump in the pavement .
neutral	the receptionist where my sister works received a box and emailed my sister to say she had a parcel .
positive	supplementwarehouse
neutral	je_suis prete a commander a nouveau chez_eux , mais cette_fois uniquement les produits disponibles immediatement .
neutral	as other_users have mentioned you need to have some confidence in a site especially when paying quite a lot of money for flights and unfortunately this site did not provide that .
neutral	trustpilot uses a system to allow retailers to request a review guideline and in the interim period not show the review .
negative	containers take days to arrive so surely they would have known well in advance but failed to inform their customers .
negative	i have tried contacting them to ask for a refund .
positive	this company provided me with a very good service and the delivery was prompt .
positive	:)
neutral	dont intend to use again !
neutral	they now stock shelves during the day , or rather during the busiest times possible , rather_than at night , which is very frustrating trying to dodge around them .
neutral	i still prefer visiting subway for their quality of food and good service .
neutral	but when tyres arrived , ive check them on internet and found the same almost 00 pound cheaper per tyre .
neutral	boo !
positive	brilliant service highly_recommended
positive	oh and you gotta_love getting free t -_shirts and shaker_bottles !
negative	i can ' t get a refund because it ' s been used .
positive	the gun case was as i hoped , and it was packed very securely in bubble_wrap and corrugated cardboard , so arrived in perfect_condition .
positive	hi , i have a bit of girlie gossip to share with you , do check out fragrance_direct online .
negative	it appeared that they had been sent via standard post and had been lost but nicecans had no issues with sending me another three units , this time via 0nd_class recorded_delivery .
neutral	i received a phone_call the day after_placing my order to say that the rod in stock was damaged but i was assured that i would receive my newly ordered rod by the end of the following week at the latest which i was still happy to wait for and i did appreciate the phone_call to let me know .
negative	appauling service from both the shop and tellysales staff .
neutral	next_day 00 / 00 / 00 the courier sent me their first contact , a ' no reply accepted ' email " your dell order is scheduled to arrive between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
positive	duly did and was told by another helpful lady the goods would be delivered in approx 00 minites , and they were .
positive	andrew was able to sit with me and together we agreed a specification for the laptop .
positive	would buy from them again .
positive	by the following evening it was as it should be and very , very comfortable indeed .
negative	we cancelled and went to bt and have a much_better service .
positive	the pricing and quality of the products is ideal .
positive	through car del mar booked with avis who had a very nice med size toyota corolla at micro car price
positive	the time was came to buy new glasses and i was about to go to a store and make an investment of about 000_euros .
positive	we ordered a new washing_machine from appliances_online as our other one had died in a cloud of smoke on the friday_morning .
neutral	i cannot understand_why this company charge so much .
negative	website said 0 units in stock .
negative	passports , id cards and such like are important documents , you need them to get on planes and so on .
negative	first problem , noticed over christmass , the internet was not available on the new phone without my house wifi .
neutral	).
negative	this was the first time i have used them ( usually use interflora ), and very definitely the last .
negative	they offered me a shop - soiled one at a discount .
negative	mr_simon betts was now accusing me of blackmail and threatening to sue for “ substantial damages ” as i had not removed my review !!!
positive	we didn_'_t take the option of the installation service .
neutral	in spite of myself , i keep shopping online with them although i know i will have problems with delivery .
negative	well , today we have ( not ) received yet another home office document .
positive	catherine very polite & helpful service will use again .
positive	for a while i have been looking for a website like this , great webste , great giveaways , all_round a great website which i recommend to anyone :)
negative	after this frustrating experience i tried with little success in emailing plumbworld several_times ( they have no phone number ).
negative	they told me this would take 00 - 00 working_days .
negative	i stated that i wanted a call today and that i wasn ’ t prepared to wait a week again for my shopping .
neutral	games on there are good but tbh .
negative	i phoned the expensive helpline on monday and after sitting on hold , going through lots of menus i eventually explained the situation .
neutral	sorry to say i work for a major manufacturer servicing millions of customers per year - we use yodel - won_'_t be for long .
neutral	plus the t . v .
neutral	i question whether i will use tyre_shopper again
negative	i was told that if the engineer has_been to assess our dishwasher and it is decided that they will not honour our claim then we wouldn_'_t get our excess back as costs had been started .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	a box 0m high , by about 00cm by 00cm and what was inside - s small spray containers .
negative	once when something went_astray it was returned to me , however there '_s no sign of this package .
negative	disgusted with bt , over the passed 00 years we have had times when bt had to supply our telephone line and they have made our lives hell every since !
positive	i was emailed this morning to say it had been received , then lunch time to say it had been checked , then this afternoon to say they had paid me .
positive	i love muubaa , not that i can shop there regularly !
neutral	apart_from that , o0 are still a good company , but they need to be more competitive in terms of pricing and benefits if they want to keep up with their competitors .
negative	however on cancelling one of our contracts with them , we '_ve be hit with what i can only describe as a scandalous hidden charge of £_000 . 00 .
positive	i bought a solar light watering can decorated with flowers ; a lovely present for a friend .
positive	beware of wanna be topdog web_hosting company .
negative	be very aware !!!
negative	two months after leaving scottish_power i am still_waiting for a refund of the credit they owe me .
positive	saved_myself a bundle of money over the years .
positive	will deffo be using again .
negative	!
neutral	used to love this site , but does anyone use it anymore ?!
positive	i will be ordering a lot more from them in future !
neutral	but that '_s the idea .
neutral	after all i still think o . f . l .
negative	i hope now that the ceo jason . tyldesley @ csl - furniture . co . uk does the decent thing and returns my deposit as requested and have a word with your suppliers they are giving you a bad_reputation !!!
positive	!
neutral	if you ask to know the name of the accommodation you ' re told that the information is only released once the full_amount has been paid .
positive	great service and i will_definitely check on this site first in future .

negative	domestos citrus fresh bleach x 0
negative	a full_tank covers 0000 km , how many people do you know who drive this distance on a beach family holiday .
negative	we never were able to get any refund on the service that we had experienced .
negative	complaint emails have been conveniently ignored .
negative	i had the misfortune on an offer from photobox , spent 0 hours on web , trying to upload_photos for calender , speaking on chat numerous_times with tracie currie , poor customer service as saying will not upload_photos from google chromebook ? saying i need to try different computer . well surely i am not going to buy another computer when i have new chromebook and there systemscare not up to date , very unproffesional service , avoid at all costs .
neutral	after another week i complained on trustpilot because i didn ' t want people to experience the same_thing .
negative	ok i said , that was acceptable even_though i had already been charged £_00 ( 0 % for using credit_card )
positive	i expect they probably beat them on paying their proper share of uk tax too ?
neutral	made an other order last thursday money was removed from account 0 hour later then my account on ebuyer updated to items wont be sent until 00th for delivery on 00th .
positive	always a great selection of events and locations .
negative	unfortunately i chose to pay by paypal which had an old email address associated with it , they took this to be my address which i think it a very flawed way to do business .
negative	i refused ( who wouldn ' t ?).
negative	bad reception on south of england !
negative	my wife '_s birthday came and went , but the camera never arrived .
positive	bodybuilding was cheaper but supplement_warehouse is great because they honor the competitor ' s price .
negative	how this company makes money is a wonder .
negative	the cost of fuel at the time of the trip was 0 . 00 per_litre which equates to 00 euros .
positive	without_doubt the best currency_exchange company in the market .
neutral	this needs to be addressed !
neutral	0 days_later it arrived , beautify packaged .
neutral	for the price , it was fine .
neutral	after 0 days i was extremely concerned and had the same customer_service rep telling_me " your product will arrive by friday ."
positive	its prices are compeitive and it is proactive when making_sure its customers know where their order are at all times .
neutral	great quality products .
neutral	of late delivery failure after delivery failure .
positive	i was worried_about something and asked a question via the web_site .
neutral	delivery was later than initialty forecast - said 0 days then gave a range covering 0 days .
positive	very good site and great prices !
neutral	summary_: awfull service , i feel if i had not called and made a complaint things could have been alot worse and who_knows when i would have got my item , but once i started talking to people on the phone they seemed nice enough and got the item to me asap .
negative	sorry , had real bad problems with their service and when you try to sort , you speak to someone going through the questions on the card , like an eastern robot . moved to o0 .
negative	i had never_heard of yodel before yesterday and i am not surprised .
negative	they did little to help for a full week - all this time my builder was waiting for the bathroom pieces to install .
neutral	as i am a firm believer in second chances , i told them to either make_sure my item arrived by the 00nd or give me a refund .
positive	i ' m not a massive fan of sailing or that ' s what i thought , until my italian friend convinced me to join her on the king arawak for a weekend .
neutral	again today a game which is released today i haven ' t recieved .
positive	the mere fact that google is set as my home page says it all .
neutral	it took 00 days for one of my parcels to be delivered !
positive	there is a number of reasons i always go back to them : fantastic prices , speedy_delivery , very helpful staff .
neutral	unfortunately the descriptions are getting worse , loads of pretty words but trying to find the key information is useless .
negative	i checked the cctv , there was no attempted delivery .
neutral	i could of at the time of placing my deposit with iconic_watches obtained the exact_same watch from an other company guaranteed in stock albeit at a cost of £_00 more but in hindsight £_00 on a watch costing over £ 0000 would have been worth it .
neutral	i am reviewing the post_office here today .
positive	when i say how much it cost and where i got it from they ask ' are they secondhand ?'
positive	only place i could get them .
positive	this procedure cost me 00_euros and one week from the day i make my order !!!
positive	faultless service !
positive	i was very pleased about the service provided it was very easy to access what i wanted and i had the right information at hand i have no issues with this site and would use it again and recommend it to friends
positive	i ordered some flavours for plain e_- liquid , which is hard to find at a reasonable_price with a trusted company .
positive	always first_class service from my local dominos ( kilmarnock ). very easy to order either online or by phone . very quick delivery and always hot and delicious . i love the money off vouchers i get through the mail , makes the prices quite reasonable .
neutral	rest must be good but then this was my first opinion
negative	john_lewis offer 0 year_warranty on ipads .
neutral	can '_t be bothered to return them , but wouldn_'_t order again .
positive	but that didn ' t stop us from browsing around at other great deals and hotels way out of our price range .
negative	before i continue , i ask that in any response to me you don_’ t insult me by saving it is nothing to do with you and it ’_s your suppliers .
neutral	why is your vat ridiculous now and why do you keep on raising my bill .
positive	very efficient service and a keen price
negative	update 0
positive	i am now enjoying listening to my new speakers !
neutral	course ' you ', ( as in ' this ' survey ) can forward my thoughts to them , and ' they ' will contact me . ?
negative	did my wife take me in ?
negative	viagogo does have a disclaimer on the website saying that times are subject to change but im sure this does not count when they out the wrong time in the first place and the actual venue has never changed the time !!!!
negative	the person i was speaking to just didn ' t understand that there were two roads in london with the same name and that they were delivering to the wrong one ( despite me putting the correct postcode in my original order ).
neutral	only one whinge .
positive	the only disappointment we had was the amount of money we were able to release , but this was because of the age of the younger of the two of us , and a report from the gp which didn_'_t show the full nature of my husband '_s illness .
negative	when i book a car through holiday autoes that is exactly_what i do .
negative	then saw note .
neutral	we only found it in the nick of time .
positive	this went_smoothly with the yodel van turning_up on the correct day and the driver being very helpful , telling_me about how long it would take for my package to be returned to amazon .
neutral	inadequate packaging , ( some oil lost from the pocket ).
neutral	i got plenty of emails and texts letting me know were and when my orders would be delivered , but they were all mixed up . getting a text saying that the recipient have received their flowers and then an_email_saying they would be sent the next_day .
negative	booked next - day delivery for an exercise_bike .
negative	was the usual marketing ( yeah_right !
positive	products are reasonably_priced and the item arrived in no time at all .
negative	this all happened at the end of june and i ' ve only just got my refund today .
negative	wait ages for assistance !
negative	because there wouldn_'_t be anyone at home during the working week i opted to pay £_00 for a saturday a . m . delivery .
neutral	i think my health issues are pretty minor but they bump up the premium .
positive	the one thing that bothered me initially was that shipping to my particular residence was $_00 and i believed this was absurd .
positive	i have hosted my websites in several web_hosting_companies in the uk .
negative	he said the couriers don_'_t have ' works phones ' and are under no obligation to use their own . i just couldn_'_t believe it !!
negative	thanks .
negative	neither have arrived as of 00th_december .
negative	they explained how i could view the terms and conditions attached to my orders and they finished by expressing the hope that the above information was helpful to me .
neutral	- hidden_charges .
positive	kept me fully_informed of progress - would highly_recommend and use again .
negative	i then phoned them up asking if i could just add the extra cash to upgrade it to the next_day delivery , they said no , so i asked for a refund .
negative	the roaming rates are outrageous .
positive	brass handles of a very good quality - most pleased with them .
negative	do not use this company if you want a reliable service .
neutral	please_note that the company is a bit_slow when it comes to refunding payments .
neutral	i like subway sandwiches but they are overpriced .
neutral	id like to thank alex preston for his help and phone_calls , he did a brilliant p . r .
neutral	have purchased a very large item before from them and charges were minimal , but they wanted 00 quid to deliver a fairly small item to me , it was only 0 . 00 to get it delivered to glasgow . i do not live in a remote or island location !
negative	they advertise very cheap goods that they do not have , just to get people '_s orders of £_00 or more when they offer free delivery .
positive	i think lastminute . com not only have some awesome deals , but they are really helpful on the other end of the phone .
neutral	booking was really quick and the feedback email was quicker_than the booking email .
positive	lots of choice , lovely products and excellent delivery service !
neutral	excellent hotel , well worth the money !
positive	i just cannot_fault them for their service .
neutral	if your trying to save money go to your local_store
negative	the flowers , they never arrived ,
negative	was given no explanation and no apology .
negative	when i called them they said they had issued another invoice and the goods would be with me within a few_days .
negative	!
neutral	fast efficient service but unfortunately wrong shirt sent it didn_'_t even match the shirt on the delivery note .
neutral	they cant fix it and find the problem if no one speaks up .
negative	avoid !
neutral	i was so relieved i didn ' t think to ask what the confusion was .
negative	i was then informed on the site , that my refund had indeed been authorised and £_00 was being re - credited to my account .
neutral	il s ' agit de 0 chaises victoria ghost ( starck ) et nous_avons évidemment trouvé que_le site d ' infurn était très bien fait , hyper attractif avec_des prix défiant toute concurrence .
negative	proridermobility . com are not a customer service focused company – by any stretch .
negative	they didn ' t even bother to reply my messages .
negative	then said it will be up to 0 days before i get my refund .
neutral	).
positive	brilliant !
negative	avoid
neutral	no reply .
negative	we would never use this company again , will never recommend them and will tell anyone that asks the truth !!!!!
neutral	people like andrea today who instantly understood the problem , was intuitive about my dissatisfaction and made a beautifully timed upgrade gesture to smooth things .
negative	several phone_calls later i received a part - refund and eventually ( 0 months later !!!)
negative	" enormously disappointing .
negative	another single pair ( most expensive i '_ve ever purchased ) bought at the same time were ok when bought , but a few washes later ( hand washed - never in very hot_water ) had lost all elasticity .
negative	they stated that " we have a backlog of messages which requires response ".
positive	great price and laptop .
positive	this is the second time i have used_resorthoppa and would definitely recommend them .
negative	this company also ship lots of close dated ( expired product ) which they claim to be fresh - scientifically , most nutrients degrade during their shelf_life thus lessening intended benefits over time - especially proteins .
negative	i ' m confused as to how i even do this n the fact i don ' t get the money until after the buyer had confirmed they have received it .
neutral	rates can fluxuate so until last_minute you wont know how much you are paying .
positive	from start to finish your company is a at the very least a 0 star organisation in every_aspect , it has_been an_absolute pleasure to deal with you and i hope to again in the future .
neutral	i waited three_weeks for delivery but hope thats just a one off .
negative	however as they can ' t even get the basic billing right i doubt i have any chance of getting the money they owe me !
neutral	it ' s a shame , because i ' m a bit_iffy about using their service now as their website doesn ' t say if something is out of stock .
negative	just sat on hold for an_hour to be told that they could not give me any time scale of when my final_bill would be prepared even_though we left in december .
positive	i ordered a desk which av0home kindly price matched .
negative	i contacted my protein to return the items only to be told i would have to meet the cost of returning them .
negative	they were not comfortable so i tried to get a refund as their policy .
neutral	finally 0th delivery and thank_god after more_than 0months we got the right size bed - frame .
positive	really impressed .
positive	il be back . used you for a few_years now .
neutral	overall i would try them again if i was looking to rent again .
negative	i would suggest that you try deliverance . co . uk much more reliable .
positive	we have problems every year with rats in the chicken shed .
positive	comfy bed , the bath had jacuzzi in it with quite powerful jets as well .
positive	would definitely_use them again .
negative	taht was almost a week ago and i still_haven_'_t received them .
negative	the postal details state that the items will be sent via recorded_delivery , however after one week they had still not arrived so i contacted nicecans to ask for a tracking_number .
positive	i ' ve been playing since 0000 .
negative	what a joke !
negative	it is now proven the link between carbon emissions and global warming yet your fuel policies actively encourage people to use more fuel than they need , you will frequently hear the phrase “ we might as well drive as we have paid for the fuel ” how can you sleep at night knowing you are contributing to the death of the planet just so you can dishonestly make a few extra pounds , do you not have any corporate responsibility at all .
negative	still fighting for a refund !
negative	then i called to moneybookers who are registered here in uk who charged my account on the behalf of them i told them they are running scam and you are the part of this scam and i will take legal_action_against you then they contacted to simply electronic and they refund my money .
neutral	and the frustrating thing is often the error can happen just when you need it most , meaning you are stranded .
negative	i think it is sloppy customer service to just blame royal_mail .
positive	i reckon i got a great deal more than i paid for .
negative	they refused to give a full and immediate refund and while i did eventually get my money refunded it took a lot of time and hassle .
negative	another collection was arranged and the woodshed was still the alternative collection point .
negative	this is the first really bad_experience of on - line ordering for me .
positive	i found jacky extremely knowledgeable and helpful , she always answered my emails immediately , and i think she got us an amazing deal .
negative	the order was confirmed but then half an_hour later i received a second email telling_me that my order had been cancelled .
neutral	first lot of shelves - some the wrong depth and all damaged by courier .
neutral	i don ' t think trustpilot are writing reviews for companies , but i do think stores pay reputable_companies to blast reviews for them . i think trust_pilot should watch out for this !
neutral	the lights in the office are automatic - they only turn on when someone is in the room and stay on for about 00 - 00_minutes after leaving .
negative	after all the calls and " its a beautiful piece " comments , i was expecting an amazing ring .
negative	i telephoned customer_services to be told that the bench seat was out of stock because i changed the delivery date and so nothing was being delivered .
negative	i have managed to convince her that its only a week to resize and shine but hopefully she can have it before the weekend .
positive	firstly they were by_far the cheapest seller of what i needed they beat ebay and the other online sellers so i placed my order . almost strait away they emailed me apologising that they had just sold the last stock and couldnt finish my order so i called them .
positive	i will recommend globalwebpay to everyone i know .
neutral	i have collected from a variety of their stores and i have to say that the whole collection process is really painful .
negative	at 00 . 00hrs i received an_email to say " tried to deliver your order from scan_computers however no one available to accept delivery ".
neutral	they delivered the flowers and they were lovely but they delivered them on the wrong date !
positive	a good way to break the ice , get things started and give you a rough_idea of the products that may be available to you .
negative	un fair , miss - informed and above all xxx !
negative	i order three bras from this company , had my bank card debited for all three , yet only two arrived and a note saying the other one was out of stock .
neutral	didn_'_t receive the voucher_code deduction at checkout and the free gifts specified didn_'_t arrive !
neutral	first off , i do purchase my music , but the prices on itunes are just off - putting sometimes .
negative	it would have only taken one phone_call to me and this would '_ve been sorted within minutes , but with such appalling communication it dragged on all week .
neutral	makes it a bit frustrating to navigate , but the prices do make it worth it .
positive	i have been buying from supplement_warehouse for about 0 years now .
neutral	she told me that the cleaning staff had key access to all the offices to ensure they could carry out their duties even when the offices are locked .
negative	pathetic .
negative	the bank will abuse you in every way possible save for actual physical assault .
neutral	if the review has the slightest mention of a service complaint , the review stands , even if it is illegal or just wrong .
positive	my disc drive laser was replaced in 00_minutes , at £_00 . 00 ( half the price of most other quotes ) with a 0 month warranty as advertised .
neutral	if i have any comment to make about ebay , it '_s that they are forever fiddling - adding new things , changing old things .
positive	a fantastic service where i was updated every_step of the way and saved over £_000 on jessops and other stores prices .
neutral	for instance_:
neutral	it seems like an amazing site but just be wary and check it out for yourself .
negative	they will do their up most not to do an exchange or a refund , reciept or no reciept .
positive	i have used appliance_planet many_times .
positive	merlin had a great deal on .
neutral	original review - i would not purchase from ebuyer again ( after spending c . £ 0 , 000 over the last 0 - 0 years ) based on their response to my recent return under the distance_selling regulations , where their trained squirrel quoted an oftguidance document and beleived it to take precedence over the actual legislation !
neutral	why ?
negative	i ordered a bike from evans .
negative	0 days after that day has passed still_waiting .
negative	( supposed to be 00 year_warranty ) they have no pictures of the damage and they have thrown out the bracket or so they say .
neutral	most goods are good quality and reasonably_priced .
neutral	until they put timeline in .
negative	well i would not buy from them if they gave a holiday for £_00 .
positive	i ' d recommend them
positive	sevice excellent
negative	still couldn_'_t get through on phone and no response to email or written letter .
positive	i have been using various web_hosting_companies since 0000 .
neutral	i sent olotels an_email on 00th_november , immediately after_speaking with the hotel , to advise .
negative	if you want a decent bunch of flowers please pay a bit more and use interflora who have never delivered me a bad bunch before .
neutral	support is great , especially since the advent of the apple retail_stores where i can book a slot at the genius bar and get my problem sorted in store most of the time .
neutral	!
neutral	i was annoyed that we hadn ' t had a simple email or phone call to explain the delay .
negative	be_careful when you buy from here since you may get what you did not want you will be stuck with it
positive	ps - search for a discount_code online - i manged to get free delivery worth £ 0 . 00 !
negative	i will happily update this review if i get a refund within a week , but i think hell is more likely to freeze over first .
positive	however in my case it was not a significant delay , and may be it was more due to post delays rather_than highlandtitles fault .
neutral	again i was lucky the manufacture had done a better job with its own packaging so the item arrived in good condition .
negative	the guy on the end of the phone kept telling_me no one would have said that to me if it was not the case and refused to let me speak to a some one higher up in the company .
negative	so i emailed and then used there contact us form on there site and have not heard a peep from them .
positive	what more can you ask for ?
neutral	as for the night club_entry we did take_advantage of this but we had to be there before 00 which , i ' m sure , you can get for free anyway .
positive	for the first time i see such extreme fast and accurate delivery !
positive	the bike folds up so that i can carry it up to my flat on the third floor without any difficulty .
negative	you could have at_least tried to phone me !
neutral	there was not as much noise from other rooms as we have experienced in other budget hotels which was good .
neutral	i do get a lot of emails from groupon ( at_least 0 a day , sometimes up to 0 ).
negative	they have put me off citadel miniatures for life now .
neutral	instead of returning the fuel_tank full they now want it returned empty and then to charge you way over the odds for a full_tank .
neutral	talk_talk get a lot of flak but other than changing my contract without telling_me i have found their service ok
negative	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
negative	i email the company and wowcher , to not hear_anything back bar an_automated email_saying they would get in touch ." great ".
neutral	the item is ok .
neutral	it is just an extra way of making money .
negative	he has now made his first trip taking it on the bus with ease .
neutral	original review :
neutral	would like to see a better service where you are advised without asking that your order has_been delayed_due to stock .
negative	i was puzzled by , very nice ?
negative	the t &_cs are such that you can '_t claim within 00 days of starting the policy .
positive	haveing tried for almost a month on a similar site call the garden shop to be totally let_down twice and ill never go back garden for less will_definately get my custom again
neutral	je dis que ok , je veux bien attendre un mois de plus mais plus de blagues , cette_fois je_n ' accepterai pas d ' autre retard .
negative	all day i waited and waited for my phone to be delivered .
neutral	never_experienced that cs_team is closed for lunch , this is most bizarre since other customers can call only during these times .
negative	now let me remind you of something , it was “ peak time ”, peak season and the airport was packed so why did you charge me 00 euros extra ?
neutral	then it went_downhill with messages not passed between made and the delivery company .
positive	the web store is user_friendly and just a breeze .
neutral	the whole villa desperately_needed updating , especially the bathrooms .
positive	was told that there was no way that my iphone could be unlocked by a certain telecoms company ; looked at this site and was suspicious although site looks professional and theres a phone number with contact address .
neutral	will wait and see when fitted as to how good they are .
positive	thanks , i am very satisfied for your services .
negative	shame it '_s just words .
positive	love supplement_warehouse !
positive	delivery was quick , packaging was good , product was enjoyed !
neutral	this is where users from the same native language could enrol into a class that has a trusted community member ( s ) or a paid busuu staff_member that will help teach the class members .
neutral	fee should have remained the same as at the start of the procedure .
neutral	i ordered 0 separate bouquets for 0 separate people .
negative	unfortunately the experience was so bad i started using the chiquitos word to describe things i dislike , albeit with slightly mispelt letters to rhyme with a certain naughty word .
neutral	first time i have ever felt the need to review a company - i ordered at 00 : 00 on friday so just missed the cut_off for next_day delievery ( which as i paid £_00 . 00 for my bracket im not to worried_about next_day ) bracket arrived in perfect order and fits my tv perfectly .
neutral	they then say they ' ll write a note on the system and the charge will be reversed ( which doesn ' t actually appear to happen ).
positive	!
positive	you meet the real people at the right time .
positive	enough said !
neutral	a further call followed while i was still at work , wanting to speak to me as the card_holder and then promising to call later , when i returned .
positive	i found it to be cheaper per_night to book and also to be cheaper because they don ' t charge the extra $ 0 that greedy hostelworld does .
negative	i changed to thurs .
neutral	the only other glasses i like were £_00 - 00 more in cost of which i was somewhat unhappy having to pay full cost .
negative	please dont buy stuff from them they are running a scam .
positive	so i redeemed the voucher on e_- careers web_site and this is how my study has begun .
neutral	i only used them once online and that was more_than enough for me .
positive	what can i say ?
negative	waited in all day .
negative	unfortunately can ' t even see the matter being solved any time soon .
negative	not happy about that !!!!!
negative	or is this just another example of big - business scumbag ethics ?
neutral	my mobile was on the table beside me the whole time and no missed calls were recorded for the whole of that afternoon .
positive	very good service internet service is great .
positive	kommunikasjonen underveis er_det heller ingenting å si på .
negative	having been a customer with ybs for a long time i always believed they were better_than the banks and that i could trust them .
negative	i ordered online a number of shirts spent nearly_£_000 however it says online buy one get one free , customer serivces not so unless you add two items to basket , absolutely ridiculous when clearly the web updates to 0 items for each item , then you receive only one . they then offered me a measley 00_%_off next purchase but i lose 00_% of my order as no free items , very rude customer_services on online_chat and never answer phones . avoid this company be warned shop elsewhere online read all below negative_reviews . digraceful .
positive	i bought a beto mountain bike shock pump gauge & bleed valve mp000 for my husband a week_ago .
neutral	the business lounge was very bland .
negative	i don ' t care how much cheaper talktalk are , i will happy pay alot more for my broadband in future , just so i do not have to deal with them again .
negative	all my orders have had a delay of some sort .
neutral	so will see if it arrives .
positive	the rubber backing stop '_s them moving even with two dogs running about :-) have wash one already and has washed realy well would buy from these again .
neutral	however i have had a problem with one supplier - the beauty challenge who initially failed to deliver any of the 0 items i ordered as xmas_gifts for my 0 kids - then after much chasing delivered three ( which i can '_t use as i need one for each ) - but is now not responding to emails or answering phone_calls about the missing two - i have called repeatedly every day for 00 days .
neutral	i would return for another holiday .
neutral	no call came , despite my waiting in , so i went elsewhere for my new printer - a lost opportunity for the company .
positive	the accommodation was actually quite good , much_better_than i expected .
negative	the gm wanted to speak to me which we did the next_day .
positive	very good customer_service :)
neutral	again this was a while back but i still won ' t buy anything online from them .
negative	they are very inconsistent .
negative	i signed_up for a recent deal at e0save for a t - mobile full monty sim - only deal .
positive	!
negative	they have consistently overcharged me line_rental and despite numerous attempt to get them to rectify the situation they have simply ignored me .
positive	ordered a ergo - tek mesh manager chair lunchtime yesterday .
neutral	products good quality but service let_down by not taking ownership of the mistakes made .
negative	!
negative	i ordered 00 red_roses to be delivered on valentines_day .
neutral	i know it seems silly to be bothered by such a small item and at first i thought the same , but by the time i had suffered through their customer_services , i was quite irate !
neutral	obviously written by someone in an office who just thinks the colour is the most_important feature .
positive	we chose appliances_online because for value but also because they delivered free on a sunday .
negative	absolutely_useless .
negative	i find it unbelievable that a business can operate in this manner , let_alone be successful !
negative	i am very disappointed in plumbworld and their delivery partner yodel - if it works , then great .
neutral	the staff no customer friendly .
negative	called again , and was told it was all sorted .
neutral	i noticed it immediately after i sent it and quickly emailed them to tell them of my mistake .
neutral	it '_s never happened before in the 00 years i '_ve lived here so it was carelessness on the driver '_s behalf .
neutral	we ordered
positive	parcel0go '_s service is quick efficient and i particularly like the ability to have a live_chat when i have a non standard requirement .
negative	!
neutral	shower curtains can be replaced for an extremely low_cost , and the fact that they had not been replaced for the season just goes to show how little you think of the comfort of your clients .
positive	i will_definitely you them again .
positive	paignton , devon
neutral	well , i know it is nearly christmas but i placed an order on 00th_dec . it was not dispatched until 00rd .
negative	all i really wanted to know was how to fill the form in as i have window office and it wouldn_'_t fill it in .
positive	i am very pleased and impressed with the topper and the service .
positive	receieved within two days of order .
positive	happy with the transaction .
negative	unfortunately they are unable to deliver the missing goods so would we accept a refund bearing in mind we paid for delivery for all the goods in question .
positive	never bought flowers to deliver online before and even as a novice i managed to find what i wanted and add / change bits to suit .
negative	one week on , the problem has not been solved .
positive	a delighted customer :)
positive	all their hostel i used to visit are great ( good rating standard )
negative	i ' d had my conformation email
neutral	crap .
neutral	at 00 . 00 on the due date a courier arrived .
negative	they have about 0 websites all delivering in 0 - 0 weeks and only half the products0 the owners not a nice bloke and has threatened many customers !
negative	despite the fact that , under the data_protection act , they ' re legally obligated to remove my details if i request it , they felt out refused .
negative	it seems to me a ridiculous way to run a company , cancelling genuine pre_- orders from interested customers just because they won ' t pay for the goods potentially a year in_advance .
neutral	i also personally believe they are restricting access to the extremely low rates they were offering me on this card compared to modern day rates , and this may have happened to many , many others too .
negative	so never received it .
negative	we then went through a early_termination review , lol !!
neutral	jeg_har i alt bestil 0 par sko fra nelly , alle i str .
negative	having paid one month in_advance and being on a one month deal i don ' t owe them anything .
neutral	the topper itself seems to be good quality ( although it hasn_'_t been slept on yet ), and although the service was slower_than promised , i am now happy with my purchase .
negative	0nd agent was more helpful , he apologises for the mix_up , and offers to refund the money .
negative	my advice is to read_reviews carefully before_deciding what and who to buy from .
negative	i called the courier straight_away and told them i ' ve been in all day and missed a days work , so it would of been impossible for me to of missed them .
positive	brilliant service
negative	this changed when i was overcharged by a third_party using direct_debit .
negative	the " convenient " time could only be scheduled between 0 :_00am - 0pm monday - friday and would last 00 - 00_minutes - hardly convenient when you work full time in the sort of job that has set times ( ie lunch break !).
positive	fine as usual , they didn_'_t have my tyre in stock so allowed us a free upgrade and fitted them the next_day .
positive	to cut as long_story short i bought a steelseries keyboard that had faulty keys , they offered to send some new ones in the post that never turned_up !
neutral	i enjoy shopping the large selections and the insane discounts i just cant seem to get my head around the fraud purchases me and my friends have received so this is only to be aware of the possibility of it happening to all the customers out there .
negative	talk_talk tried to charge me for the four months beyond my last usage of their service and in the end i have paid two of the four months having had threats of sending debt_collectors to my home .
negative	and he asked me reason_why i want to cancel i said i already gave you reason in email he said yeh but we need your reason again .
negative	pc wold is sucks
negative	i new look wont even refund us delivery charge as we are supposedly the ones at fault .
positive	would definetly deal with this company again .
negative	i have not received any notice that a collection was attempted and for most of the day my house lights have been on so even if a courier did come , they would have clearly seen that someone was in .
negative	what a total load of b *** ocks !!
neutral	we use aldi quite a lot for generally a good standard of products at a fair price , but get annoyed when basic products just disappear for a few_weeks ( or longer ), sometimes being replaced by an inferior recipe .
positive	i ' m better at consuming reviews than writing reviews , but having found the reviews on trustpilot so positive that i bought an expensive camera from a company in hk , i wanted to backup everyone ' s comments that digitalrev are awesome .
neutral	i phoned twice in the morning yesterday , no one answered both_times .
neutral	unfortunately , the faqs on their site did not match up with my experience .
negative	i recived an_email eventually from some girl called karleen same as others . seems like they only have one customer service rep .
neutral	why is the settle figure different from the z ( end of day ) figure ?
positive	my son andrew knows quite a bit about computers , unlike my self , and when i told him i wished to buy a good laptop for his mother '_s 00th_birthday he also recommended pc_specialist .
negative	i wouldnt recommend the site to anyone .
positive	the site is easy to use , the prices are better_than any other site i ' ve gone_through , and their customer_service is the best i ' ve dealt_with .
positive	will certainly be making use of cjs_cd_keys again , it ' s a piece of cake to order and get your key and the prices are a bargain .
negative	they replied to my first email and said the order had been dispatched and was probably delayed .
neutral	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
negative	i had a few games pre_- ordered with gameseek in the build up to the launch of xbox one , most of which i had also pre_- paid for as is gameseek ' s way of doing things .
positive	so do not_hesitate order now !!
negative	the customer service is non - existent and the contempt is par excellence .
neutral	luckily items were ok .
neutral	ridiculous waste , and i paid for it too with high p_+_p charges .
neutral	the room was very clean but the general areas were shabby .
neutral	eventually got through by phone , told not despatched as awaiting final parts - why then email me saying it was with a tracking no ?
neutral	why can '_t they take it off the price i have already paid for my tyres ?
negative	straight_away i notice that some of the shopping was missing .
positive	great price .
negative	visa dispute will has been opened !
negative	ordered a pair of tyres for a land_rover .
neutral	on 0 december i send a query as goods not received .
negative	also no refund when you are not happy with the products and send them back .
negative	actually turned_up at the house without the washing_machine !
neutral	i finally received my item but after a lot of correspondence back and forth .
neutral	great selection of gear and at a good price , annoyingly i ' ve experienced issues when trying ( and paying ) for next_day service , they havent sent the goods out and havent let me know why until i have hassled them .
positive	it arrived well_packaged and the order was 000_% correct .
neutral	i have bought items from this site and the quality , fit and availablity leave a lot to be desired .
negative	!
negative	no flowers received despite the fact they claim it was delivered .
positive	for what you pay you get the world !
neutral	other times this didn ' t work and we had to wait it out to retrieve connection again .
neutral	i hope budgetair is going to do something about this unacceptable issue very quickly , this is not my money i have lost , but it is even worse !
neutral	you will never pay the advertised price .
positive	the way to check is by checking if the item offers the ' amazon free super_saver delivery ' option .
neutral	in the past you could rely_on argos to have everything in stock .
neutral	unfortunately , due to the experience i have had , i won ' t be retracting my original review as i think people should still be aware of the potential issues they can come_across when dealing_with regus .
positive	however , i believe that as a newcomer to the game there are some differences that separate me from those who have been in this arena for a long time .
negative	i bought a e_- cig manual battery for leicester granby st ecigwizard shop , the price was slightly_higher_than the online price , but that was least of my worries .
negative	i contact their customer care to find out , and they totally ignored me .
negative	i am_currently searching for another company to join .
neutral	haven ' t had any trouble with transtools over several orders .
negative	as i was getting free dress , as it was added it to my order , i decided to buy other clothes .
negative	do not use o0 as your network !
positive	good service
neutral	i got lost driving around lisbon and the fuel gauge went to zero .
neutral	i also suspect they are not mains operated as_described , but won_'_t know until i open .
neutral	update .
positive	kept up to date right throughout the process from purchase to delivery and on top of that they gave us an upgrade to our seats for the one direction concert at no extra_cost !
positive	this review will come_across a little_bit fan boyish , but i really love this website .
negative	why ?
negative	as it was not his decision he said he would get back to me .
negative	after waiting 00 weeks not for the refund , and after emailing them for the 00th time to find out what is going on , i just received an_email_saying they are only refunding a quarter of what they quoted .
positive	ordered a pair of puma evospeed 0 right before the weekend and received it on the following thursday .
negative	stems were snapped , a few of the flowers looked as if they were dying already and the arrangement was poor .
neutral	i assumed that the booking email has not been sent and started to look for other options on the website .
negative	on the day of the appointment i was 00_minutes late due to an accident on the motorway .
neutral	then then told me a 0 - 0 week wait i had no choice but to upgrade and pay the extra .
neutral	if they had said on their web_site that delivery would take 00 - 00 days then i would still have ordered from them and would have been happy to give them 0_stars .
negative	the instructions said i could pack everything in one box and i was sent one label in the email .
positive	when the crank pulley turned_out to have been incorrectly manufactured ( not wanapart ' s fault ) they couldn ' t have been more helpful , sourcing a replacement from an_alternative supplier in germany which would have been on my doorstep within 00_hours of my informing them of the issue but for the courier mis_- delivering the item .
positive	many_thanks .
positive	0 .
negative	this is the last time i buy from laredoute france !
negative	she then posted a picture on facebook for me and all our relatives to see .
neutral	the agent informed me that she works on a live system and prices can change .
negative	they didn ' t manufacture it , but i phoned them up to arrange a return and replacement .
negative	i decided enough was enough and wrote to the md mr_simon betts of proridermobility as this was a complete nonsense and i did not take kindly to the bullying tactics of this md simon betts .
negative	that was on 00th_april .
neutral	good for buying if you know your prices .
negative	the delivery date arrived ( day before mother '_s day ).
positive	well_done green and easy .
neutral	and it arrived in time for christmas .
neutral	have noticed that veg are expensive compared to local green grocers
neutral	update_: 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00
neutral	very happy that i was let_down in time so that i could purchase the gas from elsewhere .
positive	i received emails saying all were delivered when in fact only 0 lots where and the other arrived on the sunday .
positive	an added perk was that there were no booking_fees , so you would only be paying exactly the amount you saw quoted on the website and not a penny more .
negative	since then i '_ve contacted a local domestic appliance repair man who came round to assess the dishwasher on a saturday and will be able to do the repair on a tuesday_evening when he '_s received the part .
neutral	was put on hold for 0 minutes .
positive	changed sterling to dollars with excellent rate , company was best rate advertised at time .
positive	great place to easily compare prices and reviews , payments very easy
positive	i have to admit , the reason i purchased from this company is that i had money in my paypal account ( from selling on ebay ) and it takes 0 days to transfer money into your bank_account , so i was looking around various speaker sites and found that audiovisual online accepted paypal ( surprisingly the only speaker company i found that does ).
negative	no shower delivered .
neutral	hastily rectified though when i rang the customer_services team and it was delivered next_day !
negative	don_'_t bother with this company .
negative	i am about to issue a summons to the small_claims court .
positive	i have now used shima_uma on two occasions and both times have found them to be cheapest on price , good at communication and fast on delivery .
negative	i phoned boots customer care , to complain and felt_like i was being fobbed_off , a report would be made nothing more .
neutral	right , now onto the not so good part of the review !
neutral	the inside of cupboards , wardrobes and drawers all had the horrid smell , so had to be left open for days .
neutral	0 weeks and 0 follow_up calls later , and i ' m still unable to make online payments ( the form said it would take 0 - 0 working_days ).
positive	will use again soon .
negative	i would have been happy with a 000_% clean smartphone loan phone but this was refused .
neutral	i ' ve taken_advantage of a couple of them .
positive	watch shop have great products and i have never experienced any_problems with them .
neutral	users of the site need to be aware that ford dealers are all fishing in the same pool and may offer a vehicle which they simply hope to be able to obtain for you at some point in the future .
neutral	well_done jk and interlink_express .
negative	therefore we have the case for the computer but no parts to put in it and had arranged for someone to come this evening to put it together .
positive	fast deliveies and a even better after care service .
positive	so now i need a refund for £_00 to me that '_s a lot of money i am waiting for .
negative	other_retailers have not ever done this and surely buying a phone off cpw must be a negative / counter - productive task .
negative	i have been with them for 0 months .
neutral	not a month went by without a fault or problem , incredibly_frustrating .
neutral	there are better online japanese food stores out there .
positive	decided to try them for delivering an item to customer ; my delivery reach my customer within 0 days .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in recommending viovet .
neutral	oops starting to sound like gilt trip again .
neutral	i would expect much faster delivery for ordering online .
positive	best exchange_rates , best buy back rates and best service all_round .
neutral	i have placed an order and this has_been acknowledged by an_email_saying the the table is expected to be available from 00th_may and that i will be contacted shortly thereafter about delivery / collection .
negative	i was told yesterday that it '_s vodafone '_s fault as they share a network .
neutral	i had to return the sunglassses pair after 0 months due to the outer surface coming off away from the lens , and glasses_direct brilliantly honoured their guarantee for these glasses and they were duly returned for repair .
neutral	is it any wonder that this country is going down the pan ?
positive	i ordered an outdoor table_tennis table ( cornilleau sport one ) for urgent delivery - ordering_process very quick and smooth - it arrived at the stated time on the stated day with no_problems at all .
negative	emails just seem to go into a black_hole and get ignored .
neutral	i am fairly skilled being a shop fitter , but anyone with minimal skills would struggle .
negative	and again same email to the exact word .
positive	- £_00 delivery felt like a lot . but the product was reasonable so we swallowed it and went_ahead .
negative	i wish i had gone to john_lewis who all actually stock the same washing but £_00 cheaper !
negative	i haven ' t done my job but the boxes are ticked .
neutral	the handedness of the curved leg supports was not evident in the instruction .
positive	bestilte nogle vare på deres hjemmeside , men da de ikke kunne levere nogle af varene fik_jeg oven i købet yderlige 00_% rabat på mit køb .
positive	highly_recommend .
negative	however i chose to have smart_meters installed .
neutral	occasionally they would manage to reset the line ?
positive	ordered my playstation 0 a few week before official launch in uk , got mine on the release day and didn ' t have to wait a month to get one , had no issues with contacting them when i needed help , they always contacted me and got to the point , no excuses that were given to me , they just replied very fast and was very happy with my order !
neutral	recently however i have found their pricing much less competitive , so much so i am beginning to question if my membership is value for money .
positive	it has very innovative design features , wheel removal , handle bar adjustment and folding mechanism are just one click operations .
neutral	i ' ve recently set_up a standard business account , but despite having another business account and 0 personal accounts already with hsbc , the process was far from smooth .
positive	quite a lot they always deliver promptly even_though i use the super_saver delivery option it always nearly gets to me in 0 days .
negative	it has_been an aggravating experience which is far from over .
neutral	the down sides are quite considerable and have been mentioned by others , namely the packaging needs a lot of improvement ( i ' m sure that will come , given they ' re a new brand ) but more worryingly my nespresso machine ' s pump seems to need to work a lot harder to get the job_done .
positive	had a little_bit of a problem with the website and initially thought it was a website problem but it was actually my mistake .
positive	just received my first order and i am very pleased with the quality of the products .
negative	i just wish i had looked for reviews before ordering !
neutral	otherwise would recommend .
negative	i ended_up ordering a new pair with a partial_refund for the frames and paying the cost of the lenses again .
neutral	this is a design fault and shlould be brought to the front of the blind .
positive	iflorist to the rescue !
neutral	cameras are cheaper in pc_world and argos
neutral	!
neutral	ok casino but like all gamesys sites it can be very unfair !
negative	in the meantime , i still_haven_'_t received a valid return label .
positive	one vacuum_cleaner now back in working order & one extremely happy customer .
positive	perfect meals for one with fast delivery thrown in !
negative	well i wait a bit more to speak to the man in charge only to be told we can only offer a replacement ,, oh and now the same tablet is cheaper and to add_insult to injury you dont get the difference back in what you paid and what we now sell it at ,,,,, so i now have same tablet but for more money plus i know it will be going back cos its rubbish and will break again , so i came home made a complaint to their customer service department on the phone but she was reading from the same script ,,,, lesson to be learned , if your buying from them they cant do enough for you , in - between the yawns and the texting their mates , but if you want to take back a faulty item take a flask and a blanket cos you will be there a while , and dont expect them to adhere to the law cos its not there policy ,,,,,, the end ( well for now anyway )
negative	ordered something , but was delivered ( and addressed ) to wrong_address .
neutral	- left hand l shaped whirlpool shower bath with 0 jets .
positive	where most websites have just your bog_standard range of sunglasses , this site takes it up to a new level , with a massive_range of styles .
positive	can be daunting on new customers , so best to look into any glitches and not get complacent .
negative	i hear the same about the store from friends , family , and just people i know passing me in the street , keighley argos has a terrible reputation , especially regarding its staff .
negative	we have used sky and virgin and from my experiences with both , i would highly_recommend sky over virgin_media any day of the week .
neutral	i understand the co - op has quite_frankly ended_up in the creek .
positive	kloe @ imvu .
positive	the customer service was very friendly , helpful and fast .
neutral	good experience ordering , and communications were good up until delivery .
neutral	at first it was good it gave me an updated amount for phone and i accepted then got an_email_saying payment would be in by end of day and still_waiting 0days on .
neutral	!
positive	although i am sure that people have had troubles and shortcomings with different sites and different companies for whatever_reason , as a first - time buyer i do not have any of these prior ideas that taint my mind .
negative	hurry up and give me my money back !
negative	they still owe me money - but its not worth the hassle trying to get it back
negative	my order id is 0000000 .
positive	ordered a pair of rayban rare prints wayfarer and has the title_says received the next_day !
neutral	ordered twice now for in store collection .
positive	pretty good for the isle of man .
neutral	all this time we had to call 0000 and wait ( company phones ), plus our main frustration was assembling bed_frame for temporary use and taking it out again and again for 0 times .
neutral	as it was , it was several days_later when i finally got my goods , having wasted a whole saturday at home being assured by jessops that the parcel would arrive and having had to ask someone to wait at home the following week rather_than risk the package disappearing into the black whole known as parcelfarce .
positive	never had any_issues with them , very quick delivery and allways accurate
positive	would definitely_use again !
positive	in fact , it was not until having spent_hundreds of hours playing online poker that i felt_comfortable enough to go to a casino on land and sit with other human beings , totally vulnerable to their intimidating looks and talks on the table .
neutral	the last time i use it on the 00 / 00 /_0000 the operator would not tell me how much credit i have after i ' ve topped_up and before it use to remember my password from the phone i use but now it kept asking me to enter it again . thats a bit disappointing and i found it only going down instead of improving the service . i would have understood if it was a one off technical_error but it doesnt seem so . communication does cut_off at some point too . i have noticed as well that during winter time customers get lower credit for the same amount of money use to purchase during summer time .
positive	however , this was down to the post_office either not delivering it or delivering the card to the wrong_address .
positive	pre_- ordered a pc game from them around 0 week prior to release as they had the lowest_price anywhere by a few £.
negative	due to the terrible service i received i asked for the price of the tv to be reduced to the now lower_price being offered online and that i get a full_refund for the delivery cost .
positive	i have used serenata time and time again and thought i would carry on doing so , until this mothers_day when i ordered 0 lots of flowers for delivery on the saturday .
neutral	good website , good prices .
negative	traveljigsaw .
positive	since we are in south_africa , it was not enough time to attend the funeral but we did order flowers online and within the next_day flora_queen delivered them .
neutral	their service is the cheapest door - 0 - door service .
negative	it was a bunch of green with occasional tiny heads of a complete different flowers .
negative	they really dont care and say that the most they can offer will be 00_%_off and really dont care that they are charging me for an item they mis_- sold !
negative	since i had decided to go with diamondsfactory last_minute ( exactly 0 weeks_ago from delivery date ), i was hoping they would get it perfect .
neutral	i ' ve also noticed it with other sections too .
positive	mike came to the rescue again and sorted_out technical problem !
neutral	just as well you have good staff at your call_centre .
negative	my advice , go elsewhere for your mobile needs .
positive	altogether a very friendly and professional service .
negative	and the estimated_delivery was 0 weeks , which is strange considering when i checked again there was 000_+ in stock apparently .
positive	i ' ve made so many great friends on this site .
neutral	very very disappointing , i '_ll buy from a good old_fashioned shop in future .
neutral	wouldn ' t use this company again
positive	they were there waiting to pick_up my car and waiting for me as i got back so nothing to complain_about
neutral	till staff are often straight out of school vicky pollards .
neutral	so i was glad to find bclc , who seemed to be well thought of in reviews and came_across professionally from their website .
positive	the pen i ordered was faulty and they acted promptly and efficiently to sort_out the issue .
neutral	i have two holidays with this company and the first one was a breeze .
neutral	i ordered the " this works " travel set on the 00th_april and chose the uk saver premium delivery and it did not turn_up in time for my holiday on 00nd .
negative	this was my first shopping_experience with this company and will be tha last .
negative	customer_services take up to 0 hours to respond , they have so far fobbed me off with :
positive	thanks :)
positive	when i entered the world of poker for the first time , online play was relatively new for me .
neutral	make it clear !!!
neutral	i booked a speedy shuttle transfer from palma_airport to our apartment in puerta pollensa .
neutral	!
neutral	the only problem i could fault is the cables . they are cheap rubbish that is no good what so ever .
neutral	i am now happy with sportpursuits response to my problems .
neutral	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer_service via his customer_service line .
negative	i repeatedly tried to contact the courier with no luck .
positive	my only issue is having to be around to sign for the package , but otherwise i can find no fault , will be using again , very soon .
positive	great comms .
positive	this is more the brand ' s fault than outdoorgb . com but they could have put more detailed pictures .
negative	before that i was a director of a freight / courier company in london for an equal amount of time .
positive	they seem to care about their customers .
positive	i purchased a sealey stw0000 torque_wrench from ffx , it was a very competitive price and arrived within a couple of days .
negative	i did write to their company support email , because is the only florist company which does not provide a phone line , so if something_goes_wrong , like in my situation , the only you can relay on is their email , they don ' t even care to check , as this morning the only answer to my emails of complain i got was this survey , asking for satisfactory review and five_star rate .
neutral	since changing couriers the delivery has_been a nightmare , i am promised delivery but they just dont turn_up .
positive	its been a great experience .
negative	however they took my email and said i would get a confirmation which diid not happen , so i called the sales_team at carphone_warehouse who asked me for the details and said everything was fine and the phone would be with me on the 00 . 0 . 0000 .
neutral	it was a good quality costume , got delivered really quickly , good service but it didn ' t fit
positive	placed an order friday_morning , by friday_afternoon i got a message_saying that my order had been processed and was being dispatched .
neutral	i ordered a full bathroom for over 0k and am happy with the product and the quality .
negative	their computer is a bit strange .
neutral	i will return the rest of the box , and look_elsewhere for a replacement
positive	bought a newly_released game the deluxe special_edition for over half the price from elsewhere , and i ' m really happy with my purchase .
negative	!
neutral	i rang them to find out if a claim i proposed to make would be valid under the terms of my policy .
positive	deliver what they say
negative	it is a good place however to meet strange smelly locals if your that way inclind .
positive	the prices are great the service is great .
positive	my dog was rescued by these_guys back in july_0000 .
positive	!
negative	i eventually got sent a link to a ticket that had been opened on 00 . 00 . 00 morning and i have asked three_times since then whether the order has_been cancelled as i requested .
neutral	refund for returned sink took a while to appear .
negative	and , trying to speak to someone on the phone . again aha hahahaha , on an 0000 number , they answerd the phone and left me hanging before the call was disconnected .
negative	this time we ordered 0x 00cl x 00 lowenbru original lager total bottles 00
negative	after several phone_calls where they tried to claim that my camera somehow got damaged , and they couldn_'_t say when it would be delivered , i asked for my money back .
positive	i use to detsroy pillows within a couple of months , but this memory_foam pillow has now lasted me over a year and is still as comfortable as the day i purchased it .
negative	i want my money back .
negative	no apology , just another tirade about no - one had phoned him .
negative	as i said in my review , i did exactly_what said in your instructions and i suposed that you paid royal_mail for a special delivery and they should know that is a mobile phone and you already know that i ' ll sent you a expensive mobile phone and now i have instead a brand_new galaxy_s0 a broken galaxy_s0 , thank_you very much .
positive	the quality was reasonable and delivery arrived the next_day after ordering .
neutral	the £_00 voucher is not the way forward .
negative	there was no attempted delivery that die .
positive	i had a problem with a driver for one of the adapters , this was also sorted very quickly and efficiently .
neutral	the hotel wanted olotels to formally request the change in an_email , and they would agree to it .
positive	very fast reply to a query .
neutral	i understood that the two items were coming from different companies so would not necessarily arrive together .
neutral	perhaps the lessons learned will improve the service .
positive	it literally took 00_hours to send my ipad and get paid for it .
negative	i ordered the large bouquet as i had already succumbed to a discount_code i found online therefore figured that i would use that discount to be able to get my mum the best flowers for mothers_day .
negative	i don ' t have a printer in my house so it means i ' m going to have to travel to the closest library to use one which isn ' t open till tuseday when my funeral is .
positive	keep up the good work !
neutral	prior to this new charge , i would have given them 0_stars , in large part because it gives the flexibility to order things when you think of it , instead of waiting to build up sufficient order size .
negative	gain and again i emailed no reply , tried going via their website , no reply .
neutral	reasons for poor communications given as hectic holiday season buying - not really acceptable but good on them for making contact .
negative	i therefore went out in the morning and came back just before 00 : 00 to find the shed part stacked in the drive .
positive	this is my favorite company to use for buying hair and salon equipment .
positive	all in all i would class their service and stock availabillity as excellent and give them a score of 0 out of 00 and have no_hesitation in recommending them to everyone .
neutral	carrier assumed he was at the right house , actually he was trying to deliver to an unoccupied house and kept leaving cards there .
neutral	i would start by saying that the company has been going for many years , is an ' industry standard ' key competitor and despite what i will write in this review i would definitely use them again and again .
positive	now that '_s what i call a service .
neutral	i have now got to drive all the way into_town to find a jeweller who can either make it bigger or supply me with one that fits .
positive	the product was well_packaged and works_perfectly .
neutral	i bought a mobile case and received a case the next_day ( very good ).
negative	in order to get it to move again , i had to get off it and drag it back ( which my father on his own would not manage ) onto level ground and drive 00 yards back to his garage and park it up .
negative	after that i had to chase all the time and because i chose not to cancel my order ( i wanted the items ) they just said more would come but gave no time frame .
positive	its says how many places are left so you know how long you can wait or think about it .
negative	when we were finally allowed to sit_down in one of the darkened corners of the restaurant , the staff_member took his sweet time in finding menus for us , which actually was just the beginning of this painfully_slow service .
negative	i immediately contacted shedstore who emailed me the instructions and asked for a photpograph of the damaged felt .
negative	i will change the rating if / when i get the products i ordered .
neutral	kvaliteten af routeren er elendig .
positive	visited 0 shops looking for a certain lamp with no one having the right one in stock .
negative	i couldn ' t be bothered to complain , having worked a mean shift earlier and not in the mood for confrontation .
positive	i would definitely_use these again .
neutral	just a 0 tier system , say under 000g or over ?
positive	i have got so many of my friends and family changing their everyday products which contain so many unrecognizable chemical ingredients in them to lush products .
negative	i have finally managed to get them to agree that a manager chloe will call me tomorrow but i need to get this parcel collected by someone who is capable of ringing a doorbell .
negative	and this is an extra don_’ t forget on top of the car_hire cost which was inclusive of insurance .
negative	i asked why was this ?
neutral	it now works , but one of the reasons i bought it was for the ability of continuous use but we did not get the hose connection , was this included in the price or do we need to buy separately ?
positive	so on tuesday when i haven ' t heard_anything back i emailed them .
negative	i purchased these glasses on the 00th_feb and guess_what .
positive	perfect all_round !
neutral	0 .
negative	my colleague already apologized ."
positive	fast delivery , excellent buying process .
neutral	however , if this company wishes to achieve as they themselves say , ' 000_% customer_satisfaction ' they need to be far more open and honest about who they are , where they are , and exactly_what the product they are selling is .
positive	well_done , fastlec .
neutral	back in the old days they were throwing cheque books at me , and giving an unnecessarily high credit_limit .
positive	item received well in time .
negative	i placed an order 0 or 0 of days ago , i get my voucher_code through , to find that the code does not work and is not for the product listed on the website .
positive	!
negative	i placed an order customer number 0000000000 order delivery enquiry 000000000 and i received a confirmation for my order but did not receive my items and my order disappeared from the site !
neutral	i have always found that lidl have been good for people that like to shop for food & a few extra bits here & there on a budget there selection of meat it quite good ( in packets ofc ) and being a single guy with not that much time on his hands that suits be just fine .
negative	wrote back and told customer service and demanding a full_refund as non - delivery is breech of contract .
positive	delivery information was excellent .
positive	excellent value and service .
positive	i had a 0st time perfect buying experience with this company .
neutral	i will probably use the website again .
neutral	i only went with envirofone because i had read they pay you the same day as soon as the phone has been checked over .
neutral	deres størrelser i både sko og tøj er_ikke til at stole på .
negative	do not use them you will be disappointed and out of pocket !!!!!!!!!!!!
positive	really good service .
neutral	great place for a stag night !
neutral	ordered mugs on 0rd no mugs by the 0th .
positive	i will_definitely use your services again .
negative	i ordered them last sunday and still havnt received them , we even put a clearer sign out side our house to exclude that , we couldnt find you excuse because we saw you drive past our house !
neutral	unfortunately late but that was prob down to my local postie not knowing when valentines_day was
neutral	i spoke to a customer service person and they didnt seem to know what they were talking_about .
neutral	in general the company are fast and cheap but dont always follow delivery instructions .
negative	they do not allow you to take cash out at the counter unless it is over £_00 .
positive	ordered late sunday_evening delivered monday am
positive	it arrived right on time
positive	bought an extra hard_disk drive for our main computer at home ( western digital 0tb hard_disk drive ).
neutral	je m ' estimerai satisfaite quand notre demande d ' annulation sera bien prise en compte + quand nous serons remboursés de_la somme prélevée .
neutral	but expensive - not value for money really
negative	my experience is exactly the same as everyone elses , i ordered from them , few weeks_later order is still ' pending ' and have had no replys from my numerous attemps of contacting them .
positive	will_certainly use this company again whenever we need new white goods .
negative	this time i made the poor delivery guy check what was missing ie 0 items not a happy_bunny what is it with asda they can '_t get any delivery right .
neutral	this was only based on a simple mot .
positive	everyone concerned with the procedure were so wonderfully helpful and understood all my worries by explains every_step of the way .
neutral	delivery was quick and well_packaged although we are missing the ' thank_you ' cards that should have arrived free with the order ( we received the envelopes just not the cards ).
negative	we were charged 000_euros for fuel we did not want or need .
positive	i would not_hesitate to recommend others to use this company .
neutral	and loaded_onto perth van . why is it so hard to get it to dundee ?
negative	to top the whole ordeal off they tryed to deliver the washing_machine on thursday but forgot to put it on the delivery van !
positive	i love this site its very useful and has helped_me save money
neutral	i ' m left now without carpet in the bedroom or en - suite but do have it working !!!!!
positive	couldn_'_t believe my luck , whilst other cycling shops were only doing deals on older stock , finally someone pandering to my needs .
neutral	received everything thing but one item , which i had to email several_times to get a reply for .
positive	searched for fairtrade flowers and came on arena_flowers .
negative	with the finest quality sunflowers , yellow_roses and a selection of complimenting blooms , this pretty arrangement is finished with an edging of funky green foliage .
negative	after going to hell and back , called the cancellation department . 00_minutes with a broked connection . oh let me direct you to the faults department .
positive	everyone i spoke to was very friendly and will use them again .
neutral	habituellement la réponse du service client est immédiate , mais là , au bout de plus d ' une semaine et 0 emails , aucune nouvelle .
positive	i needed a pair of prescription_sunglasses in a hurry .
neutral	i ' ve written emails to them , but no reply !
negative	i have been personally assured that my credit will be transferred and that he will make_sure it happens . in 0 to 00_hours !
negative	we both feel extremely let_down by this awful experience with proridermobility .
negative	monday and i have finally received the missing goods .
positive	you pay with paypal so you know your money is safe .
negative	i am about to make a complaint to paypal .
neutral	this price was not including the £_00 cost of sand and cement that i had to provide .
neutral	delivery was great however , flowers received could have been a better arrangement considering it was a small gift bag - disappointed !
neutral	the crossing was very good would like to see them start there sailing a little earlier each day , the food on board was very good hot and fresh if i have one complaint is we arrived at the port for our 0 . 00 sailing but due to the boarder agency only have one lane open we were late getting to the berth but the ship was still in but were not allowed to board so we had to wait_till 0 . 00 for the next one .
neutral	now , let me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
negative	it is imperative that anyone who is considering using this company reads the small_print in detail , you will for example have further reductions on your original_quote by £_00 if your phone is network locked and in theory your " used " phone should be in a brand_new condition in order to recieve the quoted payment .
negative	we did have problems as ideally you need to return the item , however 0 boxes weighing over 000kg and no return address makes things very difficult .
negative	the performance was appalling not able to go up the smallest of gradients .
neutral	ballicom offered the best price but the worst returns_policy i have ever_encountered .
neutral	except this everything was fine but is not a good attitude for a big company !
negative	my experience with the company was good a few_years_ago and my order came quickly .
negative	during this entire time , they were still accepting orders on the watch i ordered which is what i find most disturbing .
negative	no explanation .
neutral	the in - flight staff were extremely pleasant and more than helpful .
positive	excellent communication from couriers and all items delivered on time and in perfect_condition .
negative	when i phoned up to query it i was read the terms and conditions by 0 different customer service officers and told to write to head_office , but they will say the same thing - so they had effectively stolen my money and stuck two fingers up at me .
neutral	site said the retaillers wouldn_'_t agree to me getting the cash transferred into my bank_account ( after giving my full bank details !)
positive	the furniture arrived today exactly as promised and before your estimated date . it exceeded my expectations both in value and quality .
negative	took about 0 months however have now received a full_refund and will now take a trip down the scrapyard to dispose of scrap that was left at my house .
neutral	normally the delivery side is speedy , but this time boiler_juice choose a different supply , they texted me a date , this day came and went . no oil . in fact they delivered late pm two days_later than their text ,[ edit . i note that another has moaned about this supplier - bj take_note ] but cant moan as its within the 00 days but just as well i didn_'_t take time off for the oil man to come !
neutral	a great idea , however , every time i visit this site i never manage to find a hotel or holiday that is any cheaper_than usual ?
positive	the flowers helped bring joy and comfort to our family .
neutral	however quality is great and items are reasonably prices .
neutral	received email with tracking_number stating goods had been despatched .
positive	thank_you !
neutral	knowing nobody would be home to receive the package during the working week i opted for a so - called guaranteed saturday_morning delivery and paid the extra fee .
positive	very helpful staff , could not recommend them any more highly
negative	dont use them if you can help it .
positive	hostelbookers had always led me to really cool hostels and the description was always accurate .
neutral	sometimes it feels_like these folks aren ' t even interested in making a sale .

positive	value for money .
negative	so my order couldn ' t be cancelled .
positive	they do seem to have stock issues , but that aside , i ' m just waiting now for another lens to come in stock so i can order again !
negative	i would suggest anyone purchasing anything from primark keeps their receipt very safe , although i personally won_'_t be shopping there again .
positive	friendly site very easy to use .
negative	i have always purchased from dfs never had an issue and customer service excellent unlike this company .
positive	i ' m very happy with cult_pens .
neutral	easy online , stock arrives in store on time , but the service received in the poole store has really put me off .
neutral	never had any complaints with letter deliveries nor parcel deliveries before .
positive	will_definitely_use this site again
negative	when i challenged the definition of the word , ' recently ', and they said anything up to 0 months .
neutral	since timeline post people have moved over to twitter .
positive	just a good business .
neutral	plus each time i have to reset my privacy settings , they should just stay the same .
positive	we were kept up to date with the status of the order and given a delivery date .
negative	when applying , there is no clear warning such as ,” you will receive a message on your xxxcard statement when your direct_debit has_been set_up .
neutral	flowers look good , but was expecting more having paid extra for the ' deluxe ' version of the bouquet .
positive	i looked up on google the best hostel near the full moon party and it came up with hostelbookers first .
negative	expedia owe me a refund on an airport transfer that didn ' t show up .

neutral	i ' ve bought winter_tyres from their website .
neutral	although the networks can be far from acceptable , i have had many wasted calls whereby repeat calls have been necessary to achieve a decent conversation .
negative	i ' d been sending apologetic e_- mails to my customers all week , keeping them informed of events , and fortunately they were ok about it .
positive	would strongly_recommend
negative	this is the second time i have had awful service and i will not be returning .
neutral	my order was sent to milton_keynes rang them up i had to post there order to them and they sent mine to me , not what you want 0 days b0 xmas , thankfully we were honest poeple , not what you pay for ,
negative	the website feels old and clunky for starters .
positive	regards ,
neutral	you might as well be reading a piece written by the lead developer of a game in some_cases .
positive	not sure which as we were away for 0 days !
neutral	well i placed the order , a timeslot of 0 - 0 days for delivery " great !"
negative	the price was marginally better_than theyir competitor .
negative	can i also add this is not the first issue with yodel and i ' m_sure it wont be the last unless they start listening to what their customers want .
negative	a few_days went by and i called again , and was told a few more weeks .
positive	every time i ' ve sent in an_email i ' ve always got a response by the next_day , often just a few hours_later on the same day .

neutral	when i emailed transtools , they responded quickly .
negative	staff tell me that are in contact with driver , he is aware that its to be with me that day asap to hit 0pm deadline ( for a secret santa ).
neutral	i have contacted you twice now urging that you really need to get stock of the item , sorry gameseek if it fails to deliver i will never recommend you because seeing a child upset isn ' t good !
positive	good quality and fantastic service would recommend this company to anybody . well_done !
neutral	i am happy with their phone system they know who the customer is by caller id .
negative	we had previously had appliance cover with british_gas but when they increased our premiums by about 00_% despite us not having made any claims we shopped_around and settled for the silver package from the warranty shop .
neutral	bt should learn that customers don_'_t want to wait hours trying to speak to someone in india !
neutral	we paid and sat down .
positive	this is a good site for anyone who has a wheat / gluten intolerance ( my son ) enabling him to make and enjoy bread and cake again .
positive	i have also found them to be the cheapest place to buy some brands and items
negative	their 0 - midnight uk number does ' t work at 00 : 00 neither does their french one .
positive	would definitely recommend optical_express for this operation .
positive	when i contacted peak_nutrition , they were quick to respond , polite and extremely_helpful .
positive	won a small gift from gameseek and they promised to get it in the post quickly , as soon as i had i given my address , i received my prize by return post .

positive	competitive_prices and free delivery a big bonus .
neutral	the paperwork says twenty_minutes , ha_ha !, no chance !
neutral	cabins good .
neutral	poundland is cheap because everything is 0 pound but the reason i only put it three star is because of the quality of the products isnt that good but they have alot of things in store and good if you just need something quickly and dont have enough money
positive	i like this web_site , because it can offer very good rooms for optimal price .
negative	i will_continue .
neutral	good review i ' m_sure i will .

negative	they made no effort in updating me whatsoever , i tried to ring them many_times , emailed them , every time they just respond to me with a generic answer .
neutral	( a good job my wife was at home , though only by chance ).
negative	when it did eventually arrive the machine constantly rebooted with a " error 0000 no os ( operating_system )".
neutral	when he hadn_'_t arrived by 0 : 00 pm i called back to customer_services and after a short wait was told that the appointment would have to be arranged for another day because " the technician had called and could not get a response " and the customer support person stated " i called you at 0 : 00 and you did not answer ".
positive	a 00 percent rating on safety is fine if you ' re a 0 ' 0 muscular man , but 00 is perfect when you ' re 0 ' 0 can ' t do a push up without hurting my wrist me .
negative	having had a bad_experience with another online company pretending to be a uk organisation , i re - ordered a camera through valuebasket . com , again not realising they are based overseas and pretend to be a uk company with phone numbers etc .
negative	well , thank_god it all came to an end and as i left , i muttered " i can ' t wait to get out of here " to one of the tables as we were leaving .
negative	so now even if i did decide to use the tickets i wouldnt be able to make the show at 00 : 00 because i dont finish work until then .
negative	on thursday ( they say they respond within 0 days . hahahahahahahaha ) they replied to offer me a £ 0 voucher towards more flowers .
negative	the manufacturers price was on the container at £_00 . 00 .
positive	i also bought some solar_lights for my garden .
positive	others failed but they were right in unlocking , besides others charge around $_00 for the unlock and factory_unlock only 00 pounds .
positive	but it did fit after a little fiddling and was very snug .
negative	they just run you round on circles , contact your local_depot , local my foot it '_s 00miles away , used to be round the corner , but seems thanks to the profiteering they closed it .
neutral	so if your ordering a game that you may eventually trade in then just realise that some places will not take non uk titles .
negative	on tuesday .
neutral	i will most_likely still order from here again , even with the trouble , because they have the best prices .
positive	although the shipping can be expensive it usually still comes out cheaper_than most competitors .

negative	i have contacted the customer_service and they have asked me to send a note along with ring .
neutral	a clue .
neutral	it wasn ' t as i have cctv and nobody came to my house or entered the cul - de - sac .
neutral	just don ' t break that seal !
positive	excellent - great products and superfast delivery - highly_recommend
positive	i ' ve been buying from aria as an individual for several years now and i have never had a problem , either with aria or their couriers ( citylink ).
neutral	case in point : i needed to fill out a form to enable payments through online_banking , which i dutifully filled out and dropped_off at my branch .
neutral	next_day delivery as requested and paid for of tub chair and bar_stools did not happen .
negative	i wasted time , money and energy with this site for a pair of boots that cost over £_000 .
neutral	this company is a waste of space , they leave calling_cards but dont knock on the door or ring the bell , trying to call someone is not going to happen , its all automated and has limited options , i emailed them asking that they call my mobile to make_sure i dont miss the item again , they responded with ' its not our drivers job to call you , make_sure you are home '.
neutral	this is supposed to be impartial but as most things , it seems geared towards leaving good reviews rather_than honest ones .
negative	brush sheds , feels dry on my face , not buildable either .
neutral	i have found better discounts on other_sites .
positive	love the site , prefer it now to shopping on the high_street .
neutral	as they were varifocals , i put this down to the fact that you really do need to go to a high_street optician , to get an accurate fitting .
neutral	also lots of items supposedly in stock only to then be told after order accepted not available any more .
positive	shopped with go - electrical following a good product from which giving a selection of online suppliers .
positive	just waiting for more flavours . i never thought gluten_free dinners where so yummy , wow .
positive	i was very happy with the price for what i was getting which is the main_reason i bought it .
negative	the night before her flight back to the uk , she fell ill and was unable to fly .
negative	however then to ignore their own customers complaint is unforgivable .
negative	first lie from the driver .
positive	i will use him for future quotes , failing which i will again use shiply . unless its a small package .
positive	decent price as well .
negative	as in the uk we always tell everyone about the bad_experiences , this one will be told for a very long time !!!!
neutral	im not the only one to think this .
positive	i would definately recommend them and will be ordering from petmeds again ( after looking around and comparing_prices of course )
neutral	i was a bit confused and questioned it .
neutral	they can '_t tell me when because apparently their system isn_'_t showing august dates yet !
positive	the washer i wanted but cheaper_than everyone_else , delivery and removal of the old machine could not have been better , kept_informed at all times of delivery time which was at 00 : 00 on sunday morning , this included confirmation_email at 0am and an_automated phone_call just in case you miss the email .
neutral	we arrived on the 00th_july but the queues were much longer the following saturday when we dropped the car off .
negative	i would have collectd in my town ( northampton ) but to save cash they are located in rushden so nowhere_near the main population of the county .
neutral	found celebrity cruises much_better value for money and nicer shp
neutral	and " your delivery '_s going to be at this time in the morning ", so i was sat there ready in wait , but this driver decided it wasn_'_t worth their time either .
neutral	in the past things have arrived damaged but have always been replaced without_question .
neutral	they are going to make thousands redundant .
negative	the update lost me 0 and 0 / 0 days , as they have no engineer support at the weekend - losses into thousands .
negative	i thought never mind i ' ll cancel the order then re - order the correct items .
neutral	resort_hopper is a decent enough company but you ' re wasting your money if you go for anything other than the basic serice .
positive	i was also kept up to date as to when my item was dispatched and when it would arrive .
positive	delivery time is good or ok .
neutral	this event did spoil our holiday .
neutral	said i had a discount_code .
neutral	today ( 00 december , i sent an e_- mail requiring status or i would contact my card company to cancel - i get as a response the identical e_- mail to that received on 00 november .
negative	i contacted customer_services again & this time my order was sent out but i had an e_- mail saying i had set_up a credit account when i hadn_'_t but this is ok if i get my order at the original price charged ie £ 0 not full price without the discount accepted on my original order !
positive	i will always prefer to buy online due to the efficiency , fast delivery and cheerful drivers who maintain this no matter how busy as stressful their jobs must be .
negative	a week before_christmas i contacted specialised covers and never got a reply by mail or telephone_call .
positive	i always get good value for money and free delivery from pet_supermarket , its great .
neutral	good idea and easy to use website .
neutral	got a call back from a manager on the day we ad a chat about what went wrong and the company then shipped my order for next_day delivery which did arrive on time thankfully hopefully the incident i referred to in the paragraph above is a blip and a one off incident as the company appear to have fixed their customer_service . issues
neutral	read the other review and therefore made up my mind to go with company formations 000 instead of the one my friend_recommended me .
positive	excellent selection of sweets at a very competitive price .
negative	however , if you also want a hassle and stress_free claims process ( not an unreasonable request in my opinion ), then i would avoid the warranty shop at all costs
negative	however now he has stopped driving a car , he asked me to source a small 0 mph scooter suitable for taking onto a bus .
negative	update - i received my ring today , 00th_april_0000 .
negative	well today was the day the items should have been collected .
negative	i made the first payment to tt on the 00th_december .
neutral	best to shop
neutral	but putting the code upside_down ?
neutral	giving people a chance to win what can be a huge expenditure for some people
negative	i cancelled my order and requested a refund which apparently takes 0 days !
positive	the delivery was fast , the items good quality , and website / transaction smooth and simple !
negative	the buttons on the jacket i bought also falls off easily , and i ' ve had to sow them back into place !
negative	in short , i really cannot recommend fitness first to anyone and would advise people to not even bother enquiring_about joining .
positive	brought this easy leader for my dog .
positive	at this price , even if it did not , it would not have been too bad .
negative	yes they are cheap , but you get what you pay for !
positive	i now have a very peaceful nights_sleep .
positive	the videos and assessments were very clear and detailed that i could never complain_about .
negative	they contacted me again today through paypal saying ' please confirm you have received the goods ' - sorry , all i can confirm is that i ' ve paid £_00 for absolutely nothing !
positive	come here often . addicted
neutral	maybe they don_'_t want to give that away to a complaining customer !
negative	on some 0x0s you need to match brands front and rear so that the central viscous differential is balanced , particularly at high speeds .
positive	if we ' d paid three_times as much it wouldn_'_t have been this comfortable .
negative	i left a 0 star_review for nigel_o ' hara after my awful experience shopping ( if that ' s what i can call it ) with them .
negative	in return i got a email back from mr_simon betts spouting more rubbish but the threats had now got serious .
positive	and the speed of delivery astounds me .
neutral	små detaljer har dog været irriterende :
negative	after trying to implement we came_across numerous issues and raised tickets which went_unanswered and were later told that ticket system was not there for implementation issues and we should have opted for paid implementation .
neutral	however , the company took my payment as soon as i ordered and did not ship the product for 0 days !
neutral	i ordered a top - of - the - range washer / dryer from electricshop .
negative	!
negative	how ridiculous , we were home all day waiting , have 0 dogs who bark loudly when anyone comes through the front gate so there is no way we would miss anyone calling at our house .
neutral	the company was called stress_free parking and i waited 00minutes for a chauffer to arrive .
positive	it '_s one - stop - shopping for the fitness focused .
negative	you continue to hide_behind your unclear and hidden terms and conditions !
negative	disgusting for a company to lie to it ' s customers !
positive	i called simply paving to purchase a pallet of slabs to be delivered to my father - in - law '_s house .
neutral	site requires improvement and cs_team could be more helpful when people provide suggestions .
positive	prices are very good , communication and delivery first_rate .
positive	kept up to date right up to the actual delivery .
negative	whilst im on the phone he told me the refund is sent , will take upto 0 days .
negative	good evening ,
positive	the trip to riga was really well_organised we had bobsleigh and shooting range activities both were great and again well_organised .
positive	this is our second fridge which we will use for beer and wine .
negative	i have recently upgraded with upgrade experts also i have taken out a new contract .
neutral	the service was fine and the product arrived within a few_days so i have no complaint there .
positive	i '_ve used this site several_times now over the last_year and recommended it to numerous friends , all of whom have had the same successful transaction and satisfactory result .
positive	than you .
neutral	!
positive	it is easy to navigate each page from the homepage / guest - house pages / map layouts etc etc with clear headers for guidance , in all instances i can remember it was comparatively the cheapest and also not only is the depth of information about each guest - house detailed but also local information is readily_available - and this is almost always reliable as it is not only ratified by yourselves at hostelbookers but by other_travellers who have reviewed , commented and posted about various aspects .
negative	unacceptable , today is my kids birthday and i have tried to phone the depot again to see if it ' s on their vehicle , but at 00 : 00 i get the response " our opening_hours are from 00 : 00 "
negative	seems that most people have had the same or similar experience with this rubbish , i always seem to be in the area 0 % they reckon they don_'_t cover , now like so many others stuck with a contract i cant get out of without paying through the nose to buy out despite the fact they do not fulfil their part of said contract by providing a service . they do not . i live in an area that according to their coverage map should have an excellent signal , i rarely get more than one bar up on my s0 and almost never get anything other than basic net connectivity if any !
neutral	heard from wowcher who have now processed my complaint and given me a refund .
neutral	i just don ' t understand_why they keep their ( pretty high ) booking_fees !
neutral	and it came really quickly so i couldn ' t resist trying it on as soon as i could !
positive	on the return we had not received a text on our mobile but the office had e_- mailed the reception at our hotel telling us the estimated time of pick_up .
positive	!
negative	they trade under cresentdirect on amazon - you have been_warned
neutral	even_though , my order was perfect and of good quality , i ' d not order again from gear0music , in case of another slow delivery
positive	staff very helpful and polite .
positive	our neighbour has reported to us he does it constantly !
negative	only by checking the website re status of delivery did i find the order had been stopped due to out of stock and they never even bothered to inform me .
negative	i checked on their website and was supposed to arrive today .
neutral	i even spoke with the receptionist , christine , about whether anyone had come into the building asking for my company to which she replied " yes , someone called richard was asking for you but i told him you weren ' t here so he left ".
neutral	very disappointed :(
negative	yodel have obviously made a good sales_pitch to secure the contract but can '_t fulfil any of it .
neutral	all nearly went swimmingly , the site is easy to use and i was very happy with the final_result .
positive	recommand to all this site .
positive	i will_definitely_recommend this to all of my friends to use with their iphones !
positive	we also caught the local bus to rovinj which was very easy , beautiful town very venetian in influence .
positive	this is the first time i have used full circle , as i have always booked through club med web_site before .
negative	i demanded to speak to her supervisor and she than told me that there is no supervisors working today !!! impossible !
negative	ordered many items over bank_holiday and reserved online , said to collect on sunday 00 / 0 / 00 , however store closed when i arrived . so i then went and placed order online only to find now my account debited and no items received , they gave very poor excuse saying " problems with web orders " be warned do not purchase from the homebase website . will now be taking up refund to my card thru my credit_card_provider , simply unacceptable customer service .
negative	we also had a call where they volunteered to take the details from another website and gave us a cheap offer .
positive	high_quality matched with the lowest prices makes shopping here enjoyable
neutral	however they did not require a signature and left the goods visible in my front porc even_though i was in the house !
negative	a company threatening their customers is enough not to use them . read on .
neutral	the staff were fantastic - so friendly and nothing was too much_trouble .
negative	first very frustrating thing were their emails sent to me in german ( booked flight through uk website , payed with cc registered in uk , gave uk contact number ).
neutral	!
positive	would definitely_use again .
negative	unbelievably i am reluctant to switch suppliers because for me , given my postcode , first_utility remains on a cost basis , the cheapest .
neutral	bought a pair of north_face mittens .
positive	we received really impressive service when we contacted the company .
positive	iv used skiddle twice now and find it very !
positive	will_certainly use the service again .
positive	please get unlock my idevice
positive	thanks
positive	i ' ve just started using aria but i will be sticking around !
positive	i always buy from refreshcartridges .
neutral	we watched a film last_night and i almost dozed off !
positive	searching online for the cheapest place to buy a particular catflap , brought up ' easyanimal . co . uk '.
neutral	i have spoken to a very polite man after a response to this and now have claimed my gift and the other 00 . 00 has been refunded , thank_you would still be a little_weary to use again unaided .
positive	overall great service , and i would recommend your company to others without_hesitation .
neutral	usually it is all fine and that one time it arrives bashed up and the driver thinks its fine ?
neutral	as he is unwell , and would not have wanted people to know that this is what was being delivered , he was very upset that the package had no wrapper .
negative	the packaging was perfect and very robust for the items so no issues with that at all .
neutral	i used to use ebay all the time , but it appears nowadays the majority of auctions are set by companies and ebay businesses .
positive	you discover discounted items designed to help you reach your fitness potential
negative	i do not have any word to explain my feelings guys .
neutral	placed my order from tribal six days ago , gives a . co . uk web address .
negative	when advising virgin_media of this they told us that they could only provide slow broadband and telephone line to the area and not television services .
negative	i immediately raised a complaint ticket ( saturday ).
neutral	the package on the whole is great but i do feel deeply angry that i signed_up to the 00mb cable internet just before they decided to choke the life out of it when you use it for anything other than surfing ( what , you ordered 00mb internet and want to actually download something ?!!
positive	very impressive i thought , then a text and another email_telling_me the date and time to expect my goods and that if this was not convenient please arrange a different time .
neutral	too risky on the whole to use .
neutral	there should be trusted community members or paid tutors to go over corrections to make_sure the student of the language is not being mislead by a correction .
negative	on the day of receipt , i wrote to advise you that i had ordered the wrong item .
neutral	also , as a result of the image transfer process , the t - shirt looked slightly faded already when it arrived .
negative	until now .
neutral	for example , the rear drum / shoe brakes needed cleaning and adjusting for £_00 which i thought should have been in the service - after all they would have already taken off the drum to " inspect " them as per service schedule - surely all the dust would have fallen out !
positive	no waiting in all day for delivery @ £_00 . theirs is free and with a 0 hr time_slot . other company '_s should take_note .
neutral	not working for me through explorer , nearly missed bargain but went through chrome and went ok .
neutral	overall not blown_away by the experience , but not that disappointed either .
neutral	will i use boiler_juice again ?
neutral	i have bought 0 beer kits , very pleased with the price , but order took a little longer_than_expected , i didn_'_t get an e . mail to tell me the order had been dispatched , and when it arrived . even_though it was well_packaged , sadly one of the cans was dented , i will try again though !
positive	will_definately be using double 0 again .
positive	on point .
neutral	i was poorer than a low power guitar amp purchased a long time ago .
neutral	but when you realise you '_ve spent £_00 in the last month for four weekly boxes , it is just too expensive for the tiny amount you receive .
neutral	orherwise the service has bern quick and efficiant .
positive	am hoping for some good ski kit offers in time for the new season !
positive	good communications .
neutral	anyway i eventually got hold of the owner and was able to text his mobile , he explained the situation , but i still did get a few false_promises , but at_least i was able to communicate , anyway after all the snow had buggered off , i did get my tracking_number and finally my item , yes it was frustrating having to wait that long but i also understand they have to be made as it does state .
negative	i am now on hold to customer_services for the 0nd time for over 00_minutes .
positive	hostelbookers is a really helpful n convenience friend to help travelers in booking accommodation !
positive	you cannot get better_than that !

positive	i chose to get payment by bank_transfer and it showed up two days after they received my phone .
positive	the problem was sorted_out within no time .
negative	i picked a delivery date , and i received an_email_confirming the order .
negative	will now have to pay someone_else to deliver the goods , probably hermes as they are supposed to be good .
negative	no call back .
positive	the staff are very friendly and very helpful .
positive	i needed to post off a parcel with some speakers which weighed a not - so - small 00kg .
neutral	i recommend little woods all the time to people but there ' s a catch prices are higher then other_retailers .
negative	even_though it wasn ' t their fault that she had to continue with the contract they were no help what so ever .
negative	i hear this company is owned by the germans . i mean what do you expect .
positive	website easy to use and packed with fun , fab useful things .
positive	was looking for a keyboard , realized i needed to do some homework , and this site was extremely_helpful in assisting with the decision .
positive	if you are about to run out of mot , i suggest contacting servicing_stop ltd .
neutral	so a tainted first experience .
negative	there are many similar companies out there and i would hope that at_least one would have a better customer service department .
neutral	paypal takes such a massive cut out of your transactions , it almost isn ' t worth it .
negative	eventually he realised it was actually possible to leave his chair and go and look in the warehouse for my order .
positive	in small cities it ' s pretty easy to figure_out what the best hostels are , but when you ' re staying somewhere like tokyo you really do need to check the reviews to figure_out what you need .
neutral	it would be beneficial for busuu and it ' s users to concentrate on tackling the grammar issues to improve it ' s service .
neutral	the value for money ratio is quite good .
neutral	it was in cardiff and cost a fortune for us to hire a mini_bus for the day !
neutral	when , and usually before the contract expires , a free upgrade is offered .
positive	i have been with vidahost since 0000 - receipts , etc to prove this .

positive	i will recommend them to my friends and will buy from them again in future if i need anything .
negative	on one of the boots i bought , one of the hooks fell off after one day .
neutral	there appears to be a reluctance to help once the money has changed hands .
neutral	next_day delivery failed ( order at 0 . 00pm , waited in all next_day , cam day after !!
neutral	i would not use them again purely because in this day and age there is no excuse for not processing and sending an order out in just one or two days following the order instead of 00 days especially as there are so many other_companies to choose from out there .
negative	we called the customer_service desk which was useless and a waster of my time .
positive	great communication , quick service and now bookmarked for future use .
neutral	an overhaul is needed of their commenting system , which is poorly implemented and usually just serves the purpose of breeding criticism and arguments between users .
neutral	overall i was pleased with the service for the price though and my return transfer ran perfectly .
negative	quicker to leave a note at residential addresses so drivers can get their round done in time .
negative	i returned the faulty tube , when they eventually replied after many ignored attempts to contact them .
positive	very responsive and quick .
positive	i certainly would recommend power_tools direct , simple to use site , very good value and quick and prompt delivery service .

neutral	), paypal seems to regret to support a dispute .

positive	bought a hsf a short while back and cant_complain_about the service and goods .
positive	i rang them and got straight through to a lovely geordie chap , who sent me out a new tray next - day .

positive	very helpful .
positive	amazon are an indisputably great company , with the right ethos to make it ideal for the customer .
positive	i contacted them to ask for a different item and instead of letting me place the order for the more_expensive item they asked for my system spec and actually recommended a cheaper item ( one that i later discovered was of better build_quality than the one i ordered ) for much less money than i ' d been willing to spend .
positive	they look great on the car so i ' m very pleased .
negative	just received my phone bill today , £ 0 . 00 ex - vat to tesco credit_card call_centre .

positive	i emailed several couriers who advertise on ebay , but for this sort of item which was not in a neat box , and was over 0 . 0m long and weighed about 00kgs . well 0 out of 0 replied , quoting £_000 and £_000 !
negative	hmm . they can take my money immediately but drag their feet to re - credit !
negative	however , get to the checkout and lets say service with a smile isnt their thing .
neutral	i realise that i could return the unit but i am not taking up that option as the synth itself is not faulty or badly marked in any way ( ish !
positive	as a trainer , i enjoy recommending this site to my clients .
negative	this happened multiple time , and their manager defended them .
positive	there is artwork everywhere and great attention to detail in the decor .
neutral	also i have a 0 . 0 creative speaker system but i can only use 0 . 0 as the motherboard doesn_'_t have the grey sound port ?

neutral	the same thing happended back in may .
positive	i have used the service many_times since mid 0000 to ship paintings worldwide ( which i pack and insure myself separately ).

neutral	good communication
neutral	suffice to say ( fortunately i am in the legal profession so my fees will be coming out of ebuyers pocket ) taking them to small_claims court as it is a principal that amazon , play , and other good e_- tailers don ' t abuse .
positive	gave it a go . and to my amazement within 00_hours i had an unlocked iphone 0 .
neutral	i am unable to claim my £_00 discount_code , trying many_times to contact them but received no responses so far .
neutral	obviously the price is good and on top of that my initial opinion is that the blends are high_quality .
negative	i would just like a full_refund now as i just don ' t want anything to do with this now .
neutral	moral of the story ?
neutral	but thanks at the end after almost 0months wait it was delivered .
neutral	i emailed gadget_panda back but was told that at_least two people check each phone received and they were adamant that one of the water indicators was red .
neutral	and i keep getting emails about having 0 days before price ends they seem unorganised .
negative	i am considering a visit to the premises to inquire on this further .
negative	i then asked for a copy of the companies policy of complaints_procedure to be e_- mailed me and the reply was she was unable to do this .
positive	great service speedy despatch of goods .
negative	the sting in the tail with this call was that you now have to pay your excess of £_00 and that i would be contacted within " 0 - 0 working_days " for an engineer to call and assess our dishwasher .
positive	i have ordered decadent e_- liquid both for myself and for friends , and we have all been delighted with the quality of the product .
positive	if there is something wrong with the car , they will take care of that too .

negative	i emailed to alert them to the problem .
positive	fantastic store with a superb range of guitars .
neutral	also communication only followed when a query was placed .
neutral	the furniture ( now its finally up ) is lovely , however when we got to the final piece , someone in the packing department had packed the wrong accessories unit , so we didnt have the right screws , nails etc to assemble the furniture .
negative	dont people think about where this stuff comes from ?
positive	they paid the most for my phone by a good 00 or 00_% i ' d say .

neutral	i have had a lot of building items delivered , timber , flooring , tiles .
negative	we have horrible experience with the customer_service .
positive	what can i say about this company ?
negative	luckily i found out later i just needed a driver update .
negative	the reaction i ' ve got on this was that it is the rspca minimum .
positive	hope they keep timeline though , its freaking awesome !
neutral	no problem we thought ., we submitted the review for evaluation and explained that we do not sell that product and suggested the above scenario .
negative	this scam is a disgrace and you should be_ashamed of yourself .
neutral	my latest order has_been a bit dissapointing .
neutral	when arrived wrong hinges in box although invoice said correct , have returned for refund .
positive	try and find anybody cheaper and locally fitted too .
negative	i eventually found an_email contact address and composed a message explaining that my previous experience with their service , had been both fast and reliable and i had used it regularly .

negative	i ordered a small pair of earphones from amazon and they are being posted by you .
positive	filled the online form , received the freepost_bag the next_day .
negative	got interest credit back immediately , after costly 0000 phone_call to tesco credit_card call_centre .
positive	great products and excellent service
positive	no_qualms in recommending them and i '_ll happily be using them again .
neutral	worked it out between us that i would get the tyre done at my home address ( which the call_centre said i was out of the postcode zone ).
positive	i saw the item i wanted , it was easy to order and had good communications from the company , delivery was excellent , and item was just what i wanted .
neutral	i do like pizza from the hut so can knock the food for what it is . but the website seems to always have problems with the page timing out at checkout , resulting in having to try and re order 0 or 0 times before it goes though .
negative	i may have to pay extra , but going for the budget option has meant fire fighting with them all the time , they will always tell you a problem is nothing to do with them , and then low and behold it is !
negative	i enquired_about membership details , and was briefed by one of the staff .
negative	i chose my hermes .
negative	after the refund was issued , i bought the same ssd again , but chose to pay the extra £ 0 . 00 for next_day shipping .

negative	very bad .
neutral	however , when they eventually did wake_up to the fact that i was getting desperate , they were efficient and the flowers arrived when they said they would !
negative	the driver failed to deliver on day one , unable to operate the doorbell .
positive	thank_you sw for making my life that much_easier !
neutral	this was not explained to me but the tech_guy '_s when i asked about my sound system ?

neutral	online - £_00 . 00 .
positive	fast price_matching , great freebies , and excellent shipping make this site a true winner for anyone_looking to pick_up supplements .
negative	this is not the first time this has happened , i will be complaining to my shipper .
neutral	recently made a purchase and everything was of good standard until the carrier took over - city_link - and delivered my parcel to another house over 0 / 0 mile away .
negative	as usual we have had substitutes and yet again they have not been amended as ordered this is getting a regular occurrence .
neutral	these_guys are okay but sometimes there is a stock problem that they don ' t let you know about until after you ' ve ordered .
negative	so yeah , thanks for stealing my £_00 simplygames .
negative	bye
positive	i have saved a fortune using these deals .
neutral	you only have to type " regus " and " complaints " in google to see that i am not the only one affected by this .
neutral	when i went back and read the small_print , as i should have done at first , it was clear that this was not so .
positive	there was a slight_problem with parcelforce failing to find my house ( but looking at trustpilot reviews of parcelforce it doesn_'_t seem unusual for them to get things wrong !).
negative	oh , no the problem is with the exchange .
negative	you have ' nt even bothered to reply .
negative	what is the government thinking_about !
negative	only one containing the poles delivered the box with the awning is missing , value £_000
neutral	facebook was all craze .
positive	i have now placed two_separate_orders with first0magnets .
neutral	most times my deposits are gone within 0 - 00_minutes .
negative	seriously poor service .
positive	fully recommended .
neutral	and you have spend ages to prove that what they sent you was wrong - emails , sending pictures , phone_calls . customer_service is yuck .
positive	a friend showed me supplement_warehouse a few_months_ago and now it ' s the only place i buy my supplements .
neutral	we were not after material gain , just a good old_fashioned apology .
neutral	one thing however , their prices are the best around and that comes in handy when needing to support ones fitness habits .
negative	i uppose that there is room for all in the market , but i prefer to pay for quality and good taste , ok yes , i am a snob .
neutral	so 0 phone_calls which really shouldn ' t have happened .
neutral	apart_from that customer_services were quick responding and helpful and ordering and speed of delivery was good .
negative	ups cost me $_00 !!!
positive	cannot_fault it .
neutral	when i got through i explained again my problem , and i was offered a refund of the lead and the rest of the order sent out .
negative	we had a good relationship with our previous manager and the team are useless and only open minimal hours .
neutral	finally , the promised firewire sockets were absent , however a pci card is in the post .
positive	i was initially attracted_by the good prices however they were great on service too , the staff when i called for advice were so helpful and i was updated with every_stage of the packages progress , i found the products reviews useful and my guinea pigs are very happy in their home !
negative	recently lost all connection to my dedicated_server , and the matrix control_panel is plagued with problems - still without imap or pop0 for the third time in a row .
positive	i booked my first james_villa holiday nearly 00 years_ago now and have only travelled with them since .
neutral	oz
positive	simple and easy to use .
neutral	secondly the double hook is too small for winding the drawstring onto and should be higher quality for the price - brass or stainless_steel .
positive	but after_reading some of the reviews here on trustpilot , i gave gcrc a go .
neutral	that '_s when things are going well .
negative	its only when you go to make a claim , that you suddenly realise how awful this particular company are .
positive	thanks again to tyres on the drive for professional service
neutral	their other supplier had one in stock but it cost more so they would not send it , not my problem !
negative	the colour is at_least three shades darker than the double one and although the description states it is the same size the single unit is almost 0 inches taller so the shelves do not align with the double , it has different feet and the wood is rounded , where as the double unit is straight edged .
negative	takes 00 working_days to hear back from customer_service when chasing items and then another 00 working_days to book in a collection of an item .
positive	good weight , heats up extremely fast . easy to clean perfect everyday pans !
negative	so according to her it takes 00 days to get it to customs then once its there they don ' t care what happens to your product if it gets to you or not .
neutral	i usually don ' t panic but i spent a serious amount of cash on these tickets so i ' m starting to worry !
negative	took 0 month payment in_advance , yet when we left after two years they forgot about that and refused to give us our money back .
positive	this course was so easy to access and complete , everything is given to you and you don ' t need to search for materials .
positive	i ' ve ordered from here a few_times and i ' ve always gotten stuff cheap and quickly and in good quality .
neutral	however , the first booking was perfect , everything went well .
neutral	need items for tuesday as it for a birthday_present
neutral	as a follow_up to response to my last rating : there was no apology , and there was no offer of a refund .
negative	the email said as long as i pack the items as instructed , my items would be collected by the courier .
negative	well thanks for your blatant incompetence !
positive	will use again .
positive	it was a great deal and i am thoroughly pleased with both it and the service received .
negative	thank_you
neutral	not all the photos i ' d uploaded were printed on the card , there were a number of duplicates also .
negative	after ordering a bedroom_furniture set in aug and was pleased with decided to order another one for different room in oct arrived 0th_nov some of which was damaged , told rang customer_services told to refuse delivery of those items and replacements would be sent out y end of week which we did . of course replacements were not coming anytime soon , after numerous_calls to the call_centre and apart_from been told different things about a resolution to our problem which we had to restart the story each time we rang , it was all so robotic word for word even down the very insincere apology for the problem . anyway after all the calls and a letter that was advised by trading_standards giving a deadline saying what we wanted to happen by ( which they responded to the day before that date with no resolution ) help from credit_card_provider and 0months later after a lot of stress we decided to demand a refund which also took days to sort_out properly despite reassurances it would happen . i would never recommend a large purchase from asda direct that comes from a supplier . they clearly don_'_t care about their customers and definitely need to look very hard at their customer_services which is out of uk with no empathy or real knowledge of what they are doing there '_s no way contacting anyone in a higher position , you just can '_t past their 0000 number i know i tried . the whole_process is an_absolute joke .
neutral	today , 00 / 0 / 00 , still nothing received so i checked the tracking online and nothing was found so i called up and was told that the order placed last_week did not go through properly at their end and i ' ll need to go back online an re - order .
negative	all seemed fine .
positive	we hav ' nt fitted it yet , but as an electrician i will have no trouble ( they even supplied the plugs and screws )
neutral	to be told it was with ups .
negative	i asked them why they never let me know about the stock issue and delays , but they just ignored the question and said it ' d be sent as soon as possible .
negative	also reported the fact that the windows rattled .
positive	for these reasons it is my preferred choice .
neutral	will shop at amazon or dabs from now on as always had excellent service and well trained staff .
negative	do not go with orange !
negative	was promised that my number will be ported over on friday before midnight .
neutral	i emailed twice but received no reply .

neutral	i was waiting for the first payment to be processed she came back on the phone and informed me that the prices have gone up .
positive	will be dealing_with them again in future :)
negative	please avoid this company like the plague !!!
positive	this is the second time i ' ve used serenata_flowers and i will_defiantly use them again .
negative	rude personal !

positive	i recently wanted to purchase a new digital slr - having look at all the reviews around i settled on a nikon_d0000 with an additional 00 - 000mm lens .
positive	fast_shipping i have no_complaints .
positive	the best competition i found had the same products with free shipping , but i saved $_00 on 0 items and only had to pay $_00 in shipping , netting me $_00 in savings on a $_000 order .
neutral	like many people i have used amazon quite_often over the years and although the service is generally quite good , delivery does tend to let them down during both peak and off_peak periods .
negative	the money was taken from paypal on 00th_november_0000 and today ( 0st march_0000 ) has not been refunded .
neutral	the flowers were fortunately still in good condition .
negative	it never happened , i had to call them every time .
negative	this cover was requested for before_christmas since it was a gift .
positive	a very happy customer .
neutral	loaded_onto perth van
neutral	first time using them , don_'_t think i will use again !!
positive	they gave me a call a few_days after i had received the parts to check that i was happy and continued to help me and answer any_questions that i had .
negative	don_'_t waste your money or your time using these_people .
neutral	( first use )
neutral	the 0th day came , nothing through the post or any attempted deliveries , i thought i would just give them benefit of christmas deliveries as it was around that time . finally on the 0th day after delivery i got something but was way too small for the xbox_000 . i got one of the games from the bundle . ok , so where is the rest of it ?
positive	thanks
negative	i like the prices of the items but i still expect to get the item pictured & the boots i were sent were a good 0 - 0 inches shorter than in the picture of the item onsite !!
positive	representative was very polite , courteous and helpful over the phone .
negative	i will be asking them to review their experience on this site so more people can be made aware before purchasing from this company .
negative	ordered a piece of furniture in october , which the website said was in stock .
positive	once i figured out what i was doing wrong it was plain_sailing and enjoying the ease of sending all my parcel out
positive	that '_s the way to win customer_satisfaction .
neutral	when ordering dvds they ' re brilliant .
positive	tried them on straight_away and couldn ` t stop laughing .
neutral	i was greeted_by the reps at the aiport with no_problems , signed some paper work and the car was mine .
positive	they answered a question i had before i made the order and delivered quickly afterwards .
neutral	it was a good price , although not the cheapest we found on the web , but we thought it looked a professional outfit , and assumed that aeg would vet suppliers .
negative	majority of our technical problems were never resolved .
positive	but once i reordered the order went through normally .
neutral	unfortunately the delivery men struggled to get the chest of drawers upstairs for us and gave up leaving it in the centre of our living_room where we hoped to sleep tonight whilst the bedroom is being finished !
positive	she went extra_mile .
neutral	limited website and sales teams are a total pain in the backside .
neutral	it ' s a pain to have to go through various frames of what is effectively a flash banner just to get to the correct product .
neutral	wrong !
neutral	for example :
positive	very quick , efficient , helpful service .
negative	i wish to now receive my refund
neutral	i honestly do not think though that he would want me to buy this product for him again .
neutral	hopefully it will_continue to do so .
negative	naturally i was excited .
positive	very convenient and well_priced .
negative	that is it
neutral	:( very disappointed because we had to wait about 0months .
neutral	struggled to get the aeg fridge_freezer that we were after , and kitchen_appliances 000 were helpful when taking the order where others weren_'_t .
positive	i ' m very happy - excellent service
neutral	it ' s too easy to fake good reviews , or keep flagging legitimate reviews as " abusive " so nobody sees them .
neutral	we bought the corona pine bedroom set .
negative	however , the package i received from gap ( not out of southampton ) arrived in good time .
negative	i ordered it and paid in full .
neutral	tracked parcel the day after ( 00th_dec ) to find that the goods had been refused by addressee and returned to sender !!
neutral	do not book a collection when it ' s cold - it will not get collected as all their couriers are afraid of snow , ice or even the prospect of snow and ice .

neutral	if you want anything from iceland go to the store , i have had three online deliveries and only one did i get everything i ordered , on one 00 items were out of stock but my local_store had them all , i ordered 0 packs of warburtons 0pack crumpets for a pound each the sent me 0packs of kingsmill one which they sold two for a pound and only had 0 crumpets which they sell two packs for a pound but charges me a pound a pack also i ordered three two litres of semi skimmed milk , which one had a hole in the bottom and was squashed which covered the fridge and the floor with milk , if you want shopping from them go to your local_store then whatever you put in your trolley you know you will get .
positive	they have very low_prices with quick and easy payment .
neutral	update_: 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00
positive	have also informed my daughters school .
neutral	being an only child , and having lived on my own at certain times of my life , i appreciate having knowing that i can now be connected easily to everyone_else .
negative	i wouldn ' t trust anything these_guys say , i also doubt some of the other comments on here that are just being used to boost the scores up .
neutral	now its apparently back with ups .
neutral	i have had a co - op bank credit_card now for many_years .
neutral	we started with the footstool first which was a doddle .
negative	" we understand that is not your fault however please_note that this was a system error and the emails used were free of charge instead of paying for them .
neutral	a little something back is always nice .
positive	would recommend to anyone .
neutral	after the 0rd time my boots were right but cost me around £_00 in phone_calls !

neutral	i wanted to be able to update everything myself but still have to employ someone to do the jpegs and links .

positive	the first one was £_00 total , i took it , slightly worried i might get poor service .
negative	anyway , they stood by their decision , not to refund me the quarterly bill we had already paid as they had upheld their part of the t &_c and are still adament that we were not lied to by the sales_team and everyone after that , even james had lied to me within the communications we have had .

neutral	service very good and prompt , however after purchasing over £_000 of balloons / goods and whilst awaiting the helium ( one week before the party ) only to be phoned to say that there is a shortage of helium and consequently my order could not be fulfilled .
positive	well that '_s what i thought , looked at all the paperwork not a clue .
neutral	ana from the customer_satisfaction team was very helpful .
negative	i have purchased a product , via amazon , and the supplier uses yodel to deliver to their customers .
neutral	when booking you have no_idea where you will be staying ( if you book accommodation ) as you just select a category .

positive	i think scan have set the bar now for online computer accessory retailers .
positive	so i logged_onto the ups website and got a quote of £_00 . 00 for them to collect and post my parcel .
negative	this company have absolutly no after_sales support . i purchased helium balloons and a helium cylinder and it was the biggest mistake i made in years . after just half an_hour the balloons started to drop and within an_hour they were all on the floor . i called partyrama and asked for help and advice to be told there was nothing they could do as they did not do a same day delivery and that i was to blame even if they could deliver i would have to pay for a new cylinder because i should of inflated the balloons at the party not at home hours before . just as well i did do them at home can you imagin the embarrasment of helium balloons on the floor at the party . i suggest you stay_clear of this company . i will never use them ever again .

neutral	i have bought a few appliances from applianceonline - but will not be doing so in future .
negative	the phone line goes straight to answerphone , the customer support chatline is always offline and they do not answer the emails .
positive	great products back by outstanding service .
neutral	my ' gripe ' is that when we started the booking , the ' fee ' was £_00 approximately . partway through the booking , the fee escalated , with no
negative	i find it more so frustrating as i did receive an_automated email from them confirming the courier booking and providing an_email address to contact if i have a query - the same address i sent my three emails to - enquiries @ musicmagpie . co . uk .
neutral	it missed its slot and i had a large taxi fare as a consequence . empty any hold luggage , let them stew .
positive	would recommend .
negative	stay_away !
negative	this didn_'_t sound ideal but i was assured this wouldn_'_t affect my right to return them if they didn_'_t fit .
neutral	ordered bred 00 from the site and they gave me a box with a huge crease in it like it was on the bottom of a heavy stack
neutral	my issue , and the reason for only giving three stars was with the lack of knowledge and near rudeness with the numerous sales_reps over the phone .
negative	i have been appalled to keep reading_reviews from others like me who are considerably out of pocket because of the unfair trading practices of the owner of this company .
positive	small problem ( caused by me ) resolved by phone in a most courteous and helpful manner .
negative	upon_arriving at the entrance , we were looked at by the passing staff , but not spoken to or acknowledged , which was very strange .
neutral	regards
neutral	i appreciate electronic communication gets rid of the pesky customer but sometimes a conversation is needed .
neutral	i was with 0 for a couple of years and at first seemed ok although the coverage wasn ' t that great and i was supposed to receive a 0g_signal everywhere around me but i didn ' t .
neutral	automatic discounts ( buy 0 for 0 ) won ' t work - you have to contact them to fix that .
neutral	they have varied prices for varied number of days which isnt there on other_sites .
negative	my gas smart_meter is still not working and i was told that it may happen in march .
positive	my recipient was thrilled with the speed too and i have used them ever_since .
positive	so i went_ahead and got a quote from them , and gave me a huge list with various couriers and varied speeds that my parcel would be delivered .
neutral	when will it end ?
neutral	i purchased an evic from joyetech and am very pleased with the actual ecig .
positive	bought a few beds and toys and really liked the quality .
neutral	i have ordered at_least 0 times because the lighting they sell suits my needs , but god it is a messy business ordering and receiving .
positive	i was particularly impressed by their technical_support and how quickly any_issues were dealt_with .
neutral	and pushed me towards " love to shop " vouchers .
positive	so i went on to live_chat and was dealt_with really quickly by the very helpful richard_mileham .
negative	, puique de toute façonje dois payer la totalité .
negative	one or two bowls of rice ?
negative	something seems to have changed about this company .
neutral	surely a graded p_+_p system could be introduced , rather_than a blanket cost ?

negative	i wanted a new amp for my birthday .
negative	sofa should be delivered 00 july , phone_call from very rude staff_member on the 00 july to say container with my sofa on never arrived and they don_'_t know when it will be arriving , this also applied to many other dissatisfied_customers .
neutral	its my money and i want to know !
neutral	i have to give three stars because i got the phone i wanted at the price i wanted , and quickly .
neutral	not exeptional service but by no means aweful .
positive	however . my mind was put at ease instantly , with great communication , great prices and super_fast shipment .
neutral	however , eleven days after ordering , the battery arrived , fits_perfectly , was recognised by my lap - top , and so far , works as it should .
negative	the reply i received from trainline . com was polite but somewhat patronising and informed me that i had indeed purchased new tickets , that there was an admin_fee of £_00 per person , per_ticket for each of the ' old ' tickets and that my refund of £_00 had been credited to my account .
negative	store manager andy is very poorly trained and not management material at all .
neutral	just a shame i didn ' t get a straight answer at the beginning .
positive	im a pregnancy testaholic so these are so beneficial for me .
neutral	good website , but sales people in their shops are really bad and rude .
negative	i purchased a coat for my wife for christmas .
neutral	on the upside , service is still good , but now it '_s always worth_checking toolstation et al as someone_else will usually have the same thing cheaper .
positive	i love it i love it i love it !
neutral	i rang up amazon immediately to try and get them to redeliver , but they couldn_'_t reach the driver and who_knows if they ' re actually going to try again today .
negative	avoid !
positive	i have used this site a few_times and every time the order arrives quickly and with out fuss .
neutral	the university ' s finance department phoned them , and supposedly the person in charge of our account is not there until friday , so we have to call then .
neutral	i guess i wrote this more out of anger as my gf was very upset . as it was solved quickly i can change the star_rating .
positive	but the greatest thing was , if you bought this package you got a credit towards your shipping .
negative	scam !!!
positive	as we were unable to take delivery that day we selected the option from the email to choose another convenient date .
neutral	i ' m going to be paying £_00 a month at this rate for a rubbish phone
neutral	i '_ve still not received a refund for the extra postage they robbed me of .
negative	my friend has just called to say the flowers have been delivered . and they are dead , leaves all dropped_off and whole_thing squashed .
negative	the main problem i think is that they use hermes as a courier .

neutral	problems started when in my order i picked a composite door was given a price and guide date of 0 weeks this became 00 and many phone_calls later and a threat to cancel the order the door was indeed ready .

positive	i purchased serengeti eye wear at a good price and received them next_day by registered_post .
neutral	please ensure correct information is showing and not having to re - change order at extra costs .
negative	firstly they didn_'_t confirm the order by email which is usually customary with good companies .
negative	i was called back and told that it would be an afternoon delivery .
negative	of course this is if you are able to reach anybody in customer_service .
neutral	but overall , i have bought things from them in the past .
positive	brilliant service - cannot_fault it

positive	excellent company .
negative	i just don ' t like dominos .
positive	thanks .
positive	i have been in the electrical contracting business
negative	i had to register with the website and to do so was forced to give unnecessary information that i did not want to give about myself .
neutral	unfortunately they had already put 0 dents in my lovely new furniture when i pointed_out the dents the driver was very weary in his voice and stated he could ring the office but then they would have to take it away and rearrange - but since all our other furniture has already been disposed of i had little choice but to keep it dents and all .

neutral	i ' ve been a buyer and seller on ebay since 0000 .

positive	from the moment i ordered the item to delivery , everything was spot on and very professional .

negative	nescafe coffee 000g x 0
negative	placed an order with uksweets at quite a high value and had a terrible experience :
negative	i bought a kitchen from the meir department stoke on trent . after fitting the kitchen i found out i had to purchase the edging strip separately unfortunately the store did not have the strip and i had to order the strip directly from scotland . i was asked to pay in advance as they could not send or order the strip for the store as it was regarded as a special order . i was charged a delivery charge which i felt was unfair as this item i feel should have been available in store . the item was to be delivered within five days but after three_weeks i am still_waiting despite a number of calls to the store . very poor customer service .
negative	the restaurant is not even busy and i have no_idea what the chefs in the kitchen are doing , but a bunch of meatballs and some rice surely can ' t take that long to cook ?
neutral	i renewed with wft because i ran_out of time to shop around .
neutral	when they did eventually arrive a month later than promised , they were lovely cards .
positive	very good and prompt delivery .
positive	the description was relatively detailed , could have done with a bit more on the specific application of each model .

positive	many_thanks .

positive	hope the recipient enjoys spending the voucher at sportsbikeshop
positive	i think the score is so low because people who had good experience usually don ' t come to write a good comments but people who had bad_experience coming here to complain straight_away , that ' s why there are so many negative_reviews .
positive	tracking was accurate .
positive	i love this game too much < 0

neutral	needed a spare key for our tow_bar . and on googling found this site . really happy with price . not so happy with postage .
neutral	it would seem to me that ofl work for the delivery guys rather_than the other way round and i just happen to be an annoyance in the middle .
negative	was told that was not possible , and they would only send the correct ones if they receive the wrong ones , asked what would happen if they did not arrive in time , i was told i could buy replacements locally to me !!!!
negative	some 0 weeks_later i have not heard a thing from their solicitors or the police or mr_simon betts .
neutral	the one that hated it is still really thin and is off her food , this is now 0 days_later , not sure how long it takes to be effective but i think i should take her to the vets as it may even be something_else .

neutral	when contacted , they said they ' ll get back to me in 0 business days .
negative	i went straight to the letter_box and no card had been left .
neutral	strings_direct are good for mainstream stuff - i need bespoke and these_guys can '_t be doing with the faff .

neutral	recently i booked two days break for dublin and that experience was interesting .
negative	i gave my delivery address to wowcher , how could they not have it ?
negative	asda house ,
negative	they took my money , and me , for a fool !
neutral	i had already advised the controller that if i had to pay any change of booking fees that these would be forwarded to the company as the whole idea of booking valet_parking was to ensure minimum delay .
neutral	sometimes you win - i '_ve no_problems with yodel , i live on the edge of civilisation in scotland and have to have to lot of stuff delivered .
neutral	by the time it arrived the evaporator had been damaged and the bottles of pheromones had leaked a little .
negative	in the meantime i continue paying my monthly_bill .
positive	by the way , i am not married to , related to , or a friend of any delivery driver , i have just had a delivery from yodel and found the driver so cheerful that he has really brightened up my day .
neutral	also ordered a fan controller on a seperate order and this arrived in the given time but on closer_inspection i can see that the courier has manhandled the item and all the knobs were slightly bent , again no reason to get it replaced as the item works and unless your really looking you wont see it .
positive	they are just good guys .
positive	i can recommend this samsung washer and appliances_online to all .
neutral	sometimes things are in stock and you get good service ( guildford branch ) othertimes things are out of stock ( including their warehouse ) and the service is lousy or the product is damaged and has to be returned .
positive	knownhost is among the ones i have used and still using , and i can wholeheartedly_recommend them .
positive	fastest way to assemble a personalised gift package at a very reasonable_price .
positive	not used this site before and found it through a google_search as wanted to send some flowers to my sister .
positive	i used to leave my photos on my laptop but now i print them out at photobox - just like the old days !
neutral	it was purchased as a birthday_present for my wife .
negative	otherwise you will sign up then be quoted £_000 per day , approx 0 days to carry out the work ( notice it has now dramatically gone up ) when you are unable to carry out the implementation yourself .
negative	terrible service !
positive	harlow
neutral	when it is about virtual items ( in game items etc .
positive	their free ( very reliable ) next_day delivery is also an amazing bonus .
positive	delivery was really quick too , i would definately use them again and would highly_recommend to people trying to conceive .

positive	0_stars
positive	they were well_packaged and most_importantly worked_perfectly and have totally transformed my pc . verall it received excellent service and would not_hesitate to recommend this company to anyone .
neutral	after my comments on here i swiftly received a call from o . f . l .
positive	( only runs for two_weeks a few_times each year ) last time i got twelve games for around twenty pounds .
positive	i didn ' t really have any_problems and that ' s why the full stars , i got scared that they wouldn ' t be trustworthy and just say my phone was " gone " as i didn ' t really have any way to prove it . however was very positively_surprised .
neutral	sadly the rad had suffered damage in transit , being dented and scratched on the bottom rail and the packaging & tape was hardly pristine , suggesting it had done the rounds well and truly before reaching me . and the valve set sent was the angled variety .
positive	the system itself that i chose was great value for money , as were several other systems listed on the site .
negative	so thank_you yodel for once again making me waste a day of my annual leave waiting in for a parcel that was never going to turn_up .
neutral	the online billing services is fairly good .
negative	naturally cancelled the order and won_'_t be sourcing anything through argos again .
negative	0 .
positive	not the cheapest but very nearly .
positive	chris_wood is the man i liase with on literally a daily_basis and his product knowledge and advice is just great .
positive	it took 0 days for the book to arrive after_placing my order on a sunday at 00pm , i was very please with the fast service and will be placing future orders .
positive	this was with the free 0st_class delivery option .
positive	it was all panic stations unable to leave the house due to an accident the previous week .
positive	the villas are always clean and well maintained .
negative	done !
negative	shocking .
neutral	i am sick to death of the continual phone_calls before , during and after purchase ( which are alleged to be from them ) hassling me to buy additional warranties / insurance policies - although they will stress they are not insurance policies . but it will cost me extra money each month so work it out for yourself .
positive	another thing that i really_enjoyed was that they had these packages at checkout $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 which all offered different things .
negative	my friend she paid £_00 for hers and got it after two days , i paid £_00 for mine including p_& p and i ' m still_waiting .
neutral	i work full time and had decided that booking via chilli_sauce would make things fairly easy and hassle_free for me as the weekend organiser .
neutral	i sent my items 00 days ago and still_waiting for my payment to be processed .
neutral	im just getting a little_worried after_reading reviews that maybe we might travel the whole way to belfast ( i have a hotel booked and all ) and not get in and most of all my daughter would be devastated im feelin anxious :-(
neutral	however the account pages where you sell , pay etc is far to complicated .
neutral	i bought in bulk to last at_least a year but the ones i received need to be used by the beginning of august , so some will end up getting put in the bin .
negative	of course i have told them i consider their reply to be totally_unacceptable .
neutral	why cant i rank companies by location , reverse review rating , etc
negative	he claimed that the damage was sufficient that they would take £_000 off the price paid .
positive	and i will most definatley be useing skiddle again for future tickets .
positive	i got all that i wanted within my budget and i am pleased with the system .
positive	they have an amazing range of beauty products as well which is great for a makeup addict like me .
positive	bought a raleigh swift folding bike , halfords have the best bargains for bikes and if there are any_problems you can always take it to the shop for service .
positive	lilian
negative	phoned up for simple fridge hinge , no replies for 0 hours , then phoned to to clarify and they were emailing someone_else on totally different email address , very confused as to whether the part for my bosch fridge was the correct_part despite all info given to them on the product number , so to this end went online to another company part , ordered within minutes and £_00 cheaper , so i would say avoid this company .
positive	i have started using parcel0go as my courier of choice and they have been excellent so far .
neutral	the service has been good and i don ' t think we have too many complaints , but until the choice is more_than two restaurants i don ' t think we can rate higher_than three stars .
positive	i can not fault spartoo with their web_site , choice of shoes , contact and delivery which was free and my shoes arrived four days after i ordered them .
positive	it saves us all time , troubling traffic and money .
neutral	update :-
negative	needless to say she asked for her money back and we sourced a mattress locally .
positive	purchased computer memory , great value , quick delivery , brilliant communication , thanks !
neutral	guess why ?
positive	e_- mails informing_me of order & delivery status
neutral	they weren ' t overly bothered when i told them as the info is all their in checkout .
negative	the website appeared to be a uk company and the price was good , so i ordered the camera .
neutral	given the price , i decided to sit tight and hope for the best .
negative	the police were not impressed .
neutral	as i say the product appears to be good but i hope i never have to test your claims_procedure .
positive	every day had challenges but the whole team worked together so well these challenges seemed so much_easier . so many amazing memories to take home with me thank_you so much to everyone at private kilimajaro for giving me the best experience !
positive	hostelbookers restera ma référence pour chaque réservation d ' auberge de jeunesse !
neutral	oh_dear !!
neutral	would use them again when i need anything_else .
positive	thank_you smd - can '_t fault your excellent products and service
negative	we '_ve used xln telecom for a number of years , and were always skeptical about the very bad_reviews we read about them .
neutral	en anden kjole og snydt med formen på ærmerne .
negative	after the last email about how to look after the rubbish bouquet i received i went out to a high_street florist and bought a replacement for myself so i could throw the rubbish flowers in the bin
neutral	the first two options are fine but try finding a specific tip type is not something axminster think you need to worry_about ??????
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	i wanted to try these_guys as the price was the highest .
negative	absolute_joke - supposed free brightsparks visit who found no fault my end but changed the faceplate anyway , even_though he told me mine was fine i then received the brightsparks bill for £_00 which sent me overdrawn as i wasnt expecting it so got another £_00 bill from the bank - rang up 0 times to be told by " manager " rahul singh that i will be getting no refund or help will billing because he changed the faceplate !
neutral	i would much rather travel easyjet than ryanair anyday , but unfortunately their ' cheap as chips ' competitor seems to have the edge on providing the flying public with more destinations to the sun !
neutral	on my next call i nailed them .
negative	i ordered two items for my girlfriend in october ( for christmas !)
negative	a card was supposedly left - it wasn ' t .
positive	not a huge issue … one does not go on holiday to a sun - drenched country to watch tv .
positive	i remain impressed .
positive	i will use them again for certain .
negative	allposters . co . uk is not a uk site , which had me fooled !
negative	my father agreed with me that the scooter be returned with an explanation as to why it was not fit for purpose and request a full_refund as this was only 0 days after delivery .
neutral	not happy at all - if the amp does not arrive before 0pm tonight i will be requesting a refund for the extra money paid for saturday delivery .
positive	congrats and greetings !
positive	this is the second time i have used this site , and would recommend it fully .
neutral	lors de ma consultation de_notre_compte au début de_l ' été , je m ' aperçois que_le statut de_la commande est toujours " en attente de fabrication " et que la_livraison est passée à_la semaine du 00 septembre . première mauvaise surprise .
positive	if you want sunglasses go hear .
negative	alors soyez tres prudent en louant un vehicule surtout chez eux ,
negative	it looks_like i will have to take this down the legal route
negative	very disappointed in the customer_service i have received from yourselves !
neutral	they were often noisy and monopolised the small pool when guests wanted - or i wanted to use it .
positive	fantastic !
negative	needless to say , my patience was wearing pretty thin at this point .
positive	i bought a wedding_ring from diamond_geezer , i was initially a little_concerned with buying online , but the experience was a very positive one with help easily obtainable & a returns_policy if required .
negative	waited until 00 : 00 no delivery so i phoned the nottingham branch that it was due to come from , to be told , as it was 000kg they could not fit it on the vehicle and they are struggling for drivers , are they trying to fit it on a van ??
negative	unbelievable .
neutral	the impression is given that this is just a set of items designed and intended for other purposes being collected together and advertised as something_else .
positive	my parcel was delivered to me at 00 : 00 .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in both recommending them to my friends or using them again to sell on a no_longer needed phone .
negative	when i tried to claim the money back using the direct_debit guarantee i found it wasn ' t worth the paper it was written on .
positive	he gave me his direct line number , but called me regularly to let me know what was happening with my booking .
negative	would never use this company again and wouldnt trust them to deliver the parcel let_alone pick it up !!!!!
positive	no problem , delivered in two days .
negative	when going to the store i was told i have to accept a loan phone ( shared by most of uk ) which was not even a smart device ( no email / apps ) - both unhygienic and inconvenient for me .
positive	i was a little_nervous when i ordered my dress after i read some bad_reviews .
positive	have purchased a few things from here and would def recommend .
positive	thankfully my dress is 000_% perfect !
positive	also to compare the locations and prices .
negative	use at your_peril , avoid like the plague !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	i ' ve ordered tickets to wwe raw in the 00 dublin .
neutral	i dont mind the look but the categories are all over the place .
negative	the complaints are logged , so the more people who complain to them , the more likely it is that action will be taken .
neutral	!
positive	what can i say if you have a pet and your looking for a fantastic , service , tips , products then look no further this place is the best !
negative	booking the day off work and i am sure if you thought your sofa was being delivered the following_day you most certainly would not have your old one meaning people are left to sit on the floor .
neutral	it was delivered very quickly and i was impressed by that .
negative	not the 00 red_roses i had paid for , but three roses and a handful of carnations .
neutral	it also states " try going outside the store to check - in " - make up your mind please !
positive	i asked for an earlier delivery which was sorted_out very quickly .
neutral	first time i '_ve used this company - it was the cheapest on the web for husked sunflower seed i was after .
neutral	of course noone bothered to tell me this ; only by checking the website myself and having to ring them did i eventually find this out .
positive	their staff were most helpful , letting me know exactly when i could expect to receive my purchases .
neutral	she spoke very rapidly and seemed as if she just couldn ’ t wait to deal with us and move on .
neutral	very disappointing
positive	we ordered the samsung clp 000 colour_laser_printer .
positive	thanks
negative	on this occasion i received a text at 00 . 00am ( after everyone had left the house for work ) to say my parcel would be delivered within two days .
negative	it is geared up for handing disputes between buyers and sellers but when ebay gets it wrong you might as well talk to the wall .
negative	i will never touch vodafone again and i am pleased to say that my experience has persuaded many friends and colleagues to steer_well clear and when my company renews it '_s mobile_phone contract , which is a multi - million pound contract , i will do everything i can to influence the decision to ensure that vodafone does not get it !
negative	their reply stated that they regret the ' inconvenience ' this may have caused me .
negative	using this company illustrates just why public services often maintain such a poor public image .
positive	really helpful advice given on products .
neutral	i can find no number to ring on the website to chase it .
positive	good service and great range of products .
neutral	i would fly with this outfit again .
negative	set_up direct_debit with tesco credit_card in april for full monthly_payment .
neutral	would prefer to pay more for a bit more luxury so won_'_t hurry back
positive	its brilliant .
neutral	it was 0 . 00 for a small 0st_class stamp and a ain white envelope , nearly as much as the key !
negative	and i asked them to arrange_collection of the flowers and arrange for a full_refund .
neutral	but surely you should be used to this and deal with nasty odours ’ accordingly .
positive	very good product would defo recommend no more pulling .
negative	both are on a 00 day rolling agreement .
neutral	oh well
positive	good price , easy to order and fast delivery
positive	hi double0 ,
positive	partyrama was the only place where i found a good selection of 00th_birthday decorations , for my papa ' s birthday .
negative	i have requested immediate_refund and will use small_claims court to reclaim monies if not received .
positive	quality products and fast delivery .
negative	horrible dire faced woman .
negative	the photos he sent were not very good but showed a couple of scuffs marks – not £_000 worth of damage !!!
negative	i received an_email after the order confirming the purchase .
neutral	i used boiler_juice several_times now , i use it simply cause its the easy way to get fairly cheap oil . i know by ring around i can get it cheaper . but normally with group discount etc it works out about the same .
negative	!
negative	wrongly labelled ( size ) item returned and customer charged for it .
negative	only then did i get someone that understood customer_service , who apologised and promptly refunded my account with the money .
neutral	other than no one to answer the telephone . not too bad !
positive	all my shopping_experiences with viovet are fantastic , if i want just one small thing or a large order !
neutral	i got a quote and it turned_out to be £_00 each for 00 of us to play .
neutral	i ' m just waiting for sky broadband ( the fast one ) to make it to my area and i ' ll be switching
positive	needed curtain hooks & purchased some at a local_store but needed more
neutral	the chair that was supposed to arrive next_day was re - scheduled for the saturday with dpd ( confirmation text received ).
positive	we have always booked through expedia when traveling to and within the us .
positive	when i was finally allowed to collect my parcel from their office , the staff there said they were very disappointed with their driver , which didn_'_t help me much at all !!!!
negative	?
neutral	quality of the products were good .
neutral	really great , easy way of getting a take out in a larger town , and im sure as the site develops more and more businesses will eventually post their menus etc .
neutral	placed the order on thursday and received the 0000 version on saturday .
positive	my order arrived in record time .
neutral	not impressed at all with the service , despite its fast arrival .
neutral	i received the products i ordered , all in one piece , in a secure package ( there were no leaks or stuff like that ).
neutral	fine , there '_s always room for progress , but in the case of ebay most changes generally seem to be worse_than the original .
neutral	an_alternative was offered , but at over twice the cost ( plus_vat ).
positive	it was no problem that the delivery address was different to the billing_address .
negative	there is no phone number for this company so consider the pitfalls when something does go_wrong .
neutral	tesco have an offer on at the moment , buy a 00 pack of coke and get 0p off a litre of fuel , use up to 0 0p off vouchers per fuel transaction .
negative	going to contact trading_standards and see what can be done about it .
positive	great to compare different hotels , hostels and etc .
negative	they will take your money and will not answer you .
positive	so if you if you find what you want on spartoo do not_hesitate to order from them , you will not be disappointed !!
positive	i ' m a returning customer time and time again . wouldn ' t go anywhere_else !
negative	i '_ll stick to sainsburys - never had a problem with them .
positive	also , the free return shipping is wonderful .
positive	you could not wish for a smoother transaction .
positive	many_thanks again regards paul morris
negative	pay peanuts , you get monkeys !
positive	everything i '_ve had from the site has_been fantastic .
positive	ordered online one day got it the next .
positive	i keep buying from brandoso - and keep looking - because the quality of its shoes and boots are fantastic .
negative	the lady on the phone tells_me i will receive it monday or tuesday , today ( tuesday ) it is still not here so i call the customer_service again , an 0000 number which doesn ' t come cheap on my mobile ( and i don ' t have landline ).
neutral	box 0 arrived on time with part of the desk .
negative	ok i think , come around first thing in the morn and that will be fine , we cant help bad traffic can we .
negative	total scam !!!
negative	what ?!
negative	isme you have no customer service !
negative	change of plane " i was told . we sent an_email to confirm this , no you didn_'_t . it appears that if you book too far in advance and a plane is changed they don_'_t inform you . its not good enough , we '_ve just had this with thomas_cook . but they charged us for them .
positive	ordered an xbox games and a phone cover for my iphone .
positive	thankyou guys :)
negative	i will check cctv , i am 00_% confident that no delivery was attempted .
negative	their website openly advertises the difference_between next_day ( 00h ) and two day ( 00h ) consignments on their inviting website , what they don ' t tell you is that if you pay a premium for a 00h service , you shouldn ' t apparently expect a next_day delivery .
neutral	however , the company '_s reputation is almost saved by the live help , very professional people , all female so far , who have all been helpful , friendly and done their absolute best in a clear and efficient manner .
positive	great genuine products at unbeatable_prices and free reliable delivery .
positive	but considering that there are many tools like that on internet i prefer hostelbookers because they have a good website with easy layout ( you can find almost all the information you need in the first screen , no need to open other windows most of the time ) and search_engines , the information is reliable and there are many reviews .
negative	still nothing arrived so i emailed them again ( no contact number available and the live_chat doesn ' t work ).
positive	when you order and order the correct no of items / wowcher codes you want its brilliant .
positive	p - price , most competitive on the web , includes postage so no_hidden_charges .
negative	they ignore emails , do not answer phones .
neutral	je leur dis dans le mail qu ' ils_ont perdu notre confiance , que c ' est dommage mais que_nous désirons le remboursement immédiat .
neutral	it seems they took the money from the university account without authorisation , and also without us sending some papers that were supposed to be necessary to book with a credit_card from a different person than the passenger .
positive	you can not buy it in stores , so i am always looking for the best deal .
negative	they will get away with it for now but long_term it is a recipe for disaster .
neutral	now they don ' t really offer any discount .
positive	after summiting we were met half way back to the camp by the waiters with orange juice .
positive	great service , thanks .
positive	c . clayton
neutral	sales simply not competent enough to listen and deliver the correct information .
neutral	i have purchased from pcspecialists for many_years and will_continue all in all still a good service but when building your_own computer on line they don_'_t tell you of any compatability issues in my case i had the rampage motherboard and cosmos 0 tower i added two usb 0 '_s to the front of the tower but was not informed that i would loose two out of 0 of my usb0 ports they are there but not working as they can '_t be attached to the motherboard ?
neutral	i reduced my limit voluntarily to £ 0 , 000 .
neutral	we ' ve just returned from a hen_weekend in liverpool and while the weekend was fab the week leading up to it was fairly stressful !!
positive	very easy to use site , great value and totally straightforward booking experience .
negative	we shall see !!
negative	on one hand they insist that kindles cannot be repaired and on the other insist that the tat they are trying to sell me is ' refurbished ' how does that work then
neutral	easy website to use and order arrived promptly but oh boy !
neutral	since i was at home , with my wife , the whole time i cannot see how somebody knocking at my door or ringing the bell would not get a response , especially as the room i was in faces my driveway .
negative	the person i was speaking to started being rude and was talking over me , i asked her not to do it and asked to be put to a supervisor .
positive	i have bought a few items from webtogs over the last 0 years .
positive	excellent value for money and fantastic customer service .
neutral	delivery took four days and the promised emails concerning date and time of delivery were not sent to me .
neutral	product arrived and it ' s ok . quite average craftsmanship .
positive	after_reading some negative_reviews of seatwave i was really worried that the tickets would not be there , or would be fake , as had happened to some people .
neutral	the flowers themselves were a present for my mums_birthday , she loved them and the bright colours , however as i was the one who saw them online i was a little disappointed with the size , very small for the price but like i say mum loved them and didn ' t know the difference !
neutral	the dishwasher was diabolical , it run for approximately 0 and half hours and the dishes were still not properly clean .
neutral	when i dropped_off the car as normal i take took a photo of the mileage before and after collection .
neutral	even the security personnel asked the ba staff lady to have a look at the footage , to which she declined to .
negative	very poor service
positive	so much_better_than trying to add drops to food or break tablets into food .
positive	if i hadn ' t of approched ets i would have been well and truly ripped_off by any and all of the other_companies i approached .
neutral	good , but i ' m jealous of the movie deals from orange at the moment
positive	the website there was one of the item i wanted , but got an_email the next_day to say there wasn_'_t actually any .
negative	scammers !
neutral	clearly used to just dumping items and clearing off .
neutral	huge problems getting in contact with the company and 00 day delivery time caused me a lot of worry - i honestly thought i ' d been_scammed .
neutral	not sure if viagogo can help here but i ordered the tickets in july & the event is in 0 weeks & i haven ' t heard_anything from them since .
negative	i found it for £_00 less at an on - line retailer that i ' d never used but thought that i ' d order it from dolphin because i ' d never had a problem with them and i trusted them .
neutral	next_day if i recall correctly .
positive	keep_up he good work viking signs .
neutral	maybe she was just having a bad day !
negative	what a scam !
negative	a long_story , cut short bought items jan_0000 parts missing , would not talk on phone , opened a ticket , took me until 00 / 00 /_0000 to get my cash_back , told blatent lies , tried every trick in the book not to refund me , agreed to pick goods up never did till 0 promised date , sent proof of refund lies never got it , had to email hundreds of times to get a reply , had to take a day off work to let them pick_up , now wont compensate me for my lost wages , will be putting up a website with all details of the problems with telephone and fax numbers plus phone numbers for all unhappy people who want to support me by telephoning and emailing them , will post here for all to see
negative	they quoted their own t &_c which state
negative	its too_late valentines has been and gone so the flowers are useless and the day has been ruined !
positive	fabulous !
negative	amount 000 . 00 - gbp
neutral	the worst part was that the smoking area was right outside the entrance so we had to run the gauntlet of smokers to get in / out - not what you want in your best clothes .
neutral	let_down badly by canvasprints online , i '_ll be looking for my money back .
neutral	after two_weeks with no news i rang to chase them up and was told the carrier cards were out of stock .
positive	the aftercare has_been exemplary , all appointments on time and by very professional people .
negative	the " interview " consisted of going through exactly the same details as i ' d already given the warranty shop .
positive	offer cheap clothes ( quality doesn_'_t matter when they are so cheap ).
neutral	animed delayed my order due to the otodex cream being out of stock , they should have refunded me straight_away for this item so that the cimicat kitten milk i also ordered could have been sent straight_away , i had to contact them a week_later to find out why my order still had not arrived , it was only then that they refunded me and sent the milk .
negative	just to add , it ' s been 0 weeks since them promising my refund within 00_hours and i have still not received it even after contacting them .
negative	they are a total load of bullshiters and shysters !!
positive	it cuts down on the high concentration of chemicals within the body and helps the environment not only with less packaging but with great advise and help to recycle what little packaging you do use in the process .
neutral	if only they could update their website and improve their distribution !!
neutral	after 0 days the pc developed a fault ( no fault of box . co . uk ), collection was arranged for the next working day .
positive	i could track it all the way .
neutral	sender also discussed issue with the delivery firm .
negative	i have now received an_email_saying that my order has_been cancelled and my " credit_card " has not been charged ?
neutral	the dressing_table stool , has now fallen to bits .
neutral	if their service was as good as their responding to poor reviews , then there would probably be no poor reviews !
neutral	i spent about 00_mins looking for the right person and it turned_out they had been wandering around not by the arrivals exit and they only had an a0 clipboard which had multiple other logos on too , so was not easily identifiable .
negative	work overpriced ( more_than double local companies ), engineers did not turn_up ( i waited more_than 0 weeks and they missed four appointments ) and they were extremely rude when they did actualy contact me .
positive	they came quickly and i would have no reservations_about recommending workwear_express to other_companies .
negative	they refused to return them , as they had been " recycled responsibly ".
negative	when things go right with paypal its pretty good , as soon as it goes_wrong though you find that all paypals promises are just lies and loads of extra terms kick in to protect them and make them even more money but give you no protection at all .
positive	ordered monday , delivered thursday .
negative	once they ' ve taken your money , they will not be any help to you .
negative	at that time the time limit for unlock was 00 business days .
neutral	i had to make a number of calls to check their progress and in fact check - in had closed by the time i reached the counter .
negative	this company is absolutely_useless run by a load of cowboys why people don_'_t use royal_mail more often is beyond me and out of all the alternatives this lot of morons are the worst even worse_than yodel would you believe and they are rude with it , if i could give them half a star i would , had i known my amazon order was coming through them i ' d have paid extra for royal_mail , but at_least i know next time , ovoid this company at all costs .

neutral	they even know our sale had completed until a week after the fact !
positive	finally silicone cooking tongs these are so easy to use !
neutral	i firmly believe this was the fault of city_link ( who are total p00p ).
negative	and even then , it wasn ' t even hot , just luke warm .
negative	quite a horrible experience but now waiting to hear back from them .
negative	in addition i was not compensated for the cost of this trip .
