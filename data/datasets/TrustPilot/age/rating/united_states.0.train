negative	mind you i am calling from an iphone 0 that i never have problems with .
negative	then she has the audacity to ask me to call her back due to the bad connection .
negative	wtf !!!
negative	i finally got her to write down my phone_number to call me back .
negative	of course 0 hours_later i hadn ' t heard anything .
negative	then i called back and after waiting for 00 minutes and not being_able to handle the alarm sound anymore i hung_up .
negative	highly encourage anyone thinking of using this site to think_twice about their decision .
negative	still_waiting for my refund ... wont hold my breath .
negative	truly the worst customer_service / difficult company i have ever had to work with ever .
negative	we were booking with another couple ( but on two_separate computers because we wanted to pay separately but get on the same flight ).
negative	once we had both filled_out our traveller info and credit info and hit buy tickets , we were very confused as to whether or not the tickets were actually booked .
negative	we didnt receive the confirmation_email and when we viewed our receipt online it showed_up with the other couples ' traveller info ( names , bday , etc ) charged to our credit_card .
negative	we spent close to an_hour on the phone ( mostly on hold with a service rep who wasn ' t listening ) to find out what had happened ( which they could not explain how these data paths crossed ) and to cancel the flight .
negative	needless to say with this breach of information we booked with orbitz and had no funny business .
negative	i was trying to change my flight return date which took them 00 minutes to understand what i wanted to do after being hung_up on once .
negative	after waiting for them to contact me back ( twice ringing the wrong number to whatt i gave them ) i am told that it is going to cost me an_additional 00pounds to change it .
negative	after looking online the flight was only 00pounds to book it all again letalone just to change the flight that i have already paid for .
negative	trying to book another person onto the same flight takes them 00 + minutes for them to turn_around and say it was unsuccessful and to book it myself online ( at 00ppm not acceptable !!!!)
negative	i will never use this company to book any flights again and would not reccomend anyone_else to do so either .
negative	i order 00th dec . iphone 0 ( at & t ).
negative	i ' m waiting for unlock .
negative	i order 0 weeks_ago for my iphone 0 . and i ' m received full_refund today . guide say the at & t iphone services suspended world wide .
negative	please do not order this web site . west of time
negative	ok ... so i ordered over £_000 worth of isme products , the delivery was super quick but half the goods werent great quality and i was extremely disappointed to find that when i phoned up isme to sort out the 00 %_off i hadnt managed to retrieve because of my bad connection ... they tried to tell me its not 00 %_off first time customers , its £_00 off your first £_00 ...
negative	i know what i can see thank_you very much so dont try telling me i can see something else .
negative	in the end i kept two products for covienience and wrote an_email to them for proof of what is on my samsung_galaxy
negative	screen but the connection was also bad it wouldnt send so i left it at that and can honestly_say im much happier with very and paying p & p on call of duty_black_ops_0 ... whats that about !
negative	its not a big product and should be eligible for collect +!!!
negative	!
negative	i would like to start off this true review by highlighting the positives first and then i share my extremely bad_experience with this company .
negative	after using high_street opticians i thought it was time i considered the online marketplace as advances in internet technology coupled with high consumer demand especially on the uk platform of ecommerce and secure_payment facilities , maybe i needed to change the way i purchased my spectacles .
negative	after surfing many different optician websites i came_across directsight and was immediately drawn into the website design ; sleek , professional looking , easy to navigate and most_importantly they advertise the right products at great prices .
negative	it ’ s also worth mentioning they are a uk based company and production in the uk too so this was the icing on the cake for me .
negative	i found a pair of spectacles and placed an order under their 0 for 0 offer .
negative	great value i thought !
negative	well …. thats where things turn sour in terms of my customer experience .
negative	fully aware that my particular order would take 00 working days as with the majority of online opticians on like - for - like spectacles the main issue i have with them is their service ( or lack of ):
negative	0 .
negative	as a general consumer it can be perfectly appreciated why it would be common courtesy to call your supplier for a simple update on the progress of your order being that completion is estimated approx 0 weeks for a product they have in stock and will be produced in a uk lab .
negative	i called after 0 working days to be specifically told my order would take between 0 – 00 working days to complete .
negative	( fair_enough we ’ re still within the 00 working day period but my order should be completed early – nice ).
negative	0 .
negative	after 00 working days had past i still remained optimistic and contacted them on the 00th working day to ask whether i would receive my order by the 00th working day .
negative	they were very evasive in their comms and could not therefore guarantee anything .
negative	0 .
negative	on the 00nd working day i received two emails ; 0 an_email informing_me that my order was complete and scheduled to be dispatched within 00 hours and another to confirm dispatch had taken place …. wait here ’ s another issue …. they were only dispatching one of the two_pairs of glasses , to which i queried and they flippantly replied that one was ready before the other and i would receive another dispatch email for that one .
negative	0 .
negative	my order is over £_00 and so qualifies for a next_day delivery so i thought – finally with relief at_least i will receive something from them .
negative	at the same time i questioned why they would split my order and send me two_separate next_day delivery parcels – it just doesn ’ t make any sense .
negative	0 .
negative	00hrs after receiving the dispatch email i have not received anything from them .
negative	they have ignored my emails to them , cut me off over the telephone and have today ( 00th working day ) totally ignored and disregarded their unreasonable actions and haven ’ t explained what ’ s gone wrong or apologised for their errors .
negative	i just keep my fingers_crossed after having my patience severly tested , that i recieve my full order in time as the products themselves are what i am really need .
negative	we ' ve ordered twice from groupon and both times we have been severely disappointed .
negative	the first order was for 0 x dehumidifiers .
negative	we had no communication to let us know that they had been dispatched and then when one of them finally arrived 00 days_later , we were left wondering when or if the second would turn arrive .
negative	i called groupon customer services to query ( if you want to waste an_hour of your life , call the groupon customer_service line !)
negative	the girl i spoke to on the phone would not confirm whether 0 or 0 had been sent .
negative	i told her my parcel said 0 of 0 so could only assume that only 0 had been sent .
negative	she asked me to wait a couple of days for the second one to turn up , so i did and no luck .
negative	i called back and requested a refund .... only to be told that they couldn ' t refund my card , but could offer me the funds back in groupon credit !
negative	a few_months_later and we saw a pair of ballerina pump shoes in a snake skin purple / pink metallic print , with 00 %_off .... who could pass up this opportunity !
negative	so we decided to give groupon a second chance ....( famous last words !)
negative	the shoes took around a week to arrive .... fair_enough but yet again , no notification that they had been dispatched .
negative	when we received the item , the shoes were 0 different colours !
negative	one was purple / pink and the other was green / yellow !
negative	we have learned our lesson - the deals may be great but the customer_service , delivery and general operations of this business are dire !
negative	for the sake of a saving , i ' d_rather spend a bit more and receive a good service than waste any more time with groupon !
negative	fast shipping when you order small .
negative	i just ordered $_000 worth of supplements 00 days_ago and still don ' t have a tracking_number .
negative	between me and my brother we spend at_least $ 0000 a year on supplements and seriously thinking about shopping elsewhere like bodybuilding . com .
negative	i rather spend the extra money and get my stuff on time stress free .
negative	very disappointed with supplement_warehouse .
negative	i have bought tens of games before from several stores , but this is the first time to have this issue .
negative	waiting for a refund , hopefully they wont scam the money out of it
negative	dont deal with this website
negative	the customer_service of expedia is terrible !
negative	if you run_into problems they will not help you at all .
negative	after 0 hours on the phone talking to 0 different people , all i got was the phone_number for the airline ' s customer_service people !
negative	i have traveled using expedia several_times before .
negative	this was the 0st time i needed to use their 0 - 000 number .
negative	my flight was canceled due to weather .
negative	i called their number to find a solution .
negative	the agent on the other end told me that they would cancel my ticket if i found another flight .
negative	i found another flight and called back .
negative	after waiting on hold with the agent for 0 hours , i was told that , because of the inclement weather , i needed to call back the next_day before noon .
negative	i double checked to make_sure that this would not be too_late to cancel , but was assured that it would be fine .
negative	however , the next_morning when i called at 0 am , i was told that it was too_late and that my original flight had been re scheduled .
negative	i was on the phone with the person for 0 / 0 an_hour explaining things before my new flight took off and i had to hang_up .
negative	once i was back in cell service , i called the number again .
negative	this time i was told their system was down and that i would have to call them back in 0 hours .
negative	when i called them back i was on the phone again for another 0 hours until i was finally told that at no time could they have canceled the flight and that i should have contacted the airline directly right_away !
negative	when i pointed out that i had talked to 0 other people and none of them communicated this to me , i was told that they were sincerely sorry and that the people would be dealt_with , but that there was still nothing they could do for me !
negative	i will never use expedia for another flight .
negative	with all of the options out there , you can do better_than this site .
negative	i was afraid of the quality but my cousin said she ordered shoes before and loved them so i gave it a shot .
negative	i ordered wedge sneakers and i actually loved them the day they came !
negative	until i put them on walked up the stairs the and the latches broke .
negative	granted yes i was given a refund for the shoes .... just the shoes ... that i never even got to wear ... sorry but that credit can sit in my account for as long as it wants i am not paying another 00 dollars in shipping for another pair to break .
negative	waste of money sorry .
negative	they do not stock what they sell - they drop ship , so stay_away , their site is not always up to date .
negative	claimed item in stock , only to be told 0 days_later they don ' t have .
negative	a waste of time and a loss of money to them !!
negative	!
negative	stay_away !
negative	game used to be great but started awful in 0000 but i manage with them until last_year i decided gave up with them because staffs is slow , price is too high for pre_- owned ( weird price almost like to new copy or even preorder price !!)
negative	and again price is way too high and higher .
negative	i had problem with their order website because parcel lost and didn ' t posted me and returned to game from royal_mail and i didn ' t received 0 preordered games before or on day of released so arrived week_later .
negative	parcel lost and games not arrived home week after released that big problems last_year this why i decided use shopto . net and amazon . co . uk after all !!!
negative	i never and never touch game ever again but just trade in games for money that all i care for game .
negative	:)
negative	shame game used to be great before again .
negative	j ’ ai passé ma commande le 00 mars et presqu ’ un mois plus tard je_n ’ ai toujours pas reçu mes lunettes de soleil .
negative	easylunettes a répondu à mon premier e_- mail , mais pas le deuxième ni le troisième .
negative	easylunettes m ’ a dit il y a deux semaines que « nous estimons qu ’ il faudra 0 à 00 jours supplémentaires pour que votre produit nous arrive .
negative	» et « soyez assurée que nous continuons d ’ insister quotidiennement auprès de nos fournisseurs afin qu ’ ils nous livrent votre modèle .
negative	dès que nous recevons plus de nouvelles de_la part de notre fournisseur , nous vous contacterons immédiatement par courriel .
negative	».
negative	je_n ’ ai aucune nouvelle .
negative	first time buying from this site and completely regret it !!!
negative	the only_thing i didn ' t have a problem with was the shipping because i actually received the product before the estimated shipping date .
negative	but , of course the actual product was horrible !
negative	0 .
negative	site description of the material was completely off !
negative	0 .
negative	picture on the site was also different from the actual item .
negative	0 .
negative	buttons were not even sowed on .. they were tied on -.-
negative	i bought this bed bath and beyond card on saturday at 0pm and wondered when i was gonna get my gift_card code .
negative	i checked my email because i wanted to go to the vendor soon and buy something .
negative	i called the " customer_service " number and asked [_name ] when i would receive my code and she_said it was a weekend and it might be as long as monday .
negative	she_said the bank info needed to be processed first .
negative	but then said i had already been charged but i might not receive the code until monday because they are low on staff .
negative	why can the staff process my $ but not give me the code immediately .
negative	thats a scam .
negative	we have enough staff to process but not to give you the code you need is what essentially is the response .
negative	you can tell what the priority of giftcards . com , and it is definitely not the customer , but their $.
negative	if i buy discounted gift_cards on line again i will not be using giftcards . com .
negative	if you care you will respond to this complaint at clintmmartin @_gmail . com .
negative	i then wanted to cancel the gift_card with [_name ] if i wasn ' t going to receive the code today , she then said it would take 0 - 0 business days to cancel ( but you can get my $ so quickly , hmm ).
negative	well , i might as_well wait for the code now and instead of getting this done on a weekend i will have to wait_until the weekday when i work .
negative	you guys need some serious work , i would love to tell about yall on social_media .
negative	this is now the second time i order a game from cjs and they fail to deliver .
negative	i dont understand how a company can afford to be so incompetent with so much competition on the market .
negative	i guess they don ' t want to stay in buisness for too long .
negative	they don ' t respond to mails .
negative	their support system is broken .
negative	they send duplicated keys ( same key to multiple people ).
negative	they claim to have keys in stock when they in fact do not .
negative	do not give your money to this shady company .
negative	the low price is not worth it , and there are other_companies on the market who sell their products just as cheap .
negative	edit_: you can always make excuses for your incompetence , but the bottom_line is that you made a promise which you defaulted on , or in other words , displayed incompetence .
negative	blizzard not delivering the game boxes is not my problem .
negative	i do not import the game .
negative	i do not claim to be able to supply anyone_who_wants with a cd_key .
negative	that is what you do .
negative	it is your job and your responsibility to make_sure it happens , not mine .
negative	you can not place the burden of service on the customer .
negative	that is a degenerate attitude of doing_business and like i said , i do not expect you to remain a business for too long .
negative	not only that but i see no excuses for why keys were duplicated , why you do not respond to mails , and why your support system is broken .
negative	do you not even try to relieve yourself of guilt on these matters ?
negative	have you accepted your level of service as " pathetic "?
negative	or worse , do you think your customers will accept this level of service ?
negative	ok so they left me two sorry we missed you slips on my door , when just the day before i talked to one of thair rep to make_sure they would not miss me again after the rep told me they would drop my box after 0 : 00 they showed_up at 0 : 00 i call and was told i needed to pay for the service wtf so i had to dtive to the other side of town to pick_up something they messed_up .
negative	also i have a fedex office 0 mins from my house they would not leave it there i could have drove to the west coast and picked_up my box myself .
negative	i will never use fedex again i will be blogging about this also i ' m sure i ' m not the only one to have this problem .
negative	we purchased a chain saw and was told it would be delivered in the week commencing 00th may .
negative	it was actually delivered a week early which meant by the time we were home to look at it the 0 days for a refund had already passed .
negative	when we put the chainsaw together it was faulty so we contacted ukhs and were told someone would call us back , after 0 hours we called again and were told the same thing and after a further 0 hours we called again and were yet again told someone would call , no one did .
negative	on saturday we called again and was told someone would call us back and after 0 hours no one had ( yet again ) so we called again and was told the people we would need to speak to would probably have gone home so we should call back on monday .
negative	i then logged a dispute with paypal as i had purchased the item with paypal and on monday was called by a very rude man who said he wanted to sort out the issue and had the cheek to say we should have called before setting up a dispute on paypal and then accused us of lying about the previous calls because in his words " he can ' t see why the message wouldn ' t have been passed on "
negative	the man was most unhelpful and told us we needed to send the item back or he wouldn ' t do anything ( which we obviously would have done but paypal were now dealing_with the matter so we waited for them to tell us to do so )
negative	paypal favoured me in the dispute and finally gained my money back however the service from ukhs was extremely rude and unhelpful , they are interested in selling and nothing else so if you do decide to purchase with them ( which i wouldn ' t recommend ) then you will need to hope your items aren ' t faulty as they definitely won ' t assist you in returning the item .

negative	paypal policy leave big loop holes for scammers to take_advantage of .
negative	it lets paypal not take any responsibility whatsoever .
negative	even paypal claim it ' s safe , don ' t worry we will take_care of your money .
negative	00 dollar down the drain , that ' s all , and paypal suck .
negative	i hope you learn from this .
negative	i brought a 0ft pool table off this company ' uk sport imports ', the first one arrived broken , they replaced it with yet again another broken table .
negative	they blamed it on the courier , there is no way a courier could have broken the table , the wood was warped by damp and considerably cracked across the centre and side bars .
negative	i have had no apology from the company , the manager would not even talk to me ' too busy '!!!!!
negative	they told me they could not pick it up straight_away and would not give me a refund until they did .
negative	they promised to pick it up after xmas , i rang them after xmas to ask when it would be picked_up , i was then told that the warehouse was closed until the 0nd week in january so would not be picked_up until then so i could not have my refund !!!
negative	again no apology and the manager refused to come to the phone .
negative	i am disgusted with the customer_service and products from this company and will never use them again .
negative	god knows when i will get my refund or an_apology .
negative	it has spoilt my partners christmas as you can imagine and mine .
negative	where to begin ...
negative	0 ) lack of communication .
negative	they dont answer emails or return phonecalls .
negative	0 ) they short shipped my order .
negative	still_waiting for my dextrose which i ordered in december .
negative	they are not replying my emails or phonecalls .
negative	i guess i lost the money .
negative	kristian
negative	i shopped with beautybay recently .
negative	after more than 0 weeks i still_haven ' t received my package , and they said it takes 0 - 00 working days for us orders .
negative	i tried to contact them so many_times ... no responses ever .
negative	i filed a dispute with my credit_card and they refunded my money .
negative	will never ever shop with them again and will never recommend this site to anyone !
negative	extremely disappointed !
negative	i ' ve been eating kfc for as long as i can remember .
negative	i always enjoyed their food over other fast food companies .
negative	i loved their chicken pot pies .
negative	they didn ' t get my order right one day when i went through the drive thru .
negative	the order was way off , and i did not want to eat what i had been given and i didn ' t have time to go back .
negative	i tried to call the local number on the receipt and was greeted with a this number is disconnected message .
negative	so i visited their website and sent an_email to the address they had listed describing what happened and asking for some coupons for compensation .
negative	i got no response .
negative	i sent them a second email which wasn ' t so nice , and got no response again .
negative	i ' ve been boycotting kfc ever since and don ' t plan on returning with my company credit_card .
negative	i made two purchases on 0 / 0 / 00 and 0 / 0 / 00 and still have not received .
negative	i made one other purchases on 0 / 00 / 00 ( so it hascompleted the maximum period of 0 weeks for delivery requested by the website ).
negative	why did it happened ?
negative	så sent som i sidste uge , forsøgte jeg at købe_en htc one s hos 0 .
negative	jeg_ringede op_til kundeservice for at få nogle ting på plads , og her blev jeg modtaget med positiv og varm attitude ( ikke så mærkeligt når intentionen er at købe ).
negative	tingene var som de skulle_være , og jeg_ville modtage min nye smartphone i løbet af 0 - 0 dage .
negative	desværre skulle det ikke gå så vel ...
negative	jeg modtager et_par dage_efter en mail der beskylder mig for tidligere at være dårlig betaler og jeg_kan derfor ikke købe min smartphone medmindre jeg lægger et depositum på 0000 kr .
negative	dette_er selvfølgelig ikke i min interesse , da det ganske enkelt ikke er forbundet med at købe_en_ny telefon .
negative	nu tænker i sikkert " her har vi bare en fyr , der_er gal i skralden over , at han ikke får lov at købe_en telefon , fordi 0 har opdaget hans dårlige økonomi og lave kreditværdighed ".
negative	til det_kan jeg garantere jer for , at jeg aldrig har_haft kreditklammeri med noget eller nogen - hvilket også var grunden til at jeg_ringede til kundeservice igen ...
negative	efter en lang snak med en kundeservicemedarbejder der_ikke kunne give mig et bare lidt konkret svar , men som derimod blev ved at sværme vagt om , at jeg var_blevet vurderet som dårlig betaler og_så videre , bad jeg ham ringe og få dommen specificeret .
negative	svaret , jeg til_sidst endte op med , var , at jeg var_blevet vurderet uegnet som kunde grundet min alder og min bopæl .
negative	utroligt men sandt .
negative	jeg udelader intet .
negative	min bopæl ( nørre allé , 0000 aarhus c ) og min alder ( 00 år ).
negative	jeg er rasende på en virksomhed med så arrogant og fordomsfuld en holdning til_deres kundeskare .
negative	de har ingen interesse i at hjælpe den enkelte og deres grad af serviceminding er en fucking joke .
negative	jeg udfordrer jer til at give mig en_god forklaring herinde 0 !
negative	this site is used by people_who want independent info on a company , however the company reviewed can get trustpilot to alter the review if it doesn ' t like what is said .
negative	i gave a review which also mentioned my experience with other_companies for comparison , this was edited which i find outrageous .
negative	if you read or write a review one would expect comparisons as that is what we review against - our own experiences .
negative	by not mentioning the alternative names we could just be plucking opinions out of thin air !
negative	i imagine this happens to a lot of reviews and therefore i do not trust this site at all and would encourage others to exercise extreme caution .
negative	sent a parcel via this company through p0d .
negative	the pick_up time was great and everything looked like it went well .
negative	until the parcel was received by my friend .
negative	they say they use ' machines ' so make_sure you parcel is strong and secure which i did .
negative	the box had a big rip in and most of the items i sent which were secure were smashed to pieces !
negative	also i wasn ' t impressed with the tracking service which suggested my parcel had been sat in a van for hours .
negative	not really what i ' d expect from £_00 + secure postage !
negative	finally got my money back because of p0d but this took 0 months because the wouldn ' t reply to emails or send forms back !
negative	the only_thing that was good was the time it took to deliver the item ... but when it ' s been smashed to pieces that ' s not much to rave about
negative	purchased a tablet pc from them for $_00 . 00 payed via_paypal .
negative	item finally arrived 0 weeks_later it was not as_described ( no rear camera ) smashed due to poor packaging and had a non uk power supply .
negative	tried to raise an rma request via website but kept telling me my order number was invalid .
negative	contacted them via the messaging facility .
negative	after sending them photo evidence , and about 00 messages they refused to give a refund unless i shipped the item back to them tracked at my expense this was more than 00 % of the cost of the item .
negative	contacted paypal who also insisted that i return the item at my cost before a refund could be issued .
negative	they also pay people to post positive_reviews
negative	i contacted the toll free number to book a room at the country inn and suites in clarksville , tn .
negative	the hotel was booked so the gentleman i spoke to told me he could book me in the same type of room at the candlewood inn and suites .
negative	when we got the hotel ( after driving for 00hrs with an 00yr old and 00 month old ) i was informed that i was booked in a queen suite not a king suite and none of the rooms had the sofa sleeper i had requested .
negative	after about 00_mins of trying to get everything straightened out my family and i ended_up going down the road and staying at another hotel chain .
negative	i was very disappointed in all the miscommunication .
negative	the only_thing that was done right was my money being refunded back to my charge card .
negative	nous avons commandé un canapé il y a 0 mois , soit disant " en stock " et livrable sous 00 jours .
negative	a date , soit 0 mois après la commande , non seulement celle - ci est toujours en statut " ouvert " ( et non pas " en préparation ", ni " en cours d ' expédition "), mais nous avons également été débités de_la somme de 000_euros .
negative	après avoir envoyé plusieurs mails restés sans réponse , nous avons enfin réussi à joindre une personne , parlant très mal le français , et argumentant qu ' elle ne savait pas où en était notre commande car il y aurait actuellement une panne dans leur système d ' information .
negative	donc elle ne pouvait pas nous indiquer ni de délai , ni de possibilité de remboursement .
negative	attendre n ' est pas le souci , le souci c ' est : cette entreprise est - elle réellement fiable et sera - t - on réellement livrés de quelquechose un jour ou seulement délestés de plusieurs centaines d ' euros en contrepartie de ... rien ?
negative	!
negative	nous sommes a priori loin d ' être les seuls et nous sommes laissés abuser par l ' aspect professionnel du site alors qu ' à priori tous les commentaires retrouvés sur les sites d ' avis nous indiquent le même type de problèmes chez un grand nombre de personnes ayant acheté sur ce site .
negative	de là à croire que cette fameuse " panne du système d ' information " dure depuis plusieurs années ..... ce site ne respecte pas ses propres conditions générales de vente , réfléchissez donc à 0 fois avant de leur passer une commande et posez vous la question de savoir si vous ne préférez pas faire un don à une association humanitaire .
negative	au moins votre argent aura servi à quelque chose .
negative	vision express have been absolutely awful .
negative	i have truly never received worse service in my life .
negative	i have been waiting three_weeks for a pair of single vision glasses that i was promised would be ready in one week , then in two , then in three and still no sign .
negative	after phoning both the store i ordered from and the national customer services number , i have received all_sorts of contradicting stories that other reviews have said are vision express stock lines used to fob off customers .
negative	i never expected to be treated like this by a high_street brand .
negative	shocked !
negative	needless to say , i will never shop with them again .

negative	hello friends ,
negative	dont ever order any thing from this website , these people are cheaters .
negative	have placed the order 00 days back till now they havent deliverd my goods eiher they wont reply to the mail .
negative	in there online tracking system they updated that item has been shipped through aramax but there is no tracking_number for that .
negative	i lost my money . so better dont order any thing from this website these poeple are cheaters .
negative	0 days_ago i bought the game call of duty_black_ops for steam , recieved an image with they key fairly quickly , but when i tried using it ..
negative	steam told me that key had already been used .
negative	i opened up a ticket right_away about this since i couldn ' t activate the product in steam .
negative	it ' s been 0 days since this and i still_haven ' t heard anything from the support center .
negative	since the support center ignores me i have now demanded my money back from the service i used to pay for this game and just have to wait and see what happens .
negative	this is really unaccaptable to just be ignored when recieving a faulty product and just take the money .
negative	i will never use this homepage again and if possible i would have given this homepage - 00 stars !
negative	there is only 0 star i can rate but i don ' t want to rate them in 0 star though .
negative	i purchased travel insurance with my ticket .
negative	all i asked was for the policy documentation which is required by finland embassy showing what is covered under my insurance policy .
negative	i got insurance policy number with my itinerary but there is no such a detail which suffice the need of embassy .
negative	i called to the customer_service and what they do is keep on transferring call for more than 0 hour .
negative	if they can ' t handle one simple documentation process then you guys can figure what the hell it will be for other issues .
negative	i am done never ever ever gonna use this .
negative	first off i ' m american and i had previously used this site to unlock my htc one x and now i hav another htc but by a different provider now i looked through this site to make_sure my phone was compatible .
negative	i tried really hard to find out what type of phone i had seeing as how i bout it off the street .
negative	it ' s clean !
negative	and the seller didn ' t know the name so i looked and looked for a beats audio htc by verizon and piped up the sensation xe .
negative	so the xe dose not appear on the list of phones they can ' t unlock but also don ' t appear on the list they can unlock .
negative	although they have the option to search for a phone that dose not appear on the unlock able list .
negative	so i buy the code and enter my eime number and they send me a code but it don ' t work .
negative	yah know they stated i am in the wrong and won ' t even give me back my ten dollars .....
negative	sorry ass ppl
negative	ive been ordering from fommy for a year or so !
negative	the first experience was fine .
negative	the second time i was sent a cover that was different from the one shown .
negative	on complaining they said that they never promised the same print on the cover as long as the cover was the same and it fit .
negative	since it was for 000 bucks i let the matter go .
negative	recently i ordered another cover for my blackberry , and they sent me one for a different model .
negative	on complaining they asked me to first send pictures .
negative	then i had to pay for shipping to send it back , which for a month they kept saying they haven ' t received .
negative	on showing them the shipping receipt they " suddenly " found it but till date no return of either cash or cover has been made .
negative	i keep getting told " its under process " i dont care abt the 0000 plus bucks i have spent , i ' ll consider a donation to the poor but its the attitude that is so upsetting !
negative	extremely dissatisfied with the company and specifically becky s .
negative	i ordered these glasses on 0 / 00 / 00 through sears storefront .
negative	i never received the glasses i ordered and was asked if i wanted another color and was threatened to have to pay a 00 % cancellation_fee if i canceled the order at this point .
negative	i chose to go with another color .
negative	i never received the other color .
negative	i was told a day before the next color was due that they were also out of this color .
negative	this company actually tried to purchase glasses back from me ( which were never delivered in the first place ).
negative	i wouldn ' t have any confidence that this company actually delivers new product .
negative	after i never received the order becky offered to pay for the glasses if i could find them elsewhere online .
negative	through this process becky mocked me , the customer , and was overall very discourteous belittling other_companies which outperformed her own .
negative	as expected i have not received this payment and upon 0 follow_up email requests for this payment , in which i was never less_than courteous , was threatened to be reported to " austin pd " for harassment .
negative	based on good reviews , i ended_up paying £_00 for 0 months of coverage .
negative	towards the end of my policy i wrote asking for a 0 day extension to the policy as my homebound flight had changed ...
negative	i expected that i would be charged a pro rata rate for the extra days .
negative	alas no , i was quoted £_00 for the extra for days .
negative	as it turns_out they were unable to simply extend my policy , they needed to issue me a new one for the extra days for which there was a minimum policy cost .
negative	via customer services i asked for an explanation to this ridiculous policy or for someone to contact me to discuss .
negative	unfortunately the person i spoke to was either unable or unwilling and i ' ve been left with the generic customer complains number instead .
negative	so beware .
negative	i order some flowers for my mum and my mother in law for mothers_day and i thought it was horrible as when they got delivered they were chucked on the floor and the delivery driver was gone !
negative	when i got them they were half dead and had to throw them the next_morning , i am very unsatisfied with this
negative	i also got charged extra for another lot of flowers i didnt even order
negative	i recently bought sim_city limite edition .
negative	when im activating it , its say cdkey used .
negative	i was contact support before and they replying .
negative	they stop reply me after im talk about used cdkey .
negative	bad support .
negative	sorry .
negative	i have used several sites like this in the past and had no troubles at all , so when i ordered something from these_guys i was not expecting the hassle i ended_up with , after a 00 minite wait for my code i got a little note saying payement was decline .
negative	this made no sense as i knew i had sufficiant funds to make the transaction so i logged into my bank to see that the money had been taken anyway ( this was confirmed by the bank advisor i spoke too ) could be an honest mistake so i phone them .
negative	this is when i was told that i failed thier security check - this is odd as i have lived at the same address since 0000 i work full time , have a credit_card etc i was born and raised in england plus had the same email address for over a decade .
negative	of course they wouldnt tell me how i failed the checks but the fact they still took the money is unacceptable , if im no good my moneys no good and now i cant use the money elsewhere because its gone until they return it 0 - 0 days they say .
negative	a complete joke of a company .
negative	there are many sites like this and my advise is to use one of them to avoid anything like this happening to you .
negative	fraudsters !
negative	even if by a miracle i do receive my tickets , i will never use this company again !
negative	i have to change the return dates few_times so far .
negative	in 0000 , i changed two tickets with united_airlines and paid only about $_000 each including changing fee .
negative	this year in may , i book a ticket with travelocity but was able to change it with united_airlines and paid only $_000 .
negative	but now , they changed they changed something that i didn ' t know and i couldn ' t use the confirmation code to change it with united_airlines anymore .
negative	i had to go through travelocity and paid $_000 for changing a return date .
negative	when i called , emailed asking them about it , all they said was they didn ' t get any money , just the airline did but i didn ' t buy it .
negative	it ' s not in the high season , it ' s not long ago that i changed the return date for exact_same flight .
negative	the only difference was last time it shown up in my bill the airlines charging it and this time it was travelocity ....
negative	i been a customer with travelocity for so long but now i ' m dissapointed ....
negative	the broadband service we had had since renewing our contract has been terrible , went from having 000mb to 00mb !
negative	0 fix dates been and gone , no e_- mails no phone_calls , when i contact technical support they dont even want to know what the ref number is .
negative	they just want to stick to their " iam a thick agent " script .
negative	i would advise avoiding this company like a bargepole .
negative	i did not received my order .
negative	it has been pass 0 - 0 working days after day of dispatch date 00 nov 0000 .
negative	as of 00 dec 0000 , i have contacted the local postal they are not holding my parcel .
negative	my address is correct on my order .
negative	i have never had any_problems with receiving items local or internationally to my current address .
negative	i am very displeased with beauty bays international service .
negative	i am hoping to be refunded .
negative	if you are an international buyer do not choose saver .
negative	saver delivery is free but i would strongly_recommend international buyers to use the tracked delivery .
negative	been waiting for this game for ages and pre ordered it .
negative	it still has not arrived .
negative	i have bought two tickets to the barcelona vs ac milan game in less_than two_weeks and still have not even received confirmation about the tickets being sent .!!
negative	as i will be travelling to spain i need these tickets before i leave this is a disgrace and with all the reviews i don ' t know what is going on !
negative	my id is 0000000
negative	apparently the code for battlefield_0 they gave_me was not real , and ea themselves stated that the retailer you have purchased the game have generated the illegal key .
negative	so now i am out 00_bucks , because cjs -_cdkeys . com generated an illegal key and gave it to me , great real awesome , if i could 0 starts would be the way to go
negative	i had to cancel my flight , so i called in and told them about that .
negative	they said that they could return dkk 0000 out of my dkk 0000 plane_ticket .
negative	that was all fine , but after a week i hadn ' t received any money , so i e_- mailed them and asked them .
negative	they then said that they could only return dkk 000 instead .
negative	i then had a long e_- mail exchange with them , where they often didn ' t answer for more than a week .
negative	in the end , they found out that they could only give me the dkk 000 .
negative	i will never use expedia again .
negative	this is the worst customer_service i have ever received , and i am very disappointed .
negative	there are other_places that offer cheap tickets too .
negative	find them , and use them instead .
negative	me foi passado o numero de rastreamento , porém não consigo rastrear meu_produto . já enviei 0 e_- mail querendo alguma satisfação e nenhum deles me foi respondido . lamentável , recomendo não comprarem e evitar estresse pois o barato saiu caro
negative	still_waiting for a response from the company to see if they are going to refund since i did not even watch the game because they delivered the wrong seats .
negative	i already talked to many people at tennis match and they are going to follow_up .
negative	i hope they are honest and see their mistake .
negative	i will let everyone know the outcome .
negative	ich_habe eine erinnerungsuhr für demenzkranke bestellt .
negative	da bei dem model die vibration kaum merkbar war , habe_ich die uhr nach absprache zurückgesendet .
negative	ich_habe die erste bestellung per vorkasse gezahlt und_die zweite auch .
negative	nun behauptet rakuten , das geld sei nie angekommen , obwohl es ganz klar auf dem kontoauszug ersichtlich , überwiesen wurde .
negative	außerdem ging die_ware ursprünglich erst raus , nachdem das geld eingegangen ist .
negative	es ist eine frechheit mit solchen mitteln zu versuchen geld zu unterschlagen .
negative	( die uhr ist_für meinen kranken vater der selbst kaum noch geld hat !!)
negative	finger weg von rakuten . de !!!
negative	!
negative	i bought a bike , they withdrawed my money , after a week of not hearing anything from them i tried to contact them , just to find out that my bike is ' nt in stock !
negative	after about a month of annoying slow correspondence with them i finally get my bike , and now im struggling to get 00 pounds out of them which i have in writing that they will transfer and they do owe me .
negative	my ultimate game card doesn ' t work my tickets are being answered by a machine and overall i wasted money on this **** ive sent my picture didnt get a respond its about to get 0pm mountain time or whatever the fuck they said and now either im not going to get the help i want because apparently the managers are there from 0am - 0pm .
negative	dont buy from this site horrible customer support and yet there product keys dont work smh huge waste of time ..
negative	no fulfillment of my order - the gave_me a " refund ' with no explanation whatsoever .
negative	no support , no message about why - just a refund .
negative	they ' re shipping_costs are outrageous , and they ' re high score on this site is fabricated because they offer a free spot in a drawing if you post a good review ... isn ' t that kinda ...
negative	cheating ?
negative	?
negative	will be going back to my old supplement supplier ( the biggest one on the net - you can probably guess who ).
negative	they aren ' t perfect either - but they ' re actually cheaper most of the time , without the outrageous shipping that this company charges .
negative	really hard to contact them and the shipping takes_forever , when i requested a refund they refused , the worst customer_service i had ever had , they also do not ship within 00 hours and they only let you post good reviews of them on their website , totally ridiculous .
negative	' customer_service ' states that order must have been put into the ' wrong pile '.
negative	asked to speak to the manager of customer_service , was told the only way to reach her ( becky ) was to send an_email to opticsfast . com .
negative	so i paid for the repair , and overnight shipping and waited two_weeks to have the order sent back with literally zero work done it .
negative	furthermore , i wasn ' t even a repair , it was simply switching out the temples of the frameless glasses .
negative	i placed an order for an unlock my iphone on november 0th .
negative	at the time , keys0iphone ' s site said my order would be completed in 0 - 0 days .
negative	on the fourth day ( november 00 ), i sent them an_email asking for an update .
negative	there was no response .
negative	i had ordered the unlocking for an international trip the last_week of november -- and i ordered with this company based on the good reviews online , along with their presented window .
negative	unfortunately , my trip came and went without_any change in my order status .
negative	on december_00th , i sent another email .
negative	no response .
negative	about that time , i started checking_out their facebook_page and noticed that i wasn ' t the only person having problems .
negative	there were lots of posts asking for status_updates , complaining about no contact , and requesting refunds .
negative	many of them were deleted within a few hours .
negative	on dec 00th , i sent keys0iphone a message on facebook and posted on their wall , asking if they had any type of update .
negative	my message was read , but not responded to .
negative	my wall post was deleted .
negative	i then followed up with another email , which was never responded to .
negative	today , january third , i once again posted on their wall asking for an update , but i don ' t anticipate i ' ll get any response .
negative	i see they are replying to some posters here , so maybe this will get me the customer_service response i ' ve been trying to get for almost two_months .
negative	here ' s the thing : sometime in october , att borked the whole unlocking system by changing their protocol .
negative	i get that .
negative	i ' m totally understanding of that .
negative	in fact , because i knew that fact sometime around the end of november , i made sure to be extra understanding in my dealings with keys0iphone .
negative	given the situation , i didn ' t expect an instantaneous unlock or anything -- in fact , i understood that there were delays beyond even their control .
negative	that ' s totally fine .
negative	what ' s not ok is not responding to repeated requests for updates -- even if your update is just that you ' re not sure of a time_frame .
negative	six attempts at contact and literally no response .
negative	i will say that in monitoring their facebook_page , i noticed that they are deleting a lot of bad posts from unhappy customers .
negative	in addition to that , they ' ve responded to a few people with an excessive amount of glib and snark ( just my opinion of course )-- basically telling them that if they are unhappy with waiting , they can get a refund , but they ' ll make_sure the phone will be stuck locked forever .
negative	i don ' t get that last part , because if you haven ' t even started an order , why would you do that ?
negative	threats and bullying in the face of customers just wanting * some * answer is not exactly good business_practice .
negative	i ' m sure this post is going to get me blacklisted , too , but i assure you that even now , i ' d be happy if they just apologized for the lack of communication and said we could move forward ( with better communication , of course ).
negative	i ' m sympathetic to them getting shafted by a phone company , but you ' ve got to keep in contact with your customers .
negative	if you need to go out and grab something for a night out on the town , this is your go to place , otherwise forget it .
negative	don ' t expect anything from that store to last more than a few washings , or the first washing , if you ' re lucky .
negative	quality of their product is very very poor .
negative	make_sure to look over anything you ' re planning to buy very thoroughly , i ' ve bought a few things that have been defective , only to notice after tags were cut .
negative	the store is very cramped and crowded , it ' s hard to find anything .
negative	they ' re lucky not many people can afford a quality product these days .
negative	expect to hand wash everything if you don ' t want it to completely be destroyed .
negative	even then you have to be_careful with printed dyes and whatnot bleeding on the rest of the shirt .
negative	the old hqhair is fantastic before sold to this current company , but the new one is very deceitful , it never sends you the receipt , charge you but hold your order till you ask for refund when they have promotion just like 00 %_off of everything and free gift with purchase , cause they don ' t want to give you the free gift if you buy them separately twice or more , like nars if it on promotion .
negative	they would rather let you believe your parcel was missing then they didn ' t dispatch .
negative	it happened to me twice .
negative	they even don ' t stop charge you when you let them know you want to cancel your order before they dispatch .
negative	very awful website , i ' ll never use it anymore !!
negative	!
negative	i rented an apartment for six months in copenhagen .
negative	during that time i was responsible for paying the energy bill for the apartment .
negative	dong sends a bill every three_months .
negative	i paid two energy bills and an ' overage ' charge of 000 dkk .
negative	i thought that the account was paid in full and i was done .
negative	a week_later , i received yet another bill from dong .
negative	they were trying to charge me for an_additional three_months of service after i moved out !
negative	i called an got no resolution from telephone customer_service ( i admit - i don ' t speak danish well , they could not resolve this in english ) so i paid a visit to the dong headquarters in gentoff denmark ( wayyyyyy outside of copenhagen ).
negative	they insisted that i owed the sum even_though their records showed that this new bill was for a period of time i did not reside in the apartment !
negative	there has been no resolution with dong and they refuse to admit that the bill was an error .
negative	i am not at all happy with this .
negative	okay , when i moved to germany i got a two year contract with vodafone .
negative	they told me that if i left germany permanently , i could cancel out the contract with no fees and no problem .
negative	a year later , i had to relocate to denmark .
negative	i showed all of the paperwork that i was leaving germany and vodafone refused to allow me to cancel the contract !
negative	their excuse was that i could still use the phone in denmark ( at 0 . 00_euro a minute ) so they couldn ' t cancel the contract .
negative	then they came back and asked for 000 euro to cancel the contract permanently !
negative	what a terrible thing for vodafone to do to expats !
negative	i order part and ship it overseas .
negative	when part installed it was founded as defective . i contacted customer_service and they initially told me they will issue a store_credit . few weeks_later they refused to give me any store_credit and wont pay my loses on shipping .
negative	they are liars and i hope you will read this review before buy from this scammers .
negative	i ordered 0 sweatshirts .
negative	not long after i received an_email_saying that one of the items was out of stock and they would refund me .
negative	a couple days after that they sent another email_saying the other item i ordered was defective and so they would have to give me a full_refund now .
negative	they sent me yet another email_saying that they gave_me my refund .
negative	i checked my credit_card account online and saw that the charge was still there .
negative	i sent them an_email via their customer_service page saying that they didn ' t properly refund me .
negative	this went on for 0 more times .
negative	why it took so long to get me a simple refund is beyond me .
negative	it took them 0 weeks just to get me a refund .
negative	it took them so long that it ' s still on my credit_card ' s latest statement that i have to pay for .
negative	now i have to deal with my credit_card company as_well .
negative	please , if you haven ' t shopped with yesstyle yet , read the other reviews here and don ' t shop there .
negative	it is definitely not worth the hassle .
negative	these people sell goods they don ' t actually yet have but charge you and refuse to refund you .
negative	avoid
negative	after claiming the codes for bf0 would be up " soon " they went on to dsay much later :
negative	" cjs_cd_keys standard_edition eu arrival tomorrow morning expected ."
negative	do not buy from this lying company .
negative	bad quality service all around .
negative	go check out there facebook_page , tons of angry customer lashing out on them .
negative	my box will arrive after christmas and that ' s not flying right with me !!
negative	will never shop here again .
negative	last wednesday we could not find hotels by calling around in our area - most of the rooms were booked .
negative	we needed a hotel because we had no electricity - as did most of our home area .
negative	my husband used his phone to find a hotel via priceline . com .
negative	after a few_minutes and never receiving a confirmation number we decided to call the hotel directly for our confirmation number they could not find it either at the time because they had no electricity either .
negative	we called priceline . com and could not get through due to extremely high call volumes .
negative	we decided to keep trying to call but later booked another hotel_room outside of our home area that had electricity .
negative	after several calls to priceline . com and not getting through , we called our credit_card company to cancel and we were told to keep trying to reach out to priceline . com .
negative	we did not get through that night but called again the next_day .
negative	we were told since we did not contact them we could not receive a refund .
negative	we spoke to the next level of customer_service , customer relations , and was given a horrible run - around .
negative	she explained multiple_times without listening to us that they would only refund 00 % of our bill .
negative	she_said she called the hotel herself while placing us on hold and " they said that since they regained power by midnight and started checking people in after 00pm our reservation still stood ..."!
negative	so , in other words , we were to wait from the time of our reservation ( 0 - 0pm ) until the hotel got power that night .
negative	the hotel themselves explained to us ( before we called priceline . com ) that they were not going to charge priceline for the room so there were no charges to dispute if we call them .
negative	the manager explained that we would not be charged due to the outage .
negative	but the priceline representative refused to cancel the charges as noted by the hotel manager and by us and certainly by good faith since the entire area was out of electricity .
negative	after frustrations and aggravation and over an_hour on the phone she finally gave a refund - but it was not easy and it was like she did us a favor .
negative	i will never use priceline . com again nor will i recommend the " convenience " of their online booking .
negative	that " customer relations " representative was by_far the worse representative i ' ve ever_dealt_with .
negative	customer_service , especially in an emergency situation should be handled completely different .
negative	crap ...
negative	quality !!!
negative	you ' re better off spending a lil more and buying from somewhere_else .
negative	not a good company .
negative	purchased a print when i received it i was very disappointed looked like a posted in a poster frame .
negative	i tried to contact customer_service but they have none .
negative	customer services is only to take your money .
negative	i wanted to exchange print for metal art and wanted to see if the $_00 . 00 i paid for the first print ( way over priced shipping ) would cover the second shipping and they e_- mailed that it would not and i would be charged another 00 . 00 plus i would be out the 00 . 00 to ship it back .
negative	they emailed me back and told me if i did not want to pay to ship it back to just destroy the art work and take pictures of the destroyed product and they would refund me the amount minus the shipping .
negative	so that means to me that the art work is worth about 00 . 00 and not the 000 . 00 plus 00 shipping that they charged .
negative	who runs a business like this .
negative	i would not recommend this company .
negative	they need some schooling on how to communicate with their customer .
negative	shopto was , to me , the go to place for video games , until my 0nd wii u couldn ' t connect to the internet , and i was banned from buying consoles from them again .
negative	if anyone has a ps0 pre_- ordered with them , i ' d cancel , if you hear about the problems so far , and you have two faulty consoles , it ' s bad news .
negative	i suspect if i returned two of the same game i ' d also be banned from buying games , but anyway , i ' m warning you .
negative	i closed my account after abysmal customer_service , my dad used their merchant on play , but i warned him .
negative	hope he has no similar problems .
negative	edit_: now closed my father ' s account due to this , i contacted someone on the phone who was blatantly rude .
negative	he was telling a member of staff saying " i ' ve got him on the phone ."
negative	this disgusts me how a company can act this way , he was saying " i ' ve got to put the phone down now due to other customers waiting ."
negative	more customers with problems , good_luck .
negative	after seeing other reviews in the past couple of months , they seem to be banning people left right and centre .
negative	i ' d use someone_else if i were you , as some have gone with having their money completely vanished .
negative	use thegamecollection , zavvi or amazon .
negative	graingergames are good too .
negative	ordered a game on the site got it all processed looked at my orders and the order was there twice on two different order numbers , phoned the company at 0am confirming the fault with there website was told not to worry we will send a message to the warehouse and you will be refunded , 0000 comes both orders complete with pictures of both jiffy bags phone the company straight_away person name james sorry no info from warehouse of yet so cannot confirm if the order will be stopped , absolute joke they need to sort out there cancel procedure especially when it was there fault and there in black and white to see all they are interested is to rip you off and not help you at all , now i have the hassle of sending a game back i didnt order but they dont care about there customers .
negative	will never buy off the site again complete shambles
negative	apparently a few folks over in the ea forums have an_issue buying the hung / polish / russian key with no english nativity .
negative	now this can be handled many ways .
negative	ea can provide keys that are universal in a day and age that should be able to across the world and two if somebody makes a reasonable mistake to no read the " specs ".
negative	now gaming_dragons could put a image on the package that says non - english_version on image to prevent this issue from happening .
negative	click buy .. most of us don ' t read .
negative	we live in a click buy society , seldom do we read , especially when it comes to our entertainment value .
negative	as for the response on human_error this is the message i recieved :
negative	sent : sunday , march 00 , 0000 00 : 00_pm
negative	subject : re : support_ticket : [ sensitive information removed_]
negative	hi ,
negative	if the product is already activated there is nothing we can do about it at this point .
negative	there is instructions you can follow to play the game in english .
negative	there was enough information provided to make it clear that this version does not include english natively .
negative	thanks .
negative	me :
negative	it ' s ok , ea going to provide the english download as a escalation tomorrow .
negative	as for the instructions , no where to be found as for the information provided .
negative	click read buy ...
negative	i missed the read part , but thanks for making the choice easier to use a different provider that respects human_error .
negative	them :
negative	hi ,
negative	we respect human_error within reasonable boundaries .
negative	before you are able to redeem the game you can see all the specifications
negative	what languages and what bonuses are available .
negative	and origin asks you if you would like to proceed and activate the game .
negative	and yet you did .
negative	on top of that we have specifically described that this is what you get in the game description .
negative	we buy these games and for activated product no one will reimburse our order .
negative	thanks .
negative	the following is in the reply here in trust_pilot :
negative	0 .
negative	from buy to activation , the only time i saw only english was at time of " install " not activation of key .
negative	0 .
negative	origin at no time before activation of said key said it was polish .
negative	which btw the ea agent understood and escalated it strait away !
negative	score one for decent customer_service !
negative	0 .
negative	as provided ... where exactly because it would have solved all this time and grief to both are persons if it was on site or even as your first reply .
negative	0 .
negative	see image , they look the bloody same ( again didn ' t read ).
negative	0 .
negative	clearly_states doesn ' t account for human_error now does it and see 0 .
negative	and did i ask for a refund ?
negative	no .
negative	now i wonder what got you to that assumption and wasted both our times ?
negative	oh and p . s .
negative	ask the sold souls of the people_who " signed " the terms of service here .
negative	[_external link_removed_] and ask me if 00 % of people_who actually read it is your definition of " reasonable ".
negative	p . s . s .
negative	good to know " we ' re " sure they read and my own appeal to authority fallacy can find common ground lmfao .
negative	the exodus continues ... click comments to see .
negative	i have purchased many items through online shopping sites , but i have never encountered a website as bad as this site .
negative	i had to wait a week to receive the package , and when i opened it , it was a completely different items with items that i have ordered .
negative	it is not acceptable for a site that sells luxury clothing .
negative	this is my first purchase at this site and if this is not one site scams i hope they will accept me to return the item .
negative	absolutely horrified that my tickets arrived 00hours before my match , the offices closed so i can ' t call , only to find they are the wrong tickets and i can either use them or lose them !
negative	total scam !
negative	no email replied , no call backs as i waited 0weeks for tickets .
negative	then they are the wrong tickets !
negative	you are looking for new skis .
negative	you see them in stock , nice offer you think .
negative	you buy them .
negative	00 days waiting ... 00 days ... no response , no skis in your house , then you ask them what is happening .
negative	first response : we have not receive them yet ... omg .. lets_see are they in stock ?
negative	one month later , third response : there is a problem with the manufacturer ... then you think , are you kidding me ?
negative	the refund you 00 €... still_waiting , month and a half later you are going to the alps , no new skis .
negative	they dont deliver on time , they say they have them in stock ...
negative	they lie .
negative	try blue - tomato . com bought new skis there , maybe 00_€ expensive than snow inn , but received them in almost a week .
negative	thats good service .
negative	this store scams when purchasing 0 pairs sent only two pair and a refund made just for the shoes .
negative	charges left itself - almost $_00 .
negative	don ' t buy in this shop !!!
negative	!
negative	as others have mentioned , it is impossible to get_ahold of hotelsclick . com usa representatives via_email or phone .
negative	they booked the wrong hotel for me and now they are not willing to accept their mistake .
negative	this is ridiculous !
negative	avoid avoid avoid !!
negative	!
negative	please just stick to expedia , orbitz , or hotels . com most have price_match guarantee programs and 000x more reliable
negative	bestilte_et regnsæt over nettet , via deres netshop .
negative	dagen_efter modtager_jeg invitation fra_dem , til at " synes om " deres netside på facebook .
negative	så de har registreret ordren , og min email i deres system .
negative	havde også modtaget bekræftelse .
negative	på hjemmesiden stod at man kunne forvente 0 - 0 dages leveringstid , men på 00 .- dagen sender jeg dem en email , for at forhøre mig omkring levering .
negative	denne mail har man i skibutikken valgt ikke at besvare .
negative	og kan desværre se at jeg_ikke er den første , dette_er sket for .
negative	pengene er dog ikke trukket på konto .
negative	find et andet sted til din nethandel , selvom skibutikkens produkter er billigt prissat !
negative	der kan det være du rent_faktisk får , det du bestiller .
negative	eller i det mindste hører fra_dem .
negative	we made a reservation for two adults and two children and after the reservation it said call hotel to request a bed type as it said nowhwere on priceline the type of bed we were getting .
negative	so i called the hotel and they said they cannot change anything that it has to be done through price line .
negative	so we called priceline and it took 00 min before we could even talk to a real_person but even then it was like they werent even real because they were just repeating over and over agin the same thing like they were reading it off a paper .
negative	then they tell us there is nothing they can do and might i say they were very rude !
negative	let it be known we are very unhappy and will never go with priceline ever agin and will tell_everyone we know about our horrible experience !!!
negative	beware if you have kids !!
negative	!
negative	company does not deliver as promised .
negative	still_waiting for shipment .
negative	company does not respond to email or phone_calls .
negative	it took 0 week to get the dvds 0 week to check them then and payment has still not made it to my bank
negative	very discounted prices but spent more than the savings because of delivery .
negative	will not order ever again after now waiting 0 weeks .
negative	ordered on 0 / 00 and package not arriving until 0 / 00 .
negative	00 business days is unacceptable .
negative	never seen something take so long to deliver .
negative	very biased site .
negative	will not let you post bad_reviews .
negative	makes you jump_through all_sorts of hops if you have a bad review .
negative	have tried for two_weeks to post a fair review and they will not let me post it because i used the word ' fraud ' in the reivew ... what is exactly_what the site was .... don ' t trust any reviews or ratings from this site !
negative	i ' ve also asked consumer reports to do an review on them to expose them .
negative	i ' ve purchased two sneaker wedges from ami_club wear and was very disappointed !
negative	the shoes were made out foam and had a stench of burnt rubber .
negative	one of the pairs they sent me was already worn and had dirt on the sole .
negative	it seemed like they ' ve tried cleaning it and it also had a white stain on the side of the shoe .
negative	i ' ve emailed them about wanting a refund on the worn pair but no response so i said screw it and wore them .
negative	i ' ve tested both shoes out and within 0 hours of wearing them , the sole started to separate from the shoe .
negative	this is my first and will be my last time ordering anything from them again and will spread the word .
negative	i ' ll stick to buying shoes from charlotte russe and tj max , etc .
negative	save yourself some time and your money .
negative	dont make the same mistake as me .
negative	=(
negative	i got into paypal becausei originally wanted to useit for online gaming as a buffer for any real financial information exchange .
negative	however with no mention on the package there is a true catch - 00 they employ on new users .
negative	so the rub ?
negative	once your " greendot " funds are added to paypal they are subject to different terms and conditions .
negative	paypal then freezes said funds and insures that while in fact your funds are in your account you can ' t access said funds until you provide all of your financial and personal data to paypal .
negative	i don ' t mind providing some info for tax reasons , etc .
negative	all it takes is a single interception of private data to ruin your fun and in fact it ' s why i closed my blizzard account and won ' t return due to serious concern about how blizzard operates their website and account security .
negative	ordered my product on express delivery which states on confirmation e mail would arrive in 0 - 0 days .
negative	0 days_later no product when i rang to query was told it was 0 - 0 days after despatch and item had not been despatched .
negative	when i complained as the confirmation e mail did not state this i spoke to an extremely unhelpful manager who basically said tough .
negative	avoid this company at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	i bought essential whey 00 and it ' s by_far the worst protein i ' ve bought .
negative	it mixes terrible and instantly foams making it undrinkable
negative	horrible !
negative	don ' t waste_your time .
negative	the only_thing worth rating them one star for , are the prices .
negative	otherwise , a complete inconvenient hassle !!
negative	when i first made the purchase , the glasses i chose were " in stock ".
negative	but then all of a sudden the next moment they were back ordered .
negative	hmm go figure .
negative	why do you offer glasses that are not in stock , only to receive unhappy customers and negative_reviews ?
negative	its been almost a month and my glasses still_haven ' t even been sent out yet .
negative	yeah , well you better get on that express delivery and all i ' m going to say is i better not get a pair of scratched or broken glasses .
negative	seems to me my complaints are almost identical to everyone elses complaints .
negative	get some better customer_service .
negative	would never recommend .
negative	after i receive my purchase , i will no_longer be doing_business with sbg .
negative	i have heen ordering from asda for weeks , and every week i have a problem with the products .
negative	for example once i received plums with fungus growing on , then today i found out tortilla bread that i ordered was already off on the day i got my delivery :_d absolutely redicilous , once i ordered my one month old baby infacol , they sent me calpol from 0plus months , or once i ordered brown hair dye they sent me red instead :_d , or sometimes they just leave something delivered , i have so many stories to tell ... and delivery prices are absolutely mad , last time i paid 0 pound for fungus plums and gone off bread ,
negative	please people avoid asda , it might be cheap but the products you gonna be getting are awful .
negative	i rather pay more money for quality products and good serivice .
negative	absolutely fed up with asda , and never gonna order online again
negative	i booked manchester hyatt hotel for my trip this upcoming sat ...
negative	paid for it in full from paypal .
negative	got confirmation letter and then later i found out i was not even in the list of the hotel for my arrival date .
negative	i called hotelsclick at_least 0 - 0 times a day but all i got is a voicemail .
negative	none answers it .
negative	i called manchester hyatt today again and my name is still not showing in reservation list .
negative	i am very frustrated .
negative	i emailed hotels click and they keep saying i am already confirmed with booking and that my name will show up 00 hr before the arrival date .
negative	i have never_heard such thing , at_least not in thr usa .
negative	let ' s see what they say tomorrow ...
negative	but for future ... stay_away from this company .
negative	it seems like a bait and switch business
negative	we booked a flight for a cruise .
negative	the cruise was cancelled ( carnival ).
negative	my sister who had booked directly with delta , called delta and explained what happened .
negative	they waived the $_000 rescheduling fee .
negative	an_hour later i called expedia and explained the situation .
negative	the first rep said they would check with delta , she put me on hold and after five_minutes was somehow on a brand_new call from scratch with an entirely new rep .
negative	explained the situation again and she refused to check with delta , insisting on going with their formal written policy .
negative	i was transferred to her " supervisor " who made me start from scratch saying that i had given the previous rep " no information ."
negative	by the time i finally done , the price for the flight i wanted to switch to had gone up nearly $_000 .
negative	no empathy , canned responses , unwilling to go the extra_mile .
negative	sill had to pay that fee for switching our tickets .
negative	should have booked with a different company .
negative	as a seller fees are outrageous , ( roughly 00 % of the sale price plus shipping cost ) then you have to pay shipping as_well .
negative	ship international and they claim not received ?
negative	oh well , you lose , the international buyer gets your item for free , on top of that , you paid his shipping_costs !
negative	accidently sell an item over $_000 but didn ' t include signature upon delivery ?
negative	buyer gets a full_refund !
negative	i wish there was something different that had the reach ebay does , it was a fine system in the beginning but with
negative	income tax ( 00 - 00 %)
negative	sales_tax ( 0 %)
negative	ebay fees ( 00 %)
negative	shipping_costs ( 00 %)
negative	you might as_well donate your items , at_least then you get a tax break .
negative	decided to rent a car through priceline .
negative	went to pick the car up and they wanted even more money plus the deposit i already knew about the deposit but wasn ' t aware that they didn ' t keep_up with the deals with priceline !
negative	called to get my money back and was denied it !!
negative	then i look at my receipt and there it says non_refundable !!!
negative	never during the whole_process of setting up the reservation did it tell me this until they got my card information and took my money !!
negative	and i still did not get a rental_car !!!
negative	!
negative	will start you off at a reasonable rate and skyrocket that rate once you begin collecting reviews .
negative	want to leave - say goodbye to all your positive_reviews and no chance to respond .
negative	we rented a car from orlando , florida online through the sixt website .
negative	when we got to the shuttle area meant to take us to the sixt office around 0 am , the phone_number of the 00 hour office they had provided on our receipt gave us an answering_machine explaining that the office was now closed .
negative	we tried various other numbers that we found online until we got through to the shuttle .
negative	when we arrived at sixt they informed us that they actually had no car for us .
negative	they had over booked and would refund our money as_well and bring us back to the airport .
negative	we were informed that the pre paid rental amount would be refunded immediately , however it took multiple phone_calls and days to complete the refund .
negative	we loved the price of the rental which is why we chose the company .
negative	it was disappointing to have such a negative experience .
negative	almost all the glasses i wanted were out of stock .
negative	finally , i settled on one pair .
negative	well , it has been 0 months and no glasses .
negative	when i contact selectspecs they told me to go call " royal_mail " which is an overseas call for me .
negative	anyway , i run the contact , and it says that royal_mail delievered my package a month_ago to the us .
negative	( and no further information ).
negative	now i have no_idea if i owe duty or tax , do i have to go pick them up at the us port ?
negative	where the hell are my glasses .
negative	if this is the case , they should have an import agent in the us to take_care of all this for the us customers .
negative	the company is a complete scam .
negative	shame on them .
negative	ordered from online left page open on 0x pounds and next_morning processed but my card went out 0x pounds !!
negative	so i bought more expansive then before and it showed error .
negative	then they credited my money ( how much i have paid for ) then i ordered it , got my key ( delays here and there ) n they have sent me an used key !!!
negative	i am still_waiting for my key since i cant play with a used key ...
negative	order_# 00000
negative	i ordered ( order id : 000000000 ) foods for my birds 0 days_ago and they sent shipment email next_day .
negative	today there is still no movement when i check the tracking_number .
negative	i called them and they said they don ' t have this food in stock .
negative	so basically they mark orders as shipped even_though they don ' t actually ship .
negative	when i asked them how to fix this problem , they didn ' t even apologize properly .
negative	stay_away from them , at all cost .
negative	now i have to order this food from somewhere_else and i have to pick overnight shipping and pay for it .
negative	i have proof of purchase !
negative	good job !
negative	i ' ve ordered two things from this company to date .
negative	both were wigs they had on sale and advertised everywhere online .
negative	the first , a brown wig , never came .
negative	i demanded a refund and they gave_me a 00 dollar coupon .
negative	( the wig was 00 dollars .)
negative	the second , a blonde wig , i needed for a convention i was going too .
negative	the description said ships in 00 hours , and i even paid the 00 dollars for the fastest shipping method .
negative	a week_later and 0 days until my convention , the wig is still not here .
negative	sloppy work and horrible customer_service communication .
negative	do not order from this website .
negative	i ' ve been a loyal_customer for years_now and for the past few month been having problems unlike ever before .
negative	they keep not sending me items that i ordered and paid for and always all they got to say is .
negative	( as for the missing item we regret to inform that we were not be able to fulfill the remainder of your order .
negative	we had attempted to special order the item from our supplier but the item is not available at this time .)
negative	always which is bunch of b_/ s its funny because one of the items i didn ' t receive was still up for sale on the site same size and everything and the customer care person monique said that its out of stock or whatever even thought i told them its in stock !
negative	im so fed up with not receiving items that i paid for / always asking for the money back that they charged for them when it should be refunded automatically without me even asking and having other issues , better yet i shouldn ' t even have this problem .
negative	i shall not be silent no more because everyone should know what they do this .
negative	the only helpful ami customer help has ever been the ones on facebook they always respond right_away and are very nice and understanding .
negative	but other then that good_luck with dealing_with this crap !
negative	nice clothes but they really need to do something about the out of stock thing when the person already bought the items and expect them .
negative	now i have to find new items that are similar and spend shipping and handling money and time to do so .
negative	i made two orders ....
negative	0st order - i received my items within 0 weeks of purchase , except for one item ( human hair_extensions worth almost $_000 ).
negative	my items were all the wrong sizes & they didn ' t let me know the extensions were on backorder .
negative	i waited on hold for 00 minutes all 0 times i ' ve called .
negative	it ' s been 0 weeks & i still_haven ' t received my backorder item or been refunded .
negative	0nd order - i ordered a bathing suit 00 days_ago .
negative	my order still_hasn ' t been processed & i still_haven ' t gotten a confimation number from ups ... this is quite interesting considering i paid the extra 0 - day shipping charges near $_00 .
negative	i will never order from this company again or recommend them to anyone .
negative	i hope you take my advice & save your money & time .
negative	i still_haven ' t gotten anywhere with them & i ' m sure you wont either ... not to mention , the clothes i received in my order were very low quality .
negative	i have still to learn about a ms product that has no alternative which is way better in many ways , price and quality being the most usual and important ones .
negative	i recently sold and got paid through paypal .
negative	little did i know that they were going to take my money hostage .
negative	after providing all steps and everything that needed to be done including great review on ebay and tracking_numbers and all their bullshit , i did not get my money .
negative	when i was speaking with the supervisor to see if i could get my funds released , the guy did not even speak an understandable english .
negative	it is as if he had a piece of paper in front of him with a couple of phrases or words .
negative	" no ", " thats not my problem " were only a couple of the things i could make out through the bad english .
negative	and this was a supervisor .
negative	i mean the lady that first helped_me was so very nice and did everything she could , but this ignorant didn ' t even want to hear me .
negative	i think he was doing something else .
negative	as_soon as these people release my money im canceling my paypal_account , never using this service again .
negative	made a purchase on supplimentwharehouse . com this is my second purchase becuase the 0st went well .
negative	this one is horrible .
negative	i placed my order online 00 / 00 .
negative	i didnt find out via_email no phone call that they cant ship my order because my billing adress and shipping adress is different and that i had to call in to verify .
negative	i called in on the 00th to verify that it was me ordering and that it was okay to ship to my other house .
negative	i stated that i needed my product to be shipped by 00 - 0 the latest .
negative	they assured me that they could .
negative	i then on the 0th look online and it shows it hasnt been shipped yet so i call .
negative	i talk to a guy and he says he will check on it and email me the status .
negative	guess what ... . no email .
negative	i called today 000 and got karen or kristen she_said she was the lead in the department who was blaming black_friday sales for the dealy when i clearly orderd my producst before black_friday .
negative	she_said she would contact me today as a status but could offfer no garauntee as to when my product would be shipped .
negative	she also offered nothing as reconsiliation for the troubles .
negative	saving a few bucks inst worth the headaches .
negative	this is horrible customer_service .
negative	** update - i recieved a follow_up email from them stating they are waitning on product ????
negative	it didn ' t show on backorder .
negative	this is rediculous .
negative	the also didn ' t acknowledge their customer_service blunders or offer anything in returen .
negative	stay back .
negative	they didn ' t confirm the booking but they took the money from my bank_account right_away .
negative	didn ' t receive the tickets and they neither picked_up the phone nor responded to my mail .
negative	not recommend one because i made 0 purchases on 00 / 0 / 00 and 00 / 00 / 00 and never received another or even satisfaction of my requests .
negative	and also not getting answers to my email , nor with the carrier .
negative	let me keep it simple .
negative	i bought ' heaven scent ' which has a purple / white theme .
negative	on the phone , the advisor said the florist is unable to provide freesia flowers in this bundle ; which i was okay with .
negative	the next_day ; i receive a completely different flower with a different colour theme ; blue .
negative	the only similarity between heaven scent and the received flowers were only the pink roses ; the rest were different .
negative	i sent in a complaint and asked for a partial_refund and the person_who replied to me had the audacity to say " we allow our florists to make minor substitutions ."
negative	i would like to think its major rather_than minor .
negative	not to mention they do not have the blue theme under their colour category .
negative	white
negative	red
negative	yellow
negative	pink
negative	purple
negative	colourful
negative	orange
negative	do you see blue anywhere ?
negative	i certainly don ' t .
negative	funny how he / she also says in the email :
negative	" the item is within the colour scheme , style and value of the arrangement you have chosen ."
negative	then he / she ends the email with : " due to this we are unable to progress any further with your complaint ."
negative	just avoid this company , they make claims and excuses but not willing to take up responsibility and blame .
negative	being charged the full price for something i didn ' t order from the website .
negative	what a joke .
negative	i recently ordered 0 personalised egyptian cotton bath set towels and 0 personalised egyptian cotton hand towels (' his and hers ', black & pink ) as an anniversary gift !
negative	it turned_out that the towels are of extremely bad quality , so bad that we actually cannot use them at all ( little fibres comes off the towels , you cannot dry off , body is still wet afterwards and full of fibres and its everywhere , the whole bathroom is a mess , very poor_quality of towels ).
negative	i have washed to towels about 00 times and it just doesn ' t get any better .
negative	i paid £_00 for this towels and i cannot_believe what i got for my money !
negative	i am extremely disappointed .
negative	i have reported this to amy ’ sgifts . co . uk but amy doesn ’ t care .
negative	she doesn ’ t want to give me a refund !
negative	customer_service do not speak english and very unprofessional .
negative	crooks !
negative	terrible .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	you ' ve been warned .
negative	after contacting the representative .
negative	they told me refund can only be given if the product is un - open .
negative	how am i going to know if the skin will work , without trying it on .
negative	do not suggest buy .
negative	the skin does not cover the whole phone and it does not look as good in the picture .
negative	very easy to be stretched out of shape .
negative	they are the partners of fraud websites .
negative	if you chose any service from the websites using paypal , then you dispute their answer would be " this is not protected in our tnc .
negative	i purchased a bag many months_ago and was signed_up for some club that i did not know about and was charged $ 0 . 00 a month !
negative	this will teach me to keep better track of my checking account .
negative	this is a total scam and i will never buy from this company again .
negative	i was unable to board my flights due to a booking error through expedia .
negative	not only did they refuse to help me get any flights changed but also refused to refund me .
negative	as an active duty military service member yrying to get home to see family obviously i was unable to do so .
negative	i had a problem with my purchase and the support refused to speak with me .
negative	this business ( expedia ) has horrible ratings .
negative	i couldn ' t agree more .
negative	i wish i knew that before i bought anything through them .
negative	the guy on the phone for cs was hard to understand since he was from another country .
negative	he couldn ' t answer any of my simple questions .
negative	i asked if i could receive points for my latest booking and he said i could not and he couldn ' t tell me why due to confidentiality .
negative	which made no sense and he couldn ' t even explain why .
negative	he offered me a 00 $ coupon for next time booking .
negative	i asked why i received that and all he could say it was from an agent ' s error but he refused to pull up the paperwork / file to give me info on it .
negative	expedia is nuts !
negative	had there been any other options available of the accessory i ' m buying i would not buy from yesstyle .
negative	it ' s been years since i stopped shopping at yesstyle simply because if your purchase does not reach 000 you ' ll have to pay for the stupid shipping .
negative	why should i pay for the goddamn shipping if it does not arrive until a month later ?
negative	you call them and a rude chinese uncle answers the phone .
negative	whatever !
negative	rather_than explain in detail why i was unhappy with my experience with cash 0 phones i feel it would be more appropriate to give helpful information to others who are either considering or have already used this company .
negative	it ' s a bit of a review within a guide .
negative	firstly , as you are probably aware , c0p ' s is somewhat of a scam company and uses a variety of classic methods to essentially extract as much money out of you as possible .
negative	here ' s how it works ;
negative	0 .
negative	on price comparison sites you will notice that c0p ' s offers the best cash for handsets , far higher_than mazuma or any of the other legitimate recycling phone companies .
negative	this is the ' bait '.
negative	0 .
negative	you will receive an extremely flimsy piece of packaging to send your phone to c0p , you will then consider to send your handset via special delivery .
negative	this is of course expensive so you will be far more tempted to simply use the packaging they provided and ' chance it '.
negative	you will of course now be worried that your handset will be broke in the post .
negative	0 .
negative	you will receive a email from c0p ' s indicating that your handset has ' significant wear and tear ' and you will be offered a revised figure anywhere between 00 - 00 %_off the original value .
negative	it doesn ' t matter what condition you sent the phone in , 0 times out of 00 you will receive this standard email .
negative	those_who used the flimsy packet to send the package will be receptive to this ' wear and tear ' excuse as you will likely already be concerned that the handset was damaged in the post .
negative	0 .
negative	you will be given only 0 days to make your mind up regarding whether or not to accept this value .
negative	the option is to accept this poor offer or reject it , you will obviously want to reject this offer but it will then become clear that if you reject their poor offer you will have to pay them £ 0 . 00 in postage costs this is the ' hook '.
negative	at this point several different outcomes can occur .
negative	a ) you do not act on this email or have not checked your email for a few_days , after 0 days the offer is accepted automatically so c0p ' s will have extracted a decent sum of money from you .
negative	b ) you think that it is probably not worth the hassle and just accept , the delivery cost to reject the phone back will reinforce this thinking .
negative	those of you who decided to send the phone by special delivery will have already made a loss and are therefore receptive to ' cutting your losses '.
negative	those that did not will also psychologically think that it ' s your / royal mails fault anyway .
negative	either of these situations are ideal for c0p ' s .
negative	c ) you email c0p ' s regarding the situation and express your unhappiness ( more on this in a bit ) and do not phone , it ' s a 0000 number and you will be kept on ' hold ' for a very long time .
negative	also do not click either ' accept offer ' or ' reject ' if you plan on contesting it .
negative	0 .
negative	if you are contesting their offer they will apologise for ' human_error ' in terms of the valuation and offer you a revised ' counter - offer '.
negative	the extent of the ' counter - offer ' very much depends on your correspondents and the ' human_error ' excuse is stock , everyone will get it .
negative	if you came_across angry or ill - informed they will likely offer you a improved but still ' poor ' offer , knowing that you feel strongly about this situation and are emotionally invested .
negative	they will use this to their advantage as this indicates that you want a resolution quickly and will accept a poor offer .
negative	if you come_across as_well informed and calm then they will give you a significantly improved offer that ' s very close to what they originally offered .
negative	the best way to do this is mention that you are in contact with trading_standards , the gravy train at c0p ' s will soon be running out and they know it .
negative	a trading_standards investigation is currently ' ongoing ' and bbc watchdog is keeping a close eye on c0p ' s and they know it .
negative	exploit this fact !
negative	0 .
negative	the ' sell part ' in both situations in number 0 is that their counter - offer will nearly always be less_than what they quoted , just below the actual market value if you have come_across well in correspondents but because you have already been through the scam ' s initial hassle you are very very likely to just take this value .
negative	you will think you somehow ' won ' because you got a reasonable amount of money but really you didn ' t because you still got less_than what you were originally offered .
negative	although to be honest it is probably best to indeed accept this offer rather_than fight for the full_amount .
negative	in my own personal experience i was offered £_00 , reduced to £_00 . 00 when received and by following the above advice managed to get £_00 .
negative	0 .
negative	the final part is that c0p ' s is prone to delaying payout ' s , this is their last line of defence and works in that statistically some people will not notice that they did not receive there payment .
negative	if this occurs , just keep emailing them and eventually they will know that you ' re not going anywhere .
negative	just remember c0p ' s operates just like most other scams of this nature .
negative	they have a set series of scenarios that statistically demonstrate a high probability of customers ' giving up ' and just accepting the scam and play on simple psychological evaluation .
negative	i payed for a car with ac and they reserve one without , so since they could not fix the problem i decided to cancel and they charged me cancelation fee … off their mistake .
negative	on day 00 of chivalry acquired a key to pay at the moment , i have not received anything , the live_chat does not work and i do not answer to the support_ticket , it seems a shame ... in the end it ' s not worth saving a euros
negative	ok so i submitted my reservation .
negative	payment cleared within_seconds .
negative	no email conformation and the hotel has no records of my name , your company or my reservation at all !!
negative	where is my money ?!!
negative	where am i supposed to sleep ?!?!?

negative	000_% fakes , i bought armani watch the quality of the watch was relay bad even from the box you can say its 000_% fake don ' t waste_your money on them because its fakes . the quality of the watch was really bad so disappointed just good one thing didn ' t spend a lot that ' s one good thing ...: ddd keep away from that site ....
negative	they do not get you the best rates ...... they simply offer you the reduced rate based upon you paying up front for the hotel booking .
negative	you can do this on other_sites .
negative	difference here is that they make_sure to hide the fact that most hotels do not allow you to cancel you reservations , even the day after you booked it .
negative	they have horrible customer_service reps and they are difficult to reach ....... stay_away !!!!!
negative	!
negative	do not choice voucher option
negative	use topdollar
negative	as a t - mobile customer i bought 0 lines and had bad_experience with them
negative	i asked for unlock phone and they made mistake two times to send me unlock phone and when i claimed i didn ' t receive it yet they said they can ' t help me anymore because i already had 0 request for sim unlock !!
negative	!
negative	is it my problem because they don ' t know what to do and now my phone doesn ' t work on other country !!?
negative	?
negative	they cheat you ...
negative	i believe so even metro pcs is better on customer care ...
negative	broadband crap , extra charges with every bill .
negative	not happy about it at all .
negative	my buddy introduced me to vpx meltdown diet pills but they are kinda expensive so i started looking all over the net and found supplementwarehouse . com .
negative	they advertised lowest_prices guaranteed !
negative	i didn ' t believe at first but after entering a website that had a lower_price to my surprise not only did they match lowest price but i also got an_additional 0 %_discount .
negative	wow you don ' t find companies this good any more .
negative	upade …..
negative	0 day later they ship me the product at regular price .
negative	what a piece of shit company .
negative	thanks for wasting my time !!
negative	now to get my money back i have to refuse the package and once they receive it back they ' ll refund my money .
negative	dear travelers and their friends and relatives !
negative	usually i don ' t have a habit to write_reviews on services i had .
negative	even when i had bad_experience after a day or two my emotions are not so strong to express them .
negative	the case of bravofly is absolutely different .
negative	we needed to by tickets for our relative as_soon as possible .
negative	it was transcontinental flight and we were looking for the best price ( as all we do ).
negative	we found that bravofly offers the cheapest price and connections were fine , so we decided to buy the ticket .
negative	after filling all boxes and paid for a ticket , we received an e_- mail telling that they had received our request and had been awaiting for the airline to confirm our booking .
negative	please note that money was frozen immediately !
negative	ok . we decided that everything is fine , because you could never think otherwise .
negative	but no !
negative	after two hours we received another e_- mail telling that " it has not been possible to confirm your booking with reservation number xxx because a problem occurred during security controls in our system that did not allow to proceed with the confirmation of your reservation ".
negative	we have a flight in about 00 hours , so this cancellation was just shocking .
negative	we called them and a guy told us that we now we have no ticket and no money and that our money will be return in two_days !
negative	of course , it was like a madness , when you have spent money for a ticket and now you should spent another money to buy the same one .
negative	but the guy told me that he understand my felling - these words " helped " me .... for sure .
negative	so , we bought another ticket through more reliable company .
negative	two_days after - no money on our account .
negative	0 , 0 , 0 days - the same .
negative	after 0 days my husband called him and very rude ' lady ' first of all read the comments the first guy left .
negative	comments were : the client is very angry , the client wants his money immediately , the client wants for complaint to the police ".
negative	after that the lady told that usually it takes 0 working days to proceed refund of money .
negative	the moral : we have our money back .
negative	we decided to let as many people know about terrible bravofly service as we can .
negative	please be_aware of that company and never buy tickets through them .
negative	honestly , we think that in our case the problem was that they actually do not have direct connection with the database of airlines .
negative	so , when they show flights they do not have up - to - date information - not about time and prices .
negative	when they received request from us , they sent it to the airlines to get final confirmation .
negative	the airlines rejected , because the price wan ' t up - to - date .
negative	however , they had already frozen money .
negative	i will also repost my comment in other travelers ' websites .
negative	bravofly , please do not comment my complaint .
negative	thank_you .
negative	i bought a book from them and when i received it they had sent me an annotated instructor ' s edition , even_though that ' s not the same isbn as the one i ordered .
negative	the back of it has a sticker saying that they will buy this instructor ' s edition back if there is not a newer edition so i thought it would be okay as i didn ' t want to worry_about sending a book back and dealing_with that .
negative	at the end of the semester they were still buying the book back so i went_ahead and sold it back to them , only to be told in an_email after they received it that they would not buy it back because it was annotated .. even_though they sent it to me first .
negative	later i asked when i would receive the book back and i ' m told they might not be able to find it , but if they do then i can pay $ 0 . 00 to have it shipped back to me .
negative	what ?
negative	they sell me a book , then they have me send it back to them only to tell me they have lied about saying they would buy it back plus i have to pay to get the book back ?
negative	yeah right .
negative	i wrote a complaint to bbb and i will tell_everyone i know not to support this piece of crap business .
negative	after booking my trip for 0 / 00 they made the tickets for 0 / 00 and did not notify me nor rein verse my money and i bought the protection_plan !!!!
negative	!
negative	bought a hosting plan for a school projekt , at first everything was fine but after a couple of hours my account was immediatly suspended for completely bs reasons .
negative	i got my money back but i will never buy from them again !
negative	købte_en server sammen med_min ven , og der har ikke været end problemer .
negative	ftp var broken og serveren kunne_ikke stoppes .
negative	i bought an ipod for my kid on christmas , the product never arrived to my hose .
negative	i asked the seller twice to ship it ups or fedex and to ask for a signature .
negative	after starting a claim , the seller showed a tracking_number confirming that he did ship the ipod , but through usps standard mail .
negative	what happened was that he tried to save some money ( although i paid for ups / fedex ) and never mentioned that a signature was required .
negative	the package must have been left outside my house when no one was there and someone stole it .
negative	what did ebay say ?
negative	that the seller what not responsible , so i lost $_000 .
negative	will never buy on scambay again .
negative	go amazon !
negative	!
negative	im so annoyed @ this site , i bought a total of 0 items and recieved 0 !!??
negative	my heels that cost me over $_00 aud weren ' t in the parcel , i tried emailing them several_times and they just saying " we ' ll look into it " but the investigation didnt go anywhere and its been sooo long .. i wanted to open a despute with paypal at one stage but i had no time , id rather warn others on this fraud .
negative	please be_careful with online shopping , i was so light headed about it , i now review before i purchase anything from any site ... be a smart shopper and dont get fooled like i did .. amiclubwear should be shutdown .
negative	and if theres others out there that went through what i did , dont stay silent .. let it out there .. they are making $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ a day & people just dont do anything about it , post as much blogs as possible , peace :)
negative	i bought a ticket to see man united vs man city at old trafford & was promised the ticket would be delivered to the hotel .
negative	the price went almost 00 % higher_than advertised .
negative	the ticket never came !
negative	i called their customer_service on matchday , and was told they had no ticket for me .
negative	did some research : ote works on the black market which is illegal .
negative	they sell tickets they don ' t yet have , and you might risk not getting your ticket .
negative	a lot of people are having trouble getting refunds as_well .
negative	in other words - ote is a fraud , scam & illegal not recommended !!
negative	!
negative	its been 0 hours and still dont have my code for my playstation network card !!!!!!!
negative	never using this site again
negative	i won ' t lie -- i don ' t have the best credit in the world , thanks to some bad financial decisions i made almost 00 years_ago ( hooray for irresponsible 00 year olds ).
negative	anyway , i needed a small loan to pay a few bills after an unexpected medical expense practically wiped me out .
negative	all i asked for was $_000 .
negative	i got immediate approval for $_000 but here ' s the thing : i read through their terms and they wanted me to pay back just over $ 0 , 000 !
negative	i am not going to pay 00 % more than what i borrowed !
negative	i exited the application and tried to call to make_sure they cancelled the application and disposed of my information but i got an_automated message saying their line was disconnected .
negative	i got a call the following afternoon ( today ) and not only was i addressed as " mister " ( i am a woman , thank_you ) but the man was rude and tried to talk over me when i told him i was no_longer interested after seeing the payment terms .
negative	i asked that the application be cancelled and my information disposed of and he told me to " have a nice day " and promptly hung_up on me .
negative	i was not in any way nasty to him so he had no ground to be that way to me regardless of how many calls he gets / makes or if he ' s had a rough day .
negative	this company has shoddy customer_service , rude representatives , awful rates .
negative	if i could give them zero_stars , i would .
negative	i placed an order for two dresses that i had found on the website on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the order said that i would receive the merchandise in approximately four days .
negative	i received a tracking_number , however this number was invalid when trying to track it from the upsn fed_ex , and usps websites .
negative	today , after no merchandise showed_up , i decided to call the customer_service number .
negative	after being put on hold for 00 minutes , a rude representative got on the phone and stated that my dresses had just been shipped from california this morning !!!!!
negative	horrified , i explained to her that the dresses were to be worn to a new year ' s eve party and that i needed them .
negative	she proceeded to tell me that they should arrive on monday ( 0 / 0 / 00 ).
negative	i told her if they weren ' t here by the 00st that i would be sending them back and requesting a refund .
negative	she then tells_me they don ' t do refunds and tells_me they only do store credits !!!
negative	i explained to her that i didn ' t see that when i placed my order and she stated that the store policy was in a separate section of the website .
negative	i am now going to be stuck with 0 dresses and no where to wear them to !
negative	i was told by a friend of mine that she received her merchandise within 0 days so they apparently do what they want to do .
negative	will not be ordering from them anymore .
negative	i will stick with great glam !!
negative	!
negative	paypal needs negative stars .
negative	their offers of seller and buyer protection are fraudulent .
negative	a customer contacted me to purchase a dress from my store and wanted it sent to australia .
negative	she paid by paypal .
negative	once she receives the dress she immediately files with paypal to get her money back and paypal removes the entire amount of money from my account automatically .
negative	it cost $_00 to send the dress to her b_/ c she wanted express delivery .
negative	that amount was also removed even_though the post_office has that money now not me .
negative	so paypal says customer filed dispute and they are holding the money .
negative	even_though i don ' t offer refunds on formal wear , i just had near the same experience with another buyer that they filed a dispute and then returned a used and damaged dress back and still got their full money back even_though i had to go get a notary and file papers with paypal .
negative	i eventually got my money back on that one though , but i think they did as_well .
negative	so i decided on this one i would just agree to refund the cost of the dress minus shipping since , as i said , that money went to the post_office .
negative	so i offered a $_000 refund .
negative	she accepted the refund and paypal automatically gave her the money back rather_than holding the money until she proved she mailed the dress .
negative	she immediately went on our facebook_page and left us a message that she was not sending the dress back ..
negative	so i call paypal and let them know and they say nothing they can do !
negative	as if they can ' t just go in and debit her account as they did mine .
negative	believe me paypal will go in your account and take money out anytime they want , i have had it done several_times .
negative	if no money is in the paypal_account they just give you a negative balance and let you know they will be removing that amount from whatever account you have linked to your paypal_account .
negative	so i said you are supposed to protect me to as the seller i was just agreeing to the return process which you encourage members to do and pretty_much force it since you had already debited my account for the full_amount .
negative	now since she has the money i am pretty_much like the buyer who did not receive the item i payed for .
negative	still no help .
negative	nothing they can do !
negative	really where else can this happen ?
negative	i can ' t buy a refrigerator from best buy then go in there and say i want my money back but i am also going to keep the refrigerator .
negative	business owners it is so tempting to accept_paypal when you have a willing buyer but don ' t do it as you are giving up all of your rights and your return_policy means nothing .
negative	in fact you are taking a very big chance that you will be paying the postage to send someone a free product .
negative	it took 00 days for them to tell me they were out of stock of products i ordered .
negative	0 email run - arounds during that time - frame .
negative	no recourse but to ask for refund , which to their credit they did do , 00 days_later !
negative	avoid them , they don ' t know what they ' re doing .
negative	i ordered two dresses from this site and it took a week and a half to arrive although shipping for those two small dresses was $_00 . 00 .
negative	there was no information for me to track my package and when they came they looked horrible .
negative	i ordered a dress that was pictured as red and came in a burgundy color and it had threads coming apart everywhere !
negative	you can ' t get your money back and i have no desire to purchase anything else and pay more outrageous shipping prices so i will just consider this a lesson learned .
negative	this company is ridiculous .
negative	when the package did not come a few weeks after it was said to i immediately e_- mailed customer_service .
negative	i believed it was because the address might have been incorrect ( when i think back on it i now realize that there should have been no problem with the address since i have received different packages from different companies addressed the same way ).
negative	i corrected the address ( even_though i shouldn ' t have had to ) and then i was told i was to be charged an_additional $ 0 . 00 on top of what i had already paid ( that ' s just terrible customer_service ).
negative	now , here i am , months_later still_waiting on the package i guess just isn ' t going to come .
negative	i want my money back , but i doubt that will happen .
negative	this site is a scam .
negative	do not order .
negative	hello .
negative	so normally only good things would come out of my mouth when referring to amiclubwear but after this last transaction and my experience with trying to fix it i think that will be my very last transaction .
negative	whats not to love about them ... great deals , best shoes ever and get advise etc .
negative	but i feel almost like a friend betrayed me .
negative	i ordered 0 heels with this last transaction and was super excited to receive them especially since i am about to have my second baby and it was a gift to myself and motivation to get back into shape etc ... after never receiving an_email about when they were on there way and / or what the hold u was i tried emailing and calling numerous_times with no response .
negative	finally i received one of the shoes and they are the wrong_size !
negative	so i finally called and finally got thru to an actual_person .
negative	she_said didnt even offer to replace the wrong_size only emailed me a return_label so i can ship them back ( lets_see how long it takes to receive an refund )!!
negative	oh and she told me i should of received a refund for the other shoes and of course i havent .
negative	im so upset .
negative	i have never wanted a pair of shoes so bad for some reason but i did .
negative	today i went and bought some really awesome heels somewhere_else .
negative	i am sooooooo disappointed with amiclubwear .
negative	i always spoke the best tings about them .
negative	ughh so unhappy !
negative	even_though new look refunded me they never made it clear in there small print that the £ 0 . 00 was seperate from the full £_00 . 00 and they are a joke and i will never use them a again
negative	don ' t be lured in by cheap prices .
negative	i was !
negative	they had the item i wanted marked as in stock and eligible for ups quick delivery .
negative	turns_out they were lying .
negative	they didn ' t have it in stock and to cap it all , they are still to refund me .
negative	not sure what has happened to phones0u as have always taken contracts out with them for years due to their competitive prices and what used to be decent customer_service .
negative	however never again !!
negative	!
negative	had a call from one of their upgrade agents advising me my o0 upgrade was due on the 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	after a long converstation and a rather agressive sales approach i gave in and agreed to upgrade .
negative	anyway changed my mind and decided to cancel ... assumed it would be no problem as i was still 0 days from when the upgrade could be processed .
negative	ring to cancel and they tell me they cant as its already been processed ?
negative	!
negative	so ring o0 and they tell me theres nothing on the account and no upgrade has been / can be processed until the 00th chances are p0u will set_up a new account and have me call them to transfer details and activate .
negative	so ring p0u again and they them nothing has been processed by o0 but they have processed it at their end and then told apparently the distant selling laws do not apply to their upgrades as a continuation of services ... despite the fact its a new phone , new tariff and as o0 suggest probably a new account ??!
negative	!
negative	lucky o0 said i have 0 days to cancel with them so hopefully that will all work out ok but no thanks to p0u .
negative	but never going to use p0u again , their shady sales tactics and legal approach to the distant selling laws is unacceptable .
negative	they will certainly be one shop i ' d be happy to see disappear from the high_street !
negative	never received my game :/
negative	i placed my order ( on 00 / 00 / 00 ) for 0 sheets of the gigantic " cute as a bug " decals for christmas gifts for two_separate nurseries .
negative	it said they would be delivered 00 / 00 / 00 so i didn ' t opt for the rush shipping .
negative	i got one sheet on 00 / 00 / 00 but the other sheet wasn ' t in the box ?!?
negative	there was some damage to a couple of the decals , so i took pictures and e_- mailed the company .
negative	i had only got one tracking_number , so i had no_idea where my other sheet was .
negative	since then i have called and left voice mails , left messages on their website , and sent e_- mails .
negative	at first i thought they may be on some kind of extended holiday break , but here is it 00 / 00 / 00 and i have still not got any kind of response from them what - so - ever !!!
negative	i am very disappointed !!!!
negative	for lack of knowing what else to do i have filed a complaint with the bbb , which gives the company til 0 / 00 / 00 to respond to the complaint .
negative	at this point i have serious doubts that they are going to contact me at all , i guess we ' ll see in a week .
negative	i guess even if a company is rated " a " by the bbb , and all the previous customers seem to be happy .... you never can tell .
negative	in case you were wondering .... i spent about $_000 . 00 with this company .... and expected much better customer_service for the amount of money spent .
negative	:-( :-( :-( i will post again and let everyone know what kind of resolution i got .
negative	we booked a dolphin swim at the atlantis in the bahamas and expedia never contacted the company to schedule the swim or verify that we had paid .
negative	i had to call them from a foreign_country only to be put on hold for 00 minutes .
negative	when someone finally answered , thy hung_up on me after 00 seconds .
negative	i called the next_day and was told that they had done nothing wrong because going between the companies was " my responsibility ."
negative	they would not even offer me a coupon for my trouble .
negative	horrible service .
negative	do not book excursions through them !!
negative	!
negative	i have been a loyal_customer of macy ' s until a recent disaster with a furniture purchase .
negative	we ordered a three piece sectional on november 0rd and chose a stock color so we would have it by thanksgiving .
negative	we were not notified until after we purchased the sofa that it was on back order until january .
negative	we had to cancel our thanksgiving dinner and christmas party since we had no couch .
negative	when the pieces were finally delivered in january , 0 out of the 0 were damaged .
negative	macy ' s offered us an even exchange but explained it wouldn ' t be in until march .
negative	they left the damaged sofa at our home .
negative	the replacement pieces arrived but they were even more damaged than the first set .
negative	they took the original damaged pieces back and left the new damaged pieces with us .
negative	one is still wrapped in packaging sitting in our garage .
negative	i have spent numerous hours on the phone with customer_service and visited the store but they have offered us nothing !
negative	we were told to wait_until april when they could do another exchange .
negative	i demanded a full_refund and asked them to come pick_up the items but the earliest they can come is two_weeks .
negative	i have to wait an_additional week after that before my refund will be processed .
negative	in the meantime i have been over 0 months with no sofa and i can ' t even get a replacement until they take the broken one and give me my money back .
negative	macy ' s has shown they do not care about their customers and have no issue selling damaged pieces .
negative	i ' m extremely disappointed and intend on closing my macys card once my refund is processed .
negative	i will not do business with a company that does not stand_behind their customers .
negative	ted baker gift_cards can not be used online despite the claims that this service is temporarily unavailable and they will fix it soon .
negative	actually they have been saying this for years !
negative	i do not understand_why they would continue to lie to their customers and business partners .
negative	it is just insulting .
negative	especially considering their very high prices .
negative	these gift_cards also can not be used in john lewis , selfridges , house of fraser etc .
negative	but they continue advertising their product as something you can easily redeem .
negative	when i contacted customer_service about it repeatedly they just ignored me .
negative	other customers have had the same experience , just googleing this issue will give loads of information how they are just palming people off and continue to lie about it .
negative	i have been a fan of tb and i buy it a lot and i have had almost no_complaints about the quality or service but this is just an embarrassment to the company .
negative	what they are trying to achieve with it i do not understand .
negative	is stealing customers money and lying to them the way to do business ?
negative	just look at your rating here .
negative	this should be a wake_up call for you .
negative	there is plenty of competition out there and if you continue like this you will not last for long !
negative	# 00000000 # 00000000 horrible !
negative	placed two orders of flowers a week before it was due , canceled one order day after issued me a refund but two_weeks_later im still_waiting for it , kept the second order , sent flowers internationaly , got sent a confirm email_saying my flowers were delivered , in fact my girl friend never got the flowers ! i had to email floraqueen to find out what happened , florist car wasnt working and didnt deliever the flowers , and didnt try to redeliever them later or following_day , floraqueen " issued a refund " yea its been over two_weeks still havent got my money back , what a scam this place should of used 0000flowers instead , lost $_000 in total , it would of been nice to say hey we messed_up big time we are going to redeliever flowers to your girlfriend on us , and we will give you a refund , or hey just redeliever any flowers !
negative	!
negative	everything that could go_wrong has .
negative	fedex staff and their systems are a nightmare to deal with , they might as_well be rude and shouting it ' s the same thing as being unable to perform small tasks , unable to carry out instructions .
negative	when i call , i have to repeat myself over and over and my questions are answered with vagueness .
negative	i don ' t even know what ' s happening but fedex keeps calling , my husband and me during business hours to ask thing and inform us of stuff that is not necessary .
negative	i have called them twice and i still_haven ' t got a delivery date from them , all they do is inform me of what can ' t be done , how much money has to be paid , to customs .
negative	no other info is given , i have to pry information about banking details and package whereabouts .
negative	i can ' t even explain how they are .
negative	they have no coherency to anything they do .
negative	they have disrupted my life and taken up so much of my time that i will never get back .
negative	they are unprofessional , no concept of efficiency .
negative	my package is somewhere .
negative	please , deliver my package .
negative	ha !
negative	they told me that the grand oasis viva in cancun was 00 and over .
negative	i think not .
negative	it even said it on the confirmation .
negative	the grand oasis viva is actually 00 and over .
negative	if i had not have stumbled_upon this fact before my vacation , i would have been screwed .
negative	do not book a vacation through bookit . com .
negative	they even tried to make me pay more money after i caught them in this mistake for a different hotel .
negative	haha .
negative	i repeat do not book a vacation through this website .... ever .
negative	slow delivery although there was a bad ice storm so i will give them the benefit of the doubt .
negative	i filled_out a complaint ticket and this is day two without a call or email , though i am still within the 00 hour grace period so again ...
negative	benefit of the doubt .
negative	i paid for expensive shipping to receive the completely wrong part which is delaying the work on my car further .
negative	i ordered online from yesstyle , and some of my items i did not like and wish to return .
negative	their return_policy states that you must contact their customer_service within 00 days to get a rma_number before sending back .
negative	i ' ve been trying to call and no one picks_up the phone !
negative	its just an answering_machine .
negative	i would just send it back , but other people online have complained about sending back and never getting their money back so i want to make_sure i follow return process properly .
negative	this is not good , i will_continue to try to contact their customer_service the rest of this week to get a rma_number and time and ship back .
negative	after that i ill have to file a dispute with my credit_card company and paypal and force a return , i hope i do not have to do that .
negative	i strongly_recommend not to book travel with this company anymore .
negative	i experienced terrible product and terrible customer_service .
negative	i booked 0 return flights from vancouver to montreal .
negative	however , after pressing purchase button , the website stated that they are not able to confirm my reservation , and my credit_card may be charged .
negative	they gave_me reference # 0000000 and phone_number to call .
negative	my first thinking is this website gonna rob my money .
negative	i called that number many_times but no one answered .
negative	i waited listening for the brainwash insurance package for more than 0 hour each times .
negative	it means that i waited for more than 0 hours and still no one answered my call .
negative	i am extremely angry .
negative	if they charge my money , i will do anything to get my money back .
negative	i will never book any flights at this company any more .
neutral	viator should also always show review from the latest reviews to the oldest , instead of the " best " to the " worst " as i find is the default setting .
neutral	by showing reviews that way , it is misleading to customers , making all the tours seem fantastic , when often some tours go downhill with time .
neutral	i started_using origin because it was pushed on me for mass_effect 0 .
neutral	since then i ' ve bought a few games that are supposed to activate on origin , but the keys weren ' t recognized - for example , a bundle of spore + the expansion - the expansion activated on origin , but the game didn ' t !
neutral	i had to contact customer_service and it took 00_mins in chat with them to get them to sort the key out .
neutral	i bought sim_city 0 on origin , and managed to actually play the game ( i ' m lucky there !
neutral	), but the servers were really over - loaded and the trouble seems to have spilled over to origin itself , not just the game , because many of my friends are having trouble opening origin chats with me .
neutral	i like the games on the service , but the service itself is far too flaky these days and the drm they use is draconian .
neutral	itunes gift_card prices are too high because of " activation fee "
neutral	first time ordering from this website i was scared and seen all the reviews but i did so anyways .
neutral	all my questions was answer when i had problems with my order .
neutral	i got my necklace today and im really unhappy with it .
neutral	i can tell it was made in a rush .
neutral	i know you guys promise to get it here before_christmas and you did so but everything is wrong with it .
neutral	the clasp for the necklace was made unproperly .
neutral	i couldn ' t get my necklace on properly .
neutral	the plate is not properly support .
neutral	it could break very easy .
neutral	i will never order from this site again .
neutral	i shouldnt had in the first place and making sure my sister cancel her order today .
neutral	sorry my english is not all that good .
neutral	hi i know a lot of guys complain_about models screwing them over .
neutral	yet you have to realize that this is a job for most of us .
neutral	my name is msnightmerica and i was scammed by bloodybizzar for over 00 dollars worth of service .
neutral	i offered services in exchange for gifts on my amazon wish list .
neutral	yet after it was done the guy canceled his gifts to me so i not only wasted my time but was also bullied by this guy .
neutral	i ' m a nice girl and i keep my word on things .
neutral	i only ask that customers do what they say they will .
neutral	supplement_warehouse used to be my go - to supplement company because of their price - match guarantee and fast shipping .
neutral	repeatedly , however , the company shipped me the wrong products -- wrong flavor protein_bars , missing boxes of protein_bars , wrong flavor protein_powder .
neutral	to their credit , they were great about sending me the correct products , but it became such a hassle that i gave up on them and took my business elsewhere .
neutral	i ' m giving them another chance , so hopefully they ' ve fixed their accuracy issues .
neutral	otherwise , it is a great company .
neutral	key didn ' t work right_away - slow service
neutral	websites are easy to reade , and as a fin , it ´ s nice to have it also in my language to make shopping easy !
neutral	thank u for that .
neutral	i wish that all of your item infos could be in finnish .
neutral	but my order arrived in just 0 days , so i ´ m very pleaced with that , and just ordered a new kit to try ...
neutral	there is only one thing i was bit disappointed , there was two manual batteries instead of one of each ( manual and automatic ), as was written in discription ... but maby it was a mistake ?
neutral	well have a nice springtime and keep_up a good customerservice !
neutral	:)
neutral	at first , there were many security_checks , it ' s a good thing i ' m not complaining , but it takes a long time and it ' s annoying .
neutral	after i did all the tests i got a message that the money transferred into their account , but i ' ve still didn ' t get the key ...
neutral	suddenly i got an_email that there is a danger of a fraude in my credit_card , i was very stressful !
neutral	they asked me to write on the page cjs_cd_keys and give them my id and credit_card photo and send them .
neutral	i resisted and i consulted with friends until suddenly i got a message by email i can get my key now , i have no_idea what happened but i do not care .
neutral	the security of the site is very difficult and i ' m not sure if i ' ll buy one more time on the site , chances are that are only if there is a huge discount .
neutral	i ordered four clothing items from yesstyle , and i was pretty pleased with three of them .
neutral	however , the quality of the fourth item ( a black skirt from a taiwanese brand ) was really bad - the stitching inside the skirt was faulty , and two of the buttons came right off in my hands !
neutral	plus , the skirt came with an attached tag that still had the price sticker on it .
neutral	when i converted the currencies i realized that the price on the tag was much lower_than the price i had paid .
neutral	the skirt was most definitely not worth the price advertised on yesstyle , and i feel ripped_off for paying that much for such a shoddy item .
neutral	i won ' t be returning my purchased clothes because i ' d_rather not deal with the details of international shipping and refunds .
neutral	however , i don ' t think i ' ll be shopping with yesstyle again , since i ' d prefer all of my items to be of decent quality .
neutral	am cumparata un hdd , o unitate optica si o imprimanta ... dar dupa doua zile am_primit doar hdd -_ul .
neutral	am sunat la oktal si mi - au confirmat ca este livrata si restul marfii , am insistat si atunci au verificat din nou si au constatat ca marfa e inca la_ei in depozit .
neutral	in cele din urma dupa inca o zi marfa a ajuns_la mine .
neutral	in rest au_fost foarte amabili atat la service ( nota 00 +) cat_si la vanzari .
neutral	recomandarea mea ar fi ca cei de_la vanzari sa stiu un minim de detalii tehnice .
neutral	the prices are low and you can not find lower prices , however , the shipping cost is a bit_pricey .
neutral	i switched away from fcr . com when i realized they had my score all wrong .
neutral	their mistake caused me to negotiate for my recent car purchase thinking my credit_score was about 000 pts lower_than it actually was !
neutral	i love the car i bought , but i ' m sure i could have negotiated better terms .
neutral	this seems like a decent service , although it would be nice if there were more robust planning tools , although i realize that isn ' t exactly_what this service is for .
neutral	the only other complaint i have is that your app is not compatible with android 0 . 0 .
neutral	key lime pie will be out in a couple months ... may want to hurry up on that , lest you look out of touch with recent tech , which i would think an identity_theft prevention service would want to avoid .
neutral	the pricing is good , however the shipping on the free items increases to the point that they aren ' t free_samples .
neutral	this is my second order , with all the info on the free_samples i would get i expected something in my first order .
neutral	nothing came .
neutral	i see now at my second order that you have to select the free_samples that you get , again this ups the shipping cost .
neutral	the site isn ' t the easiest to use .
neutral	in all nothing earth shakingly different from a few of the other_sites i have used .
neutral	just a lower base price for the same product .
neutral	i received only one box of chargers out of the ten i ordered yet was still charged for all ten .
neutral	i have yet to receive a reply by email .
neutral	edit_:
neutral	they have since got back to me and are shipping the correct amount !
neutral	i placed an order once a couple months_ago .
neutral	it was for a high low ombre skirt and it was half off , they were having some promotion .
neutral	the skirt was cute but i didn ' t like the material and it was kinda big on me , because it was on sale i couldn ' t return or exchange :(.
neutral	the site is pretty nice but the prices are way over done .
neutral	i just saw some shorts on there for $_00 when g stage love has it for $_00 .
neutral	i see that a lot , plus they take_forever to restock and sell out of my sizes quick .
neutral	i placed my first order with them a few_months_ago .
neutral	the items were of pretty good quality but the good thing about the company is the prices are so cheap and they ' re selling a lot of things found on gojane and 0000ave and urbanog for way less , the only things is the cothes go out of stock fast , there ' s not a huge_selection , they could provide more details such as percentage of material that the clothes are made of , what size the model is wearing , how to care for the cothes , and they don ' t accept returns , just store_credit , which is the main_reason_why i haven ' t bought anything else from them , what if you can ' t find anything else you want ?
neutral	well , i ' ve been buying from ami for over a year now , i usually buy things i don ' t see elsewhere , or that is sold out , like simple maxi dresses for cheap and jumpsuits ( that are pricey ) and i must_say the quality is pretty good but there ' s so much that ' s not so good ..... the shipping is sky high and they are constantly having promotions ( i think because some of their prices and shipping ) but you can ' t combine the two .
neutral	then once last_year , i ordered two things , one came in the mail , i emailed them for weeks and called receiving no help and finally they send me an_email stating my refund was issued because they were sold out of that item , yet it was listed .
neutral	i was very disappointed and frustrated that i didn ' t buy from them for a long time .
neutral	also they don ' t accept returns ( when more and more huge stores have changed that policy ), i don ' t like that and that ' s why i hesitate to buy from them .
neutral	plus their clothes sell out fast and they don ' t restock until months after the fact .
neutral	the site itself is hell .
neutral	theres thousands of products but when you type in " leopard crop " polka dot leggings are also popping up , the site has a great design but it needs serious upgrading .
neutral	they definitely need major changes .
neutral	because the promotions and shipping of every other popular trendy site is going to win me over every time .
neutral	well , i think they have some really cute_clothes but their prices are too high for a full time student , such as myself and i once ordered a dress for $_00 and it was horrible .
neutral	the black and white saints and sinners dress .... the top part was stretchy but the bottom part was unflattering , stiff , and the material was not good , it should ' ve been stretchy like the top part .
neutral	then it was pulling or whatever its called when it seems as though the stitching is coming out .
neutral	so my thing is , expensive clothes ..... you ' re really just paying for the name tag because i see items on the site that are on gojane for $_00 and nasty gal has it for $_00 .
neutral	call me cheap but i ' m not paying more for something made of the same material .
neutral	is it really worth it ?
neutral	that dress wasn ' t .
neutral	the only reason_why i gave 0_stars because i love the design of the sight and the selection of clothes .
neutral	well , i ' ve been ordering from them for over a year now and i love their style variety , meaning you can be preppy , party girl , school girl , and sophisticated and chic .
neutral	i love that they have x - smalls too and around christmas they shipped my things within 0 days to get it before_christmas , which is amazing .
neutral	but their sizing is wayyyyy off , in bottoms specifically .
neutral	their quality can be an_issue too , depends on what you buy , but their jeans are weird too .
neutral	i ' m tall and thin but my legs are oddly short and their jeans seem to flatten your butt , but are wide in the hips and tight in the calf area .
neutral	like no one ' s shaped like that .
neutral	and their infamous $_00 jeans .
neutral	not worth those $_00 .
neutral	then they sometimes misrepresent an item with the wrong picture and don ' t respond to those emails sent on the site .
neutral	and i didn ' t like how at first in store they only issued store_credit but they changed that now thank_goodness .
neutral	i just wish their quality was better and that their jeans didn ' t fit so oddly
neutral	well i ' ve only ordered once from them and ordered 0 things ( crop tops ) and i love the fact that there ' s no shipping .
neutral	i hate paying for shipping but one of the tops were cheap ( like $ 0 ) and the quality was very poor but the other one was cheap too , cost more but still cheap and i love it , shipping time was good too though .
neutral	also they are expensive , a cute crop top was like almost $_00 .
neutral	i ' m giving it a 0 because i haven ' t had much experience with the site and i guess it depends on what you buy , regarding quality , and the majority of the items are very expensive .
neutral	delievery is good and customer support fast and reliable .
neutral	couple months_ago me and my friend ordered some cheap offer liquids and all of them was not so good .
neutral	that was mad cow if i remember right .
neutral	now i ordered 00 bottles e_- liquids and there was 0 different flavours as i ordered .
neutral	that was great .
neutral	now those new liquids ( cranberry , black currant and melon magic ) what i ordered tasted almost same than that mad cow .
neutral	it was like vaping soap .
neutral	i was not surprised that you did not have rate system to those eliquids in your website .
neutral	please , do not sell products what tastes bad and you surely know it .
neutral	thanks .

neutral	a guy told me about this website that sells cd - keys really cheap and had an insanely good deal for metro 0000 which i wanted to buy , so i thought i might aswell get it while i could after i looked up the site on google for confirmation that it was legit .
neutral	it was pretty easy to use but it was so fucking slow , i ordered it at 00 . 00 ( cest ) and i had to wait to the morning after to claim the game just because they didn ' t confirm my purchase or whatever , otherwise it was good , but that wait time was ridiculous .
neutral	arrived_promptly but not the colour indicated and email not responded to .
neutral	the first key i ordered was call of duty : world at world and it was already banned by punkbuster .
neutral	but within 00 hours i had a new key in my email box that worked , although it was a used key .
neutral	the support was helpful so i decided to give them another try and bought a battlefield_0 key .
neutral	they told me it was in stock when i paid for it , but when i went to collect it , nope ... they said it ' ll be here within 00 hours .
neutral	ok , but it wasn ' t .
neutral	i had to wait 0 days which after looking at their facebook_page seems to be very fast .
neutral	but i did eventually get an un - used , working key for a good price .
neutral	if you want fast and reliable keys , this isn ' t your store .
neutral	but if you have some patience they will eventually get you a key .
neutral	0 / 0 - so - so experience with some friction .
neutral	i used to book a lot with ebookers and when everything is fine that ' s great but when there ' s a problem , get ready for a lot of frustration .
neutral	so many hoops to jump_through to sort out something that was not my fault .
neutral	first time i put it down to bad luck but when similar happened , i realized that it was the system that was wrong .
neutral	now i use different sites to make my bookings .
neutral	i used to love facebook but in the last_year or so they have been going downhill a lot in my estimation .
neutral	they seem to want to control everything we do and ignore what people want .
neutral	i understand it ' s a business and they need to make money but there is a balance that they fail to achieve .
neutral	over the last 0 years i liked a number of pages but now , i never see any of their feeds .
neutral	same applies to many of my genuine friends whose feeds seem to have vanished .
neutral	if i like a page , i want to see what they post but facebook decide what i see .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	now i find myself only checking in once or twice a week for a few_minutes instead of 0 or 0 times a day .
neutral	facebook is killing what made them great and now i can happily live without it .
neutral	adobe is very expensive but i still love their software .
neutral	but i am worried_about their online business now as i only use it occasionally and because i travel a lot , i don ' t always have internet_connection .
neutral	maybe i have it wrong but i just can ' t see the online software model working for me .
neutral	i hope i ' m wrong .
neutral	i ordered star craft 0 wings of liberty from cjs recently .
neutral	before purchasing the game i was under the impression it would be almost_instant ( once i had been verified .)
neutral	unfortunately to my woe i was presented with a screen explaining it would be up to 00_hrs until the automatic key system would have more keys to offer .
neutral	i easily swallowed that and even waited 00_hrs ... still ... no love .
neutral	as you can imagine by this point i am becoming a little frustrated .
neutral	long_story short , after contacting support and being given a cursory " the supplier is being slower than usual , but they will come soon " reply .
neutral	i waited for another 0 or 0 days before i received the key .
neutral	i ' d like to say this was a once off , but on the same thing happened when they released diablo_iii and the website stated " available for instant download "
neutral	i intend to give cjs another go , however if i am met with such appalling service again , i will just pay the extra money and buy it from a shop .
neutral	honestly i ' m sick and tired of waiting ages for my cdkeys especially when i need to keep using their backwards piece of crap autokey_system ( i ' ve had one time where i actually managed to get my cdkey with it instead of constantly seeing the ' none left ' message ).
neutral	their prices are pretty half decent but the speed of receiving my orders is by_far the slowest i ' ve received ever .
neutral	the ring is beautiful itself however i feel it ' s cheaply_made i purchased the more expensive one to avoid that issue
neutral	most of the order was correct , but despite ticking their shipment sheet to say an item was correct it was actually the wrong colour and size .
neutral	no free postage returns system either .
neutral	i ordered skinfood products , a denim playsuit and a pair of fleece leggings .
neutral	the skinfood products were excellent but the playsuit was a bit big and coarse .
neutral	the leggings were horrible .
neutral	there was a piece of cloth stuck to the back that looked like a tail - it was sewed on as part of the seam so it was impossible to get_rid of completely without ruining the leggings .
neutral	this isn ' t the first time this has happened .
neutral	i ' ve also bought shoes before that have been lumpy and out of shape with the paint peeling off although it was supposed to be a pair of sneakers .
neutral	this isn ' t going to keep me from buying but i ' m definitely going to be more careful about my choices .
neutral	i think i ' ll stick to shirts and skirts .
neutral	it ' s too much money and work to return defective items from canada so nothing can be done .
neutral	:(
neutral	i always find myself going back to amazon becouse there prices are so good , however i have had several bad_experiences while buying from resellers that are allowed to advertise on there site , with one delivery taking two_weeks to arrive , the real sting in the tail was that the hd - dvd went bust a couple of weeks_later
neutral	when i first sent in my device , i was shocked at how quickly it arrived and ended_up cued up for assessment .
neutral	then radio silence - and after i week , i called to figure_out what was going on because the status said " assessing claim ."
neutral	they were super nice on the phone , and very helpful , but they didn ' t have any additional info to provide .
neutral	then , zoom - product was fixed and back in my hands .
neutral	so , if communication about that middle step was better , i ' d give them a higher rating , but i ' m still very satisfied .
neutral	i ' ve ordered a virgin brazilian lace closure and some virgin brazilian hair from this site and i would have to stay that my experience was half and half .
neutral	the lace closure was beautiful but the knots would not bleach and the hair was just gorgeous but the supplier lightly died my hair after i asked them not to .
neutral	also , when i told the first supplier that the knots on my lace closure would not bleach ( after i confirmed the order ) i never_heard from them again .
neutral	so when buying on this website please check the following :
neutral	0 .
neutral	the customer rating .
neutral	if the customer rating is below an 00 , i highly advise you not to order from that seller .
neutral	also , read all of customer feedback .
neutral	the good and the bad .
neutral	0 .
neutral	bug the hell out of them .
neutral	if you have a question about the product , ask them .
neutral	0 .
neutral	do not release your money until you receive your product .
neutral	when you place your order , it gives you and option to confirm delivery .
neutral	do not click that option until you receive your product because once they have the money , then you will never hear from them .
neutral	i hope this helps
neutral	amazon is a great place to find just about anything the only bad thing about the website is who your seller is and if they are legit .
neutral	i ' ve only , thankfully , had one bad_experience where i never received my product and the seller disappeared .
neutral	on the bright side , amazon came through and refunded my purchase .
neutral	other than that , if its fulfilled by amazon you ' re pretty_much insured .
neutral	great website to look for random trinkets .
neutral	there is too much security on the auto_key .
neutral	it just gets annoying .
neutral	but i got my code .
neutral	for what its worth - you prices are great !
neutral	customer_service when i call in is great !
neutral	handling of my order very poor .
neutral	i put my order in on a sunday_night received an_email about the price_match invalid monday_morning .
neutral	called in that monday_morning , the lady on the phone was very helpful in resolving the issue .
neutral	look to see my tracking_number today ( after a full 00hrs ) order still in process .
neutral	called to see if the my order had been shipped .
neutral	i was told it will take a another 00hrs .
neutral	i understand thing take time but , 00hrs just to process a small order of 0 things .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	i don ' t think i will recommend anyone to order from here , non will i again .
neutral	simply just taking way to long to process .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i ordered my batman : arkham city cdkey 0 days_ago .
neutral	today , i finally got it .
neutral	the price is okay and the game is completely legit , but there are alot of different sites wich i prefer over this due to the lack of service and the time needed to redeem your game code .
neutral	also , information about how to actually get the game is really unclear .
neutral	legit , but slow .
neutral	obs : comprei dia_00 / 00 / 0000 e ata hoje 00 / 00 / 0000 ainda esta em processamento
neutral	i always order from tigerfitness . com .
neutral	i saw that supplement_warehouse had a sale on my favorite protein for a real good price .
neutral	i usually spend about $_000 - 000 every 0 months or so so i figured i would just open an account at sw and get my order there .
neutral	i placed the order in a sunday .
neutral	it says it hasn ' t shipped yet on tuesday so i called .
neutral	" it will ship today sir " okay so wed goes by and i check around lunch time on thursday .
neutral	" oh i ' m very sorry it will ship today to get there saterday ".
neutral	fri i get a phone call , it ' s sw letting my know my order has shipped today and will get there monday !
neutral	i will say te lady was very nice and assured me they emailed me some great coupons and give me a lot of free_samples .
neutral	meanwhile j ran out of protein and wondered why the hell i ever left tigerfitness . com ?
neutral	dont get me wrong , its a great site but in my area it has fewer courses than golf now and also has no mobile_app .
neutral	a big thing that keeps me from using site more is having to print out a confirmation_email out to take to the course .
neutral	its these little things that have me overlooking this site when i book my rounds .
neutral	yesstyle has a huuuge selection to choose from , so there ' s bound to be something you like .
neutral	i haven ' t been able to buy much , just a skirt and a dress and now 0 coats , but i loved them !
neutral	:) just be prepared to wait for a little while if you buy something or make_sure to buy it way ahead of time if it ' s for a special_occasion or a certain season .
neutral	thanks for all the cute stuff and affordable shipping !
neutral	:) i know i used to not be able to get clothes like these from the internet because the shipping and random fees were crazy .
neutral	edit ;
neutral	i didn ' t take my own advice , lol .
neutral	i ordered 0 coats about a month_ago and it took 0 weeks to be notified that my order was canceled .
neutral	:( trying to order something else now , fingers_crossed it doesn ' t happen again ...
neutral	good , but lost the battle to facebook because they started to copy it .
neutral	i love all the clothes yesstyle has to offer ( so many cute ones !
neutral	), but i hate playing the waiting game when i unknowingly order something that isn ' t technically in stock .
neutral	i ' ve_seen " waiting in stock " in my account for weeks , and i know there ' s a possibility that my order will be cancelled ( this has happened to me before ).
neutral	this experience has killed my desire to order anything else from yesstyle for a while , despite having my eye on a few items .
neutral	i don ' t want to be entirely negative , though .
neutral	i made another order a few_months_ago that went_smoothly , and i was very happy with my purchase !
neutral	in the end , the product arrived in reasonable time and a great price , so i have little to complain_about .
neutral	but the items took close to a week just to ship .
neutral	and when the two boxes arrived , they were both previously opened .
neutral	i absolutely adore the clothes and shoes .
neutral	they are so fun and beautiful .
neutral	however , the service can be better .
neutral	shipping takes too long ; what i mean by that is that there are times where i ' ve waited 0 weeks with complaint .
neutral	if i ' m paying $_00 -$ 00 in standard_shipping , i ' d like to receive my products within 0 business days .
neutral	also , amiclubwear should deliver the correct sizes .
neutral	not to mention , they should list model measurements for more accurate sizes .
neutral	i ' d hate to purchase a small and it fits like a large , or purchase a large and it fits like a small .
neutral	sometimes , the shoe_sizes either run too large or too_small and it ' s not noted on the site .
neutral	better service and measurements would be nice .
neutral	hi , i just bought a couple of jeans from the store and when they arrived i found out that they were too big in the waist for me .
neutral	i repacked the jeans and was filling out a return note .
neutral	but the only address i could find was a po box .
neutral	i send it anyway .
neutral	hopefully it will get there ?
neutral	long shipping times and some bad quality items .
neutral	last time i order 0 or 0 items i dont remember well , but only end up getting 0 of them because after i order you guys run out of inventory .
neutral	its not fair , you stayed with the money which i just used , but it was disappointing to order so many items to end up with only 0 :(.
neutral	i hope this time i can get everything i ordered and as_soon as possible , my dad is coming to cr in 00 days , if my things don ' t arrive on the estimated date i won ' t get my stuff :(
neutral	this website provides an excellent service for pc_games in particular , especially when it offers new games at better prices than steam .
neutral	however , the autokey service is a bit finicky , and could do with some refinement .
neutral	i recommend this website to anyone_who is a pc_gamer .
neutral	nice color of my nail polish !
neutral	the bling bling effect that i really love it !
neutral	good selection of products , however delivery took ages .
neutral	was very had to contact amazon , but overall not a bad_experience .
neutral	will be buying from ebay again in the future .
neutral	the website was easy to maneuver however the wait time to recieve the product is a bit long and the return_policy is for only product that is returned unopened .
neutral	they don ' t seem to have anything such as a 00 day replacement policy if broken within that time .
neutral	and that lack makes it a bit risky to buy since the necklaces can be a bit pricy depending_on your budget .
neutral	such a huge_variety of products .
neutral	although a little over priced .
neutral	i ’ ve noticed that the presentation of the app is well - thought and easy to understand for everyone .
neutral	the product seems fairly good
neutral	i ordered an origin game code , and as i live overseas from my home usa billing_address my order was flagged as potentially fraudulent .
neutral	this isn ' t something new so i was somewhat expecting it .
neutral	i was told to use their support system to provide identification to allow the transaction to be promised .
neutral	their support page states that most inquiries and support answers take 0 hour but could take up to 00 hours .
neutral	i ordered before their uk office hours stated , so i went out after providing the necessary documents and came home later at night around 00 hours_later to find i had not been taken_care of yet .
neutral	i wrote a quick note in their support system and asked if they planned on taking care of it within that work day .
neutral	they replied about 0 hours_later telling me to attach the necessary identification documents to the support system .
neutral	i had already done that in the first message , but i attached them again just so they could get it in the newer message .
neutral	i still wasn ' t getting that quick service i had expected , so i sent a message on their fb and twitter accounts .
neutral	finally after about 00 + hours of waiting for my code i finally got it .
neutral	now assuming they now know my identification and paypal is legitimate , i ' m hoping i won ' t have to go through this again ( this was actually my second order , and i had to identify myself then , so maybe i ' ll have to do it everytime ...).
neutral	the prices are good , and the codes have worked both times , so i ' ll just chalk it up to a slow day and hope for better service in the future .
neutral	shipping was slow but products were great and exactly how they appeared in picture !
neutral	i ' m a happy customer .
neutral	i have been losing_weight after my second baby so e0p has been a god send for me .
neutral	i have been able to get nice tops that fit me at each stage of my weight_loss without breaking the bank .
neutral	however the sizing on trousers is so far off , i bought a pair of size 00s a while back and since then i have dropped to a slim size 00 and the trousers are still nowhere near buttoning up !
neutral	the leg length is always long so for me ( 0 " 0 ) even with heels they are too long and i think that should be mentioned in the description .
neutral	shoes are also a little on the small fitting side .
neutral	postage is good , orders come quickly and tracking them is excellent .
neutral	another thing worth mentioning is the quality is great - especially for the price about 00 % of the time , you will get some items that will fall apart after a few washes or lose their shape .
neutral	for me thats not a problem as i am replacing with smaller clothes anyway after a couple of months but if your weight is stable you wont get long_term use from the clothes .
neutral	everything is high end and over priced .
neutral	the uggs are cheaper at norstroms .
neutral	they have very nice things but since they dont have an english option , makes it hard to know what your buying and how much .
neutral	american consumers would jump on that if they could read what it was .
neutral	makes doing anything impossible .
neutral	is incomaptible with my school and what they allow to upload .
neutral	if u wanna upgrade you mac it cost just as much as a new notebook from dell , that comes with all the programing you need
neutral	good clothes and didn ' t take long to come but one item was out of stock so i didn ' t get it
neutral	pretty good company , like the price_match .
neutral	shipping can be a bit much and isn ' t all that fast .
neutral	offer free_samples but over charge for shipping on all be_careful of this .
neutral	i ' ve been a customer of myprotein for quite a few_years_now , and up until a few_months_ago their service had been amazing .
neutral	unfortunately since what seems to have been a major expansion of their business to europe and vast more quantities of products the service has decreased in my view .
neutral	the products are still top_notch and there ' s a great choice of options to meet a wide_range of requirements but delivery times just hasn ' t been met on atleast 0 occassions now .
neutral	since the introduction of pretty_much no choice but next_day delivery my deliveries have been late by 0 - 0 days everytime .
neutral	since i pay roughly £ 0 . 00 per delivery i don ' t expect this .
neutral	i am a uni student and often i order before going home or back to uni , the delivery not arriving on time has often lead to me running out of shake and then ofcourse i ' m in a different town to where i asked for the items to be delivered because i had to go home or to uni !
neutral	when i emailed to complain , no compensation or even apology as far as i remember was offered .
neutral	only ' so has it arrived today then ?'
neutral	the day after .
neutral	poor service and it ' s a shame as myprotein used to be so brilliant at everything they offered .
neutral	as i said the products are still great though !
neutral	i placed an order which took over a month to arrive at my door .
neutral	some of the items were cancelled due to the fact that they were out of stock .
neutral	i love the selection on the website .
neutral	they ' re not what you would see in any mall in us , and the fact that they sell asian_clothing is appealing to me since i am asian myself ( and i ' m into these styles of clothing ) the price is another downfall for this website especially for low - income people such as students in this economy .
neutral	they ' re not outrageously expensive , but they ' re not cheap either .
neutral	what keeps me coming_back to this website is the seemingly infinite selection of clothing , makeup , and accessories .
neutral	i would order once in a blue moon , not frequently
neutral	would i recommend this site ?
neutral	maybe .
neutral	only for people with patience and money .
neutral	in short :
neutral	pros
neutral	- huge_selection of all things fashion / makeup / etc
neutral	- high definition ( not fuzzy ) pictures
neutral	- most items have a variety of pictures
neutral	- good customer_service
neutral	- many things on sale ( mostly 00 %_off .. as far as i can tell )
neutral	- these kinds of clothing are what i would love to wear
neutral	- free shipping with minimum purchase
neutral	cons
neutral	- price is a bit high ...
neutral	- shipping is on the slow end ...
neutral	i don ' t think it should have taken a whole month to receive what i ordered
neutral	- you might get a little headache because they have so many things .. but maybe that is a good thing (;
neutral	its ok for ebay and stuff , but i perfer other online transaction companies
neutral	i went on cjskeys to get some games , the where very cheap so allowed me to get dlc if i bought them aswell , i went_ahead and got borderlands_0 ru edition and it turns_out i was sent a key that was already activated , however !
neutral	staff have been amazing in trying to get me a replacement and i hope we can get this sorted asap , good service , but autokey needs some work .
neutral	péssimo atendimento , vários e_- mails e não respondem nenhum ...
neutral	numero de rastreamento ln000000000us que me enviaram no dia_00 de junho e até agora nao tem nada no site ...
neutral	cjs_cd_keys gave_me a key for a game that is sold out everywhere_else at a very reasonable price .
neutral	however the website lists " instant download "
neutral	which was not the fact , i first had to follow an anti_fraud_verification ,
neutral	( send them an official document with my name on it )
neutral	after this ( took a lot more than the max .
neutral	0 hours as cjs_cd_keys stated ) my key should be ready to download .
neutral	but when i tried to download the key i got a message : " no keys are currently stored on our online system for this game ".
neutral	so i mailed cjs_cd_keys right_away .
neutral	after this within a few hours i was able to download the key .
neutral	so the website is a bit deceptive , but not a scam .
neutral	you get were you pay for ... eventually .
neutral	there products are cheap but there shipping and handeling is outrageous i have apo address and bodybuilding . com will ship here for about 0 00_bucks no_matter how much you order .
neutral	these_guys charged me between 00 and 00_bucks for a few items
neutral	placed an order with amazon and got my order 0 weeks_later very slow shipping
neutral	my nearest best buy is quite a long trip from my home and workplace .
neutral	i like to pick items up rather_than wait around for deliveries though .
neutral	i regularly use the bestbuy website to arrange collect at store purchases and have never had a problem .
neutral	admittedly , sometimes they ' re more expensive than mail order only places but the convenience and speed makes it worth using them for urgent purchases .
neutral	i can ' t comment on their returns_policy because i ' ve never had a problem with anything i ' ve bought .
neutral	i guess that ' s a plus !
neutral	ud over at netværkert offte skrider , så informerer de heller_ikke når de får billigere abonementer end det man tidligere havde .
neutral	men de har_altid nyeste telefoner og priserne_er efterhånden acceptable .
neutral	yesterday i bought tickets for tomorrowland in belgium .
neutral	i received the confirmation saying that the tickets will arrive 0 days before the concert but i live in mexico and i wont be in mexico 0 days before the festival , i will be travelling .
neutral	i tried to reach viagogo but it seems very dificult to reach them .
neutral	i saw that they answer in this forum so is there anyone from viagogo that could help me .
neutral	can i pick_up personally the tickets on the uk office ?
neutral	hope answers soon i spent a lot of money on those tickets .
neutral	thanks
neutral	good because i received my key , buggy because i only got 0 chance at phone id check ( it said 0 i ' m sure ), and frustrating because after i had gone though all that wile it was in stock , but it was out of stock when i was done so i had to wait_till morning .
neutral	i have ordered from them many_times .
neutral	i have never had a problem .
neutral	i once ordered an adapter for my 0g iphone .
neutral	it didn ' t work for the 0g .
neutral	they refunded my money , no questions_asked , and didn ' t need me to ship anything back !
neutral	the first order went through without_any issue but recently an order was delayed by 0 days .
neutral	the stock information at the time of purchase was false which was a major cause of discomfort .
neutral	if they don ' t have the keys stocked , the stock information should indicate that accurately .
neutral	otherwise i got a reply every time i emailed them , thats a good thing .
neutral	however they were unable to give a conclusive time at which i would receive my key .
neutral	please improve your stock information , i guess the staff got swamped by the diablo_0 release because of which the rest of the customers had to pay the price .
neutral	i originally placed this order without_any problem .
neutral	however when the order was shipped it was shipped via ups to my billing_address , which is a p . o .
neutral	box .
neutral	whether it was through error of mine or not , supplementwarehouse . com never made an attempt to contact me to ask for a different shipping address .
neutral	they shipped my order to my p . o .
neutral	box , knowing that ups doesn ' t ship to p . o .
neutral	boxes .
neutral	the day of delivery , i don ' t know how or why , someone , i don ' t know who , made the decision that since they couldn ' t ship to my p . o .
neutral	box , instead of shipping back to the supplementwarehouse . com , they decided to ship to my old address , where i no_longer resided .
neutral	when i contacted supplementwarehouse . com , i spoke with lisa courtney , who had no_clue what was going on , but offered to re - ship my order .
neutral	granted , this all took forever , and i was not pleased with the fact that my order got lost , lisa , did come through and even substituted 0 00 servings of xtend because the flavor i wanted was out in the 00 servings container .
neutral	i was a little unimpressed with the fact that my order was not express shipped due to the error , but i guess the free shake cup makes up for it .
neutral	i wasn ' t pleased with the experience , and i don ' t know if i ' ll order from them again , but i give credit to lisa and her customer_service for getting things done , despite numerous roadblocks .

neutral	i ' ll start with the positives .
neutral	yelp is the only tool i use , other than word of mouth , for deciding where to dine .
neutral	i value the opinions of other yelp users , and appreciate seeing photos of the food and the establishment .
neutral	i enjoy reading_reviews that are concise and to the point , and those that are a bit more superfluous and detailed .
neutral	the negative aspect of yelp is the review hiding .
neutral	i ' ve had multiple very legitimate reviews of mine hidden , mostly negative_reviews .
neutral	this makes me think these businesses have paid to have my review suppressed .
neutral	this is a shady practice .
neutral	other businesses are forced to pay for their yelp accounts so they all of the positive_reviews showed_up .
neutral	i ' ve_seen businesses with average to poor ratings with many positive , legitimate sounding reviews left out .
neutral	if yelp would stop being so shady , i would rate them better .
neutral	both businesses and consumers are affected by their practices , and unless you look at the hidden reviews , you might not be getting the full picture .
neutral	i use spotcrime . com to keep me aware of crimes in my area .
neutral	this is especially useful for finding out what areas tend to have more criminal activity .
neutral	i receive bi - weekly emails updating me on things that have happened nearby .
neutral	this would be very useful for someone trying to decide on an area to live or open a business .
neutral	the negatives are that the site isn ' t very user_friendly and could use some help layout - wise
neutral	i ordered the scooter for £_00 two_weeks_ago , rode the scooter for literally 00 minutes , after following all the instructions provided in the product manual .
neutral	however after that the scooter wouldn ' t charge any more and couldn ' t reach top speed any - more .
neutral	the scooter was literally falling_apart after 00 hours of having received it .
neutral	i contacted wowcher immediately then , and have been sending them 0 emails a day with no reply .
neutral	however i did receive an_email earlier but it was in my junk mails , so their customer_service score is high because they replied on the given time , but nevertheless would appreciate it in the future if product quality was tested on specific products .
neutral	ok company , third time in using and will be the last .
neutral	kept me waiting for my payment for awhile , but after umpteen messages , i finally got my pay .
neutral	you can ' t argue with the selection , and the quality of the goods i ' ve purchased on the site are surprisingly good .
neutral	what drives me batty is the ridiculous service model : it takes weeks to put_together your order , assuming they even can ; if they can ' t , they hold your refund for several days or weeks after .
neutral	returning items is a significant chore : beyond paying for the return shipping , you have to wait for it to be repackaged and shipped back to hong_kong for verification ; it can take 0 - 00 weeks to get reimbursed , preventing you from exchanging for the items you do want , since those items are likely to be long gone .
neutral	this is my last order with them -- using up credit -- until they start doing distribution for american customers from america , not hong_kong .
neutral	prices are cheap ... until you add in the shipping .
neutral	so i only have 0 hour ' s experience of trust_pilot but my first impressions are :
neutral	0 . very much dislike having to log in with facebook - have some alternative idea ' s on how to tackle the issue ' s of ' real ' reviewers - other than forcing facebook on users .
neutral	0 .
neutral	nice fluid website
neutral	0 .
neutral	easy to leave reviews - i would prefer 00 point option rather_than 0 .. especially since you collate the data into ' out of 00 ' format .
neutral	0 .
neutral	biggest gripe is the lack of grouping similar companies and lack of specifics in searching .
neutral	i tried to compare mobile service providers - preferably the big 0 , it was very difficult .
neutral	also the fact that you don ' t aggregate reviews / take into account number of reviews as_opposed to making somebody with 0 ( 0 star ) reviews is higher_than someone with 00 , 000 0 / 0 star reviews .
neutral	it means you have to trawl through nobody ' s or small_businesses who ' s mates are just rating them , as_opposed to the real players or likely companies users are looking for .
neutral	i like the interface , i think there are massive opportunities for this company and can see a lot of interesting revenue streams while keeping users happy .
neutral	it will be interesting to see if the bosses employ the same strategy as i would .
neutral	i would love to see what their model is and maybe these_guys would be a sweet investment .
neutral	right now its a 0 / 00 from me .
neutral	i was happy with the price of the item i purchased , however the only problem i had with the website was it didn ' t allow combined shipping .
neutral	in fact when i tried to add more items to my cart it would only let me process one item at a time .
neutral	if you wanted to order more you had to pay individual shipping for each item ordered .
neutral	i wanted to buy 0 nurses hats but only purchased 0 because of the shipping .
neutral	when i recieved my package it had sufficient room in it for 0 more hats .
neutral	i ordered a dress for a hen do and returned it as faulty , then received an_email confirming my refund but had not refunded the delivery costs so i had to email to request the refund .
neutral	i always find the quality of items is a bit hit and miss from boohoo some things are really good others are not good and not really as they appear in the pictures .
neutral	but good airline .
neutral	great routes to the east europe areas .
neutral	i purchased a $_00 game from cjs_cd_keys and i regretted i , t because it took almost 00 hours before i could receive my product .
neutral	after submitting my order the system asked me to do three things for security :
neutral	0 .
neutral	verify my email address through and email they sent me .
neutral	- completely understandable , since they need to prevent automated programs from spamming their servers .
neutral	every company does this .
neutral	0 .
neutral	verify my paypal email address .
neutral	- it was my wife ' s , so i semi understood why they wanted me to do this .
neutral	0 .
neutral	verify a phone_number .
neutral	i didn ' t understand this step at all .
neutral	i couldn ' t find my cell_phone , so i gave the system my land line .
neutral	i prompted for it to call me as my land line is unable to get sms messages .
neutral	the system decided that my phone was a cell_phone and would not call me .
neutral	it force me to have to submit an sms message .
neutral	i was stuck without my game because i did have text messaging and the system wouldn ' t let me use my phone .
neutral	so the system doesn ' t work very well since it was completely wrong about my phone and i don ' t get the reason for verifying a phone_number anyway .
neutral	it let you change the number so it never verified anything that had to do with me .
neutral	how does this have anything to do with security ?
neutral	so i choose the second option of providing two forms of identification and sending it to them , but blacking out all information except my address .
neutral	how is this an alternative to a phone_number ?
neutral	does the phone_number verify you address ?
neutral	this is more security protocols than my bank goes through to create a bank_account .
neutral	it is just a $_00 game ... come on .
neutral	on a positive note i received a response very quickly , but had to resend the data since i used my wife ' s paypal_account .
neutral	i thought about all the verification they provided and the mistakes i was seeing on the website and i was a little afraid .
neutral	i mean they misspell authorized in the email they send .
neutral	perhaps it is not a legit company ?
neutral	i am afraid that the multiple email verification and phone / address verification is being sold to other_companies or going to be used for nefarious intentions .
neutral	i am really worried_about it .
neutral	i have changed all my email account passwords and going to check my credit history soon to make_sure nothing was sold .
neutral	steam is having issues connecting to the server , so i am not sure if the product key works , but will update you guys soon .
neutral	i would not recommend this site for buying your games .
neutral	i have received the game that i ordered , although through a fair bit of hassle but in the end they came through .
neutral	i appreciate the assistance and the polite nature in which they gave their response but i ' d also warn people to be wary that there may be some technical hiccups that mare their usage of this site .
neutral	all in all , they did come through , so i ' ll give them that but the technical_issues are off putting and hopefully in the future they will be seen to .
neutral	:)
neutral	estou preocupado , pois a dada de_entrega era de 0 a 00_dias ...
neutral	e já fazem 00_dias e nd , não consigo rastrear e não tenho informações dobre meus produtos .. mas espero_que chegue logo ...
neutral	for the most part , the prices are very good , but i did find better prices for similar items on competitor sites .
neutral	the 0 % price undercut is a great feature , but is only useful if supplement_warehouse carries the same exact product as the competitor which in many cases , it does not .
neutral	the selection is not fantastic and the website itself is very difficult to navigate .
neutral	the ability to browse by category would be a huge improvement .
neutral	the shipping_costs are way too high !
neutral	this should be fixed asap - i may have saved a few dollars on my order , but i would have been better off ordering it from a competitor and paying about half as much for shipping .
neutral	it would have worked out to probably less money .
neutral	my big problem with paypal is their customer_service .
neutral	i use it a lot because i ' m a frequent buyer on ebay but when things go_wrong - i dread going through the customer_service .
neutral	if you ' re scammed - there is nothing they can do for you and that is laziness on their part .
neutral	prices are sometimes way too off .
neutral	however you can catch some discount periods and make good purchases .
neutral	i gave amiclubwear 0_stars because they have fair customer_service .
neutral	they somtimes respond in a timely matter .
neutral	they also have a great amount of cloths to choose from however the quality is very poor shoes in particular .
neutral	i have spent thousands with this company ... my suggestions for improvement would be to bring back some of the cloths and styles they had before also train there staff better to handle problems and process orders in a more timely matter it says 0 - 0 business days for regular items i would appreciate if they stuck to there policy also a major problem there having more frequently is not shipping certain items and not notifying that customer .. people if u dont check you wont know and they wont tell you .. that is a major issue for me ..
neutral	the first order i made with them went fine but on the second order the product page says they have over 00 keys in stock and they are available for instant_delivery .
neutral	so i ordered through moneybookers to get the instant_delivery only to find that they don ' t actually have any of the keys in stock and i need to wait 00 hours
neutral	was a good deal on titanfall .
neutral	i happened to order right as the telephone verification service went offline , so it took about 0 hours to get my key , but supposedly it happens a lot shorter than that .
neutral	i will buy from cdkeyhouse in the future .
neutral	i usually order food from seamless and its accurate for placing order , but the site itself has several flaws .
neutral	many_times it has difficulty to load properly or does not load at all ( i have tried several browsers and removed cookies ect ) but still it doesn ' t load .
neutral	in addition when it comes to rating restaurants several errors occur or the review button cannot even be pushed .
neutral	edit_: my case was resolved after calling their costumer_service .
neutral	yet i faced several difficulties as the terms and conditions were not clear on booking time ( at_least to me ) and their website suffered several error when i attempted to log - in , reset password , send contact form and make payments .
neutral	also the automated email had some typos regarding the amount of deposit and the dates which confused us .
neutral	the site definitely needs improvement since the error messages are several and important and this is a pity since the costumer_service on the telephone were really helpful .
neutral	the deal offered through the website was very good , but we had the afrementioned difficulties until we had it .
neutral	product :
neutral	the price is a little high for the quality and the items need to dispatch from vendors sooner .
neutral	however , the retention program is great .
neutral	i am also very impressed with this feedback collection method .
neutral	i also very much like the large product photos and precise measurements .
neutral	platform ux :
neutral	the massive content from vendor to vendor is not most browse friendly .
neutral	it is slightly difficult to navigate and very difficult to perform search .
neutral	the keyword search needs to be mapped to the relavant category , so the user can further narrow_down the search .
neutral	improvement :
neutral	there are many things that are not optimized on the site .
neutral	i would assume the abandoned cart rate is high ?
neutral	need to implement a drip marketing program to improve conversion .
neutral	i would suggest the site to track consumer browsing behavioral data and suggest product accordingly in addition to presenting the recently viewed .
neutral	would also suggest the site to adopt generated content ( product review ).
neutral	i would also want to see a " view all " option instead of having to go from page to page .
neutral	there are many more thing i would change but i usually charge for this .
neutral	:_p
neutral	conclusion :
neutral	a great commerce site .
neutral	would need some work to take it to the next level , but the company would need to hire some talents for that to happen .
neutral	for now , a for the consumer goods .
neutral	b - for the platform .
neutral	in the short run i don ' t see potential competitor threat .
neutral	i just hope it doesn ' t fall behind in the world of ecommerce .
neutral	it ' s a good website .
neutral	but prices are expensive for me .
neutral	they have cute_clothes but some are not worth the price .
neutral	at the first time when i saw clothes on yesstyle . com , i was not sure whether i would get the one i wanted , because clothes here are sold at cheaper price .
neutral	but when i got those clothes , awesome .
neutral	i still like to wear those asian_style clothes .
neutral	just one thing you need to make_sure is that quality of clothes is various .
neutral	but overall , it is good .
neutral	you can be a good asian stylist with clothes from here !
neutral	:)
neutral	i think the iphone 0 cover i order fitted too snugly with the phone & it was very difficult to take it out .
neutral	the pull - out tab to pop the phone out didn ' t work as_well .
neutral	had to use a plier to pry the phone out of the snugg cover .
neutral	perhaps it shouldn ' t be manufactured too tightly .
neutral	i ' d actually would like mine to be replaced for a new one .
neutral	was pretty excited to receive it though .
neutral	great product fast shipping but info on page said product was made in italy though real product was made in china .
neutral	i did my research and found out ray_ban had began recently to make more of its products in china so does not mean product is a replica .
neutral	should update to not mislead consumers .
neutral	priceline did find us a nice hotel , but after we checked in we realized that if we had just went to the hotels personal website we could have saved money !
neutral	i thought that was supposed to be pricelines job , guess they fell short this time .
neutral	on the whole dealing_with bullionvault was a positive_experience .
neutral	the only issue i had was with respect to changing my linked account .
neutral	around 0000 , my linked account was closed because of theft .
neutral	however i forgot to update bullionvault on this .
neutral	by the time i realized this i was no_longer in the country of my linked account .
neutral	the process to change the linked account became very tedious as to be almost_impossible .
neutral	however in the end after a long time , i received some very good customer_service and was able to change my linked account .
neutral	seemed like a brilliant idea , especially for someone short on time ... no more trips to selfridges to get the pods !
neutral	unfortunatly , although you may save about a £ 0 ... the quality of this coffee , is pretty poor in comparison to the nespresso ....
neutral	it just tastes very weak and watered down ... no different if you was to make a weak cafetiere coffee ...
neutral	have to say i am quite disappointed .... especially as i am now stuck with 000 pods !
neutral	i ' ve ordered three cd_keys from these_guys .
neutral	they don ' t make their hours of operation visible .
neutral	i ordered these keys around 0 :_00pm mst only to find out that their hours of operation are 0am - 0pm gmt .
neutral	the reason i purchased these keys was so that i could play the game with some friends that night .
neutral	the keys didn ' t end up coming until 0 :_00am the next_day .
neutral	keys work perfect though .
neutral	i placed the order a month back and was told to wait 00 working days for delivery to singapore .
neutral	have emailed twice since then regarding my order which i still havent received .
neutral	i always get an_automated response that i will be contacted soon .
neutral	its been over a month since the items were shipped and i have no_idea how long it will take before they reach me or if they even reach me .
neutral	me and my buddy both ordered 00 roses for our girls through florist . co . uk
neutral	my girl received roses with a whole bunch of white flowers too , which - fortunately - she loved !
neutral	his girlfriend received white lilies , which is one of the most stupid , unacceptable and bizarre things i can imagine on valentines_day ..
neutral	that ' s right .
neutral	they delivered a flower associated with funerals , to a girl expecting roses .
neutral	what a joke !
neutral	i was very lucky - he was spitting razorblades .
neutral	i certainly won ' t chance it again - back to interflora !
neutral	die blumen zur beerdigung meiner oma kamen puenklich an . ich hatte ein weisses trauergesteck bestellt und es kam leider ein grosser weiss / rosa farbener blumenstrau $ an , der bildlich total abweichend war als online dargestellt !

neutral	when trying to finish my order , the website kept sending me to the wrong page .
neutral	it happened about 0 times .
neutral	i finally called customer_service and asked if i could just purchase them over the phone , but that is not an option they told me .
neutral	they were very professional and kind , but not extremely_helpful .
neutral	finally i turned my computer off and restarted everything .
neutral	that seemed to work .
neutral	but it was confusing and very frustrating when it wasn ' t working right .
neutral	i was happy and excited when it finally went through !
neutral	i knew sky_tours days_ago , i deny that the prices were good , after i bought the ticket , there is nothing asking about passport or any verification .
neutral	the eticket was not issued for a day after the payment .
neutral	then when i opened a ticket i request to cancel the ticket and when i ' ll get the refund , they mentioned 0 or 0 days .
neutral	now it ' s more than 0 days and i didn ' t get anything .
neutral	the support replying very late , today i sent three times no one replied !
neutral	!
neutral	the time in the support portal is not correct , i know about the time difference , but even i wrote a reply after another one with a prior time !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i live in wi and ordered the fitnesspro super whey ( 0lb ) chocolate through the website .
neutral	the price was / is great however the shipping really minimizes that .
neutral	living less_than 00 minutes from their warehouse and having to pay $_00 + for shipping seems extreme , okay it is extreme .
neutral	i will have to look at their retail store but ( based on the website information ) assume the prices will be higher which doesn ' t make much sense considering how close they are to eachother .
neutral	for may people_who do not live in wi this is not even an option however .
neutral	the purchasing process was quick and easy and shipping was quick ( good thing again for the price of it !).
neutral	i wish supplement_warehouse had options for cheaper shipping , however other than that i will at_least look at them again before buying supplements other_places .
neutral	as far as the product itself , it was exactly as_described .
neutral	i ordered a book from them .
neutral	i received it in a very timely_manner and was pleased with the service .
neutral	although it took a while , it did arrive when they said it would .
neutral	yesstyle has an amazing selection of trendy and not - so - normal items .
neutral	there ' s bound to be something for you at a reasonable price ( until you tack on that mandatory express_shipping ).
neutral	and when you find that wonderful piece of clothing to complete your look you place that order in joy , only to be e_- mailed a week_later telling you that your item is no_longer in stock and a half - hearted robot automated sorry for the inconvenience message !
neutral	happened to me 0 times just trying to order a coat for winter ... by the time i was actually able to buy and receive a coat winter was already over .
neutral	now i have an expensive clothing hanger decoration .
neutral	yesstyle would genuinely by a 0 - star establishment if they updated their stock frequently so i ' m not wasting my time buying items that don ' t exist .
neutral	walmart has sort of a bad reputation , although most of it is not true .
neutral	their prices are low and they probably have some questionable business practices as with most giant corporations .
neutral	the customer_service is terrible and you should not expect much from the employees as they are probably already understaffed so they are all overworked .
neutral	i used to work for walmart and this is how it was pretty_much every night .
neutral	but , their products are not low quality , and the overall experience isn ' t bad .
neutral	i am looking for delivery ... ㅜㅜ
neutral	agoda best option to book a room due to affordable price .
neutral	nice company seller key but keep fast okey :_d
neutral	the delivery didn ' t come in until a few_days after promised date & when i got it , product was damaged .
neutral	guess price was just too good to be true .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	this is my first time purchasing something from missguided .
neutral	i love the unique clothes and the great prices , i live in the united_states ( richmond , va ) but i have some questions that i ' m a little concern about .
neutral	i ordered about five items on april_00th (# 000000000 ) for my birthday and it ' s now april_00th ; and i just wanted to know when should i expect my orders .
neutral	i ' m not trying to be anxious or rude because i understand that the store is over_seas and it takes time , but i started to read the comments on the store and i ' m a little worried if i gave my money to the wrong company . i spend over $_00 to get the free shipping , i really love the stores at whole but i don ' t want to spend money and my purchase come 0 months_later .
neutral	i ' m new at ordering and i just want someone to tell me approx .
neutral	how long does it take to ship from the uk to the us ?
neutral	i tried to use the tracking device you guys provided but it wouldn ' t go through .
neutral	does that mean it hasn ' t shipped out yet ?
neutral	how long does it takes ?
neutral	hopes to here something soon .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i have used amazon quite a few_times .
neutral	a little harder of a website to use , and have had complications with services and coupons they have offered .
neutral	i ordered 00 boas the shipping on it was almost $_00 !
neutral	about 0 / 0 of my total ordering price .
neutral	i recived them , opened them and they are not what i expected .
neutral	the description seems to be inaccurate , and the photo misleading .
neutral	the boas were very cheaply_made , made a mess everywhere .
neutral	ordered a ring for my anniversary , and wired the money through the next_day .
neutral	but three_weeks after , the order was still " inprocess ".
neutral	called a bunch of times and each time i was told it takes time for the money to get through to them .
neutral	i don ' t believe any ach clearing takes that long .
neutral	finally i sent an_email to their customer_service , and wrote a couple of bad_reviews for them .
neutral	next_morning , the manager called and helped to resolve the issue rather swiftly , considering the online reviews .
neutral	apparently my bank did not give them my name when they wired the money over , so they did not know for which order to apply the money .
neutral	i have since updated this review , although i still have my reservations .
neutral	they are professional in there service .
neutral	i am an_avid gamer , and i have games on origin , steam .
neutral	uplay , gog , desura and other services .
neutral	i just upgraded my computer , and it was really easy to copy over my old gog games ( drm free !
neutral	), and also just plug in my old steam drive and reinstall steam over the top , keeping my old games and saving several terabytes worth of downloading .
neutral	orign on the other hand , is a nightmare .
neutral	copying over old files doesn ' t save you any downloading , and the service is quite quirky about moving the download folder to another drive .
neutral	in addition , some games , such as the sims , are a nightmare to patch .
neutral	if you ' re going to be forced to use a drm service to download / install games , then why do you have to install patches separately , and incrementally to get certain games to work ?
neutral	origin is getting better - it ' s not too bloated these days and the game pricing can be decent , but i wish it would check to see if you already had some game files to save you downloads .
neutral	this place has wonderful food .
neutral	a really nice atmosphere .
neutral	but your wallet gets beat up in the end .
neutral	the atmosphere is usually nice , unless it is the weekend .
neutral	it seems to fill up and get very loud and crowded .
neutral	there seems to be no issues with staffing , but wait times can get a little out of hand due to big crowds .
neutral	maybe stop here on special occasions only , and not every sunday after church .
neutral	as promised key delivered on monday 00th day before launch .
neutral	cheap and reliable !
neutral	edit_: i know that i received my key on time but i have to take away 0_stars because of this company ' s attitude .
neutral	you have stated on your facebook account that all keys will be delivered on monday 00th of may .
neutral	so please stop making fools out of customers and trying to say that they have received their keys on the 00th which is the release day .
neutral	you have said 00th and stop twisting it around .
neutral	you keep on doing that and be sure i wont buy from you anymore .
neutral	the fact is you blew it , suck it up and move on .
neutral	stop trying to twist it around .
neutral	alt spillede perfekt , jeg brugte danske nembetaling og havde penge med_det samme .
neutral	jeg overførte 000_kr , men så tog de 000_kr i gebyr for det .
neutral	det synes_jeg_ikke er fair det sku for dyrt .
neutral	die blattform ist okay .
neutral	das angebot könnte aber mehr sein .
neutral	i was going to give 0 star only out of 0 but since i got my refund back within 0 days and gave_me compensation of $_000 then im giving three star hopefully that compensation will come because it was promised .!
neutral	not full star because it was a nightmare talking to different agent all the time .
neutral	email response was good they follow a 00 hours time_frame if you send a complain or question !
neutral	june 00 - it was my first time booking a flight with expedia so i thought it would be better if i talk to someone on the phone instead of doing it myself online .
neutral	. 0 .)
neutral	travel_agent booked me a flight + hotel which i want , keep telling me his screen is " frozen " maybe just a glitch whatsoever he ask my credit_card and paiid $ 0 , 000
neutral	he sent me an_email .
neutral	on the email he sent itinerary no .
neutral	which says " please book now " and i cant find the itinerary no .
neutral	on my account but i can see on my credit_card that 0000 was taken out of my account 0 . my sons name and my last name was spelled wrong although i keep telling him how to spell my names in detail ,
neutral	within an_hour i called asap and talk to that same travel_agent .
neutral	itold him that he made a mistake booking me a flight and a hotel .
neutral	he transferred me to a customer_service she decided to just cancel everything and give me my money back .
neutral	she_said 0 - 00 days .
neutral	then i just booked another flight and hotel doing it my self eventually cus i cant_wait for therefund and i dont_know how long it will take in the first place .
neutral	i used my husband credit_card same amount flight and hotel .
neutral	everything was good with the one i booked right spelling write amount and i can see my itinerary booking and confirmation online .
neutral	june 00 .. just to follow_up with an_email i complaint about the situation they replied within 00 hours time_frame .
neutral	they said flight was cancelled but hotel is still booked ???
neutral	like okay i thought its cancelled but how come right ?
neutral	i called again and a travel_agent said booked duplicate in a hotel so he cancelled one of them .
neutral	he cancelled the one i booked which is supposed to be the original booking the travel_agent made has to be cancelled .
neutral	another mistake on this one .
neutral	by a different travel_agent !
neutral	to make the long_story short .
neutral	june 00 i insisted to talk to one of the supervisor because of so many mistake i asked for refund receipts in email in case i need to dispute them and if i dont get my money back .
neutral	he confirmed that i will be getting refund and he gave_me a compensation of $_000 refund because of their mistake .. today when i checked my credit_card flight has been refunded and hotel also !!
neutral	looking good so far ,
neutral	bad things about expedia is that its really big company that they will make customers wait on the phone for freakin two hours on hold .
neutral	and keep transferring you to different people .
neutral	i spent my friday , saturday , sunday , and monday talking and calling them and making a complaint !
neutral	so key here check your email all the time and itinerary no .
neutral	to make_sure theres no change so far .
neutral	check the airlines and phone the hotel to make_sure that you ' have reservation .
neutral	expedia might change something without your permission !
neutral	be_aware .
neutral	and if you see a mistake call them right_away , email and ask for confirmation receipt .
neutral	now .
neutral	i ' ll will be leaving in two_weeks and im hoping everything will be good ..
neutral	i love the dress alot it looks just like the picture , but the only_thing is that it need to be tailored alot in the bust area and in the hip area the waste fixs fine but the bust and in the hips area is very big .... :( thanks !!
neutral	!
neutral	i feel_like your customer_service could improve a lot , like explain the terms better before just booking and catching you by surprise , when you go to cancel and rebook for a different hotel and you get charge double .
neutral	i was very disappointed
neutral	avast free antivirus 0 needs to improve it ' s signature based detection & complete removal capability of threats & malwares to a much much better extent
neutral	i ordered a iphone 0 orange unlock in early june , expecting the available unlock max 00 days_later ...
neutral	after a very long waiting ( a big month ) still no news , so i decided to send a pay back email .
neutral	they told me i ' ll be totally refund for the inconvenience but when i asked why the unlock couldn ' t be done , they finally sent me the unlocking process email .
neutral	it works_perfectly so i ' m very happy but it is a pity they couldn ' t get it any faster .
neutral	i was really happy with everything about my shopping_experience with fabriah . com apart_from one thing .
neutral	when my product arrived , the plastic pump part of my shampoo was broken into little sharp pieces .
neutral	although it had been wrapped in bubble_wrap , it obviously hadn ' t been protected sufficiently .
neutral	maybe the fault of the courier used / royal_mail but this is obviously disappointing as a consumer .
neutral	in terms of everything else when shopping with fabriah . com - very happy .
neutral	quality of products and prices - great .
neutral	website - easy to use .
neutral	communication about delivery - fab .
neutral	if they address this issue i would definitely buy products from them again and recommend them to family and friends .
neutral	well i could write a long paragraph about this but i was listening the whole time we went over the contracts and when i reread everything at home , he told me the stuff i would want to hear , not every_single aspect i needed to know .
neutral	on top of that my car ' s cd player and auxiliary do not work .
neutral	my car ' s worth is actually 0000 according to drive - time but overall i will be paying a total of 00000 .
neutral	if this is the case why do you guys even have a lease program if your making the same amount you would make if we financed it ?
neutral	i also got the run around about my warranty .
neutral	i don ' t feel secure about this like i did and if the oppertunity arises for me to cancel my lease financially , that ' s what i will do because the only benefit is credit to be honest .
neutral	agoda always has a hidden promotion .
neutral	its good if you are lucky to get the promotion but i usually not to know these promotion easily .
neutral	packaging - ok
neutral	delivery time - average
neutral	service - no issues to report
neutral	we booked our stay for cancun around new years and had an amazing customer_service experience !
neutral	we originally booked for the bahamas , but changed our mind less_than a day later and chose to visit cancun for our_honeymoon .
neutral	however , when i recently booked a hotel in las_vegas for my bachelorette , we forgot to apply coupon mgm00 at checkout .
neutral	we called less_than a minute after confirmation and were connected to a customer_service agent .
neutral	he was mediocre - at best .
neutral	he wasn ' t understanding at all , and when i asked if he could honor the coupon , he told me it was already a great deal , inferring that the $_00 and an_additional $_00 food credit was minor .
neutral	i was frustrated , and he told me there ' s nothing he could do .
neutral	he kept restating the same thing , so i just gave up and cancelled my reservation online , then rebooked it with the coupon .
neutral	i was out the $_00 . 00 for cancelling my hotel , but at_least i was still able to save $_00 and get a food credit ( which , no_matter how good of a deal it already was , i still thought made a huge difference in value ).
neutral	anyway , out of the two experiences , my experience with booking cancun was awesome , so i won ' t forget the great customer_service i received !
neutral	however , the second service agent could use some additional training , or he shouldn ' t be in customer_service .
neutral	you need to be a little more understanding if " helping " people is your job .
neutral	the third time i ' ve used cjs and again i ' ve had problems ( although first order went through without issue ).
neutral	delay ' s in getting the games etc etc .
neutral	if the games have plenty of stock at the time of purchase , great , otherwise there seems to be a delay greater than what ' s on the site and support leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	a classic case of over promising and under achieving for me , so i ' ll be getting my games elsewhere from now on .
neutral	booked a room for my stay in vegas and while i was under the impression that priceline had already charged me for the resort fees it turns_out that i had to pay that again .
neutral	so , was it really the cheapest deal ?
neutral	i think not .
neutral	has the potential to be a great site to go to .
neutral	but it doesn ' t update your credit_score as often as you would like .
neutral	there are other_sites that will update your score as_soon as changes happen .
neutral	this site still gets 0_stars because it ' s the cheapest i ' ve_seen where you can get all 0 credit_scores .
neutral	if you ' re a patient person or somebody that has great credit i would recommend this site to you , but if you don ' t have great credit i would not recommend this site .
neutral	if you have bad credit you need to be able to get that daily or weekly update to get a better idea as to what you are doing wrong so you can build your credit_score up faster .
neutral	i can speak from expericence because i had a low credit_score and i jumped 000 points on my transunion score and just 0 months .
neutral	rare to do .
neutral	something to think about .
neutral	everything works_fine but it took a while to download and install ( probably because my internet_connection is crappy ).
neutral	i also had to click the ' resend confirmation_email ' link to get my activation key .
neutral	all in all the games are cheap and , now that i ' ve figured out how to work the site reasonably well , i probably will make another purchase at some point .
neutral	several days after ordering , i received and email notifying my that my purchase had been flagged as potential fraud .
neutral	i suspect that this is because the shipping address was different than the billing_address for my card .
neutral	the email said either to call or respond to the email with confirmation that i ordered these shirts .
neutral	i elected to email , rather_than call .
neutral	the next_day i got another email telling me that i ' d just have to call anyway .
neutral	hmmpf .
neutral	spent 00 minutes on hold , then my call was dropped .
neutral	after another 00 minutes , i was able to confirm my order .
neutral	after that , the shirts arrived without incident .
neutral	printing looks great and had no_problems with shipping .
neutral	none of this would have happened if they supported paying with paypal .
neutral	they lose 0_stars for not having that common_sense .
neutral	looks like this company has some great selection !
neutral	throughout china and southeast asia , i relied on hostel_bookers to find the cheapest and most highly rated hostels in the area .
neutral	listings on the site are super - accurate , give a good impression of the hostels , apartments , and guesthouses on offer , and are easily bookable with a minimal down - payment .
neutral	many of the places were easily comparable to fancy hotels in the levels of service , cleanliness , and interesting characters ( honestly , the main draw of a good hostel , right ?).
neutral	however , in my most_recent booking for a hostel in london , i was charged a 00 % down - payment for two different places i was considering ; not a good way to waste $ 0 usd , but at_least it was a small loss .
neutral	aside_from website glitches , i ' ve been regularly pleased by the results and thoroughness of hostel_bookers , and recommend it to all my friends .
neutral	well to start , i believed that the flowers came with a vase as that is what was in the picture and did not state otherwise , i was disappointed with the amount of flowers as i ordered the grandissimo size and felt like it was not what i paid for .
neutral	the flowers were beautiful don ' t get me wrong but they came with no plant food to start with so had to go and buy that as_well .
neutral	overall i was dissatisfied with what i had paid for
neutral	hi !
neutral	i really love this website but i had bad_experience and wasn ' t one time , that ' s the worst part ...
neutral	long time ago ( more than a year ) i returned a pair of boots they told me that i had a credit store , after a wile i was trying to buy something and my credit store wasn ' t there i sent an_email and they apologize and told that they will return the money to my bank acc i wrote back and told them that i don ' t have that bank acc anymore but instead i want a credit store i want to buy stuffs , well they never respond to my emails and i sent many !
neutral	after that i keep buying because i like everything !!
neutral	well i need return 0 item ( was to big ) but they told me that i need a number or code , something like that but they never send me any code ( i was checking my email and my account in the webpage ) the time already passed ( waiting ) and was only 00 days to returned the merchandise so i couldn ' t do anything , after that i stop buying , they are very unprofessional !
neutral	!
neutral	key didnt arrive anywhere near the advertised time , but after a couple of emails i was offered either a full_refund or the game which is the best i could expect from the situation .
neutral	would recommend as they are cheap , just not to those itching to play something the same_day .
neutral	i sent dvds , games , and old cds into musicmagpie and had been told there would be a " 0 working day " turnaround , however it took 00 working days to actually see the money , and i also saw on my sent list that i had apparantly put the wrong game into a ds game box ( cod_: modern_warfare ) which instantly took £ 0 off my money , but you haven ' t sent it back to me , instead you ' ve kept whatever it is and i just lose out ... all in all , an ok experience .
neutral	not sure about full website but on my mobile not very easy to acces any product .
neutral	couldn ' t find any button to add to the basket .
neutral	lucky i knew what i was looking for and mananged to get it .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	shipping was great , but finding some support phone numbers was incorrect or out of service on some parts of the website .
neutral	shipping is kinda pricey i hope for that money it ' s fast .
neutral	none of the coupon_codes worked for me that i received .
neutral	i ordered fabric which turned_out to be not what i expected .
neutral	i wanted to return it .
neutral	since they have stores in every state , i assumed that i could return at the store , not reading the return_policy that they do not allow store returns and that online orders has to be shipped back which is such a bummer because i did not want to lose on return shipping after i considered my purchase a loss .
neutral	i did end up keeping the fabric and have it sitting somewhere until i find an " aha " moment project suitable for it .
neutral	i gave it 0_stars because they don ' t allow store returns .
neutral	i have ordered from this website for years .
neutral	i have really no_complaints about the quality since i understand that we always get what we pay for .
neutral	i give this store 0_stars because i ordered 0 turtleneck sweaters from them less_than a month_ago and the hang tag on it says 00 but the tag attached on the turtleneck itself was " active basic " not forever00 .
neutral	i understand that this company buys wholesale and changes the tags to their own company but they failed to do it on my order .
neutral	it makes me think i ordered from another store .
neutral	i think it is quite a mishap on their part .
neutral	if they are trying to sell their brand , they should make_sure to change the apparel tag to their own instead of leaving the tag of a wholesale shirt which can be bought for less_than 0 bucks a piece .
neutral	lastly , i wish they issued refunds rather_than store_credit on store returns .
neutral	i ordered a clarisonic cleanser brush from the macy ' s . com website and was having numerous problems with the website .
neutral	however , after a phone call , they were able to make things right .
neutral	they also sent a bonus item to make up for the issues .
neutral	i ' d shop there again , but i prefer shopping in person .
neutral	prices are good , and initially i was not upset about the shipping and just accepted it .
neutral	however , i paid $_00 in shipping for a 0 . 0lb package and it has literally hopped states back and forth from my own .
neutral	it went to indianapolis , then to kentucky , then straight across to illinois .
neutral	i live in indiana and for that high a shipping cost , it should not take a week to get it in my opinion .
neutral	shipping has been my only issue though and i had no transactional problems .
neutral	are you going to be evil or are you going to follow the path of light ?
neutral	i gave you benefit of the doubt so 0_stars it is for new .
neutral	i hope google stays
neutral	under the sun and don ' t turn to darkness .
neutral	everytime i order from the web i get everything delivered very fast to my house and also i like the low_prices and the free_stuff they have on there but one thing i don ' t like that they charge alot of money for shipping !!
neutral	!
neutral	when i found babybungalow i was surprised at the variety of cool products that other_companies don ' t have .
neutral	they are high_quality and priced right .
neutral	the downside was that they have a crappy return_policy ; it seems unrealistic that all products will be unopened and unused in order to return plus there ' s a 00 %_restocking fee which i find to be absurd .
neutral	i can buy locally and avoid all of that crap , so as long as there ' s no chance of a return needed i say they ' re pretty_cool , but if you may need to return you should go elsewhere .
neutral	;-)
neutral	these were ordered for my mothers birthday .
neutral	they were ordered on 00th sep at midday , and arranged for delivery the next_day .
neutral	cut to the 00th , and they ' ve just arrived .
neutral	my mother tells_me the bunch is nice , but somewhat wilted ( not happy , as i paid extra for extra stems , so to hear that the extra effort merely resulted in the delivery of a wilted bunch of flowers is disappointing ).
neutral	it was not made clear when i chose the delivery date that it was not guaranteed .
neutral	even so , efforts should be made to ensure flowers arrive fresh , regardless of when they arrive .
neutral	disappointed , and will not use again .
neutral	next time , i ' ll pay extra and use a local florist .
neutral	most of the clothes are very nice but the fabric is delicate which_means the clothes need to be hand washed ( my greatest weakness )
neutral	everyone says they are really quick at posting out your order ( usually within a day ).
neutral	i placed an order nearly a week ago and still have recieved no confirmation_email to say its been posted .
neutral	and according to the website what i had was instock .
neutral	i mean how long does it take to ship out 0 items .
neutral	just glad i didnt pay for next_day delivery .
neutral	bit annoyed as they have taken my money

neutral	motivul ratigului meu este modalitatea defectuoasa de livrare .
neutral	adica : daca eu fac comanda la ora 00 dimineata , si aleg curierul , am pretentia ca a doua_zi produsele sa ajunga la mine , pt ca_nu degeaba am dorit curier rapid .
neutral	in cazul dumneavoastra nu s - a intamplat asa .
neutral	am_facut comanda la 00 dimineata , apoi am_fost sunat de catre un reprezentant instiintandu - ma ca produsele imi vor fi trimise abia a doua_zi , ca peste inca o zi sa ajunga la mine fara a - si cere scuze din partea companiei .
neutral	pentru mine e mai_mult de 00 de_ore . mai aveti de lucru la partea de logistica .
neutral	in rest toate bune .
neutral	hello .
neutral	i requested an unlocking service for my sprint iphone_0s but it has not been processed yet .
neutral	today is the 0th day since i placed the order , on 0st december .
neutral	best_regards
neutral	andré zara
neutral	i love to order from this company .
neutral	in fact , its the only company i use to order supplements from .
neutral	however , my last 0 shipments i do not know what has happened .
neutral	usually i order my products and within the day i am getting a notification that they have shipped .
neutral	now , it has been taking close to a full business week just to get shipped .
neutral	please step it back up .
neutral	am i the only one who remembers , walmart back in the day took pride in the fact that they bought and sold made in the usa products ??
neutral	now i can ' t hardly find anything made in the usa there !!!
neutral	!
neutral	it took a good while to get the dog_food .
neutral	i would be worried to sign_up for the monthly service , in fear that i wouldn ' t have the food in time before they ran out , and with the dog_food being 00_bucks a pop it ' s not like i can spend extra when it ' s not here on time .
neutral	the label they put on the box was not readable and it had to be redirected and relabeled then reshipped to me .
neutral	so this is why i can only give them 0_stars , how would the person_who put the label on not be able to see it was not legible ?!?!?!?
neutral	!
neutral	i typically have good experiences with amazon , but my last few orders have been a sub - par experience .
neutral	they ' re just such a big company that you feel_like you get lost in the system .
neutral	there is no " one - on - one " type feeling when you call them .
neutral	you ' re just another number .
neutral	not the best quality of lead but what would you expect for under a couple of pounds .
neutral	the service was fast and i received my order not long after it was placed .
neutral	they can be pricey , but they always have cute stuff on sale unlike_other stores that only have last season or ugly stuff on sale .
neutral	they have great fashions for the larger woman , which i respect .
neutral	my only_thing is the shipping .
neutral	my late order to me it would be shipped by the 00 of march it wasn ' t shipped till april , i don ' t like that only express_shipping gets a tracker number .
neutral	just because i don ' t need those shoes in a hurry doesn ' t mean i wouldn ' t like to know when there going to come .
neutral	the shopping part is fine they just need to work on the shipping .
neutral	it always takes longer from them .
neutral	i order clothes from overseas all the time ( i like not looking like everybody esle ) i ordered a skirt from the uk about a week after i made my yesstyle order , my skirt came thursday and i still don ' t have my yesstyle order .
neutral	i ordered a necklace as a christmas_gift for my sister , and i understand that it takes time to actually make the product , but i don ' t think it should take 00 - 00 days to be shipped after getting the " your order has been shipped " confirmation .
neutral	i like to track my orders to see where they are and how long its taking before it gets to me , and mynamenecklace . com did not provide me with a tracking_number or the carrier that my necklace is coming with , so in case something happens to my order i have no_idea what carrier to contact because mynamenecklace . com did not provide me with that information .
neutral	if you want your necklace by a certain date , order it at_least 0 to 0 weeks in_advance , because standard_shipping there is not the normal 0 - 0 days like everywhere_else .
neutral	overall , the necklace is great , just the shipping service should be improved .
neutral	i actually just got my shoes from ami .
neutral	yes they took quite a while to deliver well just over a week .
neutral	i was scared after i read these reviews but i actually just got my product and i am about to order again
neutral	looking for a boyfriend .
neutral	i had a question and the department that could help me was gone for the day and wouldn ' t be able to help me until monday .
neutral	what ' s the point in having the convenience of this site when you can ' t get help from customer_service .
neutral	like the site but too many ads .
neutral	i joined the website , and was brought here by a website that advertised your games and i was a steam section of the website , purchased pro evolution soccer 0000 but i got a cd - key not a steam game which section i was in , also then i saw in small print please download this game by a torrent , since my isp blocks torrent websites how is that possible and since i got the cd - key why would i want a cd - key without a disk or anything to even play it it ' s basically paying for a bunch and numbers and letter
neutral	this is great website and i user it very often .
neutral	but , i ' ll ask for a new feature - for a specific date search , you should have a rss feeds or email feeds for flight offers for a specific travel segment .
neutral	example helsinki - ny - 00 dec - 00 jan return flight - to have this search and keep sending email on regular interval , if there is price change or new offer .
neutral	as of now , i can save only specific offer only - which is not very much useful .
neutral	i have been searching for oxy elite pills at gnc they charge for 0 00 ct bottle close to $_00 . 00_bucks yikes
neutral	i was able to score 0 for around 00 . 00 saving $_00 . 00
neutral	that is good .
neutral	my only grievance with supplement_warehouse is even_though they give great pricing on their bottles of supplements they are not the cheapest in shipping i had to pay $_00 . 00 for two bottles of supplements extra for snail mail delivery ?
neutral	i really like the dresses when i first on yesstyle . com .
neutral	my sister or coworker told me not to buy them because it is very expensive .
neutral	i believe that it is worth it since you really like the style and it is pretty .
neutral	you really cannot find that type of dresses here is united_states .
neutral	i actually try to brought it online and it is very convenience for me to order .
neutral	the disadvantage of yesstyle . com is that it take so much time to process the order .
neutral	i been waiting to get my order , however it is processing but not yet shipped .
neutral	it take about a month or so to get the product to me .
neutral	i tried dresses and it actually didn ' t fit me so i had to return it still have to pay for shipping cost .
neutral	also , they don ' t refund you cash or on credit_card .
neutral	however , they give you store_credit for your next purchases .
neutral	you actually have to have 000 stylebucks point in order to get a $_00 coupon .
neutral	bought two things from separate shops .
neutral	a fairly cheap game which arrived the next_day which i was impressed with .
neutral	the other thing ordered ( a game console ) arrived a day later but i had to call the shop to find out when they were posting it as i paid £ 0 . 00 delivery .
neutral	the person said they posted it special delivery .
neutral	i got it the next_day but it was signed for not special delivery which i was annoyed at .
neutral	they paid about £ 0 to post it ( as seen on the stamp ) so they made £ 0 out of me .
neutral	so it depends on the shop you order from as i had a god experience but also a so so experience .
neutral	i bought some pillowcases and recieved them in an acceptable time period .
neutral	unfortunately the free soap had shattered and caused bits of it to go all over the pillowcases and some managed to get inside the packaging which was a pain as they were meant to be a present .
neutral	smells nice though .
neutral	cleaning up my items wasn ' t something i intended on doing !
neutral	useful , but i wouldn ' t keep too much money in your account .
neutral	they have crazy rules where they can freeze your account for 00 days any time they want .
neutral	it happened to me once .
neutral	ebay is an awesome place to find cheap , rare , and otherwise collectible items .
neutral	you can find virtually anything you can imagine on there .
neutral	the problem with ebay is that the selling community is inept .
neutral	if someone decides not to ship your item , prepare for a battle to get your money back .
neutral	on the flip side , if you ' re a seller , ebay treats you awfully .
neutral	you sell an item , wait 0 weeks for the money to become available because ebay wants to verify that your item shipped ( even_though the guy received it a week ago ), then and only then do they decide to slice 00 % of the money off the top for themselves .
neutral	as if holding onto it for a month wasn ' t enough ?
neutral	and let ' s not forget after listing 00 items you have to start paying per listing ?
neutral	ebay would be awesome if the company wasn ' t full of greed .
neutral	jeg oprettede mig hos bibob hvor_jeg flyttede mit gamle nummer med .
neutral	problemet var dog , at der ved oprettelsen ikke_var en advarsel med at det kunne tage op_til 00 dage før nummeret kunne flyttes .
neutral	det viste_sig at blive et problem , da min gamle mobil var_gået i stykker , og den nye mobil havde en mindre simkort - slot .
neutral	dette betød så at jeg_skulle komme til at stå uden telefon i 00 dage hvis ikke mit bibob simkort blev åbnet .
neutral	heldigvis stod_der , at jeg_kunne ringe_til kundeservice for at få det til at gå hurtigere - så det gjorde jeg .
neutral	jeg_ringede først en torsdag hvor_jeg_fik af vide at det nye simkort ville kunne bruges dagen_efter - fredag .
neutral	men da det stadigvæk ikke virkede mandag ringede jeg til_dem igen .
neutral	her fik_jeg så af vide at der skulle gå 00 timer og hende den_anden havde gjort noget forkert - men at den nu ville blive klar til på torsdag .
neutral	om torsdagen virkede det stadigvæk ikke - og nu kunne det ikke betale sig at ringe mere , da der i første omgang stod at det ville være klar den følgende mandag - hvilket det så heldigvis også var .
neutral	nu_har jeg så endelig en telefon der virker igen .
neutral	men jeg er_virkelig utilfreds med hvordan skiftet er gået .
neutral	for det første får_man ingen informationer om at det_kan tage så lang_tid at skifte nummer , og for det andet kan det ikke passe at jeg_skal ringe ind to gange hvor_jeg bliver lovet noget , hvorefter så ingen ting sker .
neutral	jeg syntes virkelig at det_er dårligt kundeservice .
neutral	hvis det ikke_var fordi_de allerede havde trukket pengene havde jeg skiftet selskab igen den torsdag hvor min mobil eftersigende skulle_være klar .
neutral	det_kan godt være at de er billige , men forvent ingen service .
neutral	used it 0 times now and its not what i hoped , it has only_thing i get from this site is frustration .
neutral	first time i used it i got diablo_0 , i payed for it 0 hour before the realise .
neutral	and i had to get it refunded because i could get it in time .
neutral	and the anti_fraud thing thy got on the site is a joke !
neutral	i don ' t recommend it .
neutral	edit_:
neutral	and i send a anti_fraud_verification on my first order , and i made a second order 00 days after that .
neutral	and thy haven ' t even verified me .
neutral	i absolutely_loved the scarves online .
neutral	i fell in love with two pashminas that i thought were going to be my favorite articles this winter ... until they came in the mail and they are thin enough to see through .
neutral	they are not warm or very soft , they were not worth the money i paid for the quality .
neutral	they came in a very cute casing and they came very fast .
neutral	i really would just have to say they deceived me with the quality .
neutral	it ' s a pity , i was really excited .
neutral	bought a phone via amazon - all good .
neutral	phone developed a fault 0 months_later - told me to contact manufacturer .
neutral	i did this , who informed me that as the phone is not made anymore ( and therefore can ' t just be replaced ), i would need to go back to caboodle , who could :
neutral	a ) refund me
neutral	b ) return the phone and it ' s 00 year guarantee to the manufacturer who would refund caboodle .
neutral	caboodle were not interested in fulfilling their duties as a responsible seller .
neutral	update_: thanks to this review and another one posted elsewhere , plus some email persistence on my part , caboodle has recognised their duties as a decent company and agreed to refund the goods .
neutral	review rating updated accordingly , subject to successful conclusion of this little episode of course .
neutral	i have purchased a gift_card for a friend and the gift_card didn ' t cover the shipping_costs . my friend had to pay extra 00 dollars minimum to make the purchase - the system didn ' t let her make a purchase with the giftcard unless she paid for extra shipping_costs .
neutral	she of course didn ' t complete her order .
neutral	i searched on the site and nowhere does it state that the giftcard doesn ' t cover the shipping_costs .
neutral	i have contacted them more than 0 times this month and they ignore me .
neutral	paypal can ' t refund me because it ' s an e_- gift_card , and i had to complain to bbb
neutral	update_: issue resolved - i received a refund from them .
neutral	been waiting for my sniper_elite v0 key to come in .
neutral	say ' s they are out of keys and not a single response from them .
neutral	the watch arrived on time , extremely well_packaged , but i had asked 0 it to be gi0t wrapped with a gi0t bag .
neutral	it came with neither .
neutral	what a shame .
neutral	i have used trip advisor lot of times .
neutral	why is the website not user_friendly .
neutral	?
neutral	?
neutral	i was very happy with the speed of the delivery and the price , but unfortunately the nail stickers i had barely lasted a day before chipping off .
neutral	i normally wouldn ' t mind too much but because they were dark brown stickers , and where they were coming off , was white , it was very obvious and didn ' t look good .
neutral	not buying again i ' m afraid .
neutral	it seems as if most online_casinos are rigged .
neutral	the only_thing that seems not to be is when you actually play real people .
neutral	assuming they are real .
neutral	i took the capsule for 0 months along with a 0 , 000 calorie diet and exercise plan .
neutral	i didn ' t see much difference in my weight_loss with or without the suppliment .
neutral	it did help to curb my cravings .
neutral	overall my experience has been average .
neutral	when i first opened my account i had issues with the media player - silverlight .
neutral	after we got the bugs worked out it seems to be smooth_sailing .
neutral	i just wish there were a larger variety of new releases .
neutral	i would also like to see if a tv serious is still on the air or if what is available is the entire show .
neutral	sometimes troublesome if your plans change , it is every hard to get refunded by the course or the site , usually impossible .
neutral	however , usually the teetimes are discounted and is a great way to save_money if headed straight to the course , or in the morning .
neutral	payed 000gbp somewhat expensive and took a while for a vodafone locked iphone , but its unlocked
neutral	after purchasingr borderlands_0 from cjs keys with paypal , i verified myself in the autokey_system using my phone .
neutral	the verification was completed , but i then recieved an " anti_- fraud " email from cjs asking me to prove that i exist by giving cjs keys my personal identity information .
neutral	the email asked for things such as my passport , drivers_license , bank statements , etc ...
neutral	i did not give cjs any important information , but instead complained about how absurd this is and i immediately got my product key .
neutral	i would urge anyone_else who gets this ' anti_- fraud ' email not to give them your identity .
neutral	paypal already has anti_- fraud measurements in place , and i ' m pretty sure it is illegal to demand personal identity information before giving you the product you already paid for .
neutral	even if it isn ' t illegal , it is bad business and i do not like the way cjs has done this .
neutral	nevertheless , they gave_me my product key after the complaint .
neutral	no questions_asked , and the key worked so i ' d give it a 0 / 0
neutral	great place to buy bulk workout stuff from .
neutral	would like to see better prices on shipping , and a wider range of organic products ; other than that , i am very happy with the site .
neutral	i just placed my first order and am content with the prices .
neutral	i had been buying from a previous website that was very inexpensive but i had some mix up issues and figured it was about time to try a new company .
neutral	so i am hoping for no issues with supplement_warehouse !
neutral	i got an entropay account to make purchases overseas , 00 dollars later and i had topped up my first entropay card .
neutral	after returning the purchased goods , the funds showed 00 dollars balance and 0 . 00 available balance .
neutral	i emailed entropay support and they told me to wait 00 days to get the funds back .
neutral	00 days pass and my funds are not returned to my account , and my account has been restricted because " i had not provided all the correct documentation ", so i emailed entropay again with the correct documentation and asking why my money had not been returned .
neutral	entropay then emailed me back and said the same response of 00 days .
neutral	then 0 minutes_later after that email as i was writing a response to their generic response and how it had not solved my problem ...... i recieved another email from the same support guy stating that he had suspended my account permanently because of suspected suspicious activity .
neutral	what .
neutral	the .
neutral	hell .
neutral	how is my activity suspicious when i gave you a copy of my card and my drivers_license ?
neutral	your support_team is horrible !
neutral	scam service .
neutral	you ' ll never get your money back .
neutral	update_: after over a month of fighting with entropay , the day after i posted this review , the anti_- fraud support manager emailed me about my account being suspended unjustifiably , reviewed my account , reinstated it , and refunded the 00 dollars to my card .
neutral	finally .
neutral	someone_who understood what i was saying and actually acted on my disappointment .
neutral	i just made a purchase with my 00 dollar card again .
neutral	we ' ll see if it goes through .
neutral	will update later with results .
neutral	its downfall began when it started to imitate facebook with various activity streams and actions .
neutral	i don ' t understand how can anyone like to communicate like this with short , simple sentences that mustn ' t be longer that 000 characters or else they won ' t be published ?
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered three dresses from ami and a bracelet in various sizes so i could determine which fit i liked best since i read so many negative statements about the fit of things .
neutral	i was so excited because i ' m going on a trip soon and i wanted a couple new outfits .
neutral	well , two of my dresses and my bracelet came but the other dress didnt , the order slip stated it was back ordered .
neutral	this made me mad to no end considering i didn ' t get an_email stating the item was back ordered and it doesn ' t say it anywhere in my account and there was no expected date !!!
neutral	i don ' t know if ill buy from them again .
neutral	i love their dresses but who_knows if you ' ll actually get what you ordered ...
neutral	i would like to rank it 0 / 0 .
neutral	during my trip to my hometown this company provide well services .
neutral	ma_non ha niente di + di expedia , opodo o tanti altri .
neutral	ho usato il sito per mandare la mia lettera di disdetta .
neutral	0 euro !
neutral	da sky l ' hanno ricevuta in tempo e mi hanno chiuso il contratto .
neutral	poi mi sono accorta che avrei potuto mandare la lettera normalmente in posta e pagare la metà :(.
neutral	non capisco tutte le reviews " fantastico ", " ottimo ".
neutral	e ' un sito normalissimo che vende libri , pure piu ' caro di altri !
neutral	i like the service but it never seems to be very clear for me when i use video ...
neutral	only down fall is the shipping_costs .
neutral	i guess they have to make up for the low_prices on the products somehow .
neutral	the picture idea on the card was great but checking_out was a headache .
neutral	my name is osagie i am traveling on sunday which is tomorrow the 00th of march 0000 , i have not received my eticket by email and delta airline said the flight has been reserved but not booked . i am going to lagos nigeria from buffalo new_york for an interview which is on tuesday , i need to know what is going on as no one has gotten back to me via the support center except sally manapat ( ticket # 000000 ) who replied just once , she promised to send my eticket but no news from her yet .
neutral	i can be reached on + 00000000000 .
neutral	i have even notified my bank in canada which says if i don ' t get my ticket by tomorrow morning i should notify them .
neutral	i need urgent response from your ticketing department as i am panicking and wondering what kind of customer_service keeps its customers waiting without no eticket barely 00 hours to the flight .
neutral	slow processing
neutral	i will do business with them again .
neutral	the only_thing i would like better is if they would send an_email telling me something i ordered was on back order or why it might be taking longer then normal to ship out my order .
neutral	when i did email them a question they did respond fairly fast which was nice .
neutral	once the order was shipped it was fast .
neutral	over all i was pretty pleased with my experience .
neutral	booked hotel for three nights onlune , priceline charged me almost 000 . 00 .
neutral	when i got to the hotel , they ended_up charging me again , their price , 000 . 00 .
neutral	the hotel refunded me the double charge but apparently pricelines fees are pretty big .
neutral	almost a 00 . 00 difference in price .
neutral	seeing this by mistake will influence any decisions i may make to use priceline again .
neutral	i have a order made on may0000 which i ever have received .
neutral	after asking for customer_service assistance i just got automatics replies .
neutral	i was very happy at how quick my order was delivered considering i live on an island but very very dissapointed with the quality .
neutral	the costume i had ordered was not up to costume standards i have had before ie .
neutral	neckline just cut with scissors not neatly .
neutral	i also ordered ' sexy ripped stockings ' and there was no rips , just 0 holes on one stocking along the lining that obviously weren ' t meant to be there !
neutral	i would have rathered get a good quality costume than have it delivered quickly !
neutral	i am asian ( 0 ' 0 "), but with a little more meat on my bones than the typical asian ( 000_lbs ).
neutral	i ' m hoping that the clothing i purchased does fit and that the sizes stated on the website are true .
neutral	i ' ll write another review when i actually receive my clothing ....
neutral	i made my first purchase on oct . 00 , and it still says that they are " waiting for stock ".
neutral	if you don ' t have it in stock , you shouldn ' t be offering on the website or say something before i purchased my items .
neutral	i ' m still rating it 0_stars because i like their wide_variety on the website .
neutral	i will come_back and rate again once i have my clothes .
neutral	i ' ve used a few other credit monitoring companies in the past like the free one , credit - karma and another one that came with my credit_card ( for a fee ) as_well as 0 others in the past and when comparing those companies to identity_guard , identity_guard ranks in the lower percentile between them .
neutral	for one , identity_guard only updates your credit_scores every 00 days where - as the others i ' ve used allow you to update it every 00 days and credit - karma allows you to update daily ... of course , credit - karma doesn ' t have a truly accurate portrait of my credit profile , but what do you expect for free .
neutral	also - identity_guard does not portray true credit profile numbers ( as far as the score is concerned )...
neutral	i just received my experian an equifax credit profiles with scores attached from each of them ( in the mail ) and their scores are at_least 00 points higher_than reported on identity_guard - i ' ve also called transunion and received my credit_score over the phone , their score is 00 + points higher_than reported by identity_guard ...
neutral	so , overall , i have to rate identity_guard as just " okay '
neutral	nice system nice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice systemnice system
neutral	i contacted them after seeing their quote for around .. $_00 ?
neutral	online .. for recovery .
neutral	i had an " internally " damaged flash drive .. it was unreadable , but wasnt physically damaged ..
neutral	when i explained how the drive was acting ., they said it should be a simple fix under_$_000 ...
neutral	once i sent them the drive and money order , all of a sudden advanced recovery is needed ... and thats about $_000 ..
neutral	why is it that most reviews im reading here are all saying the same thing ...
neutral	simple recovery didnt work , advanced recovery was needed ....
neutral	my order was shipped the same_day i placed it .
neutral	i had to return it ; the process was quick and painless .
neutral	however , i was disappointed to find that the costume i had ordered was similar to one i could find in a halloween store : cheap , baggish , unpolished .
neutral	still , it fit my needs and the company performed beautifully .
neutral	the sheer number of options can sometimes be overwhelming but it is nice to have such a variety .
neutral	sizing can be limited , unfortunately .
neutral	wish there could be a review system implemented so users can review items they have already purchased for others to see .
neutral	i have used yesstyle several_times already , and was not happy with at_least 0 item in my order .
neutral	for the last few_times , the items for for myself , so i was okay with returning them and accepted the store_credit .
neutral	but for the last order , the items were meant for gifts , and they came ripped .
neutral	so , i had to return them with my own shipping cost , and had to accept a refund as store_credit only , given that it is their fault that the items for defective .
neutral	they claimed that the return could only be issued as store_credit , instead of a refund of " fund " so i could use the fund to buy the gifts elsewhere .
neutral	this is no way a good policy these days because there are many reasons behind the choice of not keeping an item , not to mention that we have to pay the return shipping cost .
neutral	i would be very very reluctant to shop here again as the business philosophy here is to force you to keep the items , shop with them again with the store_credit even at times when you don ' t need any .
neutral	this is a failing policy , yesstyle .
neutral	i would not recommend you for this reason .
neutral	on top of that , i could not reach their customer services after calling many_times during their stated business hours .
neutral	anyhow , after this , no more .
neutral	you get what you pay for i found the clothing material was very very thin .
neutral	the shoes were good quality and a very good price
neutral	so basically i have some good and bad_experience with wimdu .
neutral	the good experience is that you can find some great deals there and most of the hosts are nice and helpful people .
neutral	they have flats in many european cities and mostly well located , sometimes furnished like 0 o 0 star_hotels .
neutral	the bad_experience is that if something goes_wrong , don ' t expect too much help from their customer_service , because you ' ll not receive it .
neutral	they ' re not working in the evenings , they always state that " it ' s the owners responsibility " and finally if you already found out that the flat rules are not what you paid for ( the owners asks hefty extra charges ) you cannot quit because they already have your money .
neutral	so either you pay extra or you lose all .
neutral	just be cautious and always before send an e_- mail to the owner asking " how much will i really pay " as then you at_least have some proof in case of disagreement .
neutral	service was great , price was great .
neutral	however got banana flavoured why protein and although it mixed well the taste is horrible compared to competitors , i wont be using it again for that reason
neutral	okay , firstly let me say that i think a lot of the reason people buy starbucks is because of the brand , not that they are in love with their coffee , it ' s a status thing for them , just my opinion , now let me say i actually really do like their coffee , i ' m not really big on hot coffee i love them blended but they are good all the same .
neutral	definitely a little_pricey , you can easily spend $ 0 on one cup of coffee , but the only reason they charge those prices is because people like me continue to purchase .
neutral	their little treats such as the banana nut bread aren ' t very tasty but they are nice to look at if you ask me but to each their own .
neutral	for the most part the staff here has been pretty nice so that ' s definitely a plus !
neutral	i submitted my claim with only_thing missing was the receipt .
neutral	i quickly emailed it over and got the confirmation .
neutral	next_day i get an_email stating that the deductible was missing ; very strange because you cannot submit your claim without entering credit_card information .
neutral	i checked online and saw that my claim was closed .
neutral	i got no noticed of this .
neutral	i called and someone_who had difficulty with english took longer_than necessary to understand the situation and only needed to look at my account to see what i was talking_about .
neutral	he ended_up submitting a new claim and using up my time trying to understand me , putting me on hold for over 0 minutes , asking me all the information that you enter online for a claim ( what happened , where , phone hex code , cc info , etc_.).
neutral	once it was finally completed , the actual shipping , repair , and return process was satisfactory .
neutral	phone screen was cracked with damage to the bezel .
neutral	they replaced all damaged components and phone is working and looking good .
neutral	after finding the exact_same booking on hostelworld . com for cheaper it was a huge hassle to get the money back guarantee where they double the difference in price between the two listings .
neutral	eventually they agreed to pay me but i had to argue about with them to get my money which is ridiculous .
neutral	oredered a pair of pirate boots - the sole was the right size but , my 000 lb friends calf was too big for a size 00 boot upper
neutral	it is very addictive to say the least .
neutral	it gives to much information away to people though .
neutral	purchased tickets 00 may all confirmed etc easily and quick conformation emails came ... now it ' s just 00 hours till festival event on friday and still ticket not been dispatched by seller or had any updates to this on my order screen .
neutral	also states my ticket is e ticket so this means it ' s downloadable and printable but says waiting for seller to dispatch ?
neutral	ive read through whole site and various sources and ive been patient and very understanding still , ive email twice in last few_days as they say do contact us if they not been dispatched in 00 hours before the event and still no reply , site was recommend by many friends and got feeling im going be missing out and not be able go do hope this is resolved tommorow or given reply .. if matter is resolved and i get my tickets happily update my review here and follow_up with you
neutral	ordered stuff that took kinda long to arrive , and the shipping fee for an item is relatively high especially when they consider the item is ' special ' with extra handling fee
neutral	the service was really good ; fast and without_any trouble .
neutral	the price isn ' t too bad either .
neutral	but the quality of the picture on the hard cases aren ' t the best .
neutral	i brought 0 hard cases ; one of them isn ' t too bad but the other two just seem badly printed .
neutral	one of the ones that i brought is a tardis one , which is also not straight and of slightly bad quality .
neutral	great service , but improvement of the actual product is needed .
neutral	you want the best sales come here i found the best prices so come and see its worth it
neutral	i was unsure about the store at first so i ordered only one thing from them .
neutral	the item arrived really quick but it wasn ' t the color shown on the website .
neutral	the one i got was green but it ' s supposed to be teal ...
neutral	i am a little disappointed but i am going to keep the dress because the hassles of returning it is just not worth my time .
neutral	however , i will shop there again if i see some good deals , but definitely going to pick a non - ambiguous color from now on .
neutral	i ordered some prescription glasses and they informed me a number of days_later that they were out of stock .
neutral	they said i could order another brand and receive 00 %_discount .
neutral	so i called twice finally got an answer .
neutral	indian picks_up the phone , i have no problem with this but since the company ( i find out ) is actually in hong_kong i know that now i have to trust him to rely my information overseas yet again .
neutral	so he says they will send me a new invoice .
neutral	it takes a day for the invoice to arrive in my email box - big surprise no discount .
neutral	oh and even_though i pay credit_card they send me a paypal invoice .
neutral	so i cancelled the invoice emailed them .... again , now i am still_waiting to hear from them regarding my discount .
neutral	i wish i had read the reviews before i ordered from this company because i would have ordered instead from the states if i wanted to save_money - and i would have ordered from somewhere thats really in australia if i wanted to save time .
neutral	very misleading the company has an australian url .
neutral	com . au but is not in australia , hence no one can really believe you will get your order in a matter of days like they claim on the website , after you go through communication issues and all the time it takes for glasses to go through warehouses etc .
neutral	i have no problem with businesses that run this way but be up front with us .
neutral	if i actually get my glasses in a reasonable time if the prescription is actually right ill write a good review , but im having doubts since stupidly i only read the reviews on this company after ordering .... oooops .
neutral	i bought_battlefield_0 here and everything went right till i came to the trustpilot to retreive the cd_key , since they asked for a mobile number which starts here with 00 i did that but because t hey where sendins a text_message from a foreign_country it onyl should be 0 so my number was invalid and i had to send my information trough a scann of my identity , the reply to this took ways longer that prommised but i did get it in the end .
neutral	i would buy here again for the low_prices and a reliablee support in the end , but it all ended with some friction .
neutral	ordered flowers for my girlfriend ’ s birthday .
neutral	probably should have looked at more of the negative_reviews before ordering .
neutral	i received the delivery when expected , but around 00 % of the roses were completely wilted .
neutral	judging from other reviews , it appears that their main problems are delivery times and quality .
neutral	for me , if the quality had been better , i would use them again .
neutral	the majority of the items i have purchased have been returned to boohoo as the colour looks completely different or they are of poor_quality , i have also found the returns process extremely slow at times !
neutral	!
neutral	i got a code that had a typo in it and it took me 0 days and 0 different support departments to finally get the correct code .
neutral	da_jeg_købte mine_varer og oplyste mit mobil nr regnede jeg med at få_den sædvanlige besked dagen før eller på selve dagen hvor pakken ville ankomme , men dette skete ikke .
neutral	de fleste online butikker har ellers sms service .
neutral	en af mine_varer var i for stor størrelsen og jeg valgte at benytte expres bytte .
neutral	min nye ordre skete i tirsdags men siden da er intet sket .
neutral	varen skulle_være afsent 0 - 0 dage herefter men jeg er ikke blevet informeret om , at den skulle_være blevet sent .
neutral	jeg håber trøjen snart kommer , og at jeg_får mine_penge tilbage som aftalt , dog skulle der gå op_til 0 dage før returvaren bliver behandlet , så det_kan stadig nås :)
neutral	smartgirl . dk er lidt langsommere end mange_andre online butikker , da mange sender samme dag som man bestiller .
neutral	rigtig_mange varer er kun i få størrelser .
neutral	jeg oplevede at størrelse s og m var udsolgt ved rigtig_mange varer , og min skostørrelse ( 00 ) var også lidt svær at finde .
neutral	udover dette har jeg kun positive oplevelser med smartgirl . dk og mine købte varer så ud som_forventet .
neutral	folk kan anmelde produkter de ikke har anvendt .
neutral	det gør anmeldelserne en_del mindre troværdige :_p
neutral	they had multiple listings for the item i wanted .
neutral	i emailed to find out why .
neutral	i was eager to get the glasses and the response seemed to take a bit so i tried there online chat .
neutral	rep told me the 0 item numbers were different and told me which was the one i wanted .
neutral	an_hour later my first e mail was responded to saying that the 0 item numbers were exactly the same and it didnt matter which one i ordered .
neutral	i let them know about the conflicting stories and was told its impossible for them to know what is what because they have so many products .
neutral	really ?
neutral	i have received my product and it is damaged .
neutral	i have not contacted them yet to resolve this .
neutral	i recieved an e mail requesting my opinion on this site and another .
neutral	the other site does not offer the option to write a review ??
neutral	?
neutral	é a segunda bateria que mando vir e são de exelente qualidade .
neutral	já o tempo de envio é muito demoroso , quase 0 meses .
neutral	fora isso foram respondendo ao meu contacto .
neutral	about a year_ago we dumped the cable company and started_using netflix and hulu plus for all of our television / movie watching .
neutral	the price for unlimited streaming is good , the service is pretty good as_well ( every once in a while we have a hard time with the system being down - but that is rare ), and it is perfect for watching older television series from start to finish .
neutral	my biggest_complaint is the lack of newer content ( both films and relatively recent tv_shows ).
neutral	wally world as its affectionately called in college towns .
neutral	wal - mart is the epitome of a one_stop shop .
positive	a questo punto non resta che provarne la qualità .
positive	per adesso eccellente servizio !!!
positive	bene !!
positive	!
positive	had 0 new tyres fitted in 00_mins only 0 miles from home and at a great price too including a discount from csma :)
positive	if you need some new rubber i ' d give e tyres a go , they have been fitting my tyre sofr a number of years_now , always the best price and great service , they come to you anywhere .
positive	there is a reason_why php designer is rated so high above other ides , it has everything .
positive	it has an ftp client , php manual , php live syntax checking , popup info on function usage , and so much more !
positive	the layout can be customized to any developers needs or wants , along with changing the color of the syntax .
positive	it supports the norm of css , js , php , html , but also many other languages .
positive	the interface is intuitive , easy to use , and fully packed with useful features .
positive	also my favorite feature is : its ability to beautify code .
positive	it makes your code much_easier to read and to develop with .
positive	if you are a web developer seeking for a good editor that doesn ' t cost huge amounts like adobe ' s products , get php designer !
positive	i personally think it is better_than adobe ' s .
positive	my husband and i ordered two_pairs of shoes for cosplay costumes .
positive	i was impressed that both pairs got here so fast and are of high - quality materials .
positive	they look genuine to the costumes we are using them for !
positive	i love the wide_selection of clothing to choose from and how affordable everything is !
positive	service is great , they have coupons , and s + h is very cheap .
positive	there hasn ' t been a service this innovative to hit the fishing industry in decades .
positive	i signed_up when they were just getting started and really_enjoyed the variety of lures i received monthly .
positive	a perk of this service is the feeling of anticipation as you wait for tackle in the form of soft & hard plastic , hooks , sinkers & more .
positive	mtb features fans catches on the facebook_page which seems very effective .
positive	i think tactics like this are a great way for subscribers to show off their catches while validating partners / manufacturers designs .
positive	cheapest and quickest way for me to buy sc0 hots .
positive	very happy
positive	i was hesitating to purchase an non - oem salt cell from an online reseller , due to the potential issues and having to deal with returns .
positive	poolsupplyworld . com was great - excellent price , quick delivery , product that works as_advertised , and corteous service with personal follow_up .
positive	i will certainly use this pool supply web store again .
positive	i have been ordering my supplements from supplementwarehouse for years_now .

positive	loeshop . dk er_virkelig overskuelig at anvende , og servicen er i top .
positive	jeg skrev til_dem angående en salgsfaktura efter et køb på webshop , og_fik svar efter maks en halv time .
positive	endvidere fik_jeg besked på dagen om at postdamnark ville levere min_pakke !
positive	jeg er ovenud tilfreds_med den service de har ydet , og det_er bestemt_ikke_sidste_gang_jeg_handler hos_dem .

positive	the service was great , and i received my package the the day after i ordered it !
positive	great inventory , fast shipping .
positive	great that stuff that is " expired " is sold at a discount .
positive	i choose cjs_cd_keys because for prices and stock of products .
positive	it ' s a very safe page to buy , and i loved its anti theft policies when need to activate the keys .
positive	in my case , i bought_simcity , and i am very satisfied with the purchase .

positive	pointshop on kätevä palvelu , käyn päivittäin keräämässä pisteet ja säästän ne jotain arvokkaampaa palkintoa varten .
positive	palvelu toimii lähes aina ; välillä " päivän kysymys " linkkien vihje - linkit eivät toimi ja joskus ovat jopa viitanneet sivustolle jossa ei ole ollut vastausta päivän kysymykseen .
positive	palvelu on kätevä , pienellä vaivalla saa kerättyä pisteitä ja vaihdettua ne tuotteiksi haluamallaan hetkellä .
positive	tosin joidenkin tuotteiden vaadittavat pistemäärät ovat hieman epärealistisia .
positive	aina kun olen ollut asiakaspalveluun yhteydessä vastaus on tullut nopeasti , eli plussaa siitä .
positive	loppujen lopuksi -> loistava sivusto .
positive	they will beat any other competitors price on any supplement , and they carry everything !!!

positive	i never shop_anywhere_else for supplements !
positive	i ' ve used a few of these code buying web sites now and on every one of them i have run_into a problem somewhere along the line and then take_forever to get this resolved .
positive	i can ' t say that about cjs keys because delivery of my keys were instant and so straight_forward i couldn ' t believe it .
positive	upon purchasing my second code i got stung with a fraud_check , and to some this may be annoying but i personally think its a great touch because they obviously take their customers security very seriously .
positive	00 / 00 great site , couldn ' t believe the price of the steam games compared to the actual games themselves on steam .

positive	000_% recomended
positive	first let me start by saying i do not usually review a company or its products .
positive	i have always felt its a waste of time .
positive	that being said supplement_warehouse deserves a pat on the back .
positive	they are very efficient , provide the best prices , and i had my order in two_days .
positive	you might pay a little more for shipping than usual but its well worth it .
positive	just for comparison i ordered from another company the first time i ordered with supplement_warehouse on the same_day , it took the other place over 0 days to get two tubs of protein to me , while supp_warehouse got it to me in two_days .
positive	they are amazing , and you can buy a 0 $ shirt , get a free_shaker_bottle and headphones with your order .
positive	if you are on the fence try it , this company is worth checking_out !
positive	i love yesstyle because they carry clothes that you can ' t typically find in american_stores .
positive	yesstyle carries cute asian_clothing for a pretty good price .
positive	i ' m a teenager and so i can ' t afford to spend a lot shopping , but yesstyle ' s pricing is very reasonable .
positive	i like how for most products , many pictures of the product and / or a model wearing the product is provided .
positive	in addition , the accessibility of reviews from other people really help me make a decision as to whether or not i want to purchase an item .
positive	overall , just an amazing company that has what i ' m looking for !
positive	super easy to use and so many great listings - definitely my go to from now on !
positive	i was sceptical when i first was at the site , but after my first order went that smooth ( and reading other reviews ) i bought my first game trough cjs .
positive	now i ` m a returning_customer , instant_delivery i really can recommend these_guys .
positive	delivered next_day as promised , well_packaged , great price .
positive	they email you details when items are despatched and when delivery will be , and even popped a lollipop in the parcel !
positive	would highly_recommend .
positive	i ' ve used lenstore a few_times now and would highly_recommend them to anyone .
positive	the prices are much better_than high_street opticians ', they despatch extremely quickly and there have never been any_problems with their service .
positive	it will help you to form your_own opinion regarding the sellers .
positive	i have found reviews about two interesting sites on nancygiftguide . com blog .
positive	good_luck !
positive	great wine , champagne and beer gift basket selection , speedy_delivery , caring customer_service at winegiftcellar . com .
positive	what else does a person need from a giftbasket store ?
positive	the answer is simple - more money to be able to buy gift baskets and send them to the friends and family around the world on a daily_basis .
positive	she was readily_available when i had a question and was prompt in responding to my emails .
positive	the entire_process was very seamless and i was updated as each update was made .
positive	i am very happy with the site and i received my passport right on time !
positive	it was easy to order and it shipped quickly .
positive	i would use this website again and refer it to my friends .
positive	ordered from amerigiftbaskets . com for our kids .
positive	was delicious and timely , very impressed !
positive	everyone was really pleased and i heard so much about how tasty it was and how nice the package was .
positive	always order my favorite pall mall light / blue smooth taste at artcigs . com .
positive	they offer the lowest_prices , the fastest delivery and the most competent customer_service .
positive	absolutely_loved the pink colors of their website when i first found it .
positive	:) from then on , i could not buy my favorite vera wang look by vera from elsewhere , only here .
positive	excellent service , speedy_delivery and authentic products are the reasons i won ' t quit buying my perfume there .
positive	strongly_recommend it to everyone who is looking for a reliable source of their favorite eau de parfum - for novices who are not sure where to go and what to buy , and for those experienced ones - you ' ll surely find everything you need here .
positive	ez - perfume . com
positive	there is no_doubt this site is sleek and easy to browse .

positive	ok , so i have been struggling with losing and managing my weight as_well as staying healthy .
positive	i swear i have so many physical and health problems from my surgeries in the past i just felt that i would never stay as fit and healthy as i wanted to .
positive	however when one of my family_members had this " heavy duty shaker_bottle " from this place called supplement_warehouse i immediately questioned her on where she purchased that awesome looking bottle .
positive	once she told me about the site , the rest was history .
positive	see i was purchasing meal replacements from other_places but the prices for all foods and organic items are crazy sky high , but unfortunately i kept paying for the meal replacements that i wanted because i couldn ' t find any place else that was selling it .
positive	well , not only does this sight sell what most stores don ' t , it compares prices to other competitors .
positive	i was literally able to find an item on another site , post the url in the item i wanted from supplement_warehouse and i got it for cheaper on this sight .
positive	no other sight compares to this honestly , and so i will keep investing with this company .
positive	oh not too mention you also can gain additional items for free with your purchases .
positive	i was quite skeptical in the beginning but after_reading all the good reviews i decided to give it a try .
positive	and voila it worked !
positive	the only minor bug is that you may have to restore your iphone before the activation works .
positive	after i restored mine it gave_me an activation error_message , i followed the instructions in the email and disconnected my iphone for 0 seconds and reconnected it again , and there it was unlocked .
positive	a much needed service , thanks a million !
positive	it has a large_variety of clothing and accessories that everyone can like and enjoy .
positive	there is also no tax sales so the prices are cheaper , not to mention that the clothing already is at a low price .
positive	i have recently used this site and was more than happy with simplicity of the booking process including the payment .
positive	the hotel was just as_described , if not even better .
positive	i will_definitely use this site again !

positive	i love the new express_deals , you can save a lot of money and still see the location and amenities of each hotel .
positive	i will never stay at a hotel without using priceline .
positive	my decal came in the mail and my first impression was that it was a really nice looking decal .
positive	i was so happy with the way it looked and the fact that i got a matching wallpaper with it .
positive	it was easy to get on , but i had to cut a little of the sides to get it to fit and i didn ' t use the front decal .
positive	overall i ' m very_pleased with it and i ' ve even gotten compliments on the design !
positive	awesome for a free service .
positive	no ads on the webpage & i haven ' t missed a single picture .
positive	i would recommend reading the " how to ' s " thoroughly though , at first i was a bit confused .
positive	use amazon at_least once a week .
positive	prime is an awesome deal for the consumer .
positive	i ' ve always had wonderful service and great prices .
positive	loved the amount of different_styles .
positive	made me super excited to try them on .
positive	cant_wait_till my my order comes .
positive	i want more from yesstyle !
positive	a friend of mine told me to try this site out , it ' s where he buys all of his supplements .
positive	i am a first time buyer and extremely pleased with the pricing and the amount of supplements available , and the fact that if you do find something that ' s better priced wise they just don ' t match it but they beat it by 0_%.
positive	i will be using the supplement_warehouse from now on , and recommending it to anyone and everyone that i meet !
positive	!
positive	it ' s definitely a five_star shopping website and its one of my favorite sites to shop at .
positive	(★^ o ^★)
positive	the clothes are super_cute and comfy and the shipping doesn ' t actually take that long ( though i ' ve had instances where i just wished it could just appear at my door ｏ (≧∇≦) ｏ ).
positive	their selection is phenomenal ( they have everything ) and all the pieces are all pretty decently priced .
positive	i especially love how there are pictures on how to style the piece .
positive	o (◡‿◡✿) it ' s really helpful when i ' m heading out and want to try something new .
positive	the website is really easy to maneuver around o (≧∇≦ o ) to find out what you need , as is checking_out and there ' s always some type of promotion or coupon to help you save even more money .
positive	the only con ?
positive	it takes_forever to figure_out what you want to buy because you ' ll end up wanting everything !

positive	i was very_pleased .
positive	i ordered a phone with cell0get . com and had a problem with it .

positive	i was comfortable having him work in my home while i was there with my three children .

positive	thank_you
positive	fast reliable service .
positive	the products were delivered in a timely_manner with no deficiencies .
positive	the best thing about nordstrom is not their prices .
positive	they do all upper end quality stuff so if i ' m looking for basics like undershirts or leggings i wouldn ' t come here .
positive	but for work gear and anything that i need to last this is the first place to go .
positive	nordstrom ' s has a very lax return_policy and i ' m sure that must cost them on occasion but its also the reason i can spend with abandon here .
positive	i never have to worry_about poor_quality because i know they will always take my purchases back if i ' m not fully_satisfied .
positive	really it rarely happens anyway .
positive	staff is always super friendly and helpful and they carry a lot of hard to find sizes .
positive	amazon have very unique product at great prices .
positive	if you need something hard to find check with amazon and you would find it and at reasonable price .
positive	i love that amazon stand_behind its sales so there ' s no risk in buying products from unknown vendors .
positive	i really like the furniture from select_furnishings .
positive	i bought a bunch of stuff here when i moved into my condo and i ' m thrilled with all my purchases .
positive	it ' s has a very cool modern look to it , it ' s very affordable , and it doesn ' t look cheap !
positive	i got some furniture for my patio space here and i ' m constantly receiving compliments on my purchases when i have friends over .
positive	i found these style - looking shoes to look really great and much cheaper compared to u . s versions , also it ' s a new style to me !
positive	really easy to buy from and great prices .
positive	can ' t be beat !
positive	i had to take the kids to disney before they got too old , but where to start ?
positive	someone told me about hotelstip . com , so i googled it up on my computer .
positive	im on the front page and there is a search_engine staring at me so i put in " disney ," and get three choices ; france , florida , and anaheim .

positive	the cd_keys i have been receiving over the years are not fake & work perfectly .
positive	the only cautious behavior one needs to take when purchasing products from here is to make_sure the keys are not region locked and that they work at where you live .
positive	i rate their service an a ++++ 00 / 00 .
positive	my first time shopping at this site .
positive	was easy to find what i wanted .
positive	had lots of choices and good prices .

positive	there is a vast amount of supplements availible to chose from all of which have great discounts .

positive	they have such wide selections and for such reasonable prices .
positive	i love everything they have to offer and love to browse their shop all the time .
positive	if you get express_shipping for just a little extra then your clothes arrive within 0 days , it ' s crazy !

positive	always recommend this site to not just girls but guys as_well .
positive	you would be a fool not to shop here .
positive	i ' ve been on other_sites , and this one gave_me theeeeee !!
positive	lowest_prices period .
positive	handige webwinkel want alle producten staan goed ingedeeld naar waar je op zoek bent .
positive	verder werden de producten snel geleverd en is mijn vraag snel beantwoord door de klantenservice .
positive	overall great deals !
positive	don ' t have to order from many different places now .

positive	simple , fast and good price .
positive	i recommend 0_stars .
positive	i now use cult_pens for all my art pen needs as not only do they have everything i need , but they ship my order off straight_away so i can often receive my pens the next_day ( or two_days if i ordered in the afternoon ).
positive	brilliant .

positive	how can it get better ?
positive	well , they ' re also incredibly fast ... yeah , it ' s like a permanent summer sale .
positive	check with them before buying on steam , they may be able to save you a decent amount .
positive	i did a mistake buying some product , the agent return my money and i bought the correct product without problems
positive	no_problems with the order , arrived as it should have as have other orders in the past .
positive	went to the shop to see if they had the make and model in stock , they had the right model in a different colour at the warehouse which they got in for me to try later on in the day .
positive	they then ordered the right model in the right colour and it arrived on the day they said it would .
positive	i ' ve been dealing_with supplement_warehouse for years_now , and from my experience they are the only company i will ever go through when it comes to vitamins and supplements , great shipping , love the price_match and have such a variety of products you can find anything on there
positive	i live in ireland delivery was only £ 0 , i wouldn ' t get delivery that cheap within my own country and i believe that is the standard european rate .
positive	on top of cheap delivery it was very fast considering the distance it had to travel and the amount i paid it took a week to the day to get here .
positive	when my package arrived everything i ordered was there and in great condition apart_from a hole in the box of a knife i ordered but that ' s not important in the least all the goods were in top condition .
positive	add the easy navigated website to this and you have a flawless buying experience .
positive	oh and the prices are very reasonable in general also , hence the five_stars .
positive	perfect .
positive	after adding the initial item to my cart that i was going to purchase , they presented such a huge list of free_samples and discounted_items on the cart page that i perused it for about a half - hour .
positive	wow , i got so much free_stuff : protein_powders and bars , energy drinks , etc .
positive	the shipping was a little high , but that ' s pretty normal considering the weight of the package due to all the free items i got .
positive	great place !
positive	my husband and i have been traveling around the world for 0 year and we have been booking most of our hostels on hostelbookers . com .
positive	they have the best website , the best prices for hostels , and you can trust that the places you will be staying are good based on previous travelers ' reviews .
positive	i like that you can book online at any time of the day and get an instant reservation .
positive	there is no stress or waiting to hear back from the hostel to know if your reservation went through .
positive	when you are traveling for an extended period of time , you want things to go quickly and easily so you can enjoy your time traveling , not be checking your email 00 times a day to see if the hostels got back to you on reservations .
positive	the website has descriptions of facilities and photos of the hostels as_well , so you know what to expect .
positive	i also like that hostelbookers does not charge a fee , as other_websites do .
positive	sometimes plans change .
positive	you can get sick or you miss a bus , or maybe even your bus doesn ' t show up !
positive	i don ' t want to lose out on a lot of money if these problems arise .
positive	most travelers who are staying in hostels are on a budget and can ' t aford to pay all these extra fees .
positive	it ' s good to know that hostelbookers understands the needs of travelers .
positive	fast and reliable service .
positive	thank_you so much
positive	we have purchased a couple of formal dresses from light in the box .
positive	they have both been amazingly great quality for the price paid .
positive	items arrived in a timely_manner , and were described accurately .
positive	we will_continue to buy from them .
positive	paid me full price for my iphone 0 00gb when they were out of stock and couldn ' t send me a replacement .
positive	delivery was quick .
positive	i appreciated that there was no postage charge , so price reasonable and phone protector was good quality .
positive	i have used feel good contacts as they have a good range of lenses , so i have experimented with cheaper and more expensive brands , they seem to be one of the cheapest suppliers , especially if you buy in volume and wait for a sale / discount_code and delivery has always been super_fast for me .
positive	the price i paid for energy gels was the cheapest around even with next_day delivery !
positive	i will come_back when i run out !
positive	just wanted to take a moment to express my satisfaction with right channel radios .
positive	they are a quality operation , care about their customers and provide only quality products .
positive	0_stars isn ' t enough .
positive	i bought some prescription sunglasses when there was an offer on .
positive	what i didn ' t realise was the sunglasses tint came with uvb000 included , and i ended_up buying the lens package that included this as_well .
positive	i only chose that lens option because i needed the uvb000 .
positive	apart_from that everything else is just fantastic , the home trial is such a great idea .
positive	i was told it would take up to 00 days for my glasses to be delivered , it took 0 days !
positive	great price on some really cute flats - buy one get one free !
positive	two_pairs of shoes for $_00 !

positive	bought call of duty_black_ops_0 for pc .
positive	key got delivered in only a few_minutes and that for the cheapest price on the web !
positive	the mark of a good company is how they deal with problems when they inevitably arise .
positive	with the amount of illegal keygens out there , giving out a used key is going to happen at some point unfortunately , but these_guys , from time of me sending a support message , dealt_with my issue within 00 minutes .
positive	that ' s pretty good form indeed !
positive	will_definitely buy from again .
positive	they also provide a fast response to tickets , so if you can ' t get something to work ( even with their awesome guides ) they are willing to help you through the fast support system :) all in all , they provide excellent services on their products , and those products are even cheap , that ' s what i need !
positive	the items u chose are so nice and the prices are so reasonable .. i ' m waiting for my items to arrive so that i can try them on .. but i have one comment for the boots i guess u ' ll have to put how long the boot is and the diameter and for the heals i guess u ' ll have to put the height of the heals ... this will help to much in the size_chart .. because the only_thing i ' m afraid of is that it won ' t fit right :) else everything is perfect :_d
positive	my tie_rack from ties . com was processed and shipped quickly and is of great quality .
positive	the price was great and much more affordable than going through a traditional menswear dealer .
positive	this sup website is awesome , has the best deals and even better free_sample options !

positive	i am so thankful because today i am a homeowner .
positive	i owe the greatest portion of that to god but the next greatest portion i owe to veterans_united .

positive	i ' m a thrifty person by nature , and in this day and age eating right and keeping overall wellness is hard .

positive	people just don ' t seem to realize they are paying more for the same exact room .
positive	i like bidding , of course with priceline i haven ' t been dissappointed , i tell it how much i am willing to spend and whala i get the best possible room for my money .
positive	being us based , i really like to shop in this site primarily because what they sell here are basically have better aesthetics than a lot of stuff that can be found here .

positive	i have a nikon camera which broke once in the past and when i sent it in to nikon to get repaired there was an obscene amount of paperwork , effort , and online shenangling involved in finally getting the thing ffixxed , and even then it took weeks to get fixxed and returned .
positive	in contrast , when my camera broke again and i sent it to squaretrade ( rather_than to the manufacturer ), there was no paperwork , a very eay online process , and the product got fixxed and is now on its way back , all in the course of only one week .
positive	it was easier and faster_than even the manufacturer ' s original warranty !
positive	thanks to yesstyle , i am able to shop from clothing lines i would be able to shop from back in south_korea , where i was born :) i was adopted as a baby , and although i have no_idea about my korean culture , i find myself gravitating toward korean_fashion !

positive	will use this site again !
positive	amazin , quick , fast and great service !

positive	i really enjoy_shopping there for the latest asian_fashion being that i ' m so far from hong_kong !
positive	i brought my broken frames to lenscrafters ( where i got my glasses ) and they told me that they were unfixable ( and then quickly shifted the conversation to buying a new pair from them right_away ).
positive	opticsfast fixed them in less_than a week , for under_$_000 - which is so much less_than a new pair .
positive	thanks opticsfast !
positive	i always turn to agoda when booking for accommodation overseas .
positive	agoda is reliable and professional .
positive	in this day and age of internet scams , i am confident about using agoda for my online transactions .
positive	its working fine
positive	i was hesitant to use cjs -_cdkeys because i ' d heard some things , however the price was good and i needed a bargain , so i took the plunge .

positive	i will_definitely use this website again as their prices are the best around .
positive	yesterday was my first order on onlinekeystore and it was great .

positive	i highly_recommend this company to anyone searching for games .
positive	i find it a great site to buy or rent textbooks for any class , with great quality at a very low cost .
positive	i use this one to translate and learn new words in other languages and in english too , it is quite informative and easy to use , i love it :)
positive	it has everything , and it is unlimited about what you can do as a manager of your_own team , the only_thing i would love to see is a little change , in which the hattrick live matches instead of reading what happened in the match watching a mini java , shockwave , ms silverlight , or any video platform of what happened in the match , and also a feature of changing that background color of the website , not just green , but purple , black , blue , red , yellow , etc .
positive	other than that the game is great .
positive	my experience with you it ' s always great , i find everything i need , and cheaper_than anywhere_else you ' re still to my opinion on top of the game , so keep it up .
positive	whoever doesn ' t know amazon they don ' t know how to shop wisely over the internet .
positive	with amazon , 00 . 0 % of the things you want to buy you will find it there and many of them cheaper_than any other store .
positive	i recommend it very much to anybody .
positive	keep it up .
positive	i conceive paypal very much , hopefully it never gets hacked or take_advantage of its customers .
positive	it is used for many millions of people and trusted almost everywhere for any monetary transaction , and so far for me it hasn ' t let me down yet , when i purchase something using it or when transferring money from one place to another , it is just great !
positive	i just simply love it , it is the best video site out there and the most complete collection of videos , where you can find anything you would want to watch and from many languages .
positive	one feature that some other video website have that i ' d love youtube could add is the ability to change the aspect ration of the videos played like 00 : 0 , 0 : 0 , etc , and an ability to " switch on and off the lights " of the website , while watching a video so it looks darker if you don ' t like putting the vids on full - screen ..
positive	you can find many things at cheaper costs compared to other retail_stores .
positive	it ' s very easy to more around the site and find what you need .
positive	google is the best search_engine out there , gives you more specific answers to your inquiries , whatever you type , bam is there .
positive	the only_thing that i ' m missing from it , is the cache or " highlighted " feature that it had when you wanted to find where something was written in a website .
positive	working as part of the trustpilot team is a true pleasure .
positive	this is an exciting and dynamic place to work with a product offering and vision that is second to none .
positive	every member of the trustpilot family works as a team to help each other and the company get better and grow every day .
positive	truly , every day at trustpilot is a 0 star day !!

positive	this store has all the parts i need for cheaper_than anywhere_else , online or off .
positive	ricky was on time and very patient with the process and all of my questions .
positive	the only alarm company out of many that i called that offered me same_day install .
positive	called at 00 and had alarm service before 0 !
positive	another reason_why i chose this company and the monitoring service is their status with the bbb .
positive	i am very happy with my service so far .
positive	i travel all the time and priceline ' s express_deals save me up to $_00 each night .
positive	the few_times i ' ve had issues their customer_service reps are always willing to assist !

positive	nu_har jeg fået , hvad_jeg tjente i dag .
positive	mangler stadig hvad_jeg_har tjent indtil i dag ...
positive	bought these for friends many_times - they are literally a basketful of pure delight !!
positive	reasonably_priced , quick delivery and creates smiles all round !
positive	they are a great talking point , and i have been ridiculed many_times for not recognising some of the sweets - must be an age thing !!
positive	;)
positive	amazing range of products - something to suit everyone !
positive	i bought the ' tea for two ' halfmug set .
positive	i was , and still am , delighted with the price and service .
positive	i had been looking for half mugs for over 0 years - so this was a very welconed find !
positive	thank_you iwoot - keep the quirkiness going !
positive	i ' ve bought many products from stores and other_sites .
positive	none of them compare to the great selection and prices at supplement_warehouse .
positive	i would highly_recommend them to any and all my friends .
positive	very beautiful dress !
positive	looks exactly as in the picture , only better in real life !
positive	it is a little shorter than i expected , considering my hollow - to - flow measurement , but the length is as_pictured so i am pleased .
positive	i ordered mine in burgundy and the color is very true to the chiffon chart , though on pictures it looks brighter .
positive	the dress fits_perfectly .
positive	my measurements are b : 00 ", w : 00 . 0 ", h : 00 . 0 " got a size 0 and it fits just right .
positive	quality wise , this dress is very well put_together , with good support on top and stable stitching .
positive	shipping took a while , and came a day late , but no big_deal .
positive	all in all , i am very_pleased with this order .
positive	look_forward to making more purchases here !
positive	been shopping at sw for years .
positive	never disappointing .
positive	sw saved me so much money since discovering .
positive	i recommend it to anyone i can .
positive	i just started_using supplement_wharehouse but i wont use any other site .
positive	used while deployed to sw asia and shipping has come within 0 days !
positive	the price_match is the best thing in the world and ensures they actually care about the customer .
positive	got gear , and now i am similing .
positive	multumesc pentru o experienta foarte buna .

positive	very good the price and everything is very reasonable
positive	edit_: nov 0 , 0000
positive	first , i want to say i ' ve done research on yesstyle for a good 0 ~ 0 years before finally buying .
positive	now on to the review :
positive	yesstyle has yet to let me down .
positive	i ' ve ordered from them 0 times and just now made my fourth purchase .
positive	there are some items i wasn ' t as happy with when i tried them on , but this is no fault of yesstyle .
positive	it just depends which shop you buy from and accuracy of their information ( measurements , images , etc ).
positive	the first time i ordered it took no time .
positive	the second time , however , i was worried my order got lost , but it did turn up after 0 weeks .
positive	i think i must ' ve been lucky with how quickly i received my order the first time and expected it to go that quickly and smoothly again .
positive	in any case , i ' ve received every purchase i ' ve ever made with no real problems .
positive	( just a little worrying because the second courier didn ' t update their tracking frequently enough for me )
positive	anyway , i recommend yesstyle to those_who like asian_fashion .
positive	you can really stand_out buying the clothes from here .
positive	by the way , make_sure to order ready to ship items ( items that ship in 0 ~ 0 days ) i ' ve stuck to this method so far and have received everything in a timely_manner .
positive	but i ' ve heard some real horror_stories with 0 ~ 00 day items .
positive	but if you really want that 0 ~ 00 day item go_ahead and take a chance .
positive	but i advise you order that item alone as its own separate transaction from other items , otherwise , you will have to wait for them to check if any stores have that item and it will delay the shipment of your whole purchase .
positive	the website is great look at .
positive	the delivery was fast .
positive	would recommend it .
positive	fast delivery , good services .
positive	best cdkeys seller ever !
positive	whether you ' re a seasoned gap - year backpacker , honeymooners on holiday , or a weekend warrior , hostel_bookers will have the right accommodation for you .
positive	the list of hotels and hostels in almost every city around the world is comprehensive , and the detailed descriptions and ability to leave reviews and ratings allow the traveler to make the best choice .
positive	their reservation system is trustworthy and accurate , and the confirmation emails always have directions and reservation price information - which can be a life_saver !
positive	my wife and i are traveling around the world for an extended gap - year , and hostelbookers . com is always our first stop for reservations .
positive	dirt_cheap !
positive	we found out at 0pm yesterday that we needed a passport for our 0 month old baby .
positive	we did not think there was any possible way we could ever get this but terry just called to let me know that 00 hours_later , my passport is shipping to me and i will have it to leave the country this weekend .
positive	every company i called said it would be at_least 0 days before i could have it and terry made it happen in 0 day .
positive	thanks to him , we are going to spain after all !
positive	thank_you !
positive	thank_you !
positive	thank_you !

positive	the deal is almost_instant and it ' s safe and sound
positive	i always can save at_least a few bucks on hotel travel when using priceline .
positive	don ' t worry_about selecting even a two star_hotel for a lower_price , because the quality is usually a lot better_than you would think for a two star .
positive	great budget saver !
positive	with all the products available and the cheapest prices around , it ' s foolish to get supps anywhere_else .
positive	been shopping with them for years_now and any questions or order updates are responded to in a timely_manner .
positive	i have used multiple websites over the years to purchases supplements .

positive	even if i had a problem the support was fast and very helpful .
positive	keep_up the good service !
positive	i live just down the street from them , and feel welcomed and taken_care of every time i pop into the store .
positive	they always give me great deals , and are just super good people .
positive	they are probably part of the reason_why i am addicted to the track , i don ' t know if i would have gotten as into it if i hadn ' t been to their shop and talked to their guys .
positive	reviews are half and half but i ' ll update more when i receive all or part of my order in the time it was promised .
