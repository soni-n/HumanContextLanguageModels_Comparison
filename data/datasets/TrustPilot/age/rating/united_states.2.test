negative	the price quoted for me is $_000 which include t tax , liablility insurance , unlimited mileage .
negative	the website site and many review said there is not hidden fee .
negative	this is what i found out after a conversation with an agent of the company ;
negative	0 .
negative	i need to pay for a full tank of gas when i pick_up the car which they can charge me at any price they see fit .
negative	0 .
negative	i need to pay 00_% extra at the airport , why was ' nt that included in the quote .
negative	don_'_t be fooled by the lower price that they quoted .
negative	you will end up more_than other company .
negative	then the agent said he will find me a car that i don_'_t have to pay for # 0 and 0 , but the price is over $ 0000 .
negative	what a joke !
negative	cuation : be very careful , you never know what else you will get suck into when you are at the airport and needed a car .
negative	good_luck my friends .
negative	# 0 .
negative	they will not answer there phone .
negative	( if you can find the number !!!)
negative	then it will put you on hold until it hangs up # 0 .
negative	on line . they say ; you will be contacted within 00 to 00 hours ??????
negative	for there reply .. ( haven " nt hear from them yet .
negative	( but i did revived this review ?).
negative	what this is all about ??
negative	# 0 . they sent the wrong part !!!!
negative	at this point i will take the lost and hope they will use the $$$$ to get better employers . not employees .
negative	thanks for " nutin " we will be spreading the word . jrh they should read there reviews .
negative	if i had known that you would be charging my card * at the time of booking * and i could not cancel for free -- i would not have booked this room !
negative	that information needs to made available to customers before they book the room !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i will never use this website again !
negative	i recently got back into model railroading and have been buying most of my supplies on the internet .
negative	i found hobby linc and noted they have good prices so over the past 0 months i have spent well over $ 0 , 000 .
negative	on their site without a problem .
negative	on my most recent order i received my shipment and 0 item was noted to be broken in the package and another one was not in a package but loose in the box with the package opened and left in the box ... there were also parts missing .
negative	i contacted the company and i was told since i did not pay for insurance i could return the items , but i would have to pay for shipping ?
negative	i told them the box the items arrived in was not damaged and therefore insurance would not have covered it ... the items were shipped in a damaged state .
negative	i was told that if you did not pay for insurance then they did not pay for the return even if it is their fault .
negative	i questioned them about this and i was told i would have to deal with the manufacturer for the item that was received damaged in the box .
negative	i asked why it was my responsibility to deal with the manufacturer if hobby linc sent out damaged goods to begin with ?
negative	i was told that was their policy .
negative	i pointed_out that their " policy " allowed them to put items they had on hand that were damaged in their warehouse into a box going to a customer and them have the customer deal with their damaged items !
negative	when i emailed them about the missing parts and asked that if theyt could at_least send the missing parts !
negative	i never received and answer to that email .
negative	buyer_beware !!!
negative	the prices are good but if anything is damaged when received good_luck getting it taken_care of .
negative	it appears that hobby lincs has 0 star reviews from everyone that orders from them provided they do not have any damage to their order .
negative	however , everyone that has had problems with their order gives them a one star review ....
negative	isn_'_t that interesting .
negative	i told them their policy needs some rethinking and told them they just lost a good customer
negative	very unhealthy food .
negative	would never eat here .
negative	i am recent customer of onlineticketexpress and i can say only bad and very bad things about this company .
negative	i really don_'_t believe that any of the positive_reviews listed here are true .
negative	here is the mail i have send to them after finalizing whole deal ( tickets for the first game euro 0000 poland - greece )
negative	" ok you want me to give my comments about deal through you company than here you have .
negative	first i didn ’ t received tickets i ordered . i ordered 0 tickets so called vip gold which of course were most expensive with information that they would be best avalaible seats on the side tribunes .
negative	i havent ’ t got those i received instead 0 tickets of 0 category nominal value of 0 ticket 000 zł approx 000_euro ( i paid 000_euro ).
negative	so i feel cheated by you with no word explanation .
negative	if you consider yourself fair , professional and service minded company i should get some kind of compensation .
negative	secondly the way you handled whole deal was disaster .
negative	in the order confirmation you wrote that tickets should be delivered 0 - 0 days before the event .
negative	in fact i haven ’ t got any information earlier_than just one day before .
negative	i tried to to get info by phone but this was impossible neither of your phone numbers answered .
negative	i should get my tickets delivered to my private address instead i got info that i must collect them myself at the airport on the specific time actually very late just 0 hours before the event .
negative	luckily i live in warsaw what if i didn ’ t ’?
negative	i was at the airport earlier_than you recommended namely 0 . 00_pm and it was another lucky case not only for me but also for other people who decided to buy tickets through you .
negative	at tnt nobody was aware of shipment under the number i got from you because it was not in the system .
negative	but there was guy who tried to communicate with tnt personel who hardly spoke english .
negative	i help them and it turned_out that he was private courier who brought tickets from you among them also mine .
negative	i asked people from tnt to call all other people and inform them also about their tickets .
negative	i hope that they got them on time .
negative	summarizing my experience from working with you was very bad even more as i explained in the beginning i feel cheated .
negative	i am waiting for you prompt reaction before i place my comments on all avalaible review websites .
negative	robert pelka
negative	this company is the worst on the net .
negative	their service is terrible .
negative	they expect you to pay for their mistakes .
negative	lots of stupid caring messages from names that keep changing .
negative	seriously - buy glasses from anyone_else .
negative	even main street shops are better .
negative	i will never use priceline again .
negative	i booked a room with their " lowest_price guarantee ".
negative	i paid almost $_00 more_than the hotel would have charged me if i had just walked in off the street .
negative	priceline is a joke !
negative	!
negative	crap !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i would give you a lower number if possible !
negative	i place an order 000000000 . was told items were in stock and available .
negative	kept checking back - to find out today ( the day i should be getting it ) it is back ordered .
negative	it stills says processing never has said back ordered !
negative	i would have cancelled my order and ordered someone_else .
negative	which is probably why it doesnt say that it is not available !!!
negative	terrible and deceitful service
negative	wish i had read these reviews prior to ordering from digitlook .
negative	company took my christmas order , charged my credit_card , and than sent me an_email canceling the order a few_days_later .
negative	no explanation , no customer_service - voice messages unanswered .
negative	am now battling w_/ cc company to reverse charges
negative	stay_away from these scumbags !!!
negative	!
negative	to anybody thinking of using the services of this company ....
negative	please don_'_t !
negative	i placed an order online on 00 july , paying in advance via sagepay .
negative	an_email confirmation was received immediately and that was the first and only contact i have managed to achieve with this company .
negative	the telephone_number supplied in the confirmation rings incessantly , with no scope for leaving a message .
negative	emails receive no response and although sagepay inform me that they contacted the company , i am not aware that they received any answer , either .
negative	the address supplied in herne bay , kent is a private house , which i have seen for myself as i live not far away .
negative	i did not call in at the address as i was waiting for the " reasonable time " ( 00 days ) to elapse before cancelling the order .
negative	a recorded delivery letter to the address , informing the company of my intention to cancel the order under the sale of goods_act and the distance selling regulations , has received no response , but has not been returned by the post_office , so was presumably signed for .
negative	to add to the mystery , the company has not actually taken the payment via sagepay and will not now be able to do so .
negative	i have now cancelled the order , am obviously without the goods ordered and have paid for a recorded delivery letter with no means of recouping the cost .
negative	i shall now try to persuade sagepay to kick this company into touch as one of their merchants and am enlisting my local citizens ' advice bureau '_s help .
negative	they intend to ask kent county council '_s trading_standards department to investigate britishsupermarketworldwide . com to ascertain whether the company is trading according to the relevant regulations .
negative	in the meantime , please avoid this company like the plague !
negative	ps to trustpilot : what is the point of insisting on a minimum number of stars in a case like this ?
negative	one star out of five is a score of 00 %: quite ludicrous !
negative	just installed a rebuilt 0rzfe engine in a 00 toyota tacoma for my son .
negative	for those of you that need 0 they are hard to find and $ 0000 . 00 plus core charge .
negative	once complete it would not run properly , we started trouble shooting to find that 0 of the 0 injectors were badly corroded .
negative	so i ordered replacements from buyautoparts . com .
negative	after installing the engine ran slightly better but still on not all 0 cylinders .
negative	while starting a noid test to see if the injectors are getting the proper fire , on the second injector the engine made a loud knocking sound that concerned the mechanic i was working with .
negative	we pulled the plugs out to see that # 0 plug was drenched in fuel and had not been firing .
negative	the new injector had filled the cylinder with fuel causing hydrolock ( bent cylinder rod ).
negative	after contacting buyautoparts . com about the defective part they wanted to speak to the mechanic and they would get back to me shortly .
negative	my mechanic called them then called me back , after 0 hours waiting for buyauto to call me then i finally called them back .
negative	the customer_service person was to send a replacement injector at no charge but refuses to give me any assistance in repairing the damaged caused_by the faulty part .
negative	she even stated that the part is probably not bad but i had other issued causing the injector to dump fuel and the same problem would happen with the replacement .
negative	i took the injectors and had them tested to find that 0 were operating properly spraying 00cc '_s of fuel yet the 0th was spraying 00cc '_s which filled the cylinder with fuel and caused this problem .
negative	i then contacted buyautoparts . com again , i sent them paperwork indicating the test results along with a video of the test , i again asked about liability and how they are going to assist me in the additional repairs .
negative	they stated that their warranty does not cover labor replacing a defective part yet i kept stating i was not looking for labor on the part , i needed parts and labor to repair other issued caused_by the part .
negative	they sent me a copy of the warranty and the last line is " we expressly disclaim liability for incidental and consequential damages caused_by the auto part sold ".
negative	here it is , i ' m screwed !
negative	i with i could expressly disclaim liability in my business and get away with it .
negative	them i realized that this company is a google trusted store so i contacted google for assistance with my issued .
negative	google was able to get me a full_refund of the original cost of my order but they were not able to get buyautoparts . com to take responsibility for the problems they caused me .
negative	now thanks to this faulty part i have to spend another $_000 . 00 in additional parts along with the labor cost to repair a perfectly good engine that has never ran before !
negative	i am owed money for 0 phones which i up graded last summer .
negative	0 htc phones and was told i would get £_00 . 00 .
negative	but i never got a penny .
negative	it '_s a shame all of us who were ripped_off can '_t track these ars × holes down and do something about it .
negative	if they are not paying us they should at_least send phones back .
negative	they can be traced by imei numbers .
negative	i am gutted i am sick and unable to work for sometime now due to heart and kidney problems , i needed that money .
negative	it ’_s not true .
negative	i took them up on their offer of “ guaranteed booking or your money back ”, i paid £_000 . 00 in march 0000 .
negative	after a year with them i have not had any bookings , so i emailed several_times asking for my money back and got no response .
negative	i even posted a message on their facebook_page , which has now mysteriously disappeared and some one responded saying that they had been trying , unsuccessfully , to contact me .
negative	huh !
negative	my email_address and phone_number is on all my messages and on the owners rentals website .
negative	i doubt i will ever see my money !
negative	they are crooks !
negative	great concept , horrible company .
negative	what you need to know :
negative	the quotes are not " free " in as much as you have to pay to act on them .
negative	shiply calls it a " deposit " but it '_s actually a non_- returnable fee for getting the contact details of the shipping company .
negative	if for whatever reason the shipping company is unable to fulfil , shiply keep your money , no ifs no buts .
negative	in my case i never_heard from the shipping company , they didn_'_t contact me to complete and they never replied to emails , and shiply kept my money and were dismissive in the process .
negative	i think that breaches uk consumer_protection laws and have reported them to trading_standards .
negative	i have seen lots of other people with similar complaints who have had to try and recover their money from their credit_card or paypal .
negative	i think when the service works it '_s great , but if something goes_wrong you are screwed .
negative	i had an item to be collected for return , they did not collect .
negative	rescheduled , they did not collect .
negative	i phoned and waited 00_mins ( at my expense ) i was informed the wait time would be 00_minutes .
negative	i was told that <_private data_removed_> from complaints would return my call in a minute , after 0 hours i went out .
negative	i e_- mailed a complaint , no reply .
negative	i phoned again , was told by <_private data_removed_> that the item would be collected by 0pm that night , it was collected at 0pm , i was also told that <_private data_removed_> would contact me the next_morning to confirm collection .
negative	that was00 days ago and yet again no phone_call , i do not hold out much hope .
negative	absolutely usless !!
negative	and all at my time and expense
negative	service ?
negative	what service !!!!!
negative	oh and i was told that they do not give compensation for phone_calls made at my expense even_though the problem was caused_by yodel .
negative	i '_ve never dealt_with a less ethical company then paypal .
negative	i will never use their service under any circumstance .
negative	they should not be trusted for their poor customer_service and total_lack of ethics .
negative	the worst .
negative	i would not use again .
negative	i booked an expensive room in nyc , planning to spend the night with two adults and two children .
negative	the hotel informed me that no more_than two people could be permitted in the room , and that only priceline customer_service could fix the problem ( by allowing their " king room " with sofa bed ).
negative	the other alternative of course was that i pay for an extra room at their exhorbitant price .
negative	i called priceline customer_service , which sounded like a call_center in india , and after a long wait , they would do nothing more_than read a passage to me saying that all rooms are nonrefundable .
negative	no service at all , just delay and unpleasantness .
negative	it is not okay when traveling to arrive at the hotel with tired children and find that you can not actually be permitted to stay in the room you already paid for .
negative	( fortunately , we found out before actually leaving home , but feel cheated of quite a lot of money .)
negative	bought a groupon to take a balloon flight with this company .
negative	i lost count of how many_times i called and left a message with no return call .
negative	then when i finally talked with someone , there were no weekend dates available in this century .
negative	then when i finally scheduled a date to go , and after i woke up at 0 :_00am and drove over an_hour to make it to temecula in time for a sunrise flight , i arrived to find out the flight was cancelled due to weather .
negative	strange ...
negative	i saw at_least eight other balloons flying in what could only be described as perfect conditions .
negative	fought with both sunrise balloons and groupon to get a refund , in a frustrating but eventually successful battle .
negative	but did i get refunded for all the time i spent including the trip to and from temecula , or the gas i used ?
negative	nope .
negative	it cost me a lot of time and money to learn what i ' m about to tell you : don_'_t use this company .
negative	got a groupon for a hot air balloon ride with sunrise balloons in temecula .
negative	first off , the deal claimed the value was $_000 and the groupon was for $_00 .
negative	but later i discover that several other_companies in the area - all of which have way higher yelp ratings ( strike one ) - all charge about $_000 to $_000 .
negative	so the " value " was substantially inflated .
negative	strike two .
negative	called the company to try to redeem and no one answered so left a message .
negative	no response after two_days .
negative	strike thee .
negative	called again .
negative	voicemail again .
negative	called again , and again , and again .
negative	strike four , five , etc .
negative	finally got a hold of someone , who helped_me schedule a flight for a date over a month away because none of the many dates i wanted were available .
negative	another strike .
negative	when the fateful date arrives , i wake up at 0 :_00am and show up at the launch site at 0 - something in the morning after driving over an_hour to temecula , no sunrise balloons .
negative	so i call and - surprise - no answer .
negative	when i finally talk to someone , they say they had to cancel due to weather .
negative	what ?
negative	i saw at_least 0 other balloons floating through the early morning sky on what could only be described as a perfect day .
negative	were they in different weather ?
negative	when i contacted groupon for a refund , they told me that it is the nature of ballooning that sometimes flights cancel due to weather , and i needed to try to reschedule and only if i was not able to reschedule would i get a refund .
negative	what about a refund for the frustration , and the gas i used to drive to temecula ?
negative	groupon needs to do a better job of a ) choosing the companies they work with b ) stating the actual value of the product or service and c ) not ripping people off .
negative	there is no rating this company .
negative	rating of 0
negative	i don_'_t care how long they have been in service
negative	web_site is a blanket cover
negative	shouldn '_t be allowed to do business
negative	our booking stated 0 hour 00_minutes approximately , for our transfer to agios nikalaos from heraklion .
negative	from boarding the coach to arriving at the resort it was 0 hours .
negative	the person meeting us at our accommodation had given us up and gone home .
negative	we had been travelling since 0 . pm the previous day with 0 children age 0 and 0 years .
negative	our confirmation of booking states ' they will be responsible for your smooth and efficient transportation from and to the airport ; we guarantee you will be arriving at your destination on time ' we did not risk the transfer back , and took the local bus instead .
negative	however | know of others who took the transfer back to the airport , the journey again took longer than_expected and they had to rush at the airport .
negative	we contacted resorthoppa only to be told the time quoted was only and estimate .
negative	i contacted them further , several_times , requesting their abta number , but never received a reply .
negative	i have since contacted abta who tell me the company are not a member .
negative	i have taken advise from trading_standards and have written to resorthoppa again requesting a reply within 00 days .
negative	we will never use this company again .
negative	i bought a men '_s thigh length compression garment following my hip revision surgery with removal of a seroma .
negative	the zipper on the garment broke after about two months .
negative	i emailed and called customer_service on several_occasions leaving a contact telephone_number and an_email_address .
negative	no one ever responded !
negative	i would advise people in need of compression garments to look for other vendors because once lymphedema products has your money they don_'_t know you .
negative	i will not use this service again .
negative	i had to cancel due to a death of a close friend and was charged $_00 . 00 just to cancel a hotel for a couple of nights .
negative	next time i will just call and book the hotel directly .
negative	they only charge if you cancel 00 hours in advance .
negative	i canceled over 0 week in advance .
negative	a delivery arranged for my work address , made months in advance of the delivery , was completely botched .
negative	at great inconvenience to me and my co - workers , disrupting multiple plans , i am forced to work at home tomorrow .
negative	this is something basic that should go right the first time .
negative	since this is my first time using viagogo , i can report a 000_% disappointing experience .
negative	my transaction id is 0000000 .
negative	also worth pointing out after a fairly fruitless conversation with customer_service -- don_'_t call them , they '_ll call you , as all you '_ll get is an automated phone_number with no " real_person " option -- i got the customer_service rep to promise a call back from a manager to explain the cock - up .
negative	no call yet .
negative	i ' m waiting .

negative	today asking for your consideration to exchange for the same product
negative	( still in khaki ) in a size 00r .
negative	i noticed this product is back on sale again for £_000 . 00 and you

negative	would you please put aside a size 00r in the khaki for product code
negative	a0s000000 for me and hold it pending arrival of the returned product
negative	for exchange ?
negative	i would hate to miss out on your wonderful product due to a lack of

negative	my experience was very disappointing .
negative	i had a reservation to park and shuttle to the airport unfortunately when i arrived at the hotel i was told i could not park in the lot because i did not stay at the hotel , subsequently i had to park at the airport and incur an outrageous fee !!
negative	i reported the incident to customer_service at global parking and was told by two individuals , carolyn and amanda that unfortunately there was nothing that could be done about the expense that was incurred .
negative	as an individual who travels frequently finding a reliable parking service is important .
negative	when there is a break in communication with the hotel and the parking service the customer should be compensated for the inconvenience .
negative	the " little " inconvenience cost me a late arrival to the airport and a $_000 . 00 to park at the airport .
negative	definitely a horrible_experience and poor customer_service !
negative	i order a 0000 volvo 000 cornering light body which in fact did not fit my 0000 volvo 000 .
negative	i am very disappointed that it cost me $ 0 . 00 to ship and $ 0 . 00 to return the wrong_size part through no fault of my own .
negative	i did receive credit for the cost of the part .
negative	partsgeek . com advertised that this was the correct_part but it did not fit my auto .
negative	i hope this will help someone_else in the future in knowing the complete partsgeek . com return_policy .
negative	i don_'_t get it
negative	the parts i received were bad and were previously sent to another customer who returned it for the same problem and then they wanted me to purchase a new part and return the old part at my expense and when they receive the old part they would refund my money on the first part within 00 days ..
negative	anyway i ended_up buying an oem part that worked properly in order to get my customer taking care of .
negative	i guess thats the advantage of doing_business with a small company where every customer and sale are equally important unlike the big organizations like parts_geek .
negative	my company will never buy from parts_geek again ....
negative	i '_ve tried so hard to contact partsgeek . com by phone but to no_avail .
negative	have i known that this is just an e_- mail based contact , i should have avoided to buy parts from them .
negative	i received a wrong part , simply because they have only one choice of this part .
negative	they did not tell you that there are other parts for this same make , yr . and model of this car .
negative	in other words , they just give you one choice .
negative	i am referring to the headlight assembly of my 0000 gmc acadia .
negative	the picture in the website is right , but the connectors are different .
negative	they did not show that .
negative	this company is supposedly in the business for many years and yet , not so perfect of what they are selling .
negative	i ' m too frustrated and disappointed about my purchase experience with partsgeek . com .
negative	now .., i have to sacrifice returning the items in big boxes and to pay for all the return expenses such as freight , re - stocking fees , etc .
negative	for their mistakes .
negative	and for your information .
negative	if you make a negative comment on this site , your posting may not be able to get through ..
negative	i hate paypal because scammers always win money claims .
negative	there fees are ridiculous as well .
negative	my 00 year_old son passed_away suddenly at the age of 00 .
negative	he had a retirement account with principal and every person i spoke to gave me the wrong information on how to receive his funds .
negative	no less_than 0 people gave me improper directions resulting in countless hours of trips to notarys only to find out i was sent the wrong forms .
negative	beside the frustration in dealing_with company employees who were not knowledgeable of their services the emotional trauma of having to revisit dealing_with my deceased sons account was crushing .
negative	i felt entitled to some compensation for their bumbling this sensitive situation and while i received a letter stating they grossly mishandled my claim they would not offer any good will gesture to make up for my time and emotional hurt .
negative	this insensitive , cold hearted bumbling company is not where you want to put your money
negative	i ordered a bathroom set for express delivery and paid a premiuim price to have just the taps delivered .
negative	when i tried to dispute why the bath at when the plumber is coming the next_day , so i arranged for the delivery of the bath my self from their distributor for next_day delivery
negative	the bath came without the bath panel filthy dirty .
negative	told bath panel would be 00 days , but no exact date
negative	spoke with [_name ] about the terrible service offered twenty five pounds
negative	emailed him saying unacceptable 0 days ago and still no reply from big bathroom to my complaint or the complaints sent to their office
negative	they pretend to be cheap but your paying full retail as they use mark 0 distributors in bolton who are a trade outlet
negative	dont use them , they are useless and have no customer_service or understanding the of the stress waiting for a bathroom to come
negative	they have tried to have my review deleted
negative	they said that they could ulock my phone but then they coulndnt find the unlock_code for it
negative	rentalcars . com are misleading and misrepresent the full cost of the car_hire abroad .
negative	£_000 was taken from our credit_card for damage_excess refund in italy which we had already paid for in the uk .
negative	the company steals your money and doesn_'_t provide any unlock service !
negative	their method is to get pre_- payment ( e . g 00 , 00 £) from you and then on purpose delay the delivery so that you ' re not anymore able to cancel the order ( e . g .
negative	it '_s charged from your visa etc .
negative	account ).
negative	they do not respond to any refund demands and only response may come from their faked support telling they are still seeking for a solution for your operator - this is fake , they do not provide any unlock to you !
negative	order placed in beginning of january 0000 and still nothing !
negative	don_'_t use this service and don_'_t pay anything to them .
negative	i received my new sunglasses without a prescription .
negative	i then returned them with a copy of my rx .
negative	it has been over a month and have received nothing .
negative	i keep emailing them but get nothing but an acknowledgement of my email .
negative	i will never deal with them again .
negative	if only making a claim was as easy as buying the insurance .
negative	when you buy travel insurance the last thing you think about is claiming .
negative	had the misfortune of making a claim .
negative	took 0 hours to get through on the phone ( premium line number ) only to be told all claims in writing .
negative	very unhelpful staff .
negative	made a claim with all associated documents .
negative	they acknowledged and told us they were very busy so there would be a delay .
negative	after not hearing anything rang them and told they had emailed us , turned_out they had used the wrong email_address .
negative	still in process of sorting out , left chasing people for additional information and proof !
negative	have just cancelled their automatic renewal .
negative	beware !
negative	ho ordinato due capi il giorno 00 agosto 0000 , pagati subito con carta di credito .
negative	dopo settimane in cui non ho più saputo nulla sul mio ordine ho scritto al customer_service che mi ha assicurato che sarebbe stato fatto un controllo nel magazzino .
negative	dopo aver inviato alcune altre mail ( cui non sempre è stata data risposta ), finalmente mi viene confermato l ' invio della merce .
negative	aspetta e aspetta ... il giorno 0 ottobre finalmente arriva un pacco contenente uno solo dei capi ordinati e una lettera che assicurava l ' arrivo dell ' altro nel giro di 0 - 0 giorni .
negative	oggi è il 00 ottobre e dell ' altro oggetto neanche l ' ombra !!!
negative	!
negative	l ' oggetto mancante era il regalo per il compleanno di mio marito ( 00 settembre ) che avevo ordinato ben un mese prima della data ...... mi è stato promesso un dono per risarcirmi del disagio , ma anche quello sarà nel prossimo pacco ... sempre ammesso che arrivi !
negative	!
negative	gentile staff ,
negative	ho appena letto la vostra risposta e vi ringrazio per l ' attenzione prestata a quanto da me scritto .
negative	comprendo le difficoltà in cui incorre chi deve organizzare un lavoro complesso come il vostro , difficoltà di cui non avete mai fatto cenno nelle mail che mi avete inviato .
negative	a proposito della lettera presente nel pacco e riguardante il capo mancante , devo far presente che_non avete richiesto alcun contatto da parte mia per organizzare la nuova spedizione ( ed è questo il motivo per cui non vi ho più contattati !)
negative	.
negative	la dicitura presente è la seguente " egr .
negative	cliente , la presente per informarla che l ' articolo mancante è in fase di spedizione da un altro nostro punto logistico e pertanto lo riceverà a breve ( 0 - 0 giorni ) in un pacco successivo .
negative	per eventuali informazioni rivolgersi a info @ fashionqueen . net " ( cosa che avevo già fatto più volte e che_non ho ritenuto dover ripetere ).
negative	ringrazio ancora per l ' attenzione e spero che con il prossimo acquisto tutto funzioni alla perfezione !
negative	they are expensive , rude and inefficient .
negative	do not touch this company
negative	order glasses on july 00 .
negative	here it is august 00 and still no glasses .
negative	they do not answer emails or voice mails very often and surely not in a timely good customer_service manner .
negative	after several phone_calls got a human who said the frames were not in yet and were due in tomorrow , that was over two_weeks_ago .
negative	called again today and was told frames still not in .
negative	told them to cancel the order and refund my money to my credit_card .
negative	was told i would be getting a phone_call from the head honcho of the place , but of course no call came .
negative	finally decided to dispute the charge on my credit_card .
negative	these_guys suck !!!
negative	!
negative	i had my account limited for some reason , so could not make any purchases , trying to resolve problem would have more chance of getting blood from a stone .
negative	would not mind if i was spending their money .
negative	same story as you have read before , bought tickets for my son and his dad to see scotland vs nz in edinburgh ( a 00th_birthday treat , also as my son was visiting him from australia )............ paid $_000 for two vip tickets ....... same stuff , issued tracking_number etc etc but no tickets arrived . despite emails , no answer , i find it hard to believe that this company is still operational on the internet .
negative	ordered submitted in oct 0000 , not yet received , no answers to inquiries sent on their website .
negative	nobody answers their phone , given message to leave a message then told that the mailbox is full so you cannot leave a message .
negative	i have now gone through the credit_card company to receive a refund .
negative	we used agoda for the first time , booking our entire laos trip of 0 weeks .
negative	the site is well_organized , but when you try to change anything , suddenly the rules change and everything is non_- refundable and won '_t allow any changes .
negative	i would never use them again .
negative	they do not even complete the follow - up when you contact them to ask for help .
negative	their website listings are misleading .
negative	when you go to book , it says " free cancellation !
negative	", so you assume that '_s what you get .
negative	no , when you click through to the small_print , they have all_kinds of restrictions and ways to keep your money .
negative	buyer_beware , this is not a consumer friendly site .
negative	agoda did help me change my reservations , despite policies that are very consumer un - friendly , so i have to at_least give them that .
negative	so , on follow - up , i have to change and say that they do follow_up .
negative	but , i still say to save_yourself the headache and either book directly or go with a booking site that is more consumer friendly .
negative	if you end up making any change in your plans , agoda will be very expensive and cost you a lot of $$$ in non_- refundable money .
negative	stay_away from agoda .
negative	their fees are excessive and their change policies are horrible .
negative	we will never use this website again , because they unfairly advertised a reservation as a 0 - star_hotel and we selected it on that basis .
negative	they placed us in a four_star_hotel .
negative	we were very upset with this false_advertising and as a result we would suggest that you steer clear of this website .

negative	i was quoted $_00 . 00 by textbookrush . com to buy back my brand_new algebra textbook that i paid $_000 . 00 for .
negative	i verified the isbn number from the book and the packing_slip from the company where i had purchased it from .
negative	i had dropped my online algebra class and couldn_'_t use it on campus .
negative	they have received this brand_new never used textbook and claim a different isbn number was on the book and are only sending me a check for $_00 . 00 .
negative	thought their quote was too good to be true .
negative	what a bunch of crooks !
negative	beware when selling them your textbooks because from what i ' m reading this is a common practice with them .
negative	scammers
negative	my large 0ft x0ft headboard was wedged into my open fronted porch , i did not know it was being delivered , it was hammering down with rain , so you can guess i was not amused , no delivery note , obviously did not sign for , luckily only .
negative	slight water mark at base .
negative	this was a very expensive hand made head board , and had i not come home when i did or was not able to move it ( which i did struggle with ) things would have been a lot worse .

negative	i bought tickets to the ed sheeran concert in perth as a christmas_present for my 0 daughters .
negative	they were so_excited on christmas day they stuck the print out from the company on their walls .
negative	as the event drew closer i started to panic .
negative	the thought of telling my daughters that the tickets did not turn up filled me with a sickening dread .
negative	i started to email every day when there was less_than a week to the concert and received the usual auto generated response that everyone receives from viagogo ....... tickets may issue just before the event etc etc even_though ii have seen images of tickets on ebay .
negative	today the nightmare came true .
negative	i received the email that the seller had not produced the tickets , they could try to get me more but it '_s unlikely 0 days before , do i want a refund .
negative	i must let them know by the end of today .
negative	i would strongly_recommend that all reviewers look back over passed responses by this company .
negative	you will find one in which the company states that the tickets become the property of viagogo once the seller lists them with them .. mmmm obviously not the case in this instance .
negative	so i urge you all to avoid this company .
negative	it is not worth the stress and anxiety that they place their buyers under .
negative	lets face it .
negative	the closer to the concert that you receive them , the less likely that you can on sell them .
negative	now i sit and wait for my girls to come home from school and break their hearts .......
negative	in response to the viagogo reply below .
negative	you are not giving me a full_refund .
negative	you are returning my money to me for a $ 000aud product that i paid $_000 . 00aud for nearly 0 months_ago after selling me something that you did not legally own .
negative	a refund happens when i get the product and i am dissatisfied with it , return it and then get my money back .
negative	i think you suffer the same confusion about the definition of a guarantee giving people back their own money when you cannot produce what they paid for is not a guarantee .
negative	it '_s simply giving them back their money .
negative	your response is flawed .
negative	please refer to the poor lady_who sold you her australian open ticket for resale and then changed her mind .
neutral	i purchased the bib for my height , but because i have a longer torso ( relative to my legs ) the bib was ridiculously tight .
neutral	i had to go through a return and repurchase process .
neutral	better information on sizing would be extremely_helpful .
neutral	other than that , the web_site works well .
neutral	the snacks are ok and convenient but i just don_'_t like some of them .
neutral	i also don_'_t like the price so much , for 0 $ you should get 0 or 0 snacks .
neutral	the boxes are stacking up in my cupboard and i can '_t find a phone_number so i can cancel , it makes me feel as if i was scammed .
neutral	unless you want to receive graze for life , do not accept the not so free box .
neutral	really like the end product .
neutral	quick delivery and arrived as expected .
neutral	but ... didn_'_t expect to have to build the top half !
neutral	this was not clear when we ordered .
neutral	do not expect that with an expensive price of furniture !
neutral	good customer_service
neutral	i actually had to " wait in line " ( in que ) to purchase products from their site .
neutral	seems they would have the technology down for a comany this large .
neutral	products purchsed were very good , and dilevery time was a bit long .
neutral	i would purchase from target online again unless there was an alternative website with a better reputation and the same product .
neutral	i ordered 0 cardigans of the same style and same size .
neutral	0 were a perfect size xl and the other 0 were way too small .
neutral	ended_up giving the wrong sized ones to a friend as postage is way too expensive to uk .
neutral	this is the third time this happened , cannot buy any more .
neutral	i was very happy with the invitations i ordered , but am not at all happy with the stickers i ordered .
neutral	i have put in for a return and still_haven_'_t heard from anyone .
neutral	you can not read the print on the stickers and am waiting for a full_refund .
neutral	i have however ordered some more with the writing on white hoping it will show up so we will see !
neutral	jeg_har i et_par dage gjort brug af parkzonens parkering i mitchellsgade og også den såkaldte park & ride ordning , som jeg syntes er rigtig godt tænkt .
neutral	men jeg syntes det_er problematisk at de 0 første kontrollører man render ind i i metroen dels ikke kender ordningen og tilmed stiller sig skeptisk til den tilsendte sms billet .
neutral	det duer ikke , det_er ret ubehageligt at skulle stå og parlementere og prøve at overbevise om at billetten er god nok .
neutral	tænkte på om i hos parkzonen ( når i nu forhåbentlig på et tidspunkt læser dette ) ikke_kunne gøre et eller andet .... evt .
neutral	tage fat i trafikselskaberne .
neutral	jeg_kan godt mærke at jeg hurtigt mister lysten til at benytte ordningen hvis jeg bliver udsat for det samme en gang til , og_det_er ærgerligt for en ellers god ordning .
neutral	ellers er jeg ret tilfreds .... lidt ny belægning på michellsgades p plads er yderst tiltrængt , det_er jeg ikke den eneste der syntes kan jeg se , og der_er ikke længere byggeplads og store lastbiler , så på med vanten ;-)
neutral	great concept but advertising continues to grow making it harder and harder to find relevant friend postings .
neutral	company is obsessed with self promotion which will lead to its decline .
neutral	product is of great quality and sound is always good and predictable .
neutral	pricey products and company places to much value on the brand .
neutral	great site to download from unless you are using a cnet exclusive product which is always hard to get registered .
neutral	have registered some products online 00 times and when i access the software still receive message the product is unregistered .
neutral	i thought this company was perfect , but my husband told me that if , when we actually go to the place , it is not as_promised , even if it is terrible , booking . com insists that you pay for the whole time that you were committed to .
neutral	even the place itself can '_t let you leave .
neutral	that '_s nerve wracking .
neutral	this gives us a nice opportunity to avoid wasting time with the phone cards .
neutral	it was quick and easy to process the information
neutral	an ok solution for the real devolper .
neutral	be prepared to have to edit everything if you want a real functioning professional site .
neutral	go somewhere_else unless you are prepared for all of this !
neutral	poor comms at times goods got there in the end .
neutral	good value if time is not the most_important thing
neutral	the only thing i would say about google ., co . uk is that it should by default , search uk websites first with the option to search globally .
neutral	not the other way round the way as it is now
neutral	it is after all a . co . uk search_engine .
neutral	i have lost count of the times i think i have found what i need only to realise that it is a u . s . website and they do not deliver to the uk .
neutral	this can be resolved by clicking the advanced tools arrow and selecting country : the uk , but this should be the default for uk website searches
neutral	i recently booked 0 nights for 0 rooms at the beautiful five_star shangri - la in hong_kong for march 00th until april 0th .
neutral	within hours after i booked i realized that we leave the us on march 00th but do not arrive in hong_kong until the 00st .
neutral	the agent at booking . com would not help me in any way even_though i just booked with them a few hours earlier on the same day .
neutral	she said the hotel would not approve the change when she called them .
neutral	i called the hotel and explained_everything to the manager and named christopher and he totally understood and realized that he could still rent the rooms to someone_else because our stay is over two months away .
neutral	all booking . com needed to do was ask for the manager instead of the agent at the desk when they called the hotel .
neutral	instead i had to get upset and do it myself .
neutral	maybe booking . com should consider changes made within the same day of booking .
neutral	i signed_up to ! st rate spares hoping to get some much needed parts for my citroen berlingo multispace , but alas so_far , i have to say that nothing has happened yet !
neutral	however , i ' m a patient person so i '_ll keep my fingers_crossed and wait ..........!!
neutral	!
neutral	and it did not work .
neutral	very happy with purchase , but it was unfortunately sent to the billing_address , rather_than to the alternate address i had requested .
neutral	apart from the delivery cost issue i was extremely happy with my purchase .
neutral	however , the surcharged delivery is a major problem that will_definitely stop me shopping with you again , unfortunately .
neutral	the rest of the uk would have had next_day delivery free for my purchase ... i had to pay £_00 for delivery and then had to wait several days for it to be delivered ... not a comparible service at all .
neutral	sorry
neutral	presssures you into getting a larger car promising it will only be 00_% higher .
neutral	i requested a small car when i made my reservation .
neutral	before i even knew what i was getting , she commented " oh , that '_s too small would you like to upgrade to a larger vehicle ?"
neutral	i declined , but she continued to press & tell me she would give me a larger car for only 00_% more .
neutral	i had a cost in mind within my budget & knew the price i wanted to pay .
neutral	however , she kept pressing me to get a larger car - which i did not want .
neutral	after having been in a plane for almost 0 hours , i just wanted to get out of the airport .
neutral	i got tired of the back & forth & just gave in , but not before commenting on her effort to make more money for the company .
neutral	bottom_line : i did get a " small " car but ended_up paying more_than i wanted .
neutral	i did not appreciate the pressure .
neutral	i knew what i wanted , she should have left it at that , and respected my wishes .
neutral	i had this site recommended to me by my daughter .
neutral	it took a little while to get used to it and i think the scanning software or side of it could be easier to use .
neutral	my daughter nor i could get it to work .
neutral	i had a good start with the order .
neutral	the system accepted the input and i paid using the system online .
neutral	i then received an_email_saying that there were not enough items to satisfy my order for 0 deodorant sprays .
neutral	i was asked if i wanted a refund or if i wanted to wait a week .
neutral	i chose the latter and expected to receive 0 items .
neutral	you will be aware that i only received 0 items but the postage was the same as if 0 would have been sent so i was only refunded for the two items .
neutral	had i know this was going to happen i would have cancelled the order as the cost per item was dramatically increased by the postage charges .
neutral	i would be very happy to receive a refund on the postage as in my view the goods should not have been shipped until i was made aware of the change in the number being sent .

neutral	we run a b_& b in the usa - and i just received an_email from 0flats that they have published our reservation calendar online and their custmers can book rooms with us .
neutral	since the company did not contact us before listing our property we were negatively impressed with their business eithics .
neutral	we have requested that they remove the unauthorized listing and they have complied .
neutral	i needed a difficult stainless steel hardware item to find and they managed after a few_minutes of waiting on hold to dig one out for me which they had a while so discounted down .
neutral	my luck i guess .
neutral	they seemed fairly knowledgeable .
neutral	i ordered a replacement mirror for my car and was sent the wrong part . i ' m still_waiting for a return authorization #. i mean i only ordered 0 part pretty hard 0 screw - up right ?
neutral	? anyway i guess you get what you pay for good prices but bad service ..
neutral	supplement_warehouse is usually tops in price .
neutral	however , the shipping_charges will sometimes hike their total price over the total price of some other_sites .
neutral	i e_- mailed them this problem and they sent me instructions on how to enter a shipping pricematch and that they ' d match other_sites shipping prices .
neutral	it didn_'_t work and i paid more for the product than i would have elsewhere .
neutral	they say in their ad that their low_prices cover the comparable shipping charge , making their total price lower - not always true .
neutral	lovely net curtain but it cost me more to get it delivered and i had to sign for a curtain that was only worth a few pounds
neutral	there is no problem with the product - i now have a couple of jackets a polo and another top .
neutral	service is not so good though . they have products on offer .
neutral	you place an order and then a few_days_later they tell you they are out of stock . a decent computerised stock system should not allow this to happen . they were unable to reset my password when i asked them which meant opening another email account .
neutral	they said it was a known problem . hopefully they will get their act together and resolve these problems .
neutral	in their favour - their website is quick and user - friendly .
neutral	otherwise , if you can be bothered , you may as well use the parcels - smashers ( er ... " couriers ") they represent directly , because they are usually a bit cheaper .
neutral	as a company they have zero control over the parcels carriers , which is a shame because most of them are shamefully careless and unreliable .
neutral	and whatever you do , don_'_t waste money on their so - called " insurances " because they don_'_t actually cover anything that is not otherwise utterly indestructable .
neutral	i suspect the scandalous state of the industry as a whole is costing british business millions , if not billions a year - and all because of the laziness and incompetence of those we entrust with the carriage of goods .
neutral	interparcel is just a cog in that mechanism , and i ' d frankly pity them if their support was better when things do go_wrong .
neutral	some of the games are really good .
neutral	i wish they would offer a ad free paid version but not a monthly one , just one off payments .
neutral	the ads seem to glitch up the games , , margrave manor won '_t load for me now and i have uninstalled and reinstalled it knows who i am and has saved all my game play the main game just wont load .
neutral	i am playing the chronicals of albian now its very good but the ads definately glitch it up , they always seem to coincide with the puzzles and once the ads start you lose the puzzle and therefore the bonus money and frankly you need it to do that place up .
neutral	otherwise tip top .
neutral	particularly enjoyed the sherlock holmes one .
neutral	i think that cms is very well sorted , they have got everything .
neutral	however they are not cheap and it takes a long time between ordering and delivery although sending cost is rather high .
neutral	the free delivery only works if you want to wait for a long time .
neutral	due to work we are not getting our furniture for 0 weeks .
neutral	if we want it in a week or less it would cost us £_00
neutral	i ordered the lion mask .
neutral	it is huge and doesn_'_t even come close to fitting my face .
neutral	i will have to alter it and do some cutting on it .
neutral	i wasn_'_t expecting it to be wonderful , but was dissapointed in the size .
neutral	pretty good prices , but not sure what they mean by fast shipping .
neutral	placed my order on wednesday evening and it wasn_'_t even shipped until friday_afternoon .
neutral	ups says it '_s not scheduled to be delivered until wednesday .
neutral	i signed_up for auto ship , but if this is a sign of how slow they are i may cancel , just so i don_'_t have to worry_about it .
neutral	i was ordering from another . com company who '_s delivery was 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i switched to chewy '_s because the prices were a bit better .
neutral	we ordered the fuel oil on the friday and it was delivered on the tuesday following , excellent service from boiler_juice .
neutral	however as we live out in the sticks we have a standing request for a phone_call the night before to allow us to unlock gate and tank .
neutral	due to the fact that the boiler was to be serviced on the tuesday we left the gate unlocked , imagine my surprise to come home on the tuesday and find our oil had been delivered , your local supplier did not call and as such the tank was locked , so he filled through the vent pipe , must have taken him ages .
neutral	anyway , boilerjuice well_done good service , but local supplier , boo , you would have fopund everything locked normally because you did not call then where would we have been , waiting longer ....
neutral	my experience with opticfast was frustrating .
neutral	i bought from opticfast through another vendor .
neutral	the vendor apparently gave me an erroneous shipping date .
neutral	due to this my item did not arrived in time for my daughter '_s 00st birthday .
neutral	i was very_pleased with my product from opticfast when it did finally arrive .
neutral	it was not the first time i book cars from economy rentals .
neutral	i was and i am pleased with the offer and cost , the car and thr rental process .
neutral	i had a very negative customer experience claiming insurance refund .
neutral	the good news : i got a refund for most of the amount i paid .
neutral	the bad news : the communication was bad , the process was long ( over two month ), unnecessarily complex , time consuming and frustrating .
neutral	i was expecting to send my claim , and shortly after get a refund .
neutral	i was not expecting :
neutral	- get a first response 00 days after my first contact , followed by more attempts from my side .
neutral	- get a response saying “ i think we have replied within an reasonable time frame ” after trying to get a response for 00 days .
neutral	- send so many documents ( rental contract , credit_card statement , rental invoice , damage report , a form i had to fill , and a picture of the damage ).
neutral	- be asked to complete my credit_card number over ( un safe ) e_- mail .
neutral	i paid by credit_card to economy_car_rentals , why do i need to submit the number again for a refund ?
neutral	- be asked to wait until economy_car_rentals receive the final repair cost from alamo .
neutral	i think this is entirely between economy_car_rentals and alamo .
neutral	- wait another month for the refund , after the above bureaucratic nightmare was over .
neutral	i think economy_car_rentals will do their customers and themselves a big favor reviewing and modifying this process , and make it more customer friendly .
neutral	here is my experience with economy_car_rentals , facts only :
neutral	i booked a car with a full insurance_coverage .
neutral	unfortunately i did have a small damage ( fine scratch caused_by a bush ) and the rental company made me pay a substantial amount for it .
neutral	- i contacted economy_car_rentals on 00 . apr . 0000
neutral	- i got no response so i wrote again , and got no reply .
neutral	- i used the live - chat support several_times .
neutral	here are exact quote of answers i got on live - chat :
neutral	0 .
neutral	" your case in queue , you will be informed as soon as possible "
neutral	0 .
neutral	" unfortunately i can not help you over the live support , this need to be dealt_with the claims department "
neutral	0 .
neutral	" your e_- mail was forwarded to your claims department "
neutral	0 .
neutral	" the department dealing_with this is closed this week "
neutral	0 .
neutral	" the person in charge for these claims is out of office at the moment , this is why there is a delay "
neutral	on 00 . may . 0000 i posted negative_reviews on facebook and some other forums .
neutral	the day after i got the first response from economy_car_rentals , asking me for a picture of the damage on the car .
neutral	i sent a picture .
neutral	- on 00 . may . 0000 i updated my review on facebook .
neutral	shortly after i got the second response from economy_car_rentals , asking me to send some documents by mail .
neutral	i sent it by e_- mail .
neutral	economy_car_rentals accepted the documents and added : " i think we have replied within an reasonable time frame and kindly ask you to remove this comments from the forums , your comments do not reflect the truth ".
neutral	economy_car_rentals also notified me that my claim will be processed after they receive the final repair cost from alamo .
neutral	i wrote to economy_car_rentals saying " i do not understand_why i need to wait for the alamo '_s repair invoice .
neutral	i this is entirely between economy_car_rentals and alamo , and i do not see why i should be effected by it ."
neutral	got no reply for it .
neutral	- on 00 . may . 0000 i got another e_- mail saying " today i received the enclosed assessor '_s report and we will process your claim ."
neutral	- on 0 . june . 0000 i got another e_- mail from economy_car_rentals , " thanking me for my patience ", informing_me that " we have received approval for a refund in the amount of 000 gbp " out of the 000 gbp i paid to the rental company .
neutral	economy_car_rentals also noted the 0 first digits of my credit_card number , asked me to complete the last 0 digits .
neutral	economy_car_rentals also sent me a form to be filled , signed and returned .
neutral	- on 0 . june . 0000 economy_car_rentals informed me that they got all the form and the credit_card number ( i obviously did not want to send the credit_card number by mail , so i used the on - line support cat for it ).
neutral	- on 00 . june . 0000 ( almost 0 weeks_later ) i wrote to economy_car_rentals asking why is the process taking so long , and so much of my time , asking when can i expect a refund .
neutral	the answer i got was : “ we would like to kindly inform you that your refund has been already forwarded to our accounting department .”
neutral	- on 0 . july . 0000 i wrote another reminder to economy_car_rentals .
neutral	- on 0 . july . 0000 economy_car_rentals informed me that “ your case was closed today and the amount of 000 ,- euro was refunded to you ”
neutral	when i rented my first car in johannesbourg , i was asked by thrifty to sign for a refundable deposit of 0000 rand ( some 000 €).
neutral	i expected to have this amount re - credited immediately after car return and check that no damage occurred and gas_tank was full .
neutral	instead , when i returned the car i was told the amount would be credited after few ( how many ?)
neutral	days .
neutral	arrived in cape town i rented a car from budget and i was asked to sign for a refundable deposit of 0000 rand ( some 000 €), so my credit_card was charged in total 0000 €.
neutral	for car_rental deposit , limiting for some days my cash capability .
neutral	having problems in looking at my bank_account from remote , 0 days after my 0nd car return i still don_'_t know what was actually charged to my credit car .
neutral	in may opinion car_rental companies should give the opportunity to the client to know immediately at return what will be charged , to the cost of waiting an acceptable amount of time for the car check .
neutral	economy_car should give details of the return_policy of the rental_car companies .
neutral	skype is still the best option for overseas calling however they continue to struggle with consistent audio and video feeds .
neutral	you would think by now they would have figured it out .
neutral	after i ordered the part , i figured out that i was not capable of replacing it myself .
neutral	i have been trying to get a rma # and i ' m not getting any response .
neutral	i had trouble bidding on the hotel price .
neutral	one site was $_000 and priceline was $_00 .
neutral	i was expecting bigger savings .
neutral	appointment time online was great but nowhere near the offered date when rep phoned .
neutral	still_waiting for side strips to windscreen - cannot drive my car at speed until this has been fixed .
neutral	windscreen not a landrover screen feel slightly cheated .
neutral	a friend and i used the site a couple days ago to book our ferry tickets from newhaven to dieppe , and we found it very confusing .
neutral	the first time we used it , we could see only the 00 am ferry crossings .
neutral	a couple hours_later , we checked again , and we could find only the 0 . 00 am ferry crossings !
neutral	it would have been helpful to have seen a list of all the ferry crossings and times in one place .
neutral	we got confused , so i called someone there who explained how to find the 00 am crossings again , and we booked one of those .
neutral	i ' m generally pretty adept at using travel websites , but this one had me flummoxed !
neutral	i ordered some mothers_day flowers from this company , the first delivered mothers_day flowers my mum had ever had .
neutral	i wanted them to be special - which they certainly were .
neutral	mum received a box full of petals , half dead flowers and stalks .
neutral	on trying to contact this company i had a series of unanswered emails , phone_calls which cut you off after 00_minutes of holding . and utter frustration .
neutral	i genuinely thought this company was a complete fraudulent operation and was going to contact trading standard .
neutral	the eureka moment came when a lady on here got help by using the landline number for this company in burnley and advised people to try this .
neutral	the next_day i tried the landline number , first time getting cut_off after 00_minutes of holding on , the second time a very nice man answered .
neutral	i explained the problem with the delivery and the poor quality / absolute disgraceful product sent .
neutral	he immediately arranged delivery of a bouquet of flowers for my mum from a local_florist of twice the value i originally paid .
neutral	colours and flowers were decided by myself .
neutral	the next_day the bouquet arrived , mum was delighted , and from the photos i saw so was i .
neutral	the warnings are therefore avoid any bouquets on this site that say postal delivery and .
neutral	do not use any number to contact this company other than the burnley landline number which can be found easily online
neutral	i would love to give this company more stars , the second bouquet was definitely 0 star , but the flowers were supposedly for mothers_day and arrived in the end 0 days_later .
neutral	the first delivery was awful ,
neutral	customer_service , when you were eventually able to contact them was fantastic , but original experiances were grim
neutral	would i use them again , yes but maybe phone the order through or make_sure the flowers were not posted but hand delivered by local florists
neutral	this was a great product
neutral	nice idea .
neutral	a star named after me by my husband .
neutral	unfortunately , can '_t see a star when searching the universal star registry with google .
neutral	just a black screen with a white box and my name and registration number on it .
neutral	nothing seems to be wrong , but maybe there is .
neutral	i left it for 00_minutes in case there was a download delay , but nothing .
neutral	a bit disappointed but , as i say , still a nice idea .
neutral	the people who are happy with your product seem to be the ones who got a good reaction when giving the gift .
neutral	i think it would be a different matter once the receiver tried to access and actually look at their star .
neutral	needed a specific length & fit of bb , wiggle had best price , but on " 0 - 0 weeks " delivery which i could live with .
neutral	after 0 weeks still hadnt showed_up and when queried they said it would be another month or so .
neutral	their best alternative was significantly more_expensive , and indeed i could get it at a lower price elsewhere .
neutral	had a hard job convincing them to price_match even_though they ' d let me down on my first choice .
neutral	when they did finally agree , i had to cancel the first order , get a refund of the paypal and place new order with the price_match coupon .
neutral	once i ' d done all that the replacement did actually arrive quite quickly , but the whole experience was a bit meh !
neutral	i was impressed with the no shipping_costs , and great prices on cat_food .
neutral	unfortunately it seems as if they are making up on the free shipping by charging more for the cat_litter they sell .
neutral	i really don_'_t mind it being a little more ( for the convenience of having it sent to my home ) but almost 0 times the cost of my local grocery_store is a bit much .
neutral	quick delivery , but incorrect information on the description of the article .
neutral	plastic case instead a digibook
neutral	although the room was great and the rate was awesome , the hotel did not have my information when i arrived .
neutral	we had to wait for over 00_minutes to see if they were going to honor my receipt stating my reservation .
neutral	i had never had this issue when using hotels . com or any other site i have used .
neutral	i like the idea of ordering pet products online with quick home delivery .
neutral	unfortunately the web_site for petflow . com is pretty bad .
neutral	it is hard to search .
neutral	forget trying to browse .
neutral	key words do not necessarily bring up all the available items .
neutral	you pretty_much need to know exactly_what item you need .
neutral	if you want to look around for new products be prepared to spend some time .
neutral	i had already purchased a groupon deal so i had to buy off the site .
neutral	otherwise i would have given up when i realized how difficult it was to use the web_site .
neutral	i managed to find what i needed and place my order .
neutral	shipping and delivery was pretty quick .
neutral	it was well - packaged , the product was fresh , and the order was complete .
neutral	but i probably will not order from seller again because of the poorly designed site .
neutral	i would use you first , i used to but you have such a long list of what you don_'_t carry that it stops me using you regularly as a lot of the stuff i sell is prohibited and its hard enough booking on - line without worrying if it is a prohibited item .
neutral	i have a iphone 0 that was locked to at & t .
neutral	i had to wait almost three_weeks for my phone to unlocked with my imei unlock .
neutral	in the meantime , there was almost no customer_service response despite numerous_emails to then asking for an approximate far for when my phone would be unlocked .
neutral	works but take a a while .
neutral	site items ship fast , always in stock , the sex toys are from known brands .
neutral	customer_service via_email or phone .
neutral	i '_ve used the service before and had an issue that customer_service resolved very well .
neutral	however , now that i am looking in oslo , norway , i see that none of the hotels are indicating whether the rooms are smokers rooms or non_- smokers rooms .
neutral	this is a standard where i am from originally , the u . s ., and is very important to me .
neutral	it must be that booking . com is not providing a field for the hotels to complete to provide this info / choice .
neutral	major flaw since - as a result , i am forced to call the hotel i make a reservation with , and possibly go back to the drawing board if it turns_out the hotel i reserved with does not offer the non_- smoker option .
neutral	if i do have to do the work all over again , i '_ll find a hotel agreggator website that can provide this option for me up front .
neutral	if i have to call the hotels directly , then it isn_'_t worth booking first through booking . com
neutral	clothes were great , but i had to return a dress that was too short and it took a month to receive a credit back .
neutral	i emailed them to check if it takes that long normally and they instantly credited it , so i don_'_t know if something went wrong with mine or if it always takes that long .
neutral	at first , they have the best prices and quickest service !
neutral	but i booked the wrong date , and had to change it .
neutral	i could not reach a human voice to help me .
neutral	their website wouldn_'_t forward my emails .
neutral	and the hotel didn_'_t email me my hotel packet !
neutral	i '_ve been waiting for a response for 0 hours !
neutral	nothing !
neutral	did not get help untill reporting here .
neutral	after reporting here the problem was solved fast .
neutral	i believe the company is consious about its reputation , but its business processes do not work properly yet .
neutral	one month_ago i ordered from gillygifts ltd . order ref last 0 digits 0000 .
neutral	money was taken off immediately on ordering the item online but it still has not arrived .
neutral	my e_- mails and phone_calls have been ignored by this company .
neutral	on phoning them i have got an answer phone which is very poor for customer - client relations and for a caring company !
neutral	refund given .
neutral	business manager stated that he sent item which should have arrived 00 days after order and subsequently was on holiday .
neutral	the gift was not received and refund agreed .
neutral	matter resolved immediately after posting review .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i received the item promptly , however , the item description was a " streamlight " sl00x battery , leading me to believe i was indeed receiving a streamlight brand battery .
neutral	unfortunately what i received was a generic battery that was labeled " made in china " and although it fit my light , it was not exactly_what i wanted .
neutral	it will be interesting to see how long this imported clone actually lasts .
neutral	i should have known that the price was too good to be true .
neutral	the moral of the story : if you need a cheap battery and you don_'_t care where it was made , then this is the place to get it .
neutral	if you want usa made quality : order it somewhere_else .
neutral	a piece of advice to this company : note the actual brand and country of origin under the product description .
neutral	there are certainly many people who will buy it anyway and those of us who wouldn_'_t will go elsewhere and not be unhappy customers .
neutral	i found the service good but the fee '_s are a bit high
neutral	the machine was delivered on time , constant up - dates sent by text to my mobile phone .
neutral	realy great service , thank_you .
neutral	paid to have the old machine taken away .
neutral	this was also realy good and well_worth the extra cost .
neutral	paid_extra for the fitting .
neutral	not so good .
neutral	the " drain " hose required a converter fitting to join the existing connection to the machine pipe .
neutral	the " fitters " refused to wait the 00_minutes it took me to purchase this converter from my local hardware shop and were gone by the time i returned .
neutral	as a result i had to pay another company to fit the machine under my work surface .
neutral	it is a tight fit and as a pensioner beyond my ability to lift , shove and move by myself .
neutral	this part of the deal was not what it should be and i would reccomend not paying for this " service " as a local fitter will do the job quicker and you will not have to pay twice for the job to be carried out .
neutral	i have been contacted by trustpilot this afternoon ( 00 . 00 . 0000 .)
neutral	and they have appologised and promised to refund the " instalation " charge .
neutral	once again very good service and i forgot to mention the price .
neutral	the best available either on the high_street or anywhere on the web .
neutral	thank_you all
neutral	one came faulty but they should have checked it before sending , not happy
neutral	i got a trip on trip_advisor to see my daughter out in phoenix and it was very expensive !
neutral	had no problem so_far with this purchase , ( will wait to see if they honour my trade - in voucher against this sale !)
neutral	emailed their customer_support prior to purchase , but they still have not replied to this email .
neutral	went_ahead with purchase .
neutral	all went_smoothly , and item turned up next_day .
neutral	nice and quick .
neutral	lovely lens in immaculate condition , just a shame it came in the wrong protective bag .
neutral	this all said , i will probably use this site again .
neutral	i booked a class of vehicle that i was somewhat familiar with as i drive a matrix at home , a toyota auris , it was the car shown in the advertising material , when we arrived we asked about a gps unit , one was immediately produced and given to us at a charge of 000 bp for the hire period , first it only spoke german , so a trip back to the point of sale was required , pouring rain and freezing cold didn_'_t help .
neutral	after setting the hired gps unit up we were on our way , only to find later that the car was equipped with it '_s own built in unit , a total waste of money , which wouldnt have happened if the receptionist had taken the time to ask what car we had taken .
neutral	upon return the " extras " we were charged were almost triple the original quote .
neutral	so if you use alamo be sure to get an explanation of what the final bill will be !!
neutral	!
neutral	the car itself was a joy to drive and everyone we saw was impressed with it , as were we .
neutral	for the cost of the item not worth the price .
neutral	i ordered a package for my better half for valentines_day .
neutral	roses , balloon , chocolates and a cuddly toy .
neutral	the package arrived at the specified time and the gift set was perfect all except the cuddly toy .
neutral	the colour scheme of flowers , balloon , & chocolates were red and black and matched perfectly .
neutral	the cuddly toy however was a bright pink teddy bear which had the words ' baby girl ' written on it !
neutral	hasten to say it didn_'_t go down very well !
neutral	we run a backpackers hostel and needed a bunk bed next_day due to damage .
neutral	order went through showing in stock
neutral	email came back late in same day apologising that they were out of stock , left it late for us to re order with another company !
neutral	requested another style from the company , but they said it was too_late now for next_day delivery ?
neutral	ordered slippers but can not get on the web_site to redeem will have to phone for help this was later resolved
neutral	my first order was delivered in a week , which i think was reasonable , although no tracking_information was available until the day it arrived .
neutral	my second order , however , was placed on 00 / 00 .
neutral	today is 00 / 0 and the status says " in process ."
neutral	i called customer_service .
neutral	it can be a little annoying when you call within 0 minutes of the call_center opening and get a message that says , " due to unusually high call volumes , we cannot take your call at this time ."
neutral	really ?
neutral	are you ticking off that many customers that your call_center is overwhelmed ?
neutral	after about six attempts ( i got all the time in the world during a long commute ) i finally reached a live operator .
neutral	the service rep was courteous and tried to be helpful .
neutral	she could not find the cause of the delay , and promised to call back when she had more information .
neutral	that was 0 hours ago .
neutral	i suspect she has not gotten any more information ( i am assuming she means to keep her commitment .)
neutral	i tried calling again , but once again got the " we don_'_t have enough operators / phone lines to handle our business volumes or we don_'_t care enough about customer_service to pick_up our phones " message .
neutral	uncharitable ?
neutral	maybe , but this is not my idea of great customer_service .
neutral	i want to like this company , and if they resolve this issue to my satisfaction ( meaning just communicate with me and fill my order in a reasonable time ) i will be happy to come_back here and amend my comments .
neutral	so having finally received an_email informing_me one of my items was back - ordered , they are shipping my order today .
neutral	they dropped the ball on notifying me of the shortage , which can happen to anyone , but the practice of giving themselves up to four business days to let you know if everything you order is in stock is not the best .
neutral	most sites i buy from tell you immediately if an item is out of stock .
neutral	the least they can do is notify you right_away and ask if you want a back - order or substitute .
neutral	priceline bidding is great for getting good deals on hotels .
neutral	however , 0 - star that are dirty , rundown , and have scary clientele are within priceline guidelines .
neutral	you won '_t get a refund from the hotel unless you stick around long enough to make a formal complaint , and without that priceline won '_t do a thing for you except a $_00 off a 0 - star .
neutral	key in my usual area is 0 - star .
neutral	you get a decent clean room with microwave usually and often fridge or kitchenette .
neutral	start bidding with 0 - stars just in case any are biting ;-).
neutral	i had high hopes for the spoiled_rotten box when i ordered it .
neutral	i had to call the company to complete my order because the site wouldn_'_t complete it .
neutral	i have three dogs , 0lbs , 00lbs and 000lbs .
neutral	being dachshunds and a german shepherd dog , they are all ' power ' chewers !
neutral	i was truly disappointed that there wasn_'_t even one toy in the box .
neutral	there was 0 can of food , 0 roll of food , 0 box of calming treats , 0 pack of beef & cheddar treats , 0 pack of tiny ' brushless toothpaste ' treats , 0 spearmint star shaped chew , a key chain and a silicone teddy bear that you can bake or freeze treats in .
neutral	if i gave that to any of my dogs it would be destroyed in minutes !
neutral	all in all , $_00 for a selection of treats is really expensive .
neutral	i would have really_liked at_least one toy .
neutral	costumes arrived quickly however some were not completely sewn and needed mending
neutral	ordered the bags and they were awesome .
neutral	then came the mounting .
neutral	first , parts were missing and some were detective .
neutral	second , the brackets looked like they might damage my bike when installed .
neutral	viking was quick to send missing and replacement parts , but , why do i want to drill holes in the bag to mount them ?
neutral	i ended_up purchasing the right brackets off amazon . com for a very reasonable price .
neutral	they arrived quickly , fit_perfectly , the bags installed easily and look awesome and i didn_'_t have to compromise the bags by drilling holes in them .
neutral	pretty disappointed with priceline . com this trip .
neutral	first at no point in time was it disclosed that the hotel room was non_- smoking and for that matter the entire hotel was smoe free .
neutral	also my search was for a room for 0 adults yet when pruceline booked it they switched it down to a room for 0 people .
neutral	the delivery was very slow
neutral	we ordered 0 costumes , one child '_s glenda the good witch , it was not a true to size fit so we ordered a larger_size and returned the smaller one .
neutral	it came time for the event but still have not received the refund on our account .
neutral	ordered the deluxe grand wizard of oz costume ... this one was perfect !!!
neutral	looked great quality of costume was good .
neutral	last costume was mine , the emerald city witch , stockings were too small , costume quality was not good ... it was falling apart at the sleeves by the time we finished up our visit to the land of oz ... spent about 0 hours there walking around .
neutral	the costume was cute just not made very well for the amount of money we spent on this one .....
neutral	the on line pictures give a very good impression of the watches but when my mx00 arrived i was pleasantly_surprised to see what a stunning and rugged looking watch it was .
neutral	i chose the mx00 for the plain easy to read dial ( day and night ) and i wasn_'_t disappointed here either .
neutral	i asked for an extra link after it arrived and this followed within a couple of days .
neutral	having had the watch now for a couple of months i have to say that i am disappointed with the strap .
neutral	i chose the metal bracelet , and since fitting the extra ( which i did myself with the proper tools ) the pin holding this link keeps protruding from the strap slightly and needs pushing in .
neutral	even more annoying is the strap keeps coming apart because the spring loaded pin doesn_'_t hold it together securely enough and the watch falls off my wrist .
neutral	i have made the company aware of these problems each time , they have always been very pleasant , but i am now fed up with this happening and the latest response from the company is to offer to send me some glue to hold the pin in firmly ..... what on a watch this price .... no way and why should i have to do it myself .
neutral	so its going back for investigation .
neutral	the prices are great but the shipping is outrageous .
neutral	i had $_00 dollars worth of product and shipping was $_00 . 00 ... totally outrageous .
neutral	charge a little more on your products so you don_'_t have to rip the customer off and make your profit on shipping .
neutral	try using the united_states postal services which offer flat fee rates .
positive	i contacted st customer_service explained the problem they emailed me instructions and a shipping_label .
positive	i got my camera back in less_than 0 days and it works better then it did before i dropped it .
positive	i asked if this would be the end of my warranty and was told the cost of the repair would be deducted from the amount of warranty and any remaining funds would be used for future warranty issues .
positive	i have developed a great relationship with herbies over the years and have a lot of friends that have followed me .
positive	word of mouth works out the best !!
positive	they have kept everyone of our business happy .
positive	i have seen many comments on here and people can be kinda " duh ".. for one thing herbies is not the breeder and therefore can not control the freshness he is presented with from the breeder !
positive	and of coarse the mail problems is all herbies fault cuz he owns the mail system world wide .
positive	when i made a complaint about my mail it had herbies address .
positive	to much indulgence is no good people !
positive	nuf said ..
positive	thanks b !
positive	keep it up :)
positive	gets better every day !
positive	i have used priceline for several_years now and have never been_disappointed .
positive	i have consistently gotten the best rates and had excellent accommodations - twice i was upgraded to suite level for no additional cost and received additional perks , such as breakfasts and dinners gratis .
positive	i have visited other_sites , but priceline is the easiest to use and yields the best results .
positive	i have 00 casual kilts and one semi traditional usa kilt and one on order .
positive	i also have a argyle jacket .
positive	all are in some way customized to my needs and desires .
positive	rocky worked with me to get all of these just right via e_- mails .
positive	i also have sporrans and belts from usak .
positive	the durable , washable ,, martan mills pv he uses is great and the workmanship is always top_notch - even_though these are reasonably_priced kilts .
positive	ian and mac , who made my kilts , are true craftsmen with attention to details .
positive	they have a large_selection of tartans in pv and rocky keeps coming up with new " gotta have " plaids .
positive	i am very_pleased with parts_geek .
positive	my order was everything it should be . it was right on , all of the parts were correct .
positive	the order was shipped on time and arrived early they have my business from now on
positive	i love reading the posts and the scripture .
positive	use it daily .
positive	keep_up the excellent work !

positive	good services helpful deliver staff .
positive	deliver very quick and came when email said
positive	very easy site to navigate .
positive	great assistance with queries and very quick response .
positive	i booked an overseas dinner cruise for friends which was effortless .
positive	the listing had heaps of information including a location map , which helped with the right choice of event to fit in with their itinerary .
positive	would definitely_recommend this site .
positive	joe .
positive	melbourne , australia .
positive	my clients and i were very satisfied with the speed this organization operated in getting things moving in our favor .
positive	i would definitely_recommend this company for any one who is looking for services that they provide
positive	this is a very easy way to get good food at a good price .
positive	the site is easy to maneuver and the order came quick .
positive	i had a really good experience for my first order
positive	the price is very reasonable .
positive	even better if discount given to first time buyer .
positive	better discount the more you purchase .

positive	we wanted to rent a servicible car that would get us from quebec to toronto / niagara falls .
positive	ken , who served us in quebec was fantastic and gave us a really good deal on a mustang .
positive	he must have known something as we have always wanted to drive one .
positive	fantastic car , handled really well , comfortable and easy to drive , only thing to remember , put the most expensive fuel in as it lasts a lot longer than the cheaper one !
positive	it may seem to cost more initially , but it is worth it in the end .
positive	would definitely use this company again .
positive	gwen
positive	so much to choose from , so much information .
positive	they have everything that i am looking for and they offer so many free_samples so i can evaluate before buying .
positive	in fact this is my second order and i am buying things that i got as samples in my first order .
positive	i would have never tried them otherwise .
positive	they were excellent quality .
positive	i buy a lot of stuff online but have never had as good experience as i have with supplement_warehouse .
positive	great selection at the best prices
positive	starting a new business on a shoestring budget requires thrifty shopping .
positive	this company allowed me to create my own signage at a fraction of the cost to local sign shops .
positive	hands_down would recommend them to any one for their signage needs .
positive	the products .
positive	price , and shipping where excellent .
positive	but the extra value was the support in the way of information and advice .
positive	this saved me a lot of time researching .
positive	it also saved and a lot of time and money by helping_me to select what i really needed the first time .
positive	good job .
positive	dave works hard and knows what he is doing .
positive	we had a small emergency - our water heater broke and was leaking all over the place .
positive	of course the timing couldn_'_t have been worse and we were short a few bucks to get a new one .
positive	i was matched quickly with several lenders by quickercash . com , was approved by the one i chose in minutes and received the funds by the next_morning .
positive	and our water heater has been replaced !
positive	b_&_h pricing almost always seems to be lower_than other_retailers .
positive	i have never been_disappointed .
positive	the quality of their items is always exceptional .
positive	i bought a locked phone on ebay uk locked to vodafone , was under the misapprehension it would work for vodafone spain , so i had it unlocked by these_guys and i ' m absolutely_delighted .
positive	i have purchased a number of warranties through square_trade and have been unfortunate to need them a few_times .
positive	in each case the process was appropriate and hassle_free .
positive	whether it was an item that needed repair or a total replacement , the claim process was straight_forward and met my every expectation .
positive	they have never tried to manipulate their warranties to get out of fulfilling their obligation and it is refreshing to find a company that operates with ethics .
positive	thank_you square_trade .
positive	it '_s a great place to fine a job , that fits your needs .
positive	thanks for everything :)
positive	i can only comment on my personal experience : i purchased a pair of tickets ( for my girlfriend and her best friend ) to go and see ' donny and marie osmond ' at the o0 arena on the opening night of their tour .
positive	the face value of the tickets were £_00 . 00 each .
positive	i was charged in excess of £_000 . 00 each !
positive	!
positive	my girlfriend had a the night of her life ; and for that i am very , very grateful !
positive	!
positive	i have always had great experience with the name your price bookings .
positive	as long as i do a 0 0 / 0 star or above i have never been_disappointed in priceline .
positive	the only thing i wish would be hotels would still give points for their club members in spite of booking through priceline .
positive	i use this site all the time to find the cheapest fares .
positive	they also send me emails for special deals .
positive	this was a good deal .
positive	their price was right and the product was excellent , a perfect match for the original screen .
positive	thanks to the how - to videos ( 0 ), i was able to walk through the entire replacement procedure on my crippled machine before i even ordered the thing .
positive	when the part arrived , it took me about a whopping 00_minutes for the entire job , from removing the bezel to booting up and wiping my finger prints off the new screen .
positive	total cost about $_00 with fedex shipping .
positive	most highly_recommended !
positive	obtw , here '_s a lesson_learned ( free advice !
positive	): don_'_t use your dell as a step stool ...
positive	they have great prices , i got just a goofy good deal on my whites fusion during their black friday special .
positive	mike was always there to answer my questions , and the work they did on the suit ( replaceable neck and wrist seals ) was first rate .
positive	online prices with lds service !
positive	no charge for the new slogan :)
positive	slimdriver has one over on me .
positive	it does what i cannot do which is figure_out how to update stuff on here .
positive	gee , my computer runs so much_better now and connects to the net so much faster .
positive	slimdriver is so easy to use .
positive	i did download something else first and did not understand it and had to delete it , so glad i found this ... makes me love my computer and computer time again .
positive	i give it a 0 star .
positive	a dealership more like a friend .
positive	low pressure / no pressure sales_team .
positive	the quality of their late model used car selection was phenomenal .
positive	almost all the cars were bought from car_rentals or private owners who maintained their vehicles .
positive	the plus is warranty , 0 business day return_policy no questions asked , the 00 - day major system repair coverage with no out of pocket expense , plus an incredible extended_warranty ( 0 yr 00 , 000_miles and 0 yr , 00 , 000 mile coverage .
positive	bought suv on july_0th .
positive	july_0th the a /_c stopped blowing cold air .
positive	called aeverex ( service contract administrator ) and explained the problem .
positive	i am now scheduled for repair on wed , july_0th with no out of pocket expense , whether it '_s just a freon recharge , a /_c compressor , or water pump .
positive	i have always bought late model used cars ( never new ) and i have never had such complete comprehensive coverage if something breaks nor ever had such great customer_service - national customer_support center for drivetime called me on monday , july_0th , to congratulate me on my purchase and to ask about my experience with sales_rep and finance mgr at the dealership - this was a first .
positive	normally when i bought used and drove it off the lot , i ' d never hear from the dealership again and start getting harassed about my loan payment , even_though with those other dealerships my payment wouldn_'_t be due for a month !
positive	drivetime east in indianapolis , thanks for a great experience .
positive	special thanks to sales associate chad horsley , who took_care of paperwork and car prep for delivery on my purchase .
positive	don_'_t go to any mom & pop buy here pay here lot , or even large local dealership ( like gm , chevrolet , ford , kia , etc .
positive	).
positive	i highly_recommend drivetime , which is nationwide !
positive	i even have the option of activating my built - in onstar service - something i have never even offered before on a used car .
positive	if you go to drivetime to purchase a car , truck , or suv , use my name ( jeffery wolfe in indianapolis ).

positive	ordering was a breeze and the prescription was perfect .
positive	the only opportunity i would add is that the lenses include a label indicating which is right vs . left .
positive	had to figure this out for myself .
positive	this one little addition to the process would simply add to this wonderful experience .
positive	thanks ads !
positive	i '_ve been trying to construct my own logo for my business and was searching for ideas for objects and layering .
positive	i came_across this logo company , freelogoservices . com , and they had everying i need .
positive	i registered and created a two layer logo , an object and a graphic design , with the name of my company all in a matter of minutes .
positive	i would recommend freelogoservices . com everytime .
positive	we really don_'_t have time to look for vendors for our supplies so when we find one that is affordable , knowledgeable and has a fast production time we stick with it .
positive	everything has worked_perfectly for us for the past few years .

positive	the parts_geek csr that helped_me ( chris m ) is as good as they get .
positive	he made me feel that pg truly wanted my business while presenting a thoroughly professional , yet personable image .

positive	he is quite an asset to parts_geek .
positive	as for the positive efforts of parts_geek - i was totally blown_away when i found the parts i had ordered friday_afternoon in my mailbox early monday_afternoon .
positive	that type of delivery is nearly impossible except for very expensive services like ups or fed_ex next_day , but this package was simply 0st_class usps postage .
positive	when a problem , of my doing , showed_up , parts_geek assured me they would take whatever steps they needed to solve my dilemma .
positive	in my opinion , that ’_s the kind of service you get from a local parts supplier that you build up over many years - yet this was my first visit to parts_geek .
positive	if they all go this smoothly , i ’ ll never need to shop anywhere_else .

positive	i do a considerable amount of hobby trading on ebay .
positive	i found an item i wanted to build and present to a physician friend who has provided me with competent and compassionate healthcare over the past decade , but found the ebay price and s &_h to be unrealistic for a new but relatively common product .
positive	i decided to research the product on hobbylinc , just to see if my theory of price gouging held true .
positive	even having to pay ga sales tax , the hobbylink price was well below half of the asking price with s &_h charges for the identical item on ebay .
positive	there is a moral to this story .
positive	the trust you put into an on - line purchase must be equaled by the trustworthiness of the seller .
positive	with ebay , you are not dealing_with a company that must maintain its reputation of fairness , but an individual who can assume a new identity from one transaction to the next .
positive	buyer_beware .
positive	trust has a tangible value and should be considered whenever making purchases too good to be true , even more so than when the circumstances have already caused your defense mechanisms to activate .
positive	the cost of peace of mind is sometimes negligible when compared to what is at risk .

positive	i bought 0 blue led flashing lights to hook to the dogs collars .
positive	only 0 of them worked .
positive	they have a way of getting out and i did not want them to get hit by a car .
positive	these lights are very bright and you can see these two dogs 0 blocks over .

positive	great prices
positive	very impressed with the range of goods offered , the free p + p , and the generous discounts for bulk orders .
positive	i ordered at 0pm , goods were here the next_day at 00 .
positive	quality of packaging was good and goods were received undamaged .
positive	i was impressed by the staff at the fitting_centre , they started the job exactly at the time when the car was booked in , and within an_hour 0 tyres were fitted , an oil change completed , and advice was given to me about a suitable spare for the car , as it is not a standard fitment .
positive	it was explained to me exactly_what the job would involve , and they treated my car with respect .
positive	i have used squaretrade for 00 plus years and have used them many_times . you get great warranties for a resasonable rate , also exceptional .
positive	i can '_t believe in todays times that there is still a company like this one .
positive	excellent pricing on the best supplements , highly_recommend .
positive	operator who took my call understood the urgency of my relatively small order , promised to speak to warehouse , he obviously did because the goods were there next_morning , their product ( snow machine fluid ) is very competitively_priced as well .
positive	they offer a really wide_selection of shredders at pretty good prices , fast delivery and good communications , i would recommend them .
positive	this was an awesome experience .
positive	i damaged my iphone 0 beyond repair .
positive	i submitted my square_trade claim on line by answering a few simple questions .

positive	the replacement cell looks and performs like a new iphone 0 .
positive	i will never purchase cell_phone protection through my cell carrier again .
positive	i will only use square_trade from now on .

positive	we booked out trip through private_expeditions and found the entire_process seamless and informative .
positive	with literally hundreds of outfitters offering climbs of kilimanjaro and safaris , we needed to whittle down our options .
positive	we had a couple of basic criteria : 0 ) we wanted a company that complied with kpap ( kilimanjaro porters assistance project ), a group that ensures porters are paid what they ' re supposed to be paid and that the porters have adequate basic equipment ( shoes , tents , meals ) while on the mountain , 0 ) we wanted a mid - priced company - there are many outfitters offering the same services and experience for substantially more money and others which offer low_prices but cut many corners ., 0 ) finally , we wanted a company with many favorable reviews .
positive	our search brought us to private_expeditions and we couldn_'_t have been more pleased .
positive	we were met at the airport by said - a very well - spoken man who took us to our hotel and got us settled in .
positive	he explained that our guide and the local head of pe would be by the hotel in the morning to give us our pre_- trek briefing .
positive	next_day , emmanual and our guide praygod arrived and gave us great comfort by explaining all of the details of the hike .
positive	we headed off the next_morning for our 0 - day machame trek with praygod , our assistant guide elias , our cook james , our waiter serafin and six other porters .
positive	throughout the climb , our crew was always focused on our comfort and safety .
positive	you are greeted at every new camp with hot tea , popcorn and bowls of hot water for washing .
positive	praygod and elias ( who , by the way , has a great sense of humor and made the trek so much fun ) were a constant presence , always willing to offer a hand across larger rocks or offering to carry my wife '_s pack during the more arduous parts of the trek .
positive	we reached the summit successfully thanks in large part to our wonderful crew .
positive	you meet many other climbers along the way who are traveling with other outfitters .
positive	while not universal , the vast majority had complaints about their guides , their food , the tents , or something .
positive	we had no_complaints :)
positive	one other aside , in speaking to our crew ( guides to porters ) all seemed genuinely happy to be working for private_expeditions .
positive	the safari was led by a different guide , ezekiel , a very nice man with tremendous knowledge of the national parks and all of the animals .
positive	he , also , was very conscientious of our comfort and our needs throughout the safari .
positive	the lodges booked for us through private_expeditions were all terrific .
positive	in all , i would highly_recommend private_expeditions to anyone considering climbing kili and / or going on a safari in tanzania .
positive	the best place i have found for protein_bars
positive	cool idea easy gift to do that is a little more personalized great site
positive	price was excellent and service brilliant
positive	adam arrived within the timescale advised and fitted tyre in under 00_mins .
positive	very_pleased with the service .
positive	this is our second time .
positive	very good prices and efficient delivery service .
positive	we were contacted on the day of delivery and were given a 0hr timeslot which was brilliant and did not disrupt the day .
positive	delivery men were polite and took all packaging away .
positive	accu werkt perfect en moet pas na meer dan 0 volle dagen terug opgeladen worden .
positive	een_aanrader !

positive	i cannot_fault suntransfers at all .
positive	the booking process online was easy and hassle_free .
positive	we travelled to marjorca on 00th july 0000 and our driver was waiting for us at palma airport with a clearly named card .
positive	therre was no chance of missing him .
positive	he was courteous and the vehicle was more_than adequate for 0 adults - fully air - conditioned and comfortable transfer .
positive	the expereince was even better coming_back as the driver arrived early and agreed to wait around for my son and his friend who were due to meet us at the originally agreed time .
positive	the vehicle was even better on the return .
positive	definitely 0_stars for suntransfers and i would not hesitate to use again .
positive	since i '_ve been with ancestry . com , i '_ve learned so much about my family .
positive	i really didn_'_t know that some of our family is from canada , and some parts of england .
positive	i really wanted to do the search at this time , but i really couldn_'_t afford to upgrade , but i found much satisfaction in the subscription i had .
positive	i have had the most incredible journey into the my ancestors past .
positive	not only was i able to gather information of the past , i was also able to get information of the present .
positive	i was nervous at first , but with the help of ancestry . com research techniques , i believe i have became a pro !!!!

positive	priceline is so easy to use and very customer friendly .
positive	the bidding_process is convenient and very competitive and fair .
positive	i don_'_t use any other site for my travell needs because priceline is the best ... hands_down .
positive	the shirt is perfect i really like it !
positive	the viator website is laid_out very well , making our choice of tours easy based on our personal interests .
positive	once we had decided , it was just a few_clicks and we were booked !
positive	five_stars !
positive	wide_range of tyres .
positive	wide_range of prices .
positive	there '_s one for you .
positive	when e arrived at pula airport , the driver was there to greet us .
positive	when we got to the hotel he was very helpful in checking us in .
positive	he told us what time he was going to pick us up on our return .
positive	and he was there bang on time .
positive	i have at last found a product range that works for me .
positive	good quality and works well .
positive	feels good and soothing , i will_definitely use again and again .
positive	brilliant . thank_you .
positive	i have been meaning to do this for ages .
positive	i had several looks at selectspecs , choosing what i wanted and then it was extremely straightforward process .
positive	before i knew it my glasses were ordered and i could breathe a sigh of relief .
positive	i have varifocals so was pleasantly_surprised that this didn_'_t seem to be a problem and had a wide_selection of specs i could choose .
positive	everyone has commented on how they like my choices and i '_ve had no_problems at all .
positive	they arrive in reasonable cases , so no_problems from the start .
positive	i would definitely order again from selectspecs .
positive	i would highly_recommend quicker cash . com .
positive	the whole_process took less_than a minute and they matched my application with a loan instantly .
positive	i was approved and cash on its way in a matter of minutes .
positive	definitely a0 service .
positive	i shop a lot on qvc , i find many items here and i can return if not satisfied .
positive	very convenient , reps are courteous .
positive	my son introduced me to google everything a few years_ago this should be their logo .
positive	i never stopped googling since then .
positive	love to see with paypal logo .
positive	saves me the headache of looking for my credit_card .
positive	always gives up the good deals
positive	loved the prices , lowest by far
positive	i '_ve purchased warranties throughout my life , an odd thing i tell you since i really treat myself in a devil may care way , i run marathons , i hike mountains , i eat whole cheese cakes and i train martial arts and get my body and feathers ruffled on a day to day occurrence .
positive	so , when i bought a canon g00 years_ago , and used it on a trip , i also purchased a squaretrade_warranty along with it .
positive	the warranty sat , unused for years .
positive	two and a half to be exact , so i got that familiar feeling anyone gets when they get the clear coat put on their car , or the cabbage they bought that spoiled , that feeling of , unused service .
positive	which was fine , i went on thinking ignorance was bliss and never sure if i would ever need squaretrade for future_purchases , as i seemed to take_care of my things .
positive	and then , while hiking around arizona on a cross country drive , the wind decided to be my nemesis and knock my tripod mounted camera forwards and into a rock filled path of discomfort .
positive	the camera build like the 0 bit nintendo survived the scuffle with gravity but not completely unphased , a slight scratch had found it '_s way onto my lens , visible in photo '_s .
positive	i finished my cross country trek , contacted squaretrade through a few_clicks and presto , box in the mail and a few_days_later my camera were being repaired .
positive	i know such , as i got emails updating me on it '_s status .
positive	then it arrived back , and my lens was fixed and my life were better and i have bought a warranty through squaretrade on everything i buy .
positive	everything , camera lens and such from ebay , keyboards from amazon .
positive	i hardly ever use the warranties , currently i have 0 and have only required their service 0 times .
positive	another fight with gravity and my phone , and my kindle deciding it didn_'_t want to be a e_- reader and instead opted for paper weight .
positive	i have recommended them to friends and chuckled when they said , " no need ."
positive	and then six_months later when the moon was full and the temperature was right , and they dropped their phone '_s down and escalator at the mall whilst eating kettle cooked corn .
positive	i am not an insured person '_s , i feel no need as i am still young enough to feel invincible and just old enough to know which things to avoid in mass quantities at buffet lines , but if square_trade ever offers health insurance , i would be first in line .
positive	until then , ever gadget i own is in their hands .
positive	truly , all of them .
positive	only place i could find the cd i was looking for that had a particular track i wanted .
positive	delivery took about 0 wks to usa .
positive	no_problems .
positive	shipped in a nice padded cd envelope .
positive	would shop with again .
positive	cheap prices without cheap quality like other big stores .
positive	the actual buildings can be run down looking , but aldi has got it where it counts .
positive	still has the best results , but their new privacy_policy of tracking people everywhere they go on the web is a little too big brother .
positive	hopefully someone will challenge them soon .
positive	tons of content , easy streaming , upload , download , subscriptions .
positive	ads are annoying , but it '_s owned by google so what do you expect ?
positive	can have everything for free .
positive	been using amazon since 0000 .
positive	very happy with shipping and return_policy .
positive	customers service ( if you ' re unfortunate enough to need it ) can be poor , but they ' re an online company so that '_s not unusual .
positive	my prime account recently expired which has actually saved me a lot of money .
positive	i realized i don_'_t compulsively buy anymore , like when i had prime .
positive	after a decade of frustration with other_companies , i finally " discovered " grainger and couldn_'_t be_happier .
positive	i used to think they just sold industrial stuff , but they '_ve been able to fulfill almost every business need i '_ve thrown at them .
positive	i '_ll update if they ever fall short ( as i '_ve come to expect from all companies ) but so_far they '_ve been great .
positive	highly_recommended , as i '_ve told all my friends .
positive	if you are seeking to keep_up to date on your family_history this is the perfect site to do it .
positive	i ordered fitness ball 00cm best price on line . i needed it fast for program i was starting . i ordered at 00 . 00am on
positive	0 / 00 / 0000 and got just what they said in my hand at 0 . 00pm 0 / 00 / 0000 , when the driver came in i could not believe it they called me 00 min .
positive	later to make_sure i was happy with the service . great job i will be back
positive	i use ancestrtal .
positive	com because with facebook there is no privacy .
