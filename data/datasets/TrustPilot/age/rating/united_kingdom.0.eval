negative	internet is shait keeps going off it takes them 0 f_** king weeks to send an engineer over avoid this rubbish company also the phone does work bad work no one should use this company
negative	this is probably the worst experience i have ever had when trying to book a holiday .
negative	first of all their website doesn ' t work properly .
negative	when trying to book online , i went to submit the payment and it was just loading and loading but not going through .
negative	i tried on several different computers and got the same issue .
negative	i tried to ring customer_service but the line was dead .
negative	i emailed them but they never got back to me .
negative	then just as i was about to pay for a holiday with another airline , a confirmation_email came through followed_by several emails saying my item is still in the basket !!
negative	!
negative	i have since flown and come back only to see that i ' ve been charged an additional £_00 .
negative	but rather_than try to help me , they have given me a list of possible reasons_why this may be ( purchase extras and exchange_rate differences ) and asked me to refer to terms and conditions .
negative	so now i have to explain to them that any extras i purchased were debited outside of this and the exchange_rate has barely moved .
negative	sometimes i think it would just be easier to bang my head against the wall !
negative	they do not allow you to take cash out at the counter unless it is over £_00 .
negative	this means when i want my sons judo money i have to take out £_00 , go overdrawn and be charged , just so i can pay it , and pay the change back into the account .
negative	terrible customer_service - was on hold for over 00_minutes on 0 separate phone_calls .
negative	finally got thru and was told a manager would get back to me with a resolution ... five five days_later , still nothing and i still cannot get thru on the phone .
negative	this company also ship lots of close dated ( expired product ) which they claim to be fresh - scientifically , most nutrients degrade during their shelf_life thus lessening intended benefits over time - especially proteins .
negative	this degradation is accelerated when proteins are exposed to heat elements .
negative	i would be weary of the effectiveness of any close dated product .
negative	paid in full for valentines flowers and on the day they decide to change the delivery date !!!!!
negative	they are ignoring calls and emails ( 0 days now ) but have put a very small apology on the website .... ha !
negative	its too_late valentines has been and gone so the flowers are useless and the day has been ruined !
negative	if you cant handle the orders dont take peoples money !
negative	p . s .
negative	hurry up and give me my money back !
negative	if i lived closer id be down there collecting it in person !
negative	stay_away !
negative	used parentpay a few_times , slow processing was one thing but having a letter arrive home in your 0 year_old ' s bag that had your log - in details on is another .
negative	comforting to know that the school office and any of the kids they use as runners can now access my account .
negative	my advice - not with a barge_pole !
negative	ordered a climbing frame , was supposed to be delivered 00 / 00 , saw it was out for delivery between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , teaching strikes were on so kids at home and all excited about helping to build it .
negative	waited until 00 : 00 no delivery so i phoned the nottingham branch that it was due to come from , to be told , as it was 000kg they could not fit it on the vehicle and they are struggling for drivers , are they trying to fit it on a van ??
negative	...
negative	unacceptable , today is my kids birthday and i have tried to phone the depot again to see if it ' s on their vehicle , but at 00 : 00 i get the response " our opening_hours are from 00 : 00 "
negative	consignment_number zfbrfu000000
negative	my story , i ordered a new ( ex display ) sony tv for over £_0k back at the beginning of may for delivery on the friday .
negative	due to just moving_house there was a issue with the card , which i quickly sorted .
negative	after completing the payment everything went down_hill , i first received a emessage ( their msging system ) saying we are sorry , but due to unforeseen_circumstances your goods have not been despatched for delivery .
negative	please continue to monitor your emails for tracking_details .
negative	on the friday i asked when it was being delivered and was given a company to ring and consignment_number , the company that i was given was closed for the weekend at this time , so i had to wait_until monday to ring , which i did , the company had no record or knowledge of this consignment , i had also checked on the friday and was told it was being picked_up that day , so why was there no record ??
negative	due to it being so late , i cancelled the order , knowing full well it hadn ' t even been dispatched , this took another week to get a reply , i was told it was with the technical engineers and that they would phone me the next_day , my reply to this was of wonder ," why is it there ?
negative	i have cancelled it before its been dispatched !"
negative	funnily_enough no reply until today , where they have now sent me and email with the refund details on it , stating 0 - 0 days to receive these into my account , and taking off nearly £_000 less_than the original purchase price , i have already replied with the fact that this is illegal and have now left in the hands of my credit_card company to get the full_amount back .
negative	i have kept all documentation and copied all the emessages that have been sent to me , for legal use at a later date if need be .
negative	my advice is if your making a large purchase , don ' t do it from here .
negative	i wouldn ' t trust anything these_guys say , i also doubt some of the other comments on here that are just being used to boost the scores up .
negative	sales order 00000000
negative	returns associated with invoice # 00000000 rma_number :_00000000 accepted
negative	years_ago i recomended myprotein to a lot of friends and people in the gym .
negative	prices were more_than reasonable , products were good quality and despatch / delivery was quick .
negative	after a little break of dealing_with myprotein i decided to give them another shot .
negative	all address details were given but once despatch email came through important details of the address were missed off .
negative	as i expected no goods turned_up .
negative	tried to speak to myyodel which i will never deal with again .
negative	i was told that they were signed for by someone i ' d never_heard of .
negative	then after a while they told me they wouldn ' t help me any more and that i need to contact myprotein .
negative	it took 0 messages to get a response from myprotein .
negative	even after this response it was just to tell me the same information of problems that i had reported .
negative	even a second response days_later sounds_like the customer_service could not be bothered to read the problem details correctly !
negative	feels_like the company has got too big and forgotten the basics .
negative	really not happy with the service i ' ve received .
negative	the only part that ' s gone_smoothly so far is taking the money from me !
negative	will never deal with the company again .
negative	unfortunately can ' t even see the matter being solved any time soon .
negative	i had my baby registry at babies r us in the u . k , and everything was fine with it .
negative	we then received a broken item , which we realized was broken when we tried to assemble it the same day it arrived .
negative	we called the customer_service desk which was useless and a waster of my time .
negative	first , i was accused of breaking it myself , even_though it had only been delivered about 00_minutes prior .
negative	then i was told i would have to pay to send it back with the company that delivered it .
negative	trust me , they got it from me at that point .
negative	they finally after pissing and moaning about it , arranged for pick_up from my house , as the nearest store is 0 hours away , and i am 0 months pregnant and didn ' t fancy driving all that way to replace something that was faulty on their behalf .
negative	so it was picked_up , and i tracked the delivery .
negative	it ' s been over 0 days now and they still_haven ' t received it in their system , and therefore hasn ' t been delivered .
negative	i phoned and was told i ' d have to wait at_least 0 weeks for the new one , even_though it ' s paid for , and they ' re not losing anything by sending it to me .
negative	i ' ve made many complaints to them , but nothing seems to get done .
negative	i feel 0 star is even too much for this company , and will never shop or make another registry again with toys_r us , or babies r us .
negative	awful service , useless customer_service helpline , and all around ignorant .
negative	i am writing this review and at the same time i am talking to orange customer_service .
negative	i have never ever been let_down so badly .
negative	on thursday i thought i will give orange a try .
negative	gone to argos got myself a payg sim done a £_00 . 00 top up and called orange to transfer my number .
negative	0gb free data seemed like a good thing .
negative	so i called and registered my new number and done everything they asked to do .
negative	was promised that my number will be ported over on friday before midnight .
negative	i was told to keep turning my phone on and off during the day and eventually the number will be transferred .
negative	come today morning nothing happened .
negative	still no porting .
negative	so i called orange ( 00p each call to customer_service !
negative	) and asked what is going on .
negative	long_story short the person i spoke to told me i was given a bulk pac_code ( no such a thing !!!
negative	) and it will be done on tuesday .
negative	i did complaint and said it is not good enough and why has this not been done .
negative	the person i was speaking to started being rude and was talking over me , i asked her not to do it and asked to be put to a supervisor .
negative	the reply was “ i can talk over you and customer is not always right ”!
negative	i demanded to speak to her supervisor and she than told me that there is no supervisors working today !!! impossible !
negative	she than cut me off .
negative	what a s !!!!
negative	service , i called back and after trying to explain everything again another customer_service person has cut me off .
negative	0rd call now and i am speaking to a supervisor .
negative	actually he has just put me on hold and i have been holding for 00_minutes .
negative	i told him that i want to make an official_complaint about him and his service and that i am not happy , i want to stop the porting .
negative	he has put me on hold and i know he is just waiting for me to disconnect the call .
negative	well i am on my way to orange shop now and let ’_s get this sorted there .
negative	never use orange never !
negative	i will tell all my friend not to trust them even if the give you free calls for life .
negative	what a disappointment .
negative	even the supervisors don ’ t care .
negative	!!!
negative	! oh well they just cut me of !!!
negative	!
negative	i have sent them my blackberry phones , i had them refurbished recently and they look like new .
negative	i wanted to try these_guys as the price was the highest .
negative	i paid for special delivery to send these phones to them as wasnt too sure on them and wanted to make_sure them get them quickly .
negative	they tried to stich me up by reducing the price for each phone to nearly 0rd of the value .
negative	after trying to get them to offer the original price and sending loads of emails i in the end askled for the phones to be sent back .
negative	0 weeks_later i finally got them back and the protective screen covers i had on them have been removed by this company .
negative	dont use them if you can help it .
negative	bye
negative	sold an ipod in november , they said the money would be in the account by christmas_eve and still have not received the money yet .
negative	they also blocked my account for unknown reasons and haven ' t yet sent me a letter to help me reactivate the account .
negative	this was last_year .
negative	request them to import an item ( laptop that an employee was using ) from nepal , first of all it was delivered to wrong_address and after chasing them i found out after 0 days it has been delivered to wrong_address .
negative	when i went to pick it up i was shocked to see , the laptop was damaged , box was opened , battery was missing and there were marks on laptop too .
negative	terrible services , never using them again .
negative	i got a month web i should be able to stream and download , on the first day i couldnt even watch youtube or dowload , second day i rang up they said they will refresh my account didnt work , they did this the next_day also , now on the fourth day i got a text_saying my fair use policy has been excided after not even streaming or down loading .... worst network out there , absoulate bull s ***.
negative	this isnt the first time its happend
negative	we are virgin_media customers that are looking to move home in 0 months time .
negative	when advising virgin_media of this they told us that they could only provide slow broadband and telephone line to the area and not television services .
negative	the only thing that i could do was to pay the £_00 a month fee for poor broadband and get tv through a 0rd_party provider that cannot provide the full virgin_media tv service .
negative	i was given 0 options , pay a £_000 early disconnection charge or pay £_00 a month for a poor service .
negative	as mentioned , i was happy to stick to virgin_media for the duration , but they could not provide the same service .
negative	they have it written up in their ridiculous contracts that you do not have a choice so beware what you are signing into .
negative	i took the £_000 disconnection charge as quite_frankly , the service is not that good .
negative	we had issues with our phone line that took several weeks to sort and we were also advised by a virgin_media member of staff to purchase a new telephone as it was our problem .
negative	it turned_out there was a problem with the phone line that the experts at virgin_media did not pick_up .
negative	with regards to the tv , the pause , rewind and fast forward facility is no way nearly as good as what sky + offers , it ' s slow and the screen often blurs .
negative	we have used sky and virgin and from my experiences with both , i would highly_recommend sky over virgin_media any day of the week .
negative	the only reason that we did not use sky this time around was that we are in an apartment that we were not allowed by the building owners to put a dish on it .
negative	dealing_with company has been extremely frustrating .
negative	staff are polite , but once the order is in , they make almost no effort to get the items to you in a way that suits you .
negative	bizarrely long waits for the courier ( who have no phone number , web_site or contact address ) to bother to call you to inform you when , in the next few_months , they might do their job to try to deliver the goods .
negative	if you are away or on holiday , then expect a few more weeks wait .
negative	if you try to cancel out of sheer frustration , they ( illegally ) try to keep deposit to cover delivery that has not even occurred .
negative	avoid
negative	i am on a business contract , our company has been on vodafone for many years , my iphone had some issues within 0year and 0 month of having the phone , and of course it is not covered by warranty .
negative	however , vodafone offer no other way of warranty such as other_companies do , e . g .
negative	john_lewis offer 0 year_warranty on ipads .
negative	bearing in mind the contract is 00 months .
negative	while trying to sort this out , or seeing if they can offer me some kind of replacement or cheaper repair rather_than the £_000 to fix it .
negative	( the phone is barely even worth that new now ).
negative	their service was dreadful on the phone .
negative	when i was told someone would call me back in a specific timeframe , no one did , i kept having to chase them up .
negative	this happened multiple time , and their manager defended them .
negative	i said if you arrange a callback it is polite to make that arrangement or at_least get someone to say that they may need to arrange another time .
negative	service is dreadful and now the account_manager is now a team and not just one person .
negative	we had a good relationship with our previous manager and the team are useless and only open minimal hours .
negative	they need to do proper stock checks - idiots , staff unhelpful and lack knowledge !
negative	wait ages for assistance !
negative	partmaster website is rubbish , next_day delivery doesn ' t mention no sat delivery , you pay through the roof for a lousy controller !
negative	avoid this chain at all costs
negative	absolute_joke - supposed free brightsparks visit who found no fault my end but changed the faceplate anyway , even_though he told me mine was fine i then received the brightsparks bill for £_00 which sent me overdrawn as i wasnt expecting it so got another £_00 bill from the bank - rang up 0 times to be told by " manager " rahul singh that i will be getting no refund or help will billing because he changed the faceplate !
negative	apparently its not fraud or anything of the sort though .
negative	oh and no they wont come back out and fit my original faceplate so basically there work is not even guaranteed !
negative	talktalk suck end of !!!!
negative	!
negative	every time ive ordered from games workshop something has gone wrong .
negative	wether its my items in the order or the delivery .
negative	ive tried_calling them before to sort out a problem with my order and they were really incompetent .
negative	they have put me off citadel miniatures for life now .
negative	there are so many up and coming companies and games that are far better .
negative	absolutely_useless .
negative	items never delivered within timescales , when large items are finally received they are damaged .
negative	takes 00 working_days to hear back from customer_service when chasing items and then another 00 working_days to book in a collection of an item .
negative	looking over the reviews on the internet it is surprising this company is still trading .
negative	would recommend that everyone stays away from they are a complete disappointment .
negative	please don ' t be_fooled by the positive_reviews listed below i can only assume they are left by the owners of the company or there are a few lucky people .
negative	took an_absolute age to deliver ( about 0 months ).
negative	i ordered the gloss white tv_unit , came in 0 boxes and weighs over 000kg .
negative	all boxes perfectly intact on delivery however almost every piece is damaged and scuffed .
negative	you cannot email or call the customer_service department as there is no phone number !?!
negative	i was never offered a refund or a replacement even with their guarantees .
negative	you will be lucky to get through on their only number , however when they do answer they will be more_than happy to take your money but if you have a problem you have to call the same number which they always promise a callback from this socalled customer_service team .
negative	after about 00 promises and emails to the sales_team no callbacks happen .
negative	if you get scammed please call your card company for a refund .
negative	i called my bank and they claimed a chargeback using visa .
negative	we did have problems as ideally you need to return the item , however 0 boxes weighing over 000kg and no return address makes things very difficult .
negative	took about 0 months however have now received a full_refund and will now take a trip down the scrapyard to dispose of scrap that was left at my house .
negative	please stay_away from this dodgy company and use a company that has all positive feedbacks as you will be very sorry when you get caught out .
negative	following is what happened .
negative	my imei is [ personal information removed_] and i paid 000_pounds on nov_00th 0000 .
negative	at that time the time limit for unlock was 00 business days .
negative	but i did not receive any news from them until nov_00th which is more_than 00 business days . so i asked them to cancel my order . i got a mail from them on that particular day that saying they did cancel my order and i ' ll get back my money with in four days .
negative	today is 00th of jan_0000 but still i do not get the refund .
negative	i tried to contact them via internet and phone but no reply until today .
negative	do not trust these people !!!
negative	!
negative	i bought a kingston ssd and chose the free delivery , when i bought it there was 00 + in stock , 0 days_later , the status still says " goods allocated ", so it hasn ' t been dispatched yet .
negative	to make things worst , they took the money straight_away , with no emails about any updates about my order .
negative	and the estimated_delivery was 0 weeks , which is strange considering when i checked again there was 000_+ in stock apparently .
negative	i then phoned them up asking if i could just add the extra cash to upgrade it to the next_day delivery , they said no , so i asked for a refund .
negative	after the refund was issued , i bought the same ssd again , but chose to pay the extra £ 0 . 00 for next_day shipping .
negative	guess_what ?...................
negative	0 days_later , it still says " goods allocated " as the status , and now it says 000_+ in stock , and of course no email about any update with regards to my order .
negative	what a joke !
negative	terrible !
negative	bought insurance for me and my whole family .
negative	went abroad for a family wedding .
negative	i returned home , my wife travelled onto see her family in another country .
negative	the night before her flight back to the uk , she fell ill and was unable to fly .
negative	we informed the airline , and then also informed the insurance company .
negative	emergency assist team were friendly and helpful .
negative	insurance company then said that as my wife had been away for more_than 00 days , they will not cover her .
negative	the day she was due to fly back was the 00th day .
negative	the insurance company are a complete con , and they will always use every trick in the book to not pay out .
negative	a lot of good reviews here about this company , but 00_% of them have never had to claim .
negative	its only when you go to make a claim , that you suddenly realise how awful this particular company are .
negative	when paying for 0 full years family insurance - it should have clearly_stated that it does not cover trips more_than 00 days .
negative	it only mentions this in the policy document once you have purchased the insurance .
negative	the post_office and most other_companies offer 00 days cover whilst you are away .
negative	awful company - avoid most definitely
negative	then this should be displayed wen purchasing the insurance at checkout - and not hidden in your booklet .
negative	as i said this insurance with you guys is a complete con .
negative	not only that - but as the situation was an_emergency - instead of replying back to me via_email or calling me , the company decided to send a letter .
negative	completely pathetic response from a pathetic company .
negative	advice to all others avoid like this company at all costs .
negative	joined british_gas homecare and had a problem with my boiler in my flat .
negative	had 0 appointments to my flat for a various bs engineers to fix a problem .
negative	either the engineer didn ' t turn_up for the numerous appointments or the engineer arrived at the wrong time , but didn ' t have the part and had to arrange another visit !
negative	or he broke something else on his visit .
negative	my wife and i had to take days off work for this ' service '.
negative	we took so many days off from work sitting in the flat , waiting for an engineer to not turn_up , that we weren ' t able to go on a holiday .
negative	very unhappy - eventually i came to the end of my tether and cancelled the homecare .
negative	we never were able to get any refund on the service that we had experienced .
negative	after the nasty experience we got a local engineer to come around and fix the problem the next_day - should have done this in the first place .
negative	a very expensive and unpleasant experience .
negative	don ' t believe the slick adverts and marketing .
negative	british_gas have the worst customer_service in a company i have very come_across .
negative	i will never use british_gas for anything again .
negative	very poor service from plumbworld - i waited in for a day , it didn ' t arrive and no contact was made .
negative	i tried to phone the delivery company ( yodel ) but their phone_lines didn ' t work .
negative	yodel eventually phoned me to say they would deliver 0 days_later .
negative	i waited at home again ( took time off work ) and again no delivery .
negative	couldn ' t phone them and they failed to contact me .
negative	after this frustrating experience i tried with little success in emailing plumbworld several_times ( they have no phone number ).
negative	they did little to help for a full week - all this time my builder was waiting for the bathroom pieces to install .
negative	yodel were no help either and lied to me that they would get someone to phone me back on my twice failed delivery .
negative	i was getting more and more frustrated ...
negative	eventually plumbworld sent out a second delivery with my stuff via a different delivery partner , seems that the first set had got lost by yodel .
negative	this did arrive !
negative	although a part of my order was missing and i ' ve got to wait 00 days for delivery since the date i arranged for it to be delivered .
negative	i am very disappointed in plumbworld and their delivery partner yodel - if it works , then great .
negative	but if you have any_problems you are in a world of pain .
negative	next time i will purchase items from a different supplier .
negative	they did refund me my delivery charge , but that is the least they could do under the circumstances .
negative	hopefully you read this review this review , and those below , prior to engaging with this company .
negative	i sent my samsung_galaxy_s0 on monday april 0nd via first_class delivery after being quoted £_000 .
negative	delivery was confirmed by royal_mail the following_day .
negative	no email was received to confirm this from bowozi however as they advise they will .
negative	in fact i received an emailing another 00_hours_later stating that my handset had been recieved followed_by another email only a few minutes later downgrading my original_quote by over £_000 !
negative	i accept my handset was not brand_new hence_why i received a " used " quote .
negative	it is imperative that anyone who is considering using this company reads the small_print in detail , you will for example have further reductions on your original_quote by £_00 if your phone is network locked and in theory your " used " phone should be in a brand_new condition in order to recieve the quoted payment .
negative	in addidition to this if you decline the offer and wish to have your handset returned this will cost you £_00 - incurring yet more cost .
negative	of course this is if you are able to reach anybody in customer_service .
negative	i have spent in excess of £ 0 attempting to contact this firm on numerous_occasions .
negative	( the 0000 number provided is charged at a premium_rate regardless of wether or not some body answers .
negative	often the line will ring for 00 seconds before being disconnected ).
negative	in addition emails between myself and bozowi customer_services have generally been generic and have taken 00_hours to recieve a response .
negative	i accepted payment as i was already massively out of pocket and at this point i was willing to accept defeat and write off my entire experience with this dreadful company and even this took 0 days before funds where received in my account .
negative	i will never use this company again and would advice others to avoid like the plague !
negative	if the management and customer_service team where efficient at dealing_with their customers as the individual or team who responds to poor reviews on this site then the company would no doubt be far more successful .
negative	** regardless of wether the 0000 number is national or premium_rate you fail to acknowledge the fact that i have incurred further charges as a result of your customer_service department leaving my calls unanswered .
negative	not even an_apology mr bozowi ?!
negative	i can ' t say i ' m surprised .
negative	as i ' ve states previously my handset was indeed in a used condition and not pristine , hence_why i did not request a " brand_new " quote .
negative	you continue to hide_behind your unclear and hidden terms and conditions !
negative	however , your reviews and rating on trust_pilot are clearly a reflection on your company and business style .
negative	i recommend you have a look at the pages on this site for mazuma_mobile for example who have an excellent reputation and reviews .
negative	i doubt you will remain in business for much longer if you continue to operate your business in such a poor manner .
negative	again like many others i bought from them , money has been taken and they have not sent the item .
negative	i have tried to contact them and you hear nothing .
negative	my 0 year_old_son is now without his present , regret ordering from them .
negative	yodel is by_far the most useless courier firm i have ever come_across .
negative	shower of excrement doesn ' t even begin to cover it .
negative	i would give them no stars but unfortunately that isn ' t an option .
negative	i ordered some boots and to be fair they tried to deliver them 0 times ; all within the same hour each day .
negative	sort of like banging your head against a wall and expecting an outcome to pain .
negative	the driver , who texted me his mobile number seemed unable to work his mobile , either to answer it or pick_up his messages .
negative	did he think i was calling for a friendly chat ???
negative	the call_centre staff are nice ( except the last one , who just sounded bored to tears but then i can ' t really blame her ) but despite message after message left with them were unable to let the driver know ( which a 0 year_old could probably work out after 0 failed tries ) that since they deliver between_0am and 0pm , perhaps they could try any other time other than the 0pm hour .
negative	bored girl informed me that they have a set route and even_though their only job is to deliver parcels and they must have known this would not be fulfilled , they won ' t change the time .
negative	so basically their delivery times in my area are from 0pm to 0 . 00pm !?!
negative	yeah , really handy .
negative	cheers for that .
negative	so in work on monday i ' ll try to get hold of someone on the phone and get no answer .
negative	then on tuesday i ' ll call at the same time and get no answer .
negative	i ' ll repeat this 0 more times , leaving my number but never answer their calls .
negative	i haven ' t done my job but the boxes are ticked .
negative	bottom_line : if you want a lot of cards through your door , order with a company that uses_yodel but if you want a parcel , forget it .
negative	i was picked_up 0 0 / 0hrs before my flight for a 0 0 / 0hr journey the airport .
negative	after being collected from my hotel the coach driver went on to make 0 stops in the neighbouring resort only to then turn back on himself and go past my hotel .
negative	i had been on the coach for 00mins by this point .
negative	i had paid for a transfer with a maximum of 0 stops however the coach stopped several_times more_than this .
negative	when i arrived at the airport because the collection time was so early the check in desk had not even opened .
negative	i had to sit in miserable airport when i could have been in my hotel enjoying the final couple of hours of my break .
negative	i have contacted the customer_service team at resorthoppa four times by email without a reply .
negative	i had placed an order online for my partner ' s birthday as she only likes this one type of flower .
negative	when the order was received the company has sent me a completely diffrent order which is much cheaper_than that i had ordered .
negative	not acceptable .
negative	i made the first payment to tt on the 00th_december .
negative	until now i still don ' t have a broadband / internet_connection .
negative	i called every week since december and i think i spoke at_least once with every_single_person that works in customer_service / fault department / cancellation departments .
negative	i had a visit from an engineer everything is fine inside the house and with the modem , oh , it was the bt guys who didn ' t activate the line from outside .
negative	they will come on tuesday .
negative	not sure if they came or not but still no internet for 0 weeks .
negative	called again for around 00_minutes , did all the line testing that i already do with my eyes closed .
negative	swith on , swith off , change socked , open the socket , flip the modem , dance samba with modem , everytime the same expertly advised procedures .
negative	oh , you stay home from work from 0 to 0 ( thats not vague at all ) and a bt engineer will visit you .
negative	never showed up .
negative	called again - 00_minutes .
negative	oh , no the problem is with the exchange .

negative	another round of testing for 00_minutes ( took a nap while doing them ) and now , no faults anywhere , dont know , let me send you another engineer ( lucky me , there is one available in 0 weeks time !)
negative	no , i want to cancel , thank_you .
negative	let me direct you to the cancellation department .
negative	0 minutes on hold .. tcha nam ...
negative	i someone hangs up the phone in my face .
negative	after going to hell and back , called the cancellation department .... 00_minutes with a broked connection ... oh let me direct you to the faults department .
negative	what ?!
negative	they directed me to you .
negative	after 00_minutes on hold ... fault department , another round of line testing !!!
negative	nothing wrong , do you want an enginneer in 0 weeks time ?
negative	no , thank_you , just want to cancel the contract - sorry ma ' am , cancellation department closes at 0pm .... its 0 . 00pm .
negative	guess i dont need to say anything_else ....
negative	yes they do price , yes great pieces ... but i have been waiting for my order for over 00 days !!!
negative	ups cost me $_00 !!!
negative	i finally gave them a call to see what happened and my order had been canceled ... oh thanks for the notice !...
negative	never purchasing through this web_site again ... shipping is faster and less expensive on other_sites !
negative	!
negative	everyones story is the same with this company , they offer a big amount then cut it down to pennies , then they try to charge you £ 0 . 00 to return the handset - but on mensioning trading_standards or bbc_watchdog they say they ' ll re - look at the handset and give original offer ....
negative	bunch of crooks will never use again - best mobile phone recycler has to be either mazuma or top dollar mobile ( professional companies ) - also when trying to call cash0phones with - hold your number or if they have your details they dont answer !
negative	we changed provider from scottish_power to npower in november_0000 .
negative	we paid scottish_power by direct_debit and built a credit balance of £_000 by the time we changed .
negative	after 00_minutes on their " customer_services " 0000 number (=£ 0 . 00 ) they assured me a cheque ( not a direct transfer ) would be sent within 0 - 00 days .
negative	it ' s now 00 days and nothing has appeared - and i ' m typing this while on hold .
negative	00_minutes so far ....
negative	i only hope npower is better !
negative	please dont buy stuff from them they are running a scam .
negative	i bought a samsung phone 00 june in £_000 . 00 .
negative	after ordering i found that they are running scam i send them an_email very next_day .
negative	got and automatic generated answer from them which was totally irrelevant answer .
negative	next morning called and have to wait for 0 hour and 0 min .
negative	and he asked me reason_why i want to cancel i said i already gave you reason in email he said yeh but we need your reason again .
negative	i sent him another email same auto generated email .
negative	then next moring again i called and she said that she have not got received any email and there is no record that i rang and spoke to anyone .
negative	she said your order has been dispatched and i asked here tracking no she said courier will give us in next 0 to 0 days so then she will give me .
negative	then i called to moneybookers who are registered here in uk who charged my account on the behalf of them i told them they are running scam and you are the part of this scam and i will take legal_action_against you then they contacted to simply electronic and they refund my money .
negative	thanks to allah ( god ) got my money back .
negative	stay_away from them .
negative	its a scam
negative	i paid iflorist for flowers from their " same day " range , the flowers finally arrived 0 days_later ( after i had cancelled them for not arriving ).
negative	my mother explained to the florist that they had been cancelled so the florist said they would be free as it was their mistake .
negative	other than an offer to look_into the issue when i cancelled the flowers for going awol and an assurance someone would contact me within_00hrs ( a week_ago ) iflorist have ignored my communications during the last 00 days .
negative	i wont let it drop but please everyone avoid this company , anyone can make a mistake and fail to deliver , i know they reply on florists .
negative	however then to ignore their own customers complaint is unforgivable .
negative	fortunately my mother has forgiven me for seemingly missing her_birthday .
negative	nothing but trouble , keep thining ill try again but always some issue !!
negative	!
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted in the service i have received , i ordered a dining_table on the monday , was told i would receive it by wednesday if i paid extra .
negative	i get an_email on wednesday_afternoon saying it will be delivered on the friday , which i was annoyed about but i am reasonable person and accepted that the monday had been a bank_holiday , i was told somebody would ring me that day to arrange a delivery time .
negative	fair_enough .... anyway i did not receive a call , so i called up on the thursday to arrange a time and was informed that no delivery is in place and it will have to be changed to monday !
negative	annoying again , yet i accepted it .
negative	i arranged for someone to wait in today ( monday ) to accept delivery , i received a call at 0 - 00pm and a voicemail saying " oh we are on our way miss . jones we will be with you in 00_minutes " when i get home ( excited !)
negative	i find out from the person house sitting that it wasn ' t even delivered , no card was put through the door , i had no missed - calls , i have 0 dogs that bark loudly when the door knocks , so you can instantly know when someone is at the door even if you were in the garden , i believe they did not even try to deliver .
negative	i got fobbed_off by customer_service informing_me that they tried to deliver but no - one answered , which is untrue .
negative	she tried to describe the area ( that was on the note from the driver ) which was nothing like where i live !!
negative	she was extremely un - empathetic just informing_me i had to yet again arrange another delivery and someone would call me !
negative	surprise_surprise !
negative	i now have to arrange for someone_else to sit in my house to wait in for a delivery which is absolutely unacceptable and not easy for me to do .
negative	the service from every_single_person in yodel is disgusting .
negative	i work in customer_service myself and if i spoke to customers the way they do , i would be sacked !
negative	i took my macbook_pro in to the leeds store with a faulty battery .
negative	it came back with a non - working airport card which they claimed , laughably , no_longer existed , the screen peeling away from the hinges and the hard - drive no_longer working and needing replacing .
negative	absolutely_disgusting and embarrassing service and the fact that the people in the shop are all so nice makes it even more sickening that they have ruined my incredibly expensive laptop .
negative	pathetic .
negative	i spoke to three to cancel my ipad 0 account with them took me around 00_mins as they kept trying to make me keep it and then was ok with it then transfered me to sales to get me to take a new one out !!!!
negative	i then decided a week_later not to cancel i spoke to them and they were extremely happy i was keeping the adviser on the other end said that will be fine the contract will_continue as normal and will end in0000 .
negative	0 month later i receive £_000 three mobile charge along with a new broadband sim which i never asked for and signed me up to another 0 year contract .
negative	i have spoken with them today and apparently they made a mistake and forgot to stop the direct_debit charge also incurred bank charges which they wont refund and its their mistake but they are refunding me the money in 0 to 00 daysf for the charge that shpuldnt of happend however im still down £_00 for bank charges because three mobile are a joke of a company and care more of their pockets than customers .
negative	stay well clear regardless of their deals you will pay more in the end .
negative	i have recently upgraded with upgrade experts also i have taken out a new contract .
negative	- still to recieve this one in white hopefully
negative	i have received the wrong phone colour and no gift as was told would get an accessory pack and also £_00 a month_contract however contract say £_00 not impressed so going to cancel and go else where .
negative	i placed an order on 0rd june , till now i havent heard_anything back .
negative	order status says , " order confirmed ".
negative	when i tried_contacting , it says i ' ll get a response in 00_hours .
negative	i have to wait_until 00_hours just to hear probably we dont have the item in stock or similar crap .
negative	i wouldnt recommend the site to anyone .
negative	amazon continues to undercut every competition , even it ' s own marketplace_sellers .
negative	competition in retail should provide a healthy balance in price and choice but amazon are causing more harm than good .
negative	buying from amazon may save you a couple of pounds initially but if they continue to close down small_businesses , causing the loss of permanent , skilled and enjoyable employment , and only providing unskilled temporary warehouse employment , then i think we will all suffer in the long_term .
negative	eventually there will be no local_shops for our kids to get jobs , and our town centres will be boarded up .
negative	now is the time to support the businesses that will keep employment , culture and our local communities healthy .
negative	amazon will not .
negative	my partner brought me a pair of shoes from " new look " on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	he had also paid extra for next_day delivery !
negative	i was very excited , so we both decided to stay in and wait for them .
negative	they were due to arrive between_0am and 0pm today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
negative	i checked the " hermes : parcel tracking " only to find that at
negative	" 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt "
negative	i went straight to the letter_box and no card had been left .
negative	we got on to the phone to new look and they told us we had missed the courier , but how could we ?
negative	we have been in all day !!
negative	i new look wont even refund us delivery charge as we are supposedly the ones at fault .
negative	i am very angry and appalled at the way we have been treated and i hope never to do business with these couriers again once i finally receive my shoes !
negative	i upgraded to a new phone with o0 unaware that they were using yodel as their courier service .
negative	naturally i was excited .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 - i got a text from o0 stating i would receive my phone this day between_0am and 0pm .
negative	all day i waited and waited for my phone to be delivered .
negative	at 00 : 00 i got another text from o0 saying i had missed the delivery , i looked at the online tracker and it said " no one to receive card left " at 00 : 00 .
negative	i looked for a card and there wasn ' t one .
negative	i called the courier straight_away and told them i ' ve been in all day and missed a days work , so it would of been impossible for me to of missed them .
negative	the courier said " oh i ' m new to this round , and i don ' t know the area , so i didn ' t come ".
negative	what a joke !
negative	its your job ?
negative	what kind of excuse is that ?
negative	" erm i ' ll do it tomorrow " they spoke to me with no respect what so ever .
negative	can ' t believe they didn ' t even have the courtesy to call me and let me know what was going on .
negative	well thanks for your blatant incompetence !
negative	you might be a slacker but i ' m not , another day thats going to be wasted !
negative	00 / 00 / 00 - when i checked the tracker early this morning , i noticed that my phone wasn ' t actually anywhere , i had no_idea where it was .
negative	i repeatedly tried to contact the courier with no luck .
negative	eventually i got tired and gave o0 a call .
negative	all of a sudden the courier text me saying they would deliver between 00pm and 0pm .
negative	they did turn_up with my phone at 00 : 00 , it was a relief .
negative	although the courier was polite when she arrived , i found the whole experience very stressful and i hope to avoid this company in the future .
negative	i will be going to watchdog .
negative	on the upside , i love my new phone .
negative	i had a representative come round to my house saying the government are offering you a low monthly plan of £_00 . 00 a month at a fixed rate till 0000 and i asked will this go up he said no its fixed till 0000 so i thought this was a good offer as i was already paying £_00 . 00 for gas and £_00 . 00 electric a week , so i took this offer up in november_0000 , come june_0000 i had a letter from eon saying my monthly direct_debit was going up to £_000 . 00 a month from £_00 . 00 i was discuseted , as this was supposed to be a fixed rate till 0000 , im a single mother on benefits with a low income , thats why i took the offer up in the first place , ive already contacted watchdog at the bbc and going to the citezens advice please be aware do not be scammed by eons offers change providers i will never go back to eon again !
negative	trustpilot appears to have too much fake positive_reviews .
negative	i have read a company positive review here only to discover that their service was appalling .
negative	trustpilot don ' t vett positive_reviews but vet negative_reviews when companies contest them . there are simple checks they can put in place to minimise this , but my recent suggestion to them was clearly rejected from the reply i received .
negative	most forums are highly moderated but trustpilot appears not to be , except when a company report negative_reviews .
negative	it only show that people should read positive_reviews you see here with caution , and try to also read reviews posted in forums , blogs etc before subscribing to any services .
negative	according to them " trustpilot is the largest review portal in europe , supported by a passionate community of real people .
negative	trustpilot increases your sales by collecting , integrating and distributing real customer reviews of your company "
negative	how do you know they are real ?- as it is now , they are real only when they give positive_reviews and become unreal when they give negative_reviews .
negative	obviously trustpilot is out to make huge money by offering services to companies to boost their online reputation , by helping them accumulate unvetted positive_reviews . trustpilot may not stand the taste of time as evident from their own reviews .
negative	it might be worth asking uk watchdog to investigate trustpilot , to understand how they generate their funds .
negative	my experience is very unique and trustpilot has deceived me .
negative	unlimitedwebhosting . co . uk has threatened to take legal_action_against us if we write according to them " slanderous accusations " about them . we were amazed when we received the threat email " if you confirm to make slanderous accusations about us , due to your own ignorance , i will instruct our legal team to take action .
negative	", which suggest how desperate these people are , and also not willing to accept feedbacks / criticism from their customers .
negative	probably the reason_why they appears to have some positive_reviews around .
negative	infact .
negative	a company threatening their customers is enough not to use them . read on ...
negative	we have been with them for 0 months , and we have decided to exercise our consumer right to write about our experience with unlimiedwebhosting . co . uk . the aim is to share our experience with others who use web_hosting_companies .
negative	we noted that our wordpress sites always lost connection -; when you “ update ” a post you get “ internal server errors ”, when you click “ publish ” in wordpress you get the same error .
negative	when you spend say 0 mins in the site , browsing you get same problems .
negative	same applies to other scripts .
negative	they never accepted that their servers are have problems .
negative	infact when we continued to complain they said our sites / scripts were badly coded , which appears to suggest that wordpress script is badly coded !
negative	error messages from google webmaster tools were enormous , ranging_from “ outage ” " can ’ t access websites ” these are indicators of a website not connecting , down or slow . in one of our website we got this email .
negative	see image [_external link_removed_]
negative	site is [_external link_removed_]
negative	this is what they say in their website " our cloud platform enables us to deliver a totally unlimited reseller hosting_package with no limits or restrictions ."
negative	whereas this is big lie
negative	they say their uptime is 00 . 00_% . tell them to show you their statistic .
negative	our record showed that it was much less_than that with outage lasting up to 0hrs in some instance .
negative	see link [_external link_removed ].
negative	the average response time of their servers is nothing to write home about . again our record showed 0000ms , which is not acceptable by the majority of webhosting company . some webhost believes 000ms should be the min .
negative	again ask them for their response time for a site based in the uk .
negative	unlimitedwebhosting . co . uk reseller account may not be suitable for people who want to host multiple websites .
negative	we had one of our account - entire reseller disabled because they claim some domains within a cpanel / subscription overused resources ( clearly not an unlimited hosting as claimed ).
negative	the technical_support of the staff is a complete_joke .
negative	and not acceptable .
negative	majority of our technical problems were never resolved .
negative	they closed tickets automatically within few_days .
negative	it is normal that websites can exceed resources at times , but the standard which is obtainable in the industry is to disable the cpanel or subscription where the domain ( s ) that exceeds resources resides .
negative	unlimitedwebhosting . co . uk will suspend your entire reseller account and begin to play around . for someone who resells , it means your business with be adversely affected .
negative	in one instance we were told that we have to move to a dedicated_server which we obliged .
negative	after a week in our new " dedicated_server " we requested for login_details and root access . we were told that “ we do not grant root access and login_details in our managed dedicated servers ” which clearly suggest that they lied and we weren ’ t given a dedicated_server in the first place .
negative	we finally forfeited our reseller account with over 00 domains to unlimitedwebhosting . co . uk .
negative	for a company that tell lies in their website -: 00 . 00_% uptime , " our cloud platform enables us to deliver a totally unlimited reseller hosting_package with no limits or restrictions ."
negative	unwilling to accept feedbacks to help them improve , i will not recommend this company to anyone . they might be good for people who just want to host one site and not too worried_about monitoring their website performance .
negative	trustpilot - we will supply any information you request .
negative	this is a customer review
negative	for over a month , i have a horribly slow sometimes disconnecting internet_connection .
negative	i ' ve called customer_service three times and every time they promise me they are working on it .
negative	i had to buy bt wifi access for 0 quid a day for the last 0 weeks , because they can ' t even tell me when the fix will be available !
negative	in the meantime i continue paying my monthly_bill .
negative	for what ??
negative	how can a fix take a month ??
negative	as soon as my contract_ends , i leave three to never come back and tell this to all my friends !
negative	havent got anything , will be getting a refund asap
negative	item was out of stock once i had paid for it .
negative	failed to turn_up before_christmas
negative	i purchased products on next_day delivery - paying a premium to be delivered to a business address .
negative	the first " attempted delivery " according to yodels tracking was 0pm ?!?
negative	the following_day .
negative	this is stupid enough but it claims a card was left .
negative	no card was left .
negative	i checked the cctv , there was no attempted delivery .
negative	first lie from the driver .
negative	yodel confirmed that the driver had not been in the area .
negative	the next_day , i ring up express my displeasure .
negative	i was to receive a call from manchester depot that morning .
negative	no call .
negative	second lie .
negative	i call back to find out what is going on .
negative	i am told , that they will message the driver , the parcel is on a van and i will have it before 0 : 00 that day .
negative	third lie .
negative	there was no attempted delivery that die .
negative	day 0 - i ring up .
negative	staff tell me that are in contact with driver , he is aware that its to be with me that day asap to hit 0pm deadline ( for a secret santa ).
negative	delivery was attempted at 0pm that night !!!!
negative	what do they not understand !.
negative	a card was supposedly left - it wasn ' t .
negative	i will check cctv , i am 00_% confident that no delivery was attempted .
negative	yodel are a joke .
negative	twice booked a hotel in oxford and got a booking reference e_- mailed .
negative	twice , a few hours_later , the booking was cancelled by alpharooms .
negative	no explanation .
negative	you can ' t do business like this .
negative	also the rooms went up in price the second time of trying to book .
negative	waited in all day .
negative	then saw note .
negative	they couldn ' t be bothered to call .
negative	quicker to leave a note at residential addresses so drivers can get their round done in time .
negative	0000 numbers won ' t let you speak to a human .
negative	had to call a collection number and tap in a false account number ( obviously not recognised ) so system would transfer me to a human .
negative	couldn ' t deliver parcel that day .
negative	they could deliver the next_day and leave in a safe_place .
negative	i said front doorstep will be fine ( secluded house ) they said they couldn ' t do that .
negative	i would have collectd in my town ( northampton ) but to save cash they are located in rushden so nowhere_near the main population of the county .
negative	bought a graphics_card from them , about £_000 at the time .
negative	had no issues with purchase and delivery and was pleased with the company at the time but when the card developed a fault after about a year ( 0 year_warranty ) so i had to post back , at my expense with no offer or refund there , and the replacement time was 0 weeks with zero word from them during .
negative	i find zero communications really bad for such a long repair / replacement time .
negative	when i phoned up 0 weeks in i was told a replacement was sent out same day so waited a week only to learn i was lied to .
negative	disgusting for a company to lie to it ' s customers !
negative	the replacement card was faulty , failed under load which seemed to be a known fault from looking on random forums ( amd 0000 ).
negative	fair_enough , this sort of thing happens but i ' ve been told that i should expect it to be 00 days due to time of year .
negative	not ' up to ' 00 days but the full 00 days .
negative	i am so appalled about this companies after service i will not purchase from them again and i recommend the members in my gaming clan to do the same .
negative	i book a hostel with them , went to the property , paid cash , and everything went well .
negative	then i found out that the property , who i never gave my credit_card_details had charged it again .
negative	since i never gave them my card_details , only hostelbookers could have done it -- even_though they supposedly make the booking by paying the 00_% and not the credit_card .
negative	i contact their customer care to find out , and they totally ignored me .
negative	they didn ' t even bother to reply my messages .
negative	so did the hostel .
negative	in the end i could only get my money back through my bank in a long and painful process , since hostelbookers failed to provide any of the documents the visa company requested :-(.
negative	i never had a worse experience with a booking system !
negative	i sent my parcel via their service , there was a problem with my parcel and it got kept in the custom .
negative	they made no effort in updating me whatsoever , i tried to ring them many_times , emailed them , every time they just respond to me with a generic answer .
negative	they were very rude and not helpful at all .
negative	in the end it took them 0 months to get my parcel back , and i had to pay 00 pounds extra for it to be returned to me .
negative	absolutely outrageous !
negative	as soon as they take your money , they just won ' t care any more .
negative	please do not use their service if you don ' t want to get ripped_off !
negative	took months to get a reply back after having a pair of gazelle og trainers fail after 0 hours of use .
negative	support_team where unhelpful and not interested in listening to the problems i encountered .
negative	i won ' t buy anything adidas again after this , they don ' t seem to be bothered about losing long_term loyal_customers !
negative	customer_service is non - existent !
negative	had a pair of adidas gazelle trainers that tore on the inside of the heel after a few hours use , after returning them i was told it was not a manufacturing_fault and they would not replace them .
negative	going to contact trading_standards and see what can be done about it .
negative	i would advise nobody to use scotts or jd sports .
negative	it took two months to finally get a refund emailing them everyday !!!
negative	!
negative	customer_service is non - existent !

negative	had a few letters go missing in the post this year , they offer no compensation for missing items apart_from some stamps !
negative	so my stuff can go missing in the post again huh_?
negative	i placed an order and was told it would take 00days to be delivered .
negative	it is now late so i went on live_chat to find out were it was as the dhl_tracking site has not been updated since it was ordered .
negative	the women i spoke to ' cat woman chloe ' was as unprofessional as her name .
negative	she basically argued with me that it is not late at all because it has arrived at customs in my country which is what the delivery day estimation is about .
negative	so according to her it takes 00 days to get it to customs then once its there they don ' t care what happens to your product if it gets to you or not .
negative	i assume happy people on this site are from america because uk orders .... pointless .
negative	after a few_years of getting my protein from this company i was very happy until i had a missing product .
negative	i had an attachment to my order saying it would be shipped when in stock .
negative	after a while i tried to contact the company to see when my product would come .
negative	after 0 emails to customer_services and 0 months on i am still_waiting on my product i paid for .
negative	thankfully it wasn ' t of high value but i will be sure to no_longer use this company encase something else is not in stock as you seem to get charged for the items but never receive them .
negative	shocking .
negative	they have only actually been in touch since this review ?
negative	y does it take a review like this to get a response from the company ?
negative	get in contact is all they have done also as they informed me they were resolving the issue by sending me my products , however after waiting 0 weeks for an order which should as informed by them take no_longer_than 0 - 0 days i realise it was a lie to shut me up .
negative	i have again contacted them but as usual there is no response !
negative	!
negative	why not to buy from cpw
negative	i am interested in learning more about the 00 days refund / return_policy with cpw and what the implications are of a forced repair service .
negative	also interested in how / why cpw complaints staff put themselves forward as legal professionals offering biased legal_advice and opinions on behalf of cpw .
negative	as far as i know the supply of goods_act ensures a manufacturer ' s warranty and the sales of goods_act gives use time to accept goods of satisfactory quality .
negative	when purchasing a brand_new phone , things such as durability cannot possibly be tested and if a touch screen becomes unresponsive in under 0 months of initial purchase it is up to cpw to prove it was not faulty from point of sale .
negative	does any act or law give cpw the legal right to change what i thought was six_years ( reasonable time ) to 00 days ?
negative	does cpw have the legal right to prove faults on a phone did not exist from point of sales because the customer did not ring every day to report the problem with in the first 00 days ?
negative	do cpw have the right to unbox , activate and flick through menus ( demonstration ) at point of purchase with no consent from buyer ( may want to leave it boxed )?
negative	situation is being sold a phone in just over four_months_ago that did have a laggy screen but not wanting to be a " naggy " customer - put up with it and eventually saw the screen deteriorate over time and become unresponsive .
negative	when going to the store i was told i have to accept a loan phone ( shared by most of uk ) which was not even a smart device ( no email / apps ) - both unhygienic and inconvenient for me .
negative	this was insisted upon but i refused .
negative	i expected to be offered a replacement instead but this did not happen .
negative	i would have been happy with a 000_% clean smartphone loan phone but this was refused .
negative	when calling complaints , the advisor i spoke to told me he was the head trainer for consumer_law in the department .
negative	he spent 00_mins telling_me how he could offer refund / replacement if he wanted but did not want to .
negative	instead he advised me to check a ' which website ' to revise my consumer_rights .
negative	advised i have no legal right to " not accept " or " reject " the goods based on the fault as the warranty superseded my statuary rights .
negative	after giving up on trying to communicate the inconvenience to cpw i unfortunately decided to write up a letter of rejection ( after about 0 phone_calls & 0 store visits ) asking for a full_refund ( as_opposed to a better loan phone or replacement ) which will be with cpw soon .
negative	quite a horrible experience but now waiting to hear back from them .
negative	if you have struggled to get a replacement / refund in the first six_months of purchase , it would be interesting to know how cpw dealt_with the fault .
negative	it seems like cpw profit from insisting on using manufacturer warranties as_opposed to using the contract entered ( soga ) then forcing customers into repairs , not having to replace or refund the item or even offering it as an option past the first 00 days .
negative	other_retailers have not ever done this and surely buying a phone off cpw must be a negative / counter - productive task .
negative	i would love to recommend simplygames as their prices are extremely good and they appear to run a very tight ship but this simply isn ' t the case .
negative	after receiving my product code to be activated on origin i was surprised to find it didn ' t work , so i thought i ' d just send them an_email asking if they could maybe sort this out for me .
negative	that was over a week_ago , they haven ' t got back to me , what they did email to me however was this chance to submit a review about them .
negative	so yeah , thanks for stealing my £_00 simplygames .
negative	hi guys ,
negative	i had a beautiful engagement planned from end to end on her_birthday .
negative	since i had decided to go with diamondsfactory last_minute ( exactly 0 weeks_ago from delivery date ), i was hoping they would get it perfect .
negative	what i received makes me wonder about some of the reviews online .
negative	i got 0 . 00 carat excellent cut diamond on platinum setting .
negative	however , the ring was 0 sizes too big and the diamond had black smudges on its surface ( unreachable by towels ) because i tried .
negative	i hoped it was only my imagination and ran to the jewelers nearby .
negative	turns_out , it was as i feared too big and very unlikely to be a perfect fit .
negative	my fiance thankfully accepted the ring for the thought behind it and is against giving it back .
negative	i have managed to convince her that its only a week to resize and shine but hopefully she can have it before the weekend .
negative	i just thought i would share my ' wonderful ' experience as i am sending the ring back .
negative	i have contacted the customer_service and they have asked me to send a note along with ring .
negative	i will send updates as things progress .
negative	wish me luck
negative	a
negative	update - i received my ring today , 00th_april_0000 .
negative	its a ' vs0 g 0 . 00ct egl solitare ring ' right size .
negative	however one has to wonder about quality when the first ring was evaluated at a higher price ( more_than 000_pounds difference ) than the second even - though the quality was supposedly higher .
negative	also , its got a slight yellow tinge .
negative	the metal is also slightly scratched , almost worn , not the shine of a newly cast ring polished to good level .
negative	it must be a very special stock .
negative	' a truly wonderful experience ' it has not been .
negative	i am considering a visit to the premises to inquire on this further .
negative	i will not be recommending this place to anyone though .
negative	after all the calls and " its a beautiful piece " comments , i was expecting an amazing ring .
negative	i am still disappointed .
negative	found the link to their website through trivago listed at £_00 .
negative	the link let me click " book " and enter all my details .
negative	then_proceeded to tell me the room was gone ( twin was showing as 0 available and double had " green " availability ) and when i ran another search the room was available again , this time at £_000 .
negative	look on their facebook_page and many have had trouble with hotels not having the reservation or them taking money twice from their account .
negative	stay_away !
negative	bought 0 doors on 00st october which were delivered on 0th_november - 0 of which were fine .
negative	however , one door was damaged in transit on one corner and the same door was faulty on another corner with part of the door not glued up properly .
negative	door - deals are refusing to repair the damage or replace the door !!
negative	!
negative	placed an order with tekshop000 on 00th_jan_0000 - for sony htsa 0 . 0 home cinema kit £_000 . 00 .
negative	item then goes out of stock and awaiting new stock .
negative	get an_email late last_night that they are cancelling my oder as sony has increased the price to over £_000 .
negative	why the hell would they take an order in the first place when they dont have stock .
negative	i could have got it from another supplier for £_00 more .
negative	i ordered a product on december 00th .
negative	after not receiving it by early january , i contacted the company via e_- mail and they replied_saying it would be despatched that week .
negative	the following week , the order ' s status on their site was still " being prepared ".
negative	i e_- mailed again to find out what was going on and had no reply .
negative	i e_- mailed once more and , again , had no reply .
negative	luckily i had paid via_paypal so was able to open a dispute with them .
negative	my money was refunded in a couple of days and the company didn ' t argue against the dispute i had raised .
negative	however , there wasn ' t even a comment or e_- mail to apologise for the inconvenience .
negative	i wish i had checked out sites like this before i ' d made an order .
negative	looking at the recent reviews , i wouldn ' t have gone anywhere_near them if i ' d known beforehand .
negative	don ' t waste your time .
negative	fb is now going with marketing now
negative	bought a pair of glasses including date and time of ordering transaction date : 0000 - 00 - 00 00 : 00 : 00 , i was contacted twice for sending my id documentation , when i did after i recieved only 0 email_saying i should recieve my item within 00 to 00 days but now its months gone and havent recieved anything .... stay_away from these fraudesters and rippers , never recommended simply if they dont get back within 00_hrs than i will be contacting my bank and send chargeback ..
negative	i ordered a bunch of flowers on 00 march for mothers_day to be delivered on the 00th it is now tuesday 0st april and the flowers still have not been delivered .
negative	i have emailed customer support twice now but still not got a reply back .
negative	it is pointless getting the flowers delivered now as mothers_day as been and gone
negative	when in ny , for four_months tried to top up and every time calling 000 freenumber , got the same message " have not enough founds to connect my call ", for four_months calling the company to resolve this issue and nothing was ever done .
negative	the roaming rates are outrageous .
negative	i am_currently searching for another company to join .
negative	the worst experience of the service and money value !
negative	march 00th i have placed an order , same day delivery for march 00th , my mom ' s birthday , so i have chosen deluxe flower_arrangement , item called " gorgeous ", paid 00 £ at checkout .
negative	delivered bouquet was not at any closer look , then the one they advertise .
negative	it was a bunch of green with occasional tiny heads of a complete different flowers .
negative	also , the roses were not fresh and today all came off already .
negative	i did write to their company support email , because is the only florist company which does not provide a phone line , so if something_goes_wrong , like in my situation , the only you can relay on is their email , they don ' t even care to check , as this morning the only answer to my emails of complain i got was this survey , asking for satisfactory review and five_star rate .
negative	this company is not to trust .
negative	by the way , i managed to buy some extra flowers at the wild heart , at liberty ' s and coated me 00 £ - gorgeous huge flower_arrangement !

negative	disgusted with bt , over the passed 00 years we have had times when bt had to supply our telephone line and they have made our lives hell every since !
negative	00 years_ago i moved in with my partner who decided that we needed a telephone and internet access , we had everything plumbed in so to speak and off the line went no issues until we got a bill for over £_000 , it included a line fitting which we shouldn ' t have paid and telephone_calls to numbers that we had never_heard of ... bt would not back down that the numbers were nothing to do with us and we had to pay the bill which took over 0 years !!!
negative	to sort out , we then left bt ...... 0 years later we moved_into our current property , there was a telephone line here that bt stated was not in use , they came in and re - connected it ...
negative	it didn ' t work , they then said that there was not a line to the property and connected a new one giving us a new area code ( which we told them was not in our area ), this line did not work it was the wrong area code !!!
negative	omg suprise_suprise !
negative	they then came in a did loads of checks and told us that we had changed something in the house that had corrupted the line !!! what !!
negative	!, they proceeded to fix it and gave us another telephone_number , guess_what wrong area code !
negative	we had all the lines dissconnected as none of them were actually fed to our house ... ( my dad happens to be an ex bt manager and came round to look_into what the hell was going on ) we went 0 months without a phone line but this wasn ' t the issue ...
negative	i will_continue ....
negative	finally we managed to get them to connect to our local sub station giving us the correct area code , yay we had a phone line !
negative	after a month of using it the phone started to crackle and pop while we were on it , the internet was intermittent and to be honest it wasnt worth us having it , then we started getting bills for the dissconnected numbers and charges for call outs and dissconnection charges ... of course i went up the wall at them and everytime i phoned i got the line ' we are sorry for inconvenience_caused ' you guessed it foreign call_centres !
negative	they didnt have a clue why i was complaining , they couldn ' t sort out the bills and worse of all couldn ' t sort out the line issues as there wasn ' t one apparantly this went on for a whole year until our contract finally expired and we were able to change supplier .
negative	as soon as we changed we got another bill telling us we had cancelled our contract early and owed a total of over £_000 to bt for usage and dissconnection ..... we still have the original working number and all the paperwork to prove against the bills we were being sent ... its now been 0 0 / 0 years and our phone line and internet are great with our current supplier ( not bt ) but bt are still trying to take us to court for money that they say is owed to them ...
negative	review closure .....
negative	complete incompetent staff from the call_centre to the engineers , they have no clue_what they are doing and pass the buck on to their customers !!!
negative	!
negative	never again will i use them for anything !
negative	as if it takes this long .
negative	and my customer has no evidence that i ' ve even tried to send it .
negative	i ' ve been in tears trying to explain that it ' s not my fault .
negative	except it is .
negative	i chose my hermes .
negative	i suck
negative	seriously poor service .
negative	p0g knew this was important and they charged over £_00 for next_day service .
negative	on tuesday .
negative	wasn ' t collected until thursday and now on monday , it ' s still not their .
negative	their customer_service staff have no clue .
negative	they are worse than useless - the entire company !
negative	teklite torch saga
negative	waited for over a month for the " in stock " item to arrive , after 0 month of waiting still no torch , hence to say i cancelled my order .
negative	0st expeirnce will be my last of this cowboy outfit , stick with divers_warehouse , kent diving or simply_scuba who will price_match any item on deep - poos website .
negative	plus you wont waste any of your time writing negative_reviews .
negative	headphones never came after more_than a month .
negative	emailed them 0 times in that month and recieved automated replies telling_me to wait longer .
negative	finally , after 0 weeks_later , they said they ' ll send me a returns / refund form for my missing order within 00_hours .
negative	a week_later and i still_haven ' t recieved this form !
negative	0 weeks in total wasted waiting and no headphones .
negative	the rest of the orders i ' ve made have taken longer_than a week or two to arrive .
negative	terrible service !
negative	use amazon !
negative	the quality of the materials they use is rather ... questionable .
negative	on one of the boots i bought , one of the hooks fell off after one day .
negative	the buttons on the jacket i bought also falls off easily , and i ' ve had to sow them back into place !
negative	despite this , i ' m not too disappointed , because indeed , ' quality costs more ' and boohoo . com is one of the many who reinforce this creed .
negative	i ' d hope they would have prove me wrong though .
negative	i purchased these glasses on the 00th_feb and guess_what ....
negative	still_haven ' t received them so i though i would send them an e_- mail to find out where my glasses were .
negative	they said that payment has never been sent and to re - sent the £_000 again !!!
negative	shocked !!
negative	lucky_enough i paid through paypal and have now opened a dispute .
negative	payment was sent and completed the day i placed the order .
negative	be very aware !!!
negative	scam !!!
negative	!
negative	" enormously disappointing .
negative	i placed a considerable order with digitalrev , paying through paypal .
negative	the next_day i received an_email " confirming ' that my order had " successfully " been cancelled .
negative	no explanation was given so i checked the website and saw again that it had simply been cancelled .
negative	i thought i must have cancelled it in error by clicking the wrong link so placed the order again , again paying through paypal .
negative	the order was confirmed but then half an_hour later i received a second email telling_me that my order had been cancelled .
negative	again there was no explanation .
negative	this time i found a contact number and called customer_services who told me it had been cancelled because they had been unable to link me to my address .
negative	they needed me to send them various forms of id etc and then if i passed their checks i would be able to place another order .
negative	now , i don ' t mind them conducting security_checks at all ; i think that ' s a good thing and in everybody ' s interest but i do mind very much their cavalier attitude_towards my custom as well as my time and energy .
negative	if they need more information , is it too much to expect that they would contact me and ask for it instead of just cancelling my order with no explanation ?
negative	i order a huge number of products online both from the uk and overseas and have never encountered this before .
negative	i was paying through paypal and both billing and shipping addresses are paypal verified and have been used on numerous_occasions .
negative	as i say , it is not the security_checks that bother me , it is their extraordinarily dismissive attitude_towards someone who is simply trying to buy their products ."
negative	ordered some 0 x 0 prints and received prints which are 0 . 0 x 0 .
negative	i realise the aspect ratio of digital prints these days is different to traditional negatives , but photoworld do not even offer the digital aspect ratio in small prints .
negative	and neither do they crop into the pictures to provide a 0 x 0 print .
negative	all other photo priting companies i have used do both of these things .
negative	surely you can ' t offer prints of a certain size and then send ones of a different size .
negative	the photos i have been left with do not fit in a standard 0 x 0 photo frame and so are mostly useless to me .
negative	plus , i found the website awful .
negative	spent_ages uploading photos to an album and when i clicked on ' order prints ' it wanted to me to upload them again .
negative	in the end it took 0 different computers and downloading a plugin before i could actually order anything at all .
negative	needless to say , my patience was wearing pretty thin at this point .
negative	compared to the likes of photobox or snapfish , who also send out their products pdq , photoworld is a poor alternative and i won ' t be going near them again .
negative	00 days to deliver 0 product due to a " new system "?
negative	jokers !
negative	no wonder mp are getting a bad rep
negative	hi i booked 0 parcels through parcel0go never arrived to collect the parcels i contacted parcel0go on their website because they dont have customer_service no .
negative	they said cant do anything never ever use parcel0go
negative	i order three bras from this company , had my bank card debited for all three , yet only two arrived and a note saying the other one was out of stock .
negative	yet no refund or replacement .
negative	i also previously placed an order , had the money taken from my account , and then received an_email_saying none of the goods were in stock despite already taking the money .
negative	one word .... charlatan ' s .
negative	after being a loyal_customer for many years spending thousands of pounds , i will never ever buy anything from them again .
negative	i ordered a macbook from them and paid extra to get it delivered on a saturday as i work full time 0 - 0 through the week .
negative	waited in all day on the saturday ..... no macbook .
negative	my bank_account however had been debited with £ 0000 however they claim the macbook has been lost in between their warehouse and the courier firm .... not my fault !!
negative	but allegedly until they have investigated i can ' t get my money back despite it being lost hundreds of miles_away .
negative	am_disgusted and furious !
negative	do not use this website .
negative	they have taken a lot of peoples money and do not send you any keys .
negative	they never reply to any support chat or support emails .
negative	they are a fraud and are stealing peoples money .
negative	stay_away !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	if i could choose 0_stars i would !!
negative	! i phoned to query why my bill had been so high the last few_months and it transcribed that i had " subscribed " to traffic tv .
negative	i explained i had never subscribed to this and his response " some one must have done this for you or you must have subscribed accidentally ."
negative	this is the second time i have had awful service and i will not be returning .
negative	apparently the customer is not right at all here and the management is beyond poor and could not have sounded more disinterested if she tried .
negative	absolutely awful , i am looking into cancelling my broadband , home phone and have cancelled my mobile contract .
negative	do not go with orange !
negative	!
negative	ordered 0no .
negative	0 phase mcb ' s from the website , received the confirmation_email and the money left my account all £_000 of it .
negative	i went to the website to chase up the order and find out that they have ceased trading .
negative	thanks for ripping me off !!!!
negative	!
negative	i was informed by the person who i bought the flowers for that they were damaged and in a poor condition when they arrived .
negative	i left a 0 star_review for nigel_o ' hara after my awful experience shopping ( if that ' s what i can call it ) with them .
negative	it was taken down within hours by the company for no proof of purchase .
negative	i have noticed that there are now several reviews that have been taken down for the same reason , funnily_enough , none of the fake 0 star reviews have been taken down .
negative	i replied to you the next_day with a pdf of my order confirmation and a week and a bit later my review is still not live and i have heard_nothing from you .
negative	i have also contacted your support email address about a rather concerning matter regarding fake_reviews being added to your site for this company because nigel_o ' hara were running competitions on their facebook_page whereby the only way to enter was to leave a positive review on your site .
negative	i am not sure this practise is even legal !?
negative	but once again , i have heard_nothing from you .
negative	what else am i supposed to do to get in contact with you ?
negative	very disappointed in the customer_service i have received from yourselves !
negative	i ordered a watch for my wife ' s birthday .
negative	it stated on their website , delivery within 0 - 0 days which wasn ' t a problem .
negative	however , i didn ' t expect 0 months later to still not have received my item .
negative	i had to contact them on a weekly_basis as they never contacted me bar 0 phone_calls basically telling_me that they were still_waiting for the item from their supplier .
negative	every week i had the same message back " we apologise for the delay , we expect the item to be with you by next week ".
negative	that happened for just over two and a half months !!
negative	what shocked me the most is that i arranged them to contact me regarding my order about a month and a half after_placing it and he just repeated what was in the emails they were sending .
negative	i asked what was causing the delay and they told me that they couldn ' t tell me , i then asked if they had been in contact with the supplier and the gentleman ' s response was " no , we don ' t normally do that with slight delays ".
negative	so not only had they given me the same copy and paste response each week , they hadn ' t even chased the item with the supplier and had the audacity to say that a month and a half was a slight_delay .
negative	they offered me , actually , no they didn ' t ... i asked for a small discount as a way of an_apology and they asked me if i wanted to change my order to another item .
negative	due to the massive two and a half month wait and the disgusting customer_service , i decided to change my order to a different watch .
negative	low and behold , they didn ' t have this one in stock either , i waited a couple of weeks and had no contact from nigel_o ' hara , not even an_email to let me know they had placed a new order for me .
negative	by this point , i had had enough and cancelled my order .
negative	during this entire time , they were still accepting orders on the watch i ordered which is what i find most disturbing .
negative	how can a company take orders for an item they evidentially don ' t have and obviously have no way of obtaining .
negative	even as i write this now , they are still taking orders on the watch and it ' s still out of stock !
negative	how many other people must be going through the same_thing as me ?
negative	so to round off , this is the worse shopping_experience i have ever had !
negative	i can ' t express how bad the customer_service was with just the same generic email being sent to me each week and not telling_me anything .
negative	i asked them several_times if they didn ' t think they were going to get the item in stock to let me know so i could cancel the order and order elsewhere , but each week they promised me it would be with me the following week .
negative	a terrible terrible company and i would stay as far away from them as possible !
negative	just to add , it ' s been 0 weeks since them promising my refund within 00_hours and i have still not received it even after contacting them .
negative	ordered a washing_machine 0 weeks_ago !
negative	it still has not arrived !
negative	i have been constantly fobbed_off by the sales staff !
negative	to top the whole ordeal off they tryed to deliver the washing_machine on thursday but forgot to put it on the delivery van !
negative	actually turned_up at the house without the washing_machine !
negative	i am now 00 weeks pregnant and have been without a washing_machine for 0 weeks because of this company !
negative	i wish i had gone to john_lewis who all actually stock the same washing but £_00 cheaper !
negative	will i ever get this washer ?
negative	who_knows ?
negative	i bought a e_- cig manual battery for leicester granby st ecigwizard shop , the price was slightly_higher_than the online price , but that was least of my worries .
negative	the battery stopped holding a charge just after 0 weeks .
negative	staff was terribly unfriendly , and instead of replacing the battery , as you get 0 months warranty , he tried to look for excuses .
negative	instead of arguing with him , i left the shop and saved my day .
negative	the e_- liquid does not have same intensity of flavour , but it is still better_than other_retailers , however when it comes to hardware of e_- cig , don ' t trust the ecigwizard .
negative	i placed an order on 00st november which i thought would be plenty of time for christmas .
negative	nothing turned_up after 0 weeks so i emailed them .
negative	they replied to my first email and said the order had been dispatched and was probably delayed .
negative	gave them the benefit of the doubt and left it another week .
negative	still nothing arrived so i emailed them again ( no contact number available and the live_chat doesn ' t work ).
negative	after a few more days they hadn ' t replied so i raised a dispute through paypal .
negative	they put a reply on the paypal_dispute pretty quickly but it was quite rude , no apology just the standard ' this has been dispatched , we will investigate , we still give you the chance to cancel this dispute etc etc '.
negative	they contacted me again today through paypal saying ' please confirm you have received the goods ' - sorry , all i can confirm is that i ' ve paid £_00 for absolutely nothing !
negative	don ' t order from these people !
negative	!
negative	the ordering_process was very unclear since the website states they have stock and the managers in the company are unaware of stock_levels saying that they did not have it in stock at the time of purchase , but they had stock now so i would need to reorder again , he was unaware of how to cancel and order or even send anything out .
negative	i wasted time , money and energy with this site for a pair of boots that cost over £_000 .
negative	i would rather go to another company or better still buy something else .
negative	the service is completely unhelpful , rude and incompetent .
negative	would not shop here again nor recommend to anyone .
negative	my order was not processsed for a week , when i queried this the customer suport rep told me " oh i will need to check with the warehouse , i don ' t think they got the email "
negative	when the order was eventually dispatched it was incomplete , no one informed me that i would not receive two items .
negative	shoddy website , shoddy service , i will never use them again .
negative	vial !
negative	i went to eat my last piece of pizza and i looked and what i thought was a piece of cheese , but when pulling it i found a full hair going through under the cheese into the whole pizza which could not be one of my own due to father cooking it !
negative	feel utterly sick !!!
negative	!
negative	thy are just a fraud company .
negative	be - careful .
negative	don ' t trust them .
negative	they will take your money and will not answer you .
negative	as i said in my review , i did exactly_what said in your instructions and i suposed that you paid royal_mail for a special delivery and they should know that is a mobile phone and you already know that i ' ll sent you a expensive mobile phone and now i have instead a brand_new galaxy_s0 a broken galaxy_s0 , thank_you very much .
negative	and i ' m waiting for the informations to fill the complain formulary ...
negative	the website does not show the true condition of the watch ; i order an omega constellation from watch finders , it was far from the 00 / 00 quality they promised .
negative	they issued me a refund a week_later with a cheque that took another week to clear and to make it up they said we will offer you free postage when you order again !
negative	i ordered another watch , it was small in size ; obviously links were missing - they did not charge me for postage initially , but when returned for refund , they charged me for postage !
negative	un fair , miss - informed and above all xxx !
negative	you cannot charge for something when you have agreed initially that its for free !
negative	they said they will send a cheque to make up for the postage cost - its been months now and i don ' t think i should expect anything !
negative	not only did they lose my suitcase , but even with a luggage receipt they could not tell me where my suitcase was or when i was likely to get it back .
negative	i explained i was only in st tropez for 0 days and that i had no clothing / toiletries with me .
negative	my suitcase arrived the next_day and i received a call saying i would have to pick it up from nice airport - st tropez is 0 hrs from there .
negative	nearly all other airlines will deliver your case to you if they lose it but not jet 0 .
negative	so it was up to me to make a return trip and lose a full day of my holiday .
negative	in addition i was not compensated for the cost of this trip .
negative	when i arrived at the airport i found my suitcase was damaged and is no_longer usable - it was brand_new .
negative	i wrote a letter of complaint when i got home asking to be reimbursed for the expense and the response was ' no chance '!
negative	i would never fly with them again and i would strongly_recommend avoiding this airline at all costs .
negative	ordered for the first time a few_months_ago from my local_store ( torquay ), and the driver forgot to bring up half of my shopping to the door , and just drove off !
negative	needless to say that a few items were badly_damaged and dates were terrible ... so i rang up my local_store and one of the girls were extremely rude , i ordered to speak to the store manager and he ordered the forgot shopping back to my house and also gave me a full_refund .
negative	so a few_months later ( last_week ) i decided to give them another try , the delivery came yesterday and once again 0 items were severely damaged , including cracked eggs and squashed pastries .
negative	the mere fact that they also give you reduced items is rediculous as well , dates were also terrible and required me to eat everything within 0 - 0 days lol !
negative	so i rang customer_service , the man was very helpful , and refunded me half my shop .
negative	this shouldn ' t be happening , regardless of the refunds given , they are ruining their brilliant reputation they have instore .
negative	i normally cannot_afford to shop here and usually shop at asda or sburys , but i like to try waitrose food now and again so i ' m willing to spend the money .
negative	each of the times i have changed to ordering from waitrose , it ' s been a dreadful experience .
negative	so stay clear , the previous reviews don ' t lie as well .
negative	i ordered waited 0 hour 00_mins .
negative	then phoned the pizza shop direct they said they had no record despite a confirmation e_- mail .
negative	i would suggest that you try deliverance . co . uk much more reliable .
negative	total scam !!!
negative	did not deliver my flowers for mothers_day .
negative	when i emailed to complain they sent me one email_saying they thought they had been delivered and then they ignored every subsequest email .
negative	in the end i had to request a chargeback from my credit_card company to get my money back .
negative	do not use them you will be disappointed and out of pocket !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i took out a phone contract via carphone_warehouse , when i received the phone i was told i could cancel the phone insurance , which i did .
negative	0 months later i check my bank_account ... 0 transactions showed up , each from the carphone_warehouse .
negative	i called them to ask for a refund .
negative	0st agent told me i never cancelled it ( despite me having received a confirmation letter confirming my cancellation )
negative	0nd agent was more helpful , he apologises for the mix_up , and offers to refund the money .
negative	whilst im on the phone he told me the refund is sent , will take upto 0 days .
negative	checked my bank_account 0 days_later no refund !
negative	lying robbing scum !
negative	so , i had 0 tyres_fitted to my 0x0 , the remaining 0 tyres were to be balanced - although the driver quite rudely disputed this at first until he re - read his work sheet and decided that i was right .
negative	the two new tyres were inflated to 00psi , 00psi more_than the car manufactures recommendation .
negative	i didnt find this out until a week_later as at the time i asked if he needed to see the handbook for the correct pressures he said " no " and that he knew what they should be .
negative	a classic case of putting your ego first i think !
negative	theres no shame in not memorising recommended tyre pressures for every car in the world right ...?
negative	a few_months later i order 0 more tyres as the fronts now need doing .
negative	on some 0x0s you need to match brands front and rear so that the central viscous differential is balanced , particularly at high speeds .
negative	the tyres have since dissapeared from the grippy website !
negative	so i phone them up and enquire .
negative	im told that the tyres are now available but they forgot to make them appear on the site !
negative	back i go to the site and now book 0 more tyres to match the ones previously fitted on the vehicle .
negative	done !
negative	that is until i get a phone call saying that they cant now get hold of the tyres .
negative	so they do have the tyres , then they dont have the tyres , then they do have them again , then actually they dont have them !
negative	so ive already booked and paid for these tyres which dont exist .
negative	im offered an_alternative and assured they will be a suitable match to the new tyres purchased previously .
negative	only problem is they dont seem to know what it is they are giving me .
negative	" its either one of these or one of those " im told - being two different rated tyres .
negative	as they dont know what they are giving me they at_least have the decency to charge me only for the cheapest of the two alternatives .
negative	on the day of fitting i arrange to leave work early to arrive home for the 0pm to 0pm fitting window .
negative	at 0 . 00 im phoned and told the driver is over 0 hours away , driving from dover ( to hampshire ) and that actually they are going to cancel my fitting !
negative	ok i think , come around first thing in the morn and that will be fine , we cant help bad traffic can we ...
negative	im then told my fitting cannot be done tomorrow and the next available slot is on saturday , 0 days_later !
negative	this is just plainly poor customer focus in the business .
negative	if something_goes_wrong you sort it as soon as possible .
negative	you dont put customers back to the end of the queue because you failed to deliver first time around .
negative	i need these new tyres on now so i can put some motorway miles on the car without damaging the vcu ( differential ).
negative	im told by grippy that there is " nothing that they can do " which is the most useless , bailout of a phrase .
negative	of course there is something you can do , but you are chosing the option that is most simple for your business .
negative	if you are in the supermarket and the till breaks , once they fix it they dont send you to the back of the queue , you serve them as soon as possible .
negative	i cancelled my order and requested a refund which apparently takes 0 days !
negative	i then thought about it and if the driver was 0 hours late , for a 0 hour journey , he must have left his last job halfway into my time_slot .
negative	traffic or not he was never going to get to me on time .
negative	be warned it seems grippy are over inflating themselves and booking more slots than time in the day !
negative	read the other reviews on this site and it seems im not alone .
negative	before you buy from grippy ask yourself the question " once ive bought these tyres and arranged time off work - will i mind when they dont turn_up and offer me a slot 0 days_later so i can do it all again ?".
negative	then go to your local tyre shop .
negative	im going to have to do what i should have all along , drive to a local tyre shop , pay a few_quid more_than grippy for the tyres that i want , fitted in front of my eyes , done !
negative	rude mechanics who dont know their stuff , a flaky supply chain where stock is checked after an order has been placed and paid for , staff and business policy that have a " cant do " attitude .
negative	surprised ?
negative	well you get what you pay for dont you ?
negative	in short , terrible network_coverage , terrible pushy rude and sometimes unintelligable customer_service from call_centre and nearly impossible to get unlock code and pac codes from .
negative	thanks 0 - i have been without a mobile for a week !!!
negative	!
negative	great company when things are going well however my flowers were delivered 0 days late .
negative	i have received no useful responses from the customer_service team after i notified them ( not the other way around !)
negative	and they have taken 0 days to reply to my most_recent email .
negative	they promised to redeliver immediately and even the replacement flowers were later than promised .
negative	i can ' t understand_why i have received such little communication ( each time from a different person who doesn ' t answer the points raised in my message ) when surely the worst error a flower delivery company can make is delivering flowers nearly a week late ?
negative	yes they are cheap , but you get what you pay for !
negative	expedia owe me a refund on an airport transfer that didn ' t show up .
negative	they have agreed to the refund but just aren ' t paying back the money .
negative	every time i contact them i don ' t get an answer as to where the refund is and get told they ' ll contact me but never do .
negative	it ' s even been flagged as a complaint but still no - one is actually actioning the refund .
negative	it ' s been a month since they agreed to refund me , but seem to have no_intention of doing so .
negative	i certainly wont be using them again ... and it turns_out ebookers is much cheaper anyway .
negative	much like others experiences , i sent an iphone_0s and it was reduced due to supposed water_damage .
negative	the phone was in perfect working condition .
negative	something seems to have changed about this company .
negative	i definitely will not use them again .
negative	it does not take 0 working_days to do a bank_transfer .
negative	it doesn ' t take that long to banka cheque !
negative	the maximum it should be is 0 days .
negative	after all the ads on tv and saying it was best supermarket blahblah thought id try out aldi paisley ( fulbar road ) scotland for the family shop .
negative	going round the products are good , good range of choices for a cheaper supermaket , even a few brand_names .
negative	however , get to the checkout and lets say service with a smile isnt their thing .
negative	woman sat like a robot , didnt offer to help even_though struggling with a toddler .
negative	was sighing as things started to pile up at one side .
negative	i hadnt even finished paying and she was scanning the next persons products .
negative	she was on to the next after that before i had my bags up .
negative	and just so you know i wasnt going like a wee old lady , i was actually getting things together pretty fast .
negative	i will not be shopping here again , ever .
negative	if people worked like that in any other supermarket they ' d be sacked .
negative	horrible dire faced woman .
negative	now off to check sellby dates on stuff after_reading reviews .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	when things go right with paypal its pretty good , as soon as it goes_wrong though you find that all paypals promises are just lies and loads of extra terms kick in to protect them and make them even more money but give you no protection at all .
negative	wouldnt touch these with a barge_pole unless it is the only way you could pay for an item , id recommend using a credit_card though so you can do a chargeback if you get ripped_off from a seller of an item .
negative	so i ' ve just sold my ticket , i ' ve clicked the link to accept it and everything is telling_me i need to post with ups .
negative	i ' m confused as to how i even do this n the fact i don ' t get the money until after the buyer had confirmed they have received it .
negative	what if the address doesn ' t even exist or they say they haven ' t received it , because the address seems a bit wierd to me .
negative	the concerts in manchester n they are in london , at a business .
negative	can someone who has sold on viagogo re - assure me that i will get the money and i ' m fine to sell the ticket ?
negative	still no one has replied !
negative	professional landlord : 0 weeks and still_waiting for the money .
negative	also they do not reply to our mails .
negative	very bad .
negative	we are refusing all bookings from wimdu now !
negative	sender put wrong_address then he told them right address . p0g then didn ' t in form city_link about changes of address their forth my son missed his main birthday_present . item sent out on the 0 / 0 / 00 and still not got it by today which is 00 / 000 crap service don ' t use them ........................
negative	i placed an order 0 or 0 of days ago , i get my voucher_code through , to find that the code does not work and is not for the product listed on the website .
negative	i email the company and wowcher , to not hear_anything back bar an_automated email_saying they would get in touch ..." great ".
negative	i email wowcher again and still no reply .
negative	i would just like a full_refund now as i just don ' t want anything to do with this now .
negative	no issues have been resolved .
negative	will not be using this company again .
negative	i bought a wowcher for a full head of human hair_extensions in march .
negative	i contacted the salon and arranged an_appointment for a consultation , which i attended .
negative	i arranged an_appointment for 0 weeks_later to have a full head of micro loop extensions fitted .
negative	on the day of the appointment i was 00_minutes late due to an accident on the motorway .
negative	thank_god !!!
negative	i was told i couldn ' t have my extensions fitted as i was so late and would have to rearrange .
negative	i was asked what sort of extensions i was having and when i said micro loops i was told they didn ' t do these anymore and i ' d have to either have them glued or sewn in .
negative	i don ' t want either of these methods due to the damage they do to your hair which is why i bought a deal for the micro loops .
negative	i contacted_wowcher for a refund 0 weeks_ago and the only response i have received is a copy of the email they sent to the salon 0 days_later .
negative	i contacted them again last_week to ask for some indication of when they issue might be resolved and i ' ve heard_nothing .
negative	i ' ve emailed them this morning with ' trust ' as the subject , but as yet i have no reply .
negative	i am really disappointed with the level of customer_service .
negative	after taking the money from my account immediately the glasses didn ' t turn_up for 0weeks after continuous emailing .
negative	they have now arrived , only to be the wrong_size and damaged .
negative	exhausting .
negative	there are other_companies out there which do wayfarers at a cheaper price .
negative	the most infuriating thing is that there is no direct contact number .
negative	they are definitely crooks and should not be allowed to operate .
negative	zzzzzzzzzzz zzz
negative	i had the services installed and they were fine , however plusnet then had issues and they had a message about it on the phone , they came to check the line and said that they had found an old master socket under the carpets and they need to access that , however we said that wont be possible unless they want to pay the damages , which they said they wont do , they did not want to even send another router to check if that was the problem , however the connection was on fibre and dropped out so many_times that i was unable to use the net , so i went to orange ,
negative	i signed_up online with carphone_warehouse to tell me when the samsung_s0 would be avaliable for pre order , they called me to tell me and offered me a deal , however the services was poor , the sale man that was talking to me had no_idea what he was selling as i could hear his manager in the background telling him what to say , they then offered me a deal and did a credit check which they said was accepeted and i then paid the £_000 for the phone with the £_000 cash back deal ,
negative	however they took my email and said i would get a confirmation which diid not happen , so i called the sales_team at carphone_warehouse who asked me for the details and said everything was fine and the phone would be with me on the 00 . 0 . 0000 .
negative	so i spoke to ee as i have pre ordered with them too online and canceled as i had the better deal with carphone_warehouse , however the ee person said there was nothing on the system from carphone_warehouse saying that my order had been placed and advised me to speak to them just to check .
negative	so i called them up and could not get through when i did the women hung_up on me , so i called again and waited for 00_minutes with no luck , anyways today i called them and managed to speak to someone who was not in the uk call_center ,
negative	they took my details and told me that the order had not been processed and they will do it again but can see that i have paid the £_000 for the phone , she then said that to put the order through she needs to do another credit check , bearing in mind this had already been done and it had all gone_through , she asked me for the phone number and could not get the number right , so i spoke to the manager who again was useless and did not call me back .
negative	so they have told me an order has been made and taken the money from my account and no order .... the reason was given that they were having issues with the system and the checks were not being made , surely you wont take a payment form us if the credit check was not accepted ?
negative	please be advised avoid them at all cost , i now need to get my money back ,
negative	they lost my order , i have wasted time going to the store several_times , only to be told by a member of staff they didn ' t receive anything - and that they don ' t know about delivery to stores at all .
negative	the online support was not very helpful so far .
negative	i am taking my business elsewhere
negative	edit_: - now they lie that i have collected the order .
negative	i haven ' t .
negative	worst customer_service ever - imagine this was your £_000 photobook .
negative	better claim on credit_card straight_away
negative	when you arrive on time or within about ten_minutes ryanair play this awful fanfare ... talk about blowing your own trumpet .
negative	i guess you get what you pay for !
negative	that ' s why i ' ve since flown with easyjet or monarch !
negative	despite allowing any resolution images to be loaded that look brilliant on the screen there is no quality_control at goodprint so my business_cards came to me blurry on one side and fab on the other !
negative	i even had a comment from goodprint twitter saying my design was fab surely at that point someone could have said ' hey the resolution isn ' t quite right are you sure you want to continue ?'
negative	when i contacted customer_service i was fed a line and not offered any support or encouragement to use the service again !
negative	- thank_you for your response goodprint , i was not advised on this offer at the time of my phonecall , had i been i would have felt a lot less let_down by your company .
negative	i have since had my cards printed elsewhere but i do appreciate the response .
negative	tried to order from vet medic and set_up an account .
negative	unfortunately i chose to pay by paypal which had an old email address associated with it , they took this to be my address which i think it a very flawed way to do business .
negative	thus i did not receive emails when they queried my order , amongst the problems ( generated by them ) was the fact that the image of my vet prescription did not upload .
negative	i definitely uploaded this when i ordered and inotice other people have had the same problem .
negative	despite this , they took the money from my account and made no further effort to contact me , even_though they could have worked out the email address they used did not match the email and account details i provided .
negative	i complained and when we go to the bottom of the misunderstanding i asked them for an_apology - told on the phone they had nothing to apologise for .
negative	i also found they were rude and defensive , everything was my fault rather_than theirs !
negative	i asked for a refund which they promptly processed .
negative	i will never order from vet - medic again , best avoided if you appreciate good customer_service and politeness when things go_wrong !
negative	just sat on hold for an_hour to be told that they could not give me any time scale of when my final_bill would be prepared even_though we left in december .
negative	i had asked last_week after half an_hour on hold and they said it would have been with me by tuesday .
negative	i then asked to make a formal_complaint about the wait on the phones , the misinformation and the fact that they are sitting on hundreds of pounds of my money and was put on hold for another ten_minutes to be told that i couldn ' t make a complaint because no - one was available and that they would phone me back within 00_hours .
negative	fuming with rage does not cover it .
negative	its as if a teenager is running this company out of his bedroom .
negative	a shambles .
negative	rubbish delivery , paid for a set delivery day .
negative	0 days after that day has passed still_waiting .
negative	have rung 0 times , each time , get told it will be delivered the next_day and nothing .
negative	they never return calls and and useless .
negative	disgusting unhelpful service .
negative	no flowers received despite the fact they claim it was delivered .
negative	thanks for making my moms mothers_day .
negative	not .
negative	really disappointed
negative	the company did not have any stock and only after i contacted them did they respond that that they did not have any idea when i would get the product .
negative	very slow to respond .
negative	very poor service .
negative	would avoid .
negative	interparcel failed to deliver our parcel to the spanish islands , and now want to charge us £_00 for the privilege !
negative	watch out for their small_print , which says they are allowed to charge for returns .
negative	they say the delivery address is " unregistered ", which sounds_like a poor_excuse to me - especially since they managed to deliver a slip to our customer saying the parcel had been returned .
negative	final moral of the story - always include a local recipient phone number on your parcel , that way the courier has less of an excuse .
negative	we ' ll certainly never use interparcel again !
negative	i had a few games pre_- ordered with gameseek in the build up to the launch of xbox one , most of which i had also pre_- paid for as is gameseek ' s way of doing things .
negative	i wasn ' t too fussed about this as the price was good and the games were due out in 0 weeks , so not too long a wait .
negative	however last_week i received an_email from them advising me that due to limited stock they would need me to pay in_advance for a game called quantum break for xbox one , or my pre_- order would be made available to other customers .
negative	now this is a game that currently has no release_date and might not come out for another 00 months or more , so i replied to the email explaining this and how i was unwilling to pay for a game so far in_advance .
negative	i heard_nothing back for a few_days until i checked my account today and found my pre_- order cancelled .
negative	so i checked my emails and have had a reply this afternoon that huffily informs me " not a problem .
negative	we ' ve cancelled your order ".
negative	it seems to me a ridiculous way to run a company , cancelling genuine pre_- orders from interested customers just because they won ' t pay for the goods potentially a year in_advance .
negative	poor .
negative	ordered a piece of furniture in october , which the website said was in stock .
negative	called hovells to check the website was correct and was told it was in stock .
negative	i ordered it and paid in full .
negative	i was then told a few_days_later that it wasnt in stock and would be in in a few_days .
negative	a few_days went by and i called again , and was told a few more weeks .
negative	this went on for a total of 00 weeks when it finally came into stock .
negative	after dozens and dozens of phone_calls to arrange delivery , none of which were actually answered , i gave in and collected it myself from the warehouse .
negative	i was then met by a complete jobsworth at the warehouse claiming he doesn ' t know what to do as the computers are down today .
negative	eventually he realised it was actually possible to leave his chair and go and look in the warehouse for my order .
negative	throughout the 00 week wait , no one ever contacted me to say there were delays or why , everything was left for me to contact them , which is fine in theory , however they almost never answer the phones , and when they do a clueless member of staff exclaims ' i dont know , i ' ll find out and ring you back ' which they subsequently never do .
negative	if you leave a message on voicemail , no one gets back to you .
negative	all in all , they have been the worst company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing_with , and certainly never will again .
negative	alright they are cheaper_than most places , but you can see why .
negative	its worth paying a little more to buy the stuff from a retailer who actually has a clue how to run a business .
negative	pay peanuts , you get monkeys !
negative	i ordered 0 mother ' s day bouquets .
negative	i spotted that the courier company ' s confirmation_email had the wrong_address the day before mother ' s day .
negative	i emailed to alert them to the problem .
negative	didn ' t hear_anything back so i rang up .
negative	spent 00_minutes on the phone to their indian_call_centre .
negative	the person i was speaking to just didn ' t understand that there were two roads in london with the same name and that they were delivering to the wrong one ( despite me putting the correct postcode in my original order ).
negative	i was promised ( i ) a callback that day and ( ii ) that the flowers would be delivered .
negative	surprise_surprise .
negative	no call back .
negative	no flowers delivered .
negative	just come off the phone with customer_services ( another 00 minute phone call ) whereby i was told the i would definitely get a call back today - i ' ve heard that one before !
negative	she apparently couldn ' t put me through to head_office ...
negative	so gave me a number to call .
negative	am sat here on hold , again , so i have lots of time to write this review .
negative	p . s .
negative	the flowers that were delivered were a miserable bunch of brown flowers - was not worth the money !
negative	avoid argos !!
negative	i ' m just about to get married .
negative	on 0th of august i ordered two wedding_rings for me and my fiancé in slough branch in observatory shopping centre .
negative	i specifically stated i need this rings before 00th of august and wanted to make_sure i will have it delivered to the store on time .
negative	the lady said not to worry as the delivery time is never longer_than two_weeks .
negative	i placed my order for two rings and on 00th_august collected my fiance ' s ring .
negative	my ring still didn ' t arrive , and when i went to the store few_days ago to check upon it ' s status again , the lady told me she cannot help me as the ring wasn ' t dispatched by supplier and she didn ' t know when will it be delivered .
negative	when i told her how important it is for me to have this ring , she says she cant guarantee the ring to be delivered on time , she looked in her system and she found same ring but .... one size smaller in other branch in reading .
negative	i decided to buy this ring as i didn ' t want to end up with no ring at all .
negative	the serving lady in reading i finally got me the ring , but when i looked at it - it was looking well worn with lots of scratches and some dents on it .
negative	i don ' t want and i can ' t keep this ring and now i have to return it as well as i have to return the ring of my fiancé .
negative	now i have my wedding date set on 00 . 00 . 0000 but have no rings !
negative	argos just simply ruined this most_important day by its negligence and unreliability !!
negative	in any way i cannot imagine what can be done to fix this situation !
negative	it is just unacceptable !
negative	i am extremely disappointed and by every occasion i am going to worn people , telling them my story about the situation that argos put me into , just to save them from ending up with nothing because of unreliable and extremely incompetent company - argos !
negative	i was after three genuine apple ma000g / b iphone leads but being as apple wanted £_00 per lead , i thought it might be best to have a quick look round to see what deals were on .
negative	when i saw these on at £ 0 . 00 a piece i was a bit_wary as you have to wonder_how this kind of site can offer genuine products at such a low price but based on the description and gut feeling , i decided to go with them ; it was a good choice .
negative	as stated , they are genuine and exactly as the picture shows .
negative	they are clearly genuine but the only thing i expected them to come in was full retail packaging as stated instead of just being in the plastic holding band that all apple leads come in .
negative	that said , i do not know what leads bought in an apple_store come packaged in but they would not be loose .
negative	the postal details state that the items will be sent via recorded_delivery , however after one week they had still not arrived so i contacted nicecans to ask for a tracking_number .
negative	it appeared that they had been sent via standard post and had been lost but nicecans had no issues with sending me another three units , this time via 0nd_class recorded_delivery .
negative	this was ok as the delivery details on the site state 0nd_class recorded however it would have been nice if they had been sent 0st_class to make up for the time loss but this is only a little niggle .
negative	they were very helpful and friendly when i rang up so that was great as i was expecting to get some rubbish excuse to try and get out of it so top_marks on that one .
negative	the packaging was perfect and very robust for the items so no issues with that at all .
negative	overall , i ' m very impressed and i will_definitely use them again despite the little hiccup but these things_happen and at_least they wanted to help and get the issue resolved which is more_than some other sellers .
negative	i wish i could rate the review 0 . 0_stars as the only thing that let it down was the fact they had been sent standard post instead of recorded and it ' s unfair to mark it down when they did send the new items as per their website details .
negative	many_thanks
negative	mitch
negative	talk_talk is by_far the worst company to deal with .
negative	called to give notice i am leaving , indian women said i need to speak to manager at customer loyalty , and transfers my call , after a 0min wait call goes dead .
negative	same happens again .
negative	write letter to head_office in southampton , no reply , send snotty email , then get a call from ' dave ' who sounded very indian to me .
negative	asked why i am leaving and can he address my problems , explained to him , then said i need to speak to manager , gets put through to manager after a 00mins wait , who asked me why i am calling doh ' you called me ' !
negative	he cannot help me and says i need to speak to manager .
negative	what a complete_waste of time this company is .
negative	i don ' t care how much cheaper talktalk are , i will happy pay alot more for my broadband in future , just so i do not have to deal with them again .
negative	hanving paid the deposit for unlock pre_- order , these people contacted me with their final price of gbp 000 . 00 for my iphone 0 00gb .
negative	i contacted orange , who proceeded with full factory_unlock of the handset for gbp 00 . 00 .
negative	busy claiming a refund of my deposit from official_iphone_unlock , who seek excuses in ther tc ' s stating the service has been delivered , although i never accepted and proceeded with the upgrade to full factory_unlock and settling the oustanding balance .
negative	do not pay more_than you have to , do some research first , people .
negative	scammers !
negative	they have about 0 websites all delivering in 0 - 0 weeks and only half the products0 the owners not a nice bloke and has threatened many customers !
negative	just google them !
negative	ordered £_000 worth of stuff , just to have it left outside my house by the cowboys from ' yodel '.
negative	i ordered two items for my girlfriend in october ( for christmas !)
negative	when the package turned_up , the delivery note said both items were present , when only one was .
negative	i emailed boohoo customer_services , got an answer back within a day and told that the item was still in stock , i said i would like it and thought that would be that .
negative	i still_haven ' t received anything , i have had about 0 emails answered with the automated_response of thanks for being patient and sorry for the inconvenience .
negative	how many other customer ' s money is sitting in their bank_account .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	ordered something , but was delivered ( and addressed ) to wrong_address .
negative	so never received it .
negative	company should accept_responsibility for their incompentence .
negative	and a bit of customer_service would have been nice .
negative	they expect me to sort this out .
negative	visa dispute will has been opened !
negative	i ordered a cable for £_00 . 00 on 00th_sept .
negative	received an order confirmation_email but no despatch email , no item delivered and no reply to email query .
negative	suspect they are crooks as others have found .
negative	avoid .
negative	i just don ' t like dominos ...
negative	they got all this badly trained youngsters to cook pizza ... wel sometimes you better of not to eat that !
negative	rude personal !
negative	pc wold is sucks
negative	bad reception on south of england !
negative	just do not like it .
negative	that is it
negative	if you are looking for good value find another place
negative	i have a linux dedicated_server running fedora with fasthosts web_hosting .
negative	i have been with them for 0 months .
negative	the last month has been dreadful .
negative	updates controlled through fasthosts wiping out php class files , and down times that break their service level agreements .
negative	the update lost me 0 and 0 / 0 days , as they have no engineer support at the weekend - losses into thousands .
negative	no apology , no communication and no one who_knows what they are doing .
negative	recently lost all connection to my dedicated_server , and the matrix control_panel is plagued with problems - still without imap or pop0 for the third time in a row .
negative	i will be switching in the new year when i have the energy for it .
negative	i may have to pay extra , but going for the budget option has meant fire fighting with them all the time , they will always tell you a problem is nothing to do with them , and then low and behold it is !
negative	i have been boots customer for over 0 years .
negative	experience is generally fine but boots . com is terrible .
negative	recently placed an order for around £_000 and got it cancelled with no reason .
negative	bank confirms the money has been claimed , delivery address is the same as billing_address .
negative	called the customer_service but is absolutely no helpful .
negative	feel very disappointed and angry .
negative	they just think they are big enough to treat badley their existing_customers .
negative	right well she was snotty and very cheeky , there was no need for the way i was spoken to !
negative	be_careful when you buy from here since you may get what you did not want you will be stuck with it
negative	you will never get answer to your emails if you have questions such as delivery time etc .
negative	also no refund when you are not happy with the products and send them back .
negative	i so much regret that i purchased for 000 gbp on this website as my refund hasn ´ t been made .
negative	avoid this seller !
negative	up until recently i would have said lovely , always helpful .
negative	occasional things gone wrong but rectified .
negative	but after my recent experience in store at there pharmacy and the interaction with the locum pharmacist who openly on the shop floor , my medication and medical conditions and then_proceeded to scare the living day lights out if me regarding one of my medications and also telling_me i should not be taking it and other medication all prescribed by my gp .
negative	i phoned boots customer care , to complain and felt_like i was being fobbed_off , a report would be made nothing more .
negative	so i emailed and then used there contact us form on there site and have not heard a peep from them ..
negative	not acceptable boots ... not acceptable at all .
negative	i have ordered a raincover over 0 weeks_ago , have not received any confirmation_email about my order .
negative	money was taken from my account immediately !!!
negative	i had to call them and ask for confirmation_email , the customer_service operator was rude but said that the product will arrive soon .
negative	waited for weeks ( exactly 0 weeks ) but still no sign of delivery .
negative	also checked on their online track service , there was no comment about delivery , no sign of it .
negative	in the meantime i sent an_email to customer_services .
negative	on their website they say that they reply within 00_hours , still no reply ( 00_hours passed )
negative	call them again , operator said that i have to wait 0 more weeks !!!
negative	on their website they say that if there is any chance of delayed delivery they contact you immediately .
negative	it never happened , i had to call them every time .
negative	operator is quite rude , a slight apology and thinks that is enough .
negative	i talked to the customer_service manager , called [_name ], she was extremely unpolite with me , asked me : " what do you want me to do ?
negative	my colleague already apologized ."
negative	she wanted to get_rid of me and talked to me in a very monotone voice , not even apologize for the inconveniences !
negative	unfortunately the system doesn ' t allow me to save this comment without giving at_least rate 0 to preciouslittleone .
negative	my rate would be minus 0 !!
negative	!
negative	overall , very disappointed , never again order from them !!
negative	!
negative	the following is my opinion of iflorist , based on my experiences .
negative	i ordered 00 red_roses to be delivered on valentines_day .
negative	late on the evening before valentines_day , i received as email_saying my flowers would not be delivered on valetines day , and would actually be delivered on the 00th .
negative	any other day of the year , this might have been ok but not valentines_day .
negative	eventually , late on the 00th the flowers were delivered .
negative	not the 00 red_roses i had paid for , but three roses and a handful of carnations .
negative	i have tried to contact this company on the phone , with no luck .
negative	i have also sent emails with no reply .
negative	i want my money back .
negative	i will be avoiding this company in future .
negative	ordered a couple of times and a complete_waste of time .
negative	should be banned from the internet , a complete_joke .
negative	i bought some speakers for £_00 which arrived faulty i sent them back and got a refund of £_00 ...
negative	i ' m not sure how thats even legal : s
negative	literally the worst flowers i ' ve ever_seen in my life .
negative	they look nothing like the picture , they are squashed almost flat and smelly !!!
negative	if i could post a photo here to show you i would ...
negative	if you want a decent bunch of flowers please pay a bit more and use interflora who have never delivered me a bad bunch before .
negative	my husband and i went_onto o0 because we had relatives and friends on that network so we figured we would save money .
negative	i was so wrong !
negative	they ended_up charging us double for four_months until we finally got the problem sorted .
negative	we have horrible experience with the customer_service .
negative	one person tells you one thing while another person tells you something else .
negative	you can not change your tariff if you want to lower your monthly allowances and charges .
negative	one customer representative was even argumentative and refused to transfer us to a supervisor .
negative	they are very inconsistent .
negative	my mum in law ended_up getting forced into a contract with them due to a family_member not paying the bill in her name and they were absolutely awful when she called to try and get a copy of the original contact and change the tariff .
negative	they charged her £_00 per_month just for 0000 minutes and unlimited texting .
negative	absoutely no data was included in that .
negative	even_though it wasn ' t their fault that she had to continue with the contract they were no help what so ever .
negative	the phone ended_up not working for a month and despite many time we helped her take it in to get fixed nothing worked and nobody helped .
negative	we finally ended_up getting them to send her out a new one just to find out that that phone didn ' t work either !
negative	it was absolutely_ridiculous !
negative	do not use o0 as your network !
negative	i don ' t reccomend to anyone !
negative	sign their contract at your own_risk !
negative	if you are a customer of o0 please make_sure to check your monthly_bill for unknown charges because they will not catch the error themselves !
negative	i signed_up for a recent deal at e0save for a t - mobile full monty sim - only deal .
negative	it was billed at £ 00pm for 00m with a free refurbished nexus 0 00gb .
negative	all was ok to start with , signup was painless and their delivery company dpd were spot on .
negative	fast forward 0 weeks and i got a text from t - mobile saying they ' ve been trying to contact me and this is the last chance to pay my bill .
negative	i ' ve not had any previous communication , so this seemed a bit weird .
negative	noticed that my mobile data wasn ' t working , so tried registering on the t - mobile website ( that ' s nicely broken at the moment ) so gave up and called t - mobile .
negative	got hold of a very bored sounding lady , who confirmed my account was overdue to a cancelled dd ( first i ' d heard of it !)
negative	and i needed to pay £_00 to restore my service .
negative	i queried the amount and she confirmed that i should be paying £_00 a month and pretty_much refused to believe me about the £_00 agreed with e0save .
negative	checked all my stuff from e0save and it ' s all above board , with no mention of redemption or cashback from them etc etc .
negative	so it just looks_like either i was mis_- sold or they ' re just incompetent .
negative	either way , not exactly re - assuring and i ' ve got no way to rectify it because they ' re shut at weekends .
negative	guess i won ' t be calling anyone tonight then !
negative	my advice , go elsewhere for your mobile needs .
negative	i had my first real problem with virginmedia when i upgraded my broadband and ordered a tivo box ( standard v + box is god_awful slow after being used to a skyhd box ) i haggled a deal with their indian_call_centre where i ' d only pay £_00 instead of £_00
negative	sadly , as i soon found out , i was lied to and my bill showed the full_amount .
negative	rang cs who advised me to cancel the dd as they had no way of refunding my money .
negative	done that and then i got a £_00 charge for a dd failure .
negative	called again , and was told it was all sorted .
negative	sadly the next bill still showed the £_00 charge .
negative	called and spoke to their complaints_department who said they wouldn ' t have said that ( awfully nice to be called a liar by a complaints_department !)
negative	but conveniently they didn ' t record these call to the off - shore department , so i couldn ' t prove it
negative	at this point i raised a complaint with ofcom about being mis_- sold and sent an_email to the ceo ' s office at vm .
negative	only then did i get someone that understood customer_service , who apologised and promptly refunded my account with the money .
negative	couple all this with their rubbish traffic management ( 00_% speed reduction on uploads !!)
negative	and you ' re better off looking elsewhere .
negative	as soon as my contract is up i ' m jumping ship to bt_infinity
negative	i placed an order with precious_little ones on the 00st december_0000 for an east_coast cot mattress , i rang on the 0nd jan_0000 to delay the dispatch due to not being at the delivery address by the time it was expected to be delivered .
negative	the girl i spoke to was very helpful , advised that the mattress was in the warehouse but she would get a delay put on dispatch until the 0th_jan .
negative	i thought nothing of it , and and was looking_forward to receiving the mattress , however , i received an_email on the 0th_jan saying that there had been a stock error and that it would be another week until the mattress arrived in the warehouse .
negative	i rang customer_services to ask what was going on , someone had made a mistake and not placed the mattress in the correct section and it had been resold ( not sure how that even happens ), i complained at the time but was not offered any compensation , until i asked for delivery charges to refunded .
negative	i was expecting to receive on email on the 00th / 00th_jan to say that the mattress had been dispatched , instead i have received another email to say that the mattress is still not a available and that there was a problem with the manufacturers .
negative	again i rang customer_service to complain and ask for an explanation , but was given no more information , nor could i be told when the mattress would be available .
negative	again i was not offered any compensation , other than an_apology .
negative	needless to say i cancelled the order there and then , and will not be using precious littles one again , whilst their prices are highly competitive , it would appear you have to be prepared to wait .
negative	absolutely rubbish !
negative	ordered on 0 / 0 / 00 and got goods on 00 / 0 / 00 !
negative	no excuse , it ' s not even christmas !
negative	never ordering from ' slow pharmacy ' again
negative	placed an order for a nice bouqet for my girlfriends_birthday .
negative	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
negative	when they were delivered they were disappointing and left me feeling embarrassed .
negative	stems were snapped , a few of the flowers looked as if they were dying already and the arrangement was poor .
negative	the greeting card was small and lacked imagination and a personal_touch .
negative	just another printed note for another customer ... no love or feeling involved .
negative	deflated , and unimpressed by the standard i expected .
negative	this is the first time i have used your company and as this was a bouquet for a special birthday i wont be using you again or recommending your company .
negative	i hope you can learn from this feedback and make_sure others receive a better quality of flower in future .
negative	thank_you
negative	booked three direct flights but the airline cancelled this flight ( now wondering_if they were ever offering such connection ).
negative	first very frustrating thing were their emails sent to me in german ( booked flight through uk website , payed with cc registered in uk , gave uk contact number )...
negative	however using google translator i managed .
negative	called the customer " service " just to find out the obvious - the flight is not happening ...
negative	they offered me an_alternative - instead of a direct , up to 0 hrs flight a full day connection with a change .
negative	i refused ( who wouldn ' t ?).
negative	then i called them again to find out what my other options are and i could have chosen a refund that takes at_least 0 months or a voucher that will be usable for a future booking with them and issued within 00_hours .
negative	i went for the voucher option as three passengers needed to travel and even_though i ' d have preferred not to use bravofly again .
negative	no voucher after 0 days so i called again , explained all what happened again just to be told , that it will take longer because of the bank that doesn ' t work on weekend .
negative	excuse me ???
negative	bank is not involved at all .
negative	bravofly is issuing me a voucher in order to be able to use it for my next purchase ...
negative	i had to explain the process to the customer " service " representative .
negative	outrageous .
negative	then she finally understood and promised to call me back that day after she investigates the matter .
negative	no call back received , no email received ... now i ' m desperately trying to get hold of bravofly however with no luck .
negative	their 0 - midnight uk number does ' t work at 00 : 00 neither does their french one .
negative	their worldwide number only works if you provide your card number but after_reading other person ' s experience of facing card fraud afterwards i don ' t feel_like doing this .
negative	to sum up anybody who is about to book with bravofly please think_twice as non - existent service and so frustrating approach is hardly to be seen elsewhere .

negative	on tuesday 0th_january i used music_magpie ' s mobile_app to scan a load of dvds and then used the site to add some clothing items to complete the order .
negative	i was really impressed with the convenience of the process .
negative	as i was completing the order , i was given the option of a free courier service as i had over 00 items in my order .
negative	this was also convenient for me as carrying the packed items to a post_office would have been difficult .
negative	so i selected today ( saturday 00th ) for the items to be collected .
negative	i received my welcome_pack soon after_placing my order and it had instructions on how to pack my items .
negative	the email said as long as i pack the items as instructed , my items would be collected by the courier .
negative	the instructions said i could pack everything in one box and i was sent one label in the email .
negative	i couldn ' t find a box big enough for all the items so packed everything into 0 boxes .
negative	i was worried that the courier would refuse the collection if they were only expecting one box , as per music_magpie ' s instructions .
negative	so i emailed music_magpie on the wednesday 0th asking if it would be ok for my items to be in 0 boxes as i could not find one box big enough .
negative	by friday i hadn ' t received a reply so i sent my email again .
negative	later in the day i received an_automated email_saying my items would be collected the next_day (" saturday 00nd " - their spelling ).
negative	i sent my email again straight after seeing this automated_message .
negative	well today was the day the items should have been collected .
negative	between_0am and 0pm i was told .
negative	i have stayed in all day and my items have not been collected .
negative	i have not received any notice that a collection was attempted and for most of the day my house lights have been on so even if a courier did come , they would have clearly seen that someone was in .
negative	i find it inexcusable that music_magpie have failed to reply to my email on any one of the three occasions i sent it ( my junk box has been checked and no reply in there either ).
negative	i find it more so frustrating as i did receive an_automated email from them confirming the courier booking and providing an_email address to contact if i have a query - the same address i sent my three emails to - enquiries @ musicmagpie . co . uk .
negative	i would also like to point out that music_magpie have failed to reply to my emails sent directly to them over the last 0 days but managed to take the time to reply 0 days ago to someone ' s 0 star_review below .
negative	if i were to score music_magpie purely on the process of placing an order , it would be 0_stars but what is the point of all that time i spent inputting over 00 items when the items aren ' t even collected when specified and emails sent to the enquiries department are ignored ?!
negative	such a shame .
negative	placed an order with uksweets at quite a high value and had a terrible experience :
negative	when i received it , it was all packed one item to a box so we received a stupid amount of boxes .
negative	bags of sweets were split and taped back together meaning we couldn ' t sell them .
negative	items were out of stock even_though in stock on their website .
negative	boxes were damaged so items we had sold in bulk had to be repackaged in our warehouse to avoid disappointing our customers ( see , that ' s good customer_service on our part !)
negative	sent items that had 0 - 0 months on the best before date meaning we have to either reduce them or sell them in bulk .
negative	if you look around you can find the items a lot cheaper and with better stock_levels .
negative	overall , it may be the worst experience we have had with a wholesaler .
negative	having met them at ife00 we assumed they would be a good company to work with ... obviously not !
negative	i will not be ordering from this company again , their customer_service is ridiculous and their products can be found cheaper elsewhere .
negative	do yourself a favour , don ' t buy from uksweets .
negative	ordered some goods for my bros christmas_present .
negative	supposed to be delivered on the 0th , still nothing .
negative	support email on the confirmation_email is a fake .
negative	then i saw this site .
negative	i won ' t be holding my breath for the goods .
negative	let ' s face it , they probably don ' t even have a bottle of aspirin .
negative	avoid !
negative	do not use this company
negative	work overpriced ( more_than double local companies ), engineers did not turn_up ( i waited more_than 0 weeks and they missed four appointments ) and they were extremely rude when they did actualy contact me .
negative	and for all of this , they actually charged me for the pleasure - without actually completing any work .
negative	still fighting for a refund !
negative	i ordered a small pair of earphones from amazon and they are being posted by you .
negative	i got next_day delivery .
negative	i ordered them last sunday and still havnt received them , we even put a clearer sign out side our house to exclude that , we couldnt find you excuse because we saw you drive past our house !
negative	and again same email to the exact word .
negative	now ill get the same message as everyone_else which probably wont work and receive no explanation .
negative	why ?
negative	twice hackers cleaned out my bank_account and although i got money back , it took far too long and they didn ' t give any compensation , even_though it resulted_in bank charges and potentially late bills , luckily i had family to help out !
negative	i purchased a tv from appliances direct .
negative	as soon as i went to check out , they automatically add £_00 worth of rubbish i didnt ask for or want to the basket .
negative	once removed i clicked the how much delivery will be button : £ 0 . 00 , but when i went to check out after filling these details in this prices wasnt available as i live in aberdeen ( aberdeen is not highlands !)
negative	as my wife and i work full time i paid the extra money for the tv to be delivered on the saturday .
negative	we sat inside all day waiting for the tv to arrive ( no approximate time is given ).
negative	no tv arrived .
negative	i phoned the expensive helpline on monday and after sitting on hold , going through lots of menus i eventually explained the situation .
negative	i was promised a call within_00hrs .
negative	i waited the two days .
negative	no tv arrived and i received no phone call .
negative	again i called and pretty_much started the proceedings again .
negative	this time i was promised a call within 00_hrs .
negative	again no delivery and i received no phone call .
negative	i phoned
negative	again and found out nothing , they had no_idea if the tv had been dispatched .
negative	but this time i got an_email_saying i need to wait a week for a responce ... im still_waiting .....
negative	after i submitted the review , i was contacted by a member of their management team and appologied to .
negative	the investigation failed to find anything out , so another tv was scheduled for delivery two_weeks after the initial delivery was meant to be made .
negative	due to the terrible service i received i asked for the price of the tv to be reduced to the now lower_price being offered online and that i get a full_refund for the delivery cost .
negative	i was promised both of these refunds .
negative	after waiting in all saturday again i received no tv !!!
negative	i also received neither of the refunds .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid .
negative	i was an amazon customer for years , but now i simply cannot trust them with my bank_details anymore .
negative	the last order i had with amazon was for a headset , which arrived faulty .
negative	totally not amazon ' s fault , after all .
negative	they didn ' t manufacture it , but i phoned them up to arrange a return and replacement .
negative	they said they ' ll happily replace it and they ' ll email me the details of getting the replacement underway , and all was well and good and i was happy .
negative	that was , until i got the email .
negative	it was an_email obviously for another customer , with what they ordered , their full name , their city , bank_details , all of it , right in the email .
negative	i phoned them up again to alert them of the error they ' ve made , and to ask them whether my details were also compromised .
negative	and from then on , it just got worse and worse .
negative	no apology , no investigation , no reassurance that my personal details weren ' t sent to another customer .
negative	they didn ' t care .
negative	i asked for my account to be closed and for my personal details to be removed from amazon , as , obviously , i couldn ' t trust them anymore .
negative	they refused .
negative	despite the fact that , under the data_protection act , they ' re legally obligated to remove my details if i request it , they felt out refused .
negative	i wouldn ' t expect this from an established , large company like amazon .
negative	i ' m sure they deal with millions of transactions without a fault , but when a serious fault happens , like it did for me , they don ' t care .
negative	i ' m still pretty shocked that such a thing happened .
negative	it ' s a shame that amazon are so irresponsible with customer ' s data and so unapologetic over it , but i can ' t overlook that just because their prices are good .
negative	i had an initial l ; oan and got caught in the spiral of paying back then taking another out to replace the money that quickquid have took .
negative	after numerous_attempts to set_up a payment plan that both_parties were happy with i was advised by quickquid to change my payment date so that my account went into arrears and to call them to set_up a payment plan ( as they could only do this once i was in arrears ) after calling i received no help at all .
negative	i just want to pay and get quickquid out of my life .
negative	please take my warning and do not use them
negative	i purchased the maxfactor natural minerals foundation and i phoned up to complain_about it .
negative	they describe it as being natural looking , which it isn ' t as it is very shimmery .
negative	brush sheds , feels dry on my face , not buildable either .
negative	i can ' t get a refund because it ' s been used .
negative	well , surely the customer is always right ?
negative	customer_service is shoddy as well .
negative	i was told to take it up with maxfactor !
negative	just useless !
negative	i ordered some green tea pills on a saturday and i waited until weds and thought it was odd i hadn ' t had an_email to say they had been dispatched .
negative	phoned up and they said they had a problem with their supplier .
negative	well , why have them available online ?
negative	there were in stock when i placed my order .
negative	it ' s now friday and i have them .
negative	wary to order from them again .
negative	as all the other reviews say this company is definatly a scam !
negative	i just wish i had looked for reviews before ordering !
negative	my experience is exactly the same as everyone elses , i ordered from them , few weeks_later order is still ' pending ' and have had no replys from my numerous attemps of contacting them .
negative	i ' m so gutted that they are just able to get away with this =[
negative	0rd edit_:
negative	just had an extremely arrogant chap call me up from chess to tell me that i owe them money and that because i have ignored all their efforts to contact me over this debt his department the escalated debt department were now dealing_with the matter .
negative	because of the tone taken i asked to speak to [_name ]' s supervisor but he refused to do this .
negative	it was very clear that [_name ] didn ' t have a clue regarding any of the account history and that he didn ' t believe a word i said on the phone .
negative	so after countless emails and a few telephone_calls chess are still claiming that i have never contacted them and that i owe them money ( which they are adding fees to despite their claims of no small_print )
negative	one to avoid .
negative	so yet another example of chess ' s terrible customer_services and dodgy business_practices .
negative	one to avoid 0 / 00 .
negative	0nd edit_:
negative	just a note to say that chess have been in touch again .
negative	interestingly chess have decided to try and hold me to terms and conditions which i have never signed_up to or agreed to .
negative	i signed_up through thevirtualnumbercompany and this website still says " no small_print " and " 00 days cancellation notice "
negative	they claim that they have not received any of the numerous email that i have sent to them .
negative	chess are amongst the most dishonest companies i have ever_encountered .
negative	0 / 00 terrible company .
negative	original text :
negative	i became a chess telecom customer through the virtual phone number company around 00 months_ago .
negative	i have two lines , one is a local number the other is an 0000 number .
negative	both are on a 00 day rolling agreement .
negative	they have consistently overcharged me line_rental and despite numerous attempt to get them to rectify the situation they have simply ignored me .
negative	their staff on the phone can see that i am being charged too much but cant understand_why or do anything about it .
negative	so after almost 00 months i gave them their marching orders .
negative	having paid one month in_advance and being on a one month deal i don ' t owe them anything .
negative	they owe me !
negative	however as they can ' t even get the basic billing right i doubt i have any chance of getting the money they owe me !
negative	to add_insult to injury chess have ignored my cancellation and have continued to send bills .
negative	i have cancelled the direct_debit with the bank but this hasn ' t deterred them .
negative	i have replied to every email they have sent but have never had a response in return .
negative	now they are adding fees to the account and threatening me with their legal team who will apparently pursue me .
negative	yet it is they who owe me money !
negative	so here the bottom_line .
negative	if you choose chess they will overcharge you , they will ignore your emails and when you choose to leave they will_continue to bill you and threaten you .
negative	0 / 00 from me .
negative	terrible company .
negative	edit .
negative	: i have now been contacted by someone from chess telecom .
negative	however that person denied the company was overcharging me and when i said i was not in the office at the moment and was unable to give detailed_information about the over charging because i didn ' t have the invoices in front of me , the put the phone down .
negative	another great example of chess telecoms terrible customer_service .
negative	i should also add that a message has been left on the answering_machine asking me to call them up on a premium_rate number !
negative	so again 0 / 00 terrible company .
negative	having been a customer with ybs for a long time i always believed they were better_than the banks and that i could trust them .
negative	this changed when i was overcharged by a third_party using direct_debit .
negative	when i tried to claim the money back using the direct_debit guarantee i found it wasn ' t worth the paper it was written on .
negative	they refused to give a full and immediate refund and while i did eventually get my money refunded it took a lot of time and hassle .
negative	it wasn ' t the worry free experience the guarantee offers .
negative	if you are looking for a trust_worthy alternative to the high_street banks , the ybs isn ' t it .
negative	sadly .
negative	akinika is one of the worst companies i have ever had the misfortune to deal with .
negative	when they called me they claimed to be her majesties revenue and customs calling about tax credits .
negative	it soon turned_out that the akinika employee was being dishonest as they did not have information which hmrc have .
negative	akinika claimed that i have been overpaid tax credits and that i have received and ignored a letter they have sent me .
negative	neither is true .
negative	the akinika staff refused to log the dispute and refused to investigate , they simply demand i make payment to them immediately .
negative	they even refused to provide information about their company , even their address .
negative	akinika have a website but it doesn ' t list the companies registered address , or any address .
negative	it doesn ' t list the companies registration details or status .
negative	there is no provision to make a complaint .
negative	this company doesn ' t care for normal uk trading laws or debt_collection regulations .
negative	took 0 month payment in_advance , yet when we left after two years they forgot about that and refused to give us our money back .
negative	leaving us £_00 out of pocket .
negative	after selling a product and receiving payment through paypal i shipped it confidently .
negative	however when the buyer received it they decided they wanted it cheaper and paypal removed the whole amount from my account .
negative	this meant i had no product and no money .
negative	ebay just doesn ' t care about its customers .
negative	it is geared up for handing disputes between buyers and sellers but when ebay gets it wrong you might as well talk to the wall .
negative	just remember , the bigger they are , the harder they fall .
negative	i ' m giving up on ebay because they keep ignoring me .
negative	i have heard bad things about fitness first , but i decided to have a look for myself .
negative	on first_impressions , fitness first seemed very basic .
negative	truth be told they were renovating some areas , but still it seemed quite subpar .
negative	i enquired_about membership details , and was briefed by one of the staff .
negative	i wasn ' t shown around the area for some reason , so the actual conditions and facilities remained a mystery to me .
negative	since i would soon be travelling abroad , i decided to hand over my contact details to them for more information about membership in the future , which turned_out to be my biggest_mistake .
negative	fast forward a week_later , i was packing for holiday when my phone rang .
negative	turned_out to be someone from fitness first who sounded just like ali g ( rudeboy accent ?)
negative	who wanted to talk more about the membership i enquired_about .
negative	i politely told him that i was currently busy packing for holiday and would like to talk more about this when i return to the uk , however he was not willing to accept this and continued to talk about the membership plan .
negative	i then politely told him a second time that i was busy packing , to which he rudely hung_up on me mid sentence , which i have to say really irritated me .
negative	00_minutes later , my phone blared at me again , another person from fitness first with the same intentions .
negative	whilst he wasn ' t as rude as the previous person , it was at this point i ended_up blocking the phone number from contacting me directly ever again .
negative	will i ever get to finish packing today ??
negative	i could imagine a queue of fitness first staff just waiting to turn my phone into a christmas_tree .
negative	never again will i want to associate with fitness first and their etiquettes , like a bunch of obnoxious school kids waiting in line at a sweet shop to pester the cashier .
negative	in short , i really cannot recommend fitness first to anyone and would advise people to not even bother enquiring_about joining .
negative	if the staff are that rude and persistent to a potential curious new member to their gym , i dread to think the treatment i will receive upon becoming an actual member , and that ' s forgetting all the bad stories i ' ve heard .
negative	chiquitos has to be the worst dining experience i ' ve ever had .
negative	having never eaten there before , i was excited to try out their menu , but my eagerness soon turned to utter dissapointment .
negative	first and last time i ' ll ever go there .
negative	upon_arriving at the entrance , we were looked at by the passing staff , but not spoken to or acknowledged , which was very strange .
negative	when we were finally allowed to sit_down in one of the darkened corners of the restaurant , the staff_member took his sweet time in finding menus for us , which actually was just the beginning of this painfully_slow service .
negative	you ' d think ordering a simple beverage would be as simple as either opening a can or filling the glass up from a dispenser .
negative	no_idea what the staff were doing as the drinks took around 0 minutes to arrive which probaly isn ' t that long to wait ... had it not been us as 0 of the only 0 tables occupied in the entire restaurant .
negative	the starters took 00_minutes to arrive , and the nacho - things we ordered where actually moist and tasted stale , and it was barely warm and didn ' t taste great .
negative	it was at this point when i realised i needed to get out of here , but we still waited for the rest of our meal .
negative	as for the main course , it took a good 00 or so minutes to arrive .
negative	and even then , it wasn ' t even hot , just luke warm .
negative	infact i stuck my fingers in it and took a photo to post on my facebook to share my experiences with my friends , which prompted them to also reveal they had bad_experiences eating at chiquitos .
negative	the restaurant is not even busy and i have no_idea what the chefs in the kitchen are doing , but a bunch of meatballs and some rice surely can ' t take that long to cook ?
negative	sure enough , we weren ' t the only ones suffering , as another table near us was complaining_about the service .
negative	i couldn ' t be bothered to complain , having worked a mean shift earlier and not in the mood for confrontation .
negative	well , thank_god it all came to an end and as i left , i muttered " i can ' t wait to get out of here " to one of the tables as we were leaving .
negative	last time i ever set foot in any of their branches .
negative	being involved in the food industry myself ( just as a regular chef mind you , not a managerial expert so don ' t think i ' m a know - it - all ), i can ' t help but mention that there are so many things wrong with chiquitos , especially with the professionalism of the staff , i ' m baffled they still remain in business .
negative	unfortunately the experience was so bad i started using the chiquitos word to describe things i dislike , albeit with slightly mispelt letters to rhyme with a certain naughty word .
negative	i ' d definately_recommend to everyone to avoid chiquitos at all cost to prevent utter dissapointment and a waste of money .
negative	like i said , first and last time i ' ll go there .
negative	i gave 0 month notice to cancel my contract , and a guy from their support told that ' s everything fine , and i dont need to pay any extra .
negative	went back home for 0 months , and then returned saw , that i have to pay for every month , and i still on the contract !
negative	!
negative	i was trying to got an idea of what is going on , called to customer_service and they started to switch my call from one to another employee , that finally i told 00 min with 0 different people , and the last one sad the same - it ' s not my issue , i will transfer your call .
negative	finally - nothing !!
negative	!
negative	+ their internet speed and coverage just dreadful .
negative	never buy any contract or use this network .
negative	awful !!
negative	!
negative	great if everything goes_smoothly but if they mess up they just ignore you .
negative	even when you do get a reply to an_email and you reply back to them again , they ' ll ignore you for about a week or 0
negative	didn ' t receive my order on the day i was supposed to so the next_day i phone up .
negative	after waiting on the phone for over half an_hour i went through to an agent that muted their headset , they accidently took it off mute and i said " i know someone ' s there because you just took me off mute " then they hung_up the phone .
negative	ended_up cancelling the order .
negative	but yet they still sent it out 0 days_later ( it now being 0 day since it should have been delivered ).
negative	this all happened at the end of june and i ' ve only just got my refund today .
negative	absolutely_shocking service , and in my opinion , unreasonable delivery charges , will never use them again .
negative	bodybuildingwarehouse is cheaper with free delivery and same quality .
negative	they also maintain contact with customers , even speaking to me on twitter .
negative	i ' ve had friend who have also had lots of problems with my protein and it ' s took them months to get refunds and have things rectified
negative	i bought a 0 inch tablet on the 00rd of april , said 00 working_days delivery .
negative	to this day ( 00th_may ) i still don ' t have it .
negative	two of my friends bought their tablets on other_websites for cheaper price than mine and got theirs after two to four days .
negative	my friend she paid £_00 for hers and got it after two days , i paid £_00 for mine including p_& p and i ' m still_waiting .
negative	i called the customer_service of d0d last friday after 00 days have passed , and i enquired_about it , they tell me that they didn ' t have my delivery address .
negative	i gave my delivery address to wowcher , how could they not have it ?
negative	and they have my e_- mail address which gets flooded with e_- mails and deals every day , but they couldn ' t bother to send me an e_- mail telling_me they were missing my address ?
negative	the lady on the phone tells_me i will receive it monday or tuesday , today ( tuesday ) it is still not here so i call the customer_service again , an 0000 number which doesn ' t come cheap on my mobile ( and i don ' t have landline ).
negative	the lady tells_me another excuse , the labels were wrong , it was dispatched and then went back to the warehouse they put the correct labels on it (???????)
negative	and now it is dispatched again , she was going to give me a tracking_number but i got cut_off because i run out of credit ( so much for trying to save money !!)
negative	now i can ' t be bothered to top up my phone just to waste money on a customer_service of a tablet that i bought because it was supposed to be over 00_%_off the original price .
negative	it is just not worth the hassle , next time i will just look for deals somewhere_else .
negative	so after having my grand die and having an_emergency c section to save my daughter life i choose to order mine and my husbands funeral clothing on boohoo . com as in unable to move around to get to the shops !
negative	my item was ment to be delivered yesterday which apparently it has been left in a secure place ( why couldn ' t you knock on the door ?)
negative	so now after contacting customer_service i need to go print a form off and then send it back to them to get my items resent or refunded .
negative	i don ' t have a printer in my house so it means i ' m going to have to travel to the closest library to use one which isn ' t open till tuseday when my funeral is .
negative	all in all boohoo have just added a bunch of stress on to a very stressful time .
negative	i will never shop with you again .
negative	got sent the wrong phone returned it told i would be given a new handset free of charge 0 weeks_later still no phone !
negative	to now be told that its not in the notes bunch of lying twats !
negative	their website openly advertises the difference_between next_day ( 00h ) and two day ( 00h ) consignments on their inviting website , what they don ' t tell you is that if you pay a premium for a 00h service , you shouldn ' t apparently expect a next_day delivery .
negative	this company has made our business look completely unprofessional to a high value client and has tarnished our name in doing so .
negative	be very careful when using this site .
negative	once they ' ve taken your money , they will not be any help to you .
negative	if you actually want the ability to use your phone i would recommend using a different service .
negative	i have little to no signal at all times and have had numerous problems with the simple things like direct_debits .
negative	upon ringing up customer_service to try to sort out my endless problems i have been met with rude , abrupt and ignorant customer_service agents and i am yet to have any of my problems solved .
negative	do not go to orange !
negative	very poor customer_service and terrible communication with customers !
negative	avoid like the plague and use a more reputable music dealer , unless you have lots of time on your hands and feel lucky that your order will actually arrive !
negative	avoid !
negative	!
negative	i ordered flowers , registered my details ( including mobile and email ) and received order confirmation .
negative	the order was for the following_day , for my 00 year_old grandmas birthday ; no delivery took place and no notification of attempted delivery was left .
negative	i have received no contact , in 0 days from eflorist informing_me of any_issues .
negative	my grandma was extremely disappointed , this is the worst customer_service i ' ve ever_experienced .
negative	why this mess ???????
negative	?
negative	alertpay ??
negative	i do not have any word to explain my feelings guys .
negative	awful alertpay
negative	ordered some new fitness clothing while i was aware of their ' magazine and mug ' scam so i opt out .
negative	i checked out when it was put back in my basket , only to find out when i got the confirmation_email .
negative	really , guys ?
negative	i don ' t want your stupid marketing stuff ( let_alone pay for it ).
negative	it ' s like shopping at the supermarket and have a employee sneakily put another product in your basket .
negative	how is this even legal .. also , charging 0 . 00 for standard delivery .
negative	no one does that anymore .
negative	this is truly the last time i ' m shopping with this company .
negative	i ' d rather spend a few_quid more to be treated with honesty .
negative	they sold me a £_000 cage for the degus which turned_out to be way too small .
negative	the reaction i ' ve got on this was that it is the rspca minimum .
negative	which it is not .
negative	they also seem to know nothing about them , constantly miss - sexing them so people end up with an unwanted litter .
negative	it ' s pathetic to see the animals in the shops in very small cages , and them being willing to sell them per one degu .
negative	always keep them in pairs .
negative	please do not buy from , thus promoting , this shop .
negative	i ' ve build my girls a really big cage , for less money than the cage pah sold me .
negative	we would not use city_link ever again worse company in our all aspects .
negative	it would be too rude to state what we really think of them ..........
negative	i made a mistake on my order but didn ' t notice this until i had paid for it .
negative	i thought never mind i ' ll cancel the order then re - order the correct items .
negative	i cancelled it within 0 mins of placing it , then ordered the correct items on a seperate order only later to be told the order had already been processed and could not be cancelled ( why not ?
negative	i clearly hadn ' t left the warehouse within 0 minutes when i was ordering at 00 : 00 at night !)
negative	so my order couldn ' t be cancelled .
negative	two days_later i receive duplicate orders , and items i did not want .
negative	i contacted my protein to return the items only to be told i would have to meet the cost of returning them .
negative	an_absolute_disgrace i believe since they failed to prevent the items i didn ' t want been sent in the first place .
negative	this was a totally_unacceptable circumstance and my protein have just lost a good customer over this !
negative	!
negative	had problems with an interface i purchased from here a few_years_ago .
negative	the company just did not want to assist me in the matter .
negative	luckily i found out later i just needed a driver update .
negative	recently i purchased an active subwoofer from them .
negative	the item became_faulty on its fourth use but i did not diagnose the problem to the unit until a few weeks_later .
negative	from my first contact with them regarding the issue it took them 0 weeks to replace the faulty unit , plus i had to contact the manufacturer to arrange the warranty cover myself !!
negative	( this should be their job )
negative	i did offer for them to credit note me as i wanted some more_expensive items as an_alternative but they refused !
negative	terrible service , incredibily difficult to get hold of there person in charge of service department ( sam ) and all_round bad_experience !
negative	i will not be using them ever again and will make_sure all the contacts i know who also buy dj & sound equipment know to avoid this company .
negative	i have recently order the big moving pack plus from this website and i have only received part of the package with no tapes and no pen .
negative	i have called their costumer services many_times during different days and no one pick the phone up .
negative	this is cost me another 0 pounds to buy tape and of course time which was more important to me .
negative	as i wanted to have everything ready at the same time , thats why i have ordered them online .
negative	i am not happy with my purchase at all .
negative	i bought my friend some flowers ,
negative	from iflorist , a wonderful deal !
negative	i thought how lovely they looked online ,
negative	could not wait to see them for real .
negative	however dear friends , guess_what !
negative	the flowers , they never arrived ,
negative	my friend stayed late at the office ,
negative	so i tried and i tried and i tried ,
negative	to ring the iflorist people
negative	to ask them " where are my flowers ??"
negative	i ' d had my conformation email
negative	and my friend waited at her work for hours !
negative	but nothing !!
negative	not even a phonecall !
negative	!
negative	they took my money , and me , for a fool !
negative	i wish to now receive my refund
negative	and i wish i hadn ' t shopped there at all .
negative	you could have at_least tried to phone me !
negative	to let me know that you guys had gone wrong !
negative	yes ok there may have been trouble with snow and the weather
negative	but then tell me this before the whole day has gone !
negative	you say it was down to the snow
negative	and deliveries not made on time !
negative	the for the love of god let your customers know ,
negative	because that was your problem not mine !
negative	i could have made other arrangements ,
negative	now i ' m just a mum short of dough ,
negative	please issue me now my full_refund
negative	or its off to the papers i ' ll go !!
negative	!
negative	last friday i was trying to purchase eminem tickets for wembley stadium .
negative	after trying a few_times i managed to get some and enter my details and paypal details , only after i had completed this the web_page then came up the tickets were no_longer available .
negative	00_minutes later i received an_email_saying that the tickets had been brought and the funds were leaving my account !!
negative	by this time i had already brought some tickets from another website as viagogo had said they were not available .
negative	i called viagogo straight_away and they refused to admit that something went wrong with the site and that they would not give me a refund and they told me the only way to get my money back was to re sell the tickets .
negative	.
negative	massive problem with this is i will loose money if i re sell the tickets and when i check the tickets i brought ( even_though they told me they had sold out !!)
negative	it wont give me a row or seat number making it virtually impossible to re sell them !
negative	it also still says the tickets are not available . they also told me that the tickets were from a 0rd_party seller and that they have to contact them to get my money back which is absolute lies because the third_party seller does not receive the money for the tickets until 0 days after the event !
negative	just to make things even better they e mailed me today saying the time of the concert had been changed from 00 : 00 to 00 : 00 .
negative	i called wembley to confirm this and they told me ever since the concert was first announced it started at 00 : 00 and that viagogo had made a mistake .
negative	so now even if i did decide to use the tickets i wouldnt be able to make the show at 00 : 00 because i dont finish work until then .
negative	viagogo does have a disclaimer on the website saying that times are subject to change but im sure this does not count when they out the wrong time in the first place and the actual venue has never changed the time !!!!
negative	!
negative	i want my £_000_pounds back and it looks_like the greedy people at viagogo are just going to keep hold of it and mess me about for as long as it takesand fob me off with different reasons as to why i cant have it back every time i call customer_services .
negative	stay well away buy tickets from direct site !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my order id is 0000000 .
negative	i am furious .......
negative	order number : 000a000000
negative	i strongly_recommend that you avoid purchasing a bed with dreams .
negative	i spent nearly £ 0 , 000 on a bed with dreams in january .
neutral	got a good deal at affordable_supplements .
neutral	one of the items included a 0kg box of cnp pro recover .
neutral	however when the package arrived , the cnp box has been cracked underneath and the handle at the top had been snapped off .
neutral	the crack has resulted_in about 000 - 000g spillage .
neutral	i was dissapointed about this and had to spend time transferring the contents to another box i had which had almost run out .
neutral	still a good deal but the inconvenience and loss of weight resulted_in me giving 0_stars .
neutral	why is your vat ridiculous now and why do you keep on raising my bill .
neutral	i ' m going to be paying £_00 a month at this rate for a rubbish phone
neutral	make it clear !!!
neutral	!
neutral	and plus gameseek people how long does it take to receive new stock ?!
neutral	order a few_days ago and kind of understand that its out of stock now !!!
neutral	well its just not good enough !!!
neutral	a game that i bought has to now be here in 00days for a birthday_present .
neutral	not trying to fob you off gameseek but if it doesn ' t get here in time i am going to have a extremely upset relative !
neutral	i have contacted you twice now urging that you really need to get stock of the item , sorry gameseek if it fails to deliver i will never recommend you because seeing a child upset isn ' t good !
neutral	not trying to play a gilt trip here because they never really work but please could you try your best to get bakugan defenders of the core psp game in stock , if this is at all possible you will knock [_link ] my favourite online store right off its pedal - stool .
neutral	oops starting to sound like gilt trip again ....
neutral	but anyway the point is that whatever item you need to try and get it in stock within like a week of it being out of stock ......
neutral	didn ' t receive product , so emailed customer_service .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	i called them up after 0 days and was told i would be called back later .
neutral	i wasn ' t that day so read reviews which said they don ' t always get back to you , they did saying it was sent to billing_address .
neutral	amateur mistake seeing as paypal says delivery address and you inputed it also .
neutral	i bought a ibiza 0 . 0 pa sound system which was a real let_down as it was faulty - on new years_eve !!!!
neutral	( first use )
neutral	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .
neutral	i took it to a repairer & after hifi - tower initially refused to pay the repair quote of £_00 , they then changed their minds and helpfully dealt_with the matter via telephone and offered me all the assistance i needed in order to get the repair paid for .
neutral	the customer_service has been ok , just a shame the product was faulty upon purchase causing a lot of un - needed stress and dissapointment .
neutral	ok i guess .
neutral	probably will go somewhere_else next time as their checkout wasn ' t super clear so my glasses got sent to an old address and i had to re order again .
neutral	they weren ' t overly bothered when i told them as the info is all their in checkout .
neutral	i ' m to blame but i expected a little more understanding in honesty .
neutral	i found love holidays by searching google - and was delighted with how easy the site is to navigate , and then purchase .
neutral	prices were great , information up to date - a refreshing start .
neutral	unfortunately , the faqs on their site did not match up with my experience .
neutral	the holiday deal was with a ' low_cost airline '.
neutral	according to the lh faqs , i was to expect my tickets 0 - 00 days before_departure .
neutral	0 days before_departure , i called as i had not received these , to be told they needed my passport number before allocating tickets .
neutral	staff were very friendly and helpful , but i did feel this was not good enough .
neutral	also , hotel vouchers were sent in an attachment called " invoice . pdf " - i did ' t open it , as you would have expected the file to be named appropriately .
neutral	so 0 phone_calls which really shouldn ' t have happened .
neutral	our beautiful new furniture arrived today .
neutral	it is exactly as_described on the website and just what i wanted .
neutral	unfortunately the delivery men struggled to get the chest of drawers upstairs for us and gave up leaving it in the centre of our living_room where we hoped to sleep tonight whilst the bedroom is being finished !
neutral	within 00 seconds of them leaving my husband measured the gap ( took the drawers out to make it lighter - not sure why the delivery guys didn ' t want to do this !)
neutral	and we had it upstairs in no time .
neutral	unfortunately they had already put 0 dents in my lovely new furniture when i pointed_out the dents the driver was very weary in his voice and stated he could ring the office but then they would have to take it away and rearrange - but since all our other furniture has already been disposed of i had little choice but to keep it dents and all .
neutral	so overall lovely product and i would use the company again but i ' ll be moving the furniture myself thanks !
neutral	i ' ll review hh in comparison to just - eat , the only alternative middle_man for takeaways .
neutral	hungry_house ' s menu system is better in some instances .
neutral	hh do 00_%_off offers sometimes , and pay cash back through sites like quidco .
neutral	hh doesn ' t accept the order live like je does ; you have to wait for an_email .
neutral	most_importantly , hh only has two restaurants in our postcode ( we live in county durham ); whereas je has 00 +.
neutral	the service has been good and i don ' t think we have too many complaints , but until the choice is more_than two restaurants i don ' t think we can rate higher_than three stars .
neutral	* edit *
neutral	edited the title , as i ' d put " hungry_house " instead of just - eat when making the comparison .
neutral	thanks for the reply too hungry_house .
neutral	glad to see the site is being used as it should .
neutral	har fine oplevelser med dem .
neutral	små detaljer har dog været irriterende :
neutral	kvaliteten af routeren er elendig .
neutral	kan maks være en på det trådløse ellers smider den mig af .
neutral	deres sikkerhedspakke havde jeg afmeldt men de trak alligevel penge .
neutral	a good mobile casino , easy access to your account , game lobby etc .
neutral	easy to contact customer support if needed .
neutral	casino would how ever benefit from afew more games to choose from .
neutral	i mean , the ordering was easy .
neutral	i then had to go on my other e_- mail to verify which i was okay with as it is added security .
neutral	but putting the code upside_down ?
neutral	i mean , i put a w as an m . ' incorrect code '.
neutral	i don ' t see how having the code upside_down adds to security .
neutral	i used to love this ... then i started_playing wow ...
neutral	i ' ve ordered from wowcher before and had no_problems , so i thought i ' d order again .
neutral	i ordered a shoe rack over 0 weeks_ago , for which the money has been taken out of my account , but not the posting .
neutral	so i ' m_assuming it still_hasn ' t been shipped .
neutral	i ' ve written emails to them , but no reply !
neutral	i order a few cd ' s at the beginning of december as christmas_presents , they hadn ' t arrived after a couple of weeks so i emailed there customer support .
neutral	i heard_nothing back but a few_days_later i had my cd ' s on my doorstep with the word priority written all over them , make of that as you will .
neutral	don ' t think i would be using this site again even if they are a few pounds cheaper .
neutral	0000000000000
neutral	i have t - mobile connection ( sim ) and i have been a long time customer .
neutral	what i like about t - mobile connection ?
neutral	good connectivity and decent customer_service .
neutral	it took 0 & 0 / 0 weeks for my products to arrive althought i think this was due to the mail & not beautycow & i didn ' t receive my free mascara , i will still be shopping with this site but a bit dissapointed .
neutral	i ' ve used liberette for a few_years now .
neutral	it ' s not a real mccoy clothes site .
neutral	it ' s about gaining the best immitation item you can find at a lower_price ..
neutral	i accept that .
neutral	yes , their sizes are quite small .
neutral	i do wish they ` d get bigger sizes in ..
neutral	i ' d buy from them much more if they did .
neutral	they have seals on their items which means if you break it you can ' t return it which i think is silly as well .
neutral	good for underwear but useless on one size items and stretchy items .
neutral	we need to try cloths on its a simple fact of purchasing .
neutral	in all .. cheap , cheerful and quick delivery .
neutral	some quality compromised for a lower_price .
neutral	just don ' t break that seal !
neutral	!
neutral	were not as helpful as they could have been when i had problems !
neutral	won ' t use again !
neutral	i do like pizza from the hut so can knock the food for what it is ........ but the website seems to always have problems with the page timing out at checkout , resulting in having to try and re order 0 or 0 times before it goes though .
neutral	have never had a problem getting media or games for play , but a couple of times orders from their gifts and gadgets have taken longer then the cds / dvds to arrive , and once was not in stock despite taking the order online .
neutral	would be happy to used them again as the competitive_prices out weigh deliver times !
neutral	i was greeted_by the reps at the aiport with no_problems , signed some paper work and the car was mine .
neutral	i selected a golf on the choice menu and was adviced i will get a golf or a similar car .
neutral	instead i got an old megan reno , a very long car which i am not used to driving .
neutral	i had to drive for 000_miles to get to my destination .
neutral	when i drove past 00 miles per hour , car was shaking and by the end of the journey i had a headache .
neutral	my dad told me that car shakes due to unbalanced tyres .
neutral	i was expecting a newer car that is easy and comfortable to drive .
neutral	wouldn ' t use this company again
neutral	never rated a company before on the web .
neutral	but , price was good ; service was good , arrived on time .
neutral	only_downside no instructions for the drum stool and hi hat stand was packed in brown paper and not boxed .
neutral	great selection of gear and at a good price , annoyingly i ' ve experienced issues when trying ( and paying ) for next_day service , they havent sent the goods out and havent let me know why until i have hassled them .
neutral	overall they are ok and i still use them , just not for critical stuff any more .
neutral	i was with 0 for a couple of years and at first seemed ok although the coverage wasn ' t that great and i was supposed to receive a 0g_signal everywhere around me but i didn ' t .
neutral	the worst thing about them was the endless calls from 0 trying to sell me another phone or contract , they would go through periods of ringing me four times a day for a week until i answered it !!
neutral	!
neutral	even when i answered it and said i don ' t want another phone they would carry on saying i could give it to a family_member or friend .... why the hell would i want to pay for someone_elses phone !
neutral	when i cancelled my contract the person was trying to sell me another one .... rediculous .
neutral	i waited 0 weeks only to receive the wrong book .
neutral	i had to call them up and arrange for another to be sent out , which took another 0 weeks .
neutral	i had to return the book they sent in error at my own cost , which i wasn ' t happy about , because it what they sent me was a hardback and it weighed a lot .
neutral	but , this is the only time i ' ve had problems with them .
neutral	when ordering dvds they ' re brilliant .
neutral	i think they should offer more swagbucks for everything you do .
neutral	i mean , i never watch those videos , and i bet no one else does either , but it takes nearly 00_minutes to earn 0 swagbucks by ' watching ' them , and 000 = £ 0 .
neutral	and i ' m not a geek and i wouldn ' t click through ads hundreds of times just to earn some pocket money .
neutral	think about it .
neutral	conclusion : they really should be more generous on the amount of swagbucks awarded , or lower the price of the gift cards .
neutral	a good network but very slow to connect when you lose and gain signal , also very expensive when you go abroad and make calls and use internet ( more_than any network i have been with before ).
neutral	the price is very competitive , however , when i arrived in cancun , there was no driver with a large sign waiting .
neutral	i spent about 00_mins looking for the right person and it turned_out they had been wandering around not by the arrivals exit and they only had an a0 clipboard which had multiple other logos on too , so was not easily identifiable .
neutral	then had to wait about 00_mins for the van .
neutral	another comment : the website is confusing to use if you want to book one way transfers out of resort as the boxes refer to inbound flights and the wording swaps around between pages - maybe look_into it .
neutral	overall i was pleased with the service for the price though and my return transfer ran perfectly .
neutral	microsoft are the leaders when it comes to software in my opinion but they rarely listen to their customers on what they would like to see or need in a program upgrade .
neutral	they are a very american company in the way they run and this does not always fit well with how businesses should be in the united_kingdom .
neutral	they like to have their own piece of everything and if someone does something better then they just try and kill off competition with buying companies out or buying exclusive content / hardware for themselves .
neutral	customer support is not very good at all either , usually stuck on the phone with an indian_call_centre for hours when it should have been done it 00 to 00_minutes .
neutral	seeing amazon grow over the years has been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different_types of goods .
neutral	the problem with amazon is that when you have faulty_goods or problems they arent always very helpful .
neutral	i had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them ( they say the sale of goods_act is a load of rubbish ) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty_goods .
neutral	also bad if you have to return damaged goods , its at your own_expense and in most_cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded_delivery so the item is traceable in the mail .
neutral	not a good way for a company to work .
neutral	i have always used paypal and i have accepted certain charges but now whenever i sell items on ebay i have to pay a large percentage to paypal :( most items i sell don ' t sell for much anyway !
neutral	i ' d accept it , even if it was a much lower percent of the income .
neutral	maybe more simelar to ebay charges which averages around 00p for me for an item that i sell for £ 0 .
neutral	i love fb and i use it constantly .
neutral	it does everything i need it to and it doesnt need to keep changing to be like other_websites !
neutral	it was betetr when it was a little_bit more simple .
neutral	the simplicity was what separated it and made it stand out from the other social network websites !
neutral	we ordered save the date magnets from bride and groom_direct with the promise they would be shipped within 0 to 0 days of the order .
neutral	after two_weeks with no news i rang to chase them up and was told the carrier cards were out of stock .
neutral	i was annoyed that we hadn ' t had a simple email or phone call to explain the delay .
neutral	when they did eventually arrive a month later than promised , they were lovely cards .
neutral	we may use them again as the products were so good but we will be ordering a long time in_advance !
neutral	i was already perfectly happy with nespresso and their pods , but they simply don ' t offer enough variety for me .
neutral	so i was glad to find bclc , who seemed to be well thought of in reviews and came_across professionally from their website .
neutral	having tried my first few pods now i ' ve got mixed views on them as a long_term viable alternative to genuine nespresso .
neutral	obviously the price is good and on top of that my initial opinion is that the blends are high_quality .
neutral	strangely it seems like the water comes out hotter with these pods than nespresso ' s own , which is a good thing , but i guess i could be imagining that .
neutral	the down sides are quite considerable and have been mentioned by others , namely the packaging needs a lot of improvement ( i ' m sure that will come , given they ' re a new brand ) but more worryingly my nespresso machine ' s pump seems to need to work a lot harder to get the job_done .
neutral	the lungo pull takes a good while longer_than with regular nespresso pods , with the coffee coming out at a much slower trickle , and so far 00_% of the pods i ' ve used haven ' t ejected properly , leaving the nespresso machine flashing its lights in protest !
neutral	a quick couple of taps on the lungo button resolved the issue , but there certainly isn ' t full compatibility there yet and i have no_idea if this is causing any damage to the machine .
neutral	so , overall i ' ve been reasonably satisfied with my initial batch ' s flavour , but i ' ll need to live with them a while longer before_deciding to buy again .
neutral	and by that time nespresso might have launched their new vertuoline machine in the uk , with the redesigned pods , which will be an interesting development for both companies !
neutral	well , good items , shopped few_times .... good shopping_experience .... worth a try .
neutral	good but a bit more expinsive than go direct sometims ...
neutral	e_- mailed them early yesterday to confirm track and send numbers for flowers i ' ve ordered and still had nothing .
neutral	none of the flowers have been delivered up to yet so yeah getting really worried .
neutral	i have used this company on several occasionsand the service has always been excellent .
neutral	i have no_hesitation in reccommending them to anyone .
neutral	ordered a few_times .
neutral	these_guys are okay but sometimes there is a stock problem that they don ' t let you know about until after you ' ve ordered .
neutral	not an issue , but would be nice to know at time of ordering .
neutral	the booking was okay i guess , despite being promised £_00 off if i booked before a certain_date and then never materialising once booked !
neutral	the activities ( its a knockout ) and the nightclub were okay other than the fact we were strictly informed to be at club before 00pm for the guestlist_entry and vip ( as paid for ), so we left the restaurant / bar in a rush to ensure we got there in time .
neutral	we got there at about 0 . 00pm only to be find no queue and the club not opening until 00pm , so we hung around like a load of desparados !
neutral	eventually we went in , didnt even ask for party name , as they werent expecting us , i enquired_about booking a table as i noticed some had been reserved , to which the manager explained that she didn ' t know what had been promised by hen_heaven , but it was extra for a table reservation and she didn ' t have any available , so instead gave us a wristband each for an exclusive part of the club - whcih she , didn ' t have to do .
neutral	we sorted out surfing as an extra activity external to hen_heaven and glad i did , as it was only the activity organisers that seemed to do anything right !
neutral	very much doubt i would hen_heaven again , would rather source activities myself without the expensive overheads that hen_heaven do
neutral	but dont use dpd again !
neutral	sent flowers to a friend as a congratulations for her new job , she was delighted as she was sent flowers .
neutral	however i wasn ' t as impressed as i had hoped i would be as they didn ' t look like the photo on the webpage .
neutral	they looked rather slim and a bit old to be honest .......
neutral	my order hadn ' t been delivered , only part , so phoned them up to see where the rest was .
neutral	their phone_lines are terrible .
neutral	i phoned twice in the morning yesterday , no one answered both_times .
neutral	i was waiting for about 0 mins each time and then there was a ring and an_automated_message_saying they were closed .
neutral	it was 00am .
neutral	finally got through in the afternoon .
neutral	was told there was a problem with the supplier .
neutral	i was only told today that there has been a problem for 0 weeks .
neutral	makes me wonder if i hadn ' t have phoned , would anything have been said to me ?
neutral	i phoned today and had the same problem phoning , saying they were closed etc .
neutral	when i got through i explained again my problem , and i was offered a refund of the lead and the rest of the order sent out .
neutral	i don ' t know why the rest of the order couldn ' t have been sent anyway .
neutral	but oh well .
neutral	got there in the end .
neutral	it ' s a shame , because i ' m a bit_iffy about using their service now as their website doesn ' t say if something is out of stock .
neutral	i only went with envirofone because i had read they pay you the same day as soon as the phone has been checked over .
neutral	i wouldn ' t go with them again simply because of this .
neutral	i had to wait a week for my payment after they got my phone .
neutral	i actually phoned when i had an_email_saying they had my phone .
neutral	i waited until 0pm for the money but i asked them why i hadn ' t had it .
neutral	i was told it isn ' t same day and loads of people had also said the same_thing i did to them .
neutral	so sort it out and make it clear to customers !
neutral	they ' ve got very repetitive promotions , normally in places that are not very known ... prices are ok but nothing exceptional .
neutral	you really have to look for it , to not miss a good promotion as there ' s only a real good deal once in a while .
neutral	very disappointed the item hasn ' t arrived yet as it is a christmas_present and i am worried i won ' t have time to exchange if not liked
neutral	after seeing all these posts i am wondering what is going on .
neutral	i also paid for the tracking service and like everyone_else have not had a tracking link , my girlfriend just text me to say they have still not arrived and she finished work at 0 - 00 .
neutral	if they cannot make a courier paid delivery by 0 - 00 when i ordered last_week for valentines_day then what is the point in buying the flowers ?
neutral	wish they had a phone number to ring , all i can do is hope they arrive by 0 - 00 otherwise she will get them tomorrow which i will be seriously annoyed about .
neutral	will update my rating to 0 if they arrive on valentines_day !
neutral	order no 00000
neutral	should have been confused . com
neutral	got bf0 ( russian ed ) for 00 £ it was not instant delivery despite the advertising saying it was , i got it after 0 + hours but i did get it in the end .
neutral	and it worked_fine , but it has made me think_twice about using them again .
neutral	you pay peanuts , you get monkeys .
neutral	this company has disgusting customer_service i receive an_email_saying my order has been dispatched , so i take today off work to await my order , i call citylink who have stated that my order has not arrived , i then phone the drink shop to which the receptionist who has no_idea about customer_service casually remarks with no hint of sympathy or regret that yea they received an_email this morning and it was he fault that i had not been informed , i await my call back from a manager with great anticipation .
neutral	got a call back from a manager on the day we ad a chat about what went wrong and the company then shipped my order for next_day delivery which did arrive on time thankfully hopefully the incident i referred to in the paragraph above is a blip and a one off incident as the company appear to have fixed their customer_service . issues
neutral	was happy with the product , no damage and arrived quickly .
neutral	slightly annoyed with the courier as they left the parcel outside our door , no attempt made to ring the doorbell or knock on the door .
neutral	no_idea how long my package was left there for .
neutral	they took 0 days to dispatch a special delivery ( which cost 00 pound )
neutral	they have varied prices for varied number of days which isnt there on other_sites .
neutral	hostels are not that easy to find and in general the number of clicks required to get done with booking are more_than competing sites like hostelbookers
neutral	website crashes / times out often which is a little annoying .
neutral	once order was received , we received a confirmation_email and follow_up which was good .
neutral	delivery was quick and well_packaged although we are missing the ' thank_you ' cards that should have arrived free with the order ( we received the envelopes just not the cards ).
neutral	my only complaint would be that the finishing fold is not perfect .
neutral	i can appreciate that the card is pretty thick meaning that a crease fold would be difficult but i do feel this could be completed a little better .
neutral	i was super excited to receive my wonder woman outfit ( which was brilliantly priced !)
neutral	and it came really quickly so i couldn ' t resist trying it on as soon as i could !
neutral	unfortunately , the costume was too big for me so i put it back in the packet ( folded and sealed again ) and contacted jokers ' straight_away .
neutral	that was a good while ago and still no reply , usually customer_services are reliable and fast , so now i don ' t know what to do with my item !
neutral	it ' s my 00th_birthday in a few weeks so i hope i get an exchange by then .
neutral	not impressed at all with the service , despite its fast arrival .
neutral	very disappointed :(
neutral	the sizes are very strange , very long legs on trousers .
neutral	my cardigan had a very short torso and huge arms !
neutral	also , the label was cut out ?...
neutral	( what ' a that all about ?).
neutral	i would recommend buying small clothes and shoes a size larger , the shoe sizes are very strange and it ' s very annoying waiting for something to arrive and for it to not fit at all !
neutral	i ' ve been the same clothes / shoe size for god_knows_how long , so it ' s definitely their sizes and not a growth spurt lol .
neutral	to sum it up , it ' s just market quality crap .
neutral	not a good start .
neutral	opened an account as had a voucher for get £_00 off if u spend £_00 or more .
neutral	brought a pair of boots which were faulty .
neutral	arranged an exchange but had to call again to bring price of boots back down .
neutral	then had to call again because very sent wrong_size .
neutral	exchanged but had to call again to put voucher back on .
neutral	after the 0rd time my boots were right but cost me around £_00 in phone_calls !
neutral	!
neutral	i get a lot of packages from dhl and it ’_s only gone wrong once .
neutral	but it went really wrong !
neutral	i rarely need proper next_day delivery but as luck would have it ; that ’_s the one that went sour .
neutral	i needed something urgent for the weekend and it was thursday , so i called the vendor and he assured me it would be sent out strait away .
neutral	friday came and went and .
neutral	nothing .
neutral	i called dhl , which was a real hassle ( they have no uk customer_service number , so i ended_up dialling ‘ international sales ’ and asked them to put me through ), they said that i wasn ’ t in , which i was , and they need the number off the card to rearrange delivery , i had no card .
neutral	anyway after a huge ordeal i got it re - delivered on the monday , no good to me at all ; and never got any kind of refund on the service !
neutral	crap .
neutral	but that ’_s one bad_experience nestled in amongst a great many good ones !
neutral	i am unable to claim my £_00 discount_code , trying many_times to contact them but received no responses so far .
neutral	however , the first booking was perfect , everything went well .
neutral	hope that someone would help me sort it out !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the book is really nice but i wasn ' t impressed with the quality of the photos in the photobook .
neutral	i have the same photos done in a photobook from photobox and the quality from them was brilliant , no pixels at all .
neutral	for that reason i wont be using again or recommending as it has put me off .
neutral	regards
neutral	its alright but i wouid use amazon as they are more reliable and legit
neutral	its ok but i wouid just shop for it
neutral	the delivery was terrible , i paid for next_day delivery but my nicece never recived them they said i that they left them in the porch .
neutral	the porch is an open porch near to the main path so if they did deliverer the flowers anyone could of stolen them . on the postive side they did redeliver some new flowers but a few_days_later and i still paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	the flowers were beauiful .
neutral	accommodation was not stag_doo friendly and showers were terrible !
neutral	bar_crawl that was apparently a party pass was not even heard of in any of the bars on the list so a waste of time .
neutral	" guestlist_entry to chy bar " no guest_list as it was free entry to everyone anyway .
neutral	quad_biking and clay_pigeon shooting were excellent but we still feel after asking around we could of organised the whole_thing for cheaper but thanks anyway chillisauce .
neutral	i ordered a printer on 0 / 0 / 00 , received the order acknowledgement and patiently_waited for delivery .
neutral	today , 00 / 0 / 00 , still nothing received so i checked the tracking online and nothing was found so i called up and was told that the order placed last_week did not go through properly at their end and i ' ll need to go back online an re - order .
neutral	ok , a bit of a faff and a shame that no - one followed this up with me for over a week , but i go to the site and select the same printer & it is now 00_% more_expensive .
neutral	boo !
neutral	poor me , so no sale after all that & i ' ll have to go somewhere_else now .
neutral	it is really great and cheap for visiing .
neutral	just one flaw , you must travel off_peak , which is really not convenient .
neutral	i ordered an akai mpd00 online from fairdeal music .
neutral	( after i went to there physical store in birmingham and they didn ' t have it !)
neutral	so i was recommended to purchase it online .
neutral	i ordered it on a wednesday and it came a week_later , which the person told me in the store that it will only take 0 business days !
neutral	but overall , i have bought things from them in the past .
neutral	but a week was a bit to much to wait , when i was told 0 business days for delivery !
neutral	kvaliteten og farver kan variere fra det man ser på_hjemmesiden til det produkt man modtager .
neutral	deres størrelser i både sko og tøj er_ikke til at stole på .
neutral	jeg_har i alt bestil 0 par sko fra nelly , alle i str .
neutral	00 .
neutral	de tre af parrene var for små , svarende til ca .
neutral	en 00 , og et_par var nærmere en str .
neutral	00 .
neutral	én ud_af tre kjoler bestil på nelly har_været helt anderledes i kvalitet , farve og størrelse end det jeg_så på_hjemmesiden .
neutral	en anden kjole og snydt med formen på ærmerne .
neutral	grunden til at nelly får tre stjerner , er den gratis og hurtige levering og at deres produkter i knap halvdelen af tilfældene lever op_til forventningerne .
neutral	jeg_vil til enhver tid advare venner , der ønsker at bestille varer hos nelly .
neutral	always seems to be trying to trick you on the website .
neutral	ridiculous charges on luggage , of course great if you don ' t need checked in luggage , but they must know very few people are travelling without anything that can ' t be taken in the cabin .
neutral	i continue to use ebay on and off , for selling and buying .
neutral	i can see that there is a problem with the balance of burden on the seller in conflicts , though have been lucky_enough to not deal with dishonest buyers .
neutral	products are cheap , but there are a lot of fake , replica , poor quality products .
neutral	hatched are great if you don ' t need someone to do viewings for you and you want the full online suite of documentation as standard ( floor plans , lots of photos , downloadable epc , right move coverage etc ).
neutral	the price is right !
neutral	however , they are like any other estate_agent after that , they don ' t do anything pro actively , you have to chase and hassle all the time to get any information or if you want your sale / purchase chasing up .
neutral	they even know our sale had completed until a week after the fact !
neutral	but this is usual nonsense from estate_agents and you can at_least console yourself with the fact they are cheap .
neutral	i am a true apple fanboy and the products get better and better .
neutral	i have had apple products for the last 00 years using every os since os 0 .
neutral	support is great , especially since the advent of the apple retail_stores where i can book a slot at the genius bar and get my problem sorted in store most of the time .
neutral	however the only reason for the three star_rating and not five is that the products build_quality is decreasing rapidly .
neutral	this year i have had 00 imac ' s scratching optical discs , three ipad ' s with faulty sound , two ipad 0 ' s with faults , 0 macbook chargers fail , 00 hdd failures and an ipod_touch with a flickery screen .
neutral	i manage three schools mac networks to a total of 000 apple desktops and three servers .
neutral	the removal of the xserve and the simplifying of os x server has seriously knocked my confidence in apple as a company .
neutral	i only hope tim cook can rescue the state of the company before it ' s too_late and it goes entirely os devices only .
neutral	they sell good posters .
neutral	i ' ve got 0 posters from the walking dead from them .
neutral	however i found the service better if ordered from amazon rather_than there actual site .
neutral	i tried entering a 00_%_off code on their site which didn ' t work i sent an_email to tell them that was 0 weeks_ago and i haven ' t heard a thing back .
neutral	customer_service and communication could be improved and maybe if they checked there emails once in a while .
neutral	they delivered the flowers and they were lovely but they delivered them on the wrong date !
neutral	you can ' t seem to get my orders to me on release day !
neutral	again today a game which is released today i haven ' t recieved .
neutral	if i know i am going to get them after the weekend i wouldn ' t order online and just go and buy from a shop !
neutral	so i ' m not satisfied with your turnaround in getting new games to me .
neutral	i ' ve recently set_up a standard business account , but despite having another business account and 0 personal accounts already with hsbc , the process was far from smooth .
neutral	case in point : i needed to fill out a form to enable payments through online_banking , which i dutifully filled out and dropped_off at my branch .
neutral	0 weeks and 0 follow_up calls later , and i ' m still unable to make online payments ( the form said it would take 0 - 0 working_days ).
neutral	i just got a call from someone at the branch , who has only just got to my form because he ' just got back '.
neutral	when i asked from where , he said ' business trip '.
neutral	i kind of doubt the truth of this .
neutral	what kind of business sends a middle management employee on a 0 week business trip with no cover ?
neutral	while i don ' t expect banking to be a luxury experience , hsbc is closer to kfc than ba .
neutral	in spite of this , the telephone support_team are doing a good job .
neutral	its sometimes a long wait to get through to someone ( that hold music ....), but once you do , they are polite , helpful , and feel_like a safe pair of hands .
neutral	didnt recieve items on day i was expecting was just sat in depot for few_days ( weather not an excuse ) also did not get any information about products arriving late or when i will be recieving the rest of what i had ordered ??
neutral	the products i did recieve were fine on arrival .
neutral	chillisauce offer a great service , the choice is very wide ranging and website is very easy to use .
neutral	however , the product at the end of it is not worth - in my opinion - what you pay for .
neutral	we all paid £_000 for two_nights dorm accomodation in bristol , night club_entry and deep sea fishing .
neutral	a very brisk bit of research uncovers the fact that the beds that we were in cost £_00 per_night .
neutral	that leaves £_000 for deep sea fishing that lasted 0 hours and we had to pay to get to .
neutral	it was in cardiff and cost a fortune for us to hire a mini_bus for the day !
neutral	not great value for money .
neutral	and i very much doubt that the chaps on the boat took home £ 000pp .
neutral	as for the night club_entry we did take_advantage of this but we had to be there before 00 which , i ' m sure , you can get for free anyway .
neutral	chillisauce offer a good service in that they take all the organisation out of your hands .
neutral	however , if you ' re wiling to spend an evening arranging it yourself i believe you could get the same product for about half of the price .
neutral	was a little disappointing that some books i purchased were late to be delivered , but other than that , good service .
neutral	hostelworld is a great website to use when comparing hostels , prices , reviews plus they have an interesting blog and spend a lot of time on all social_media .
neutral	i just don ' t understand_why they keep their ( pretty high ) booking_fees !
neutral	it can become very expensive when booking a lot of places , and especially when you ' re booking one night ' s accommodation that ' s possibly only costing you 00_euros , it costs you 00_% again just for the privilege of booking with them .
neutral	there are other_websites that are just as good that don ' t charge anything , like europe ' s famous hostels and hostelbookers .
neutral	the delivery was really fast , however the boxing was badly_damaged , and after i had opened the box , it came apparent that the wood had a bit chipped off , nothing big .
neutral	furthermore , i had witness the delivery man dropped the boxing , i ' m not too sure whether this caused the damage or somewhere_else during dispatch .
neutral	it is a shame , but it isn ' t a big piece that is damaged .
neutral	would like the one piece to be replaced though .
neutral	gear0music is a great company where i have always purchased my music equipment from , and will_continue to buy from them in the future .
neutral	as this is the only time i have ever had a problem .
neutral	the order process was very quick and will be having my tyres_fitted tomorrow .
neutral	i ordered a product in a particular colour and size .
neutral	i got the size wrong , which is my fault , but the product that arrived was the wrong_colour .
neutral	sweatband gave me a partial_refund , and didn ' t cover the cost of my return_postage .
neutral	i can understand this if size was the only problem and that was my fault , but the colour was their fault , so i think they could at_least have given me a full_refund , even if not covering my return_postage cost .
neutral	apart_from that customer_services were quick responding and helpful and ordering and speed of delivery was good .
neutral	the value for money ratio is quite good .
neutral	however , the food quality doesn ' t seem to be the best .
neutral	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
neutral	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
neutral	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
neutral	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
neutral	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer_service lines .
neutral	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
neutral	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
neutral	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer_service via his customer_service line .
neutral	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer_service line .
neutral	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
neutral	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
neutral	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
neutral	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
neutral	now , let me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
neutral	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
neutral	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
neutral	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
neutral	i had spent over £_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
neutral	moral of the story ?
neutral	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd ...
neutral	the silver lining .
neutral	i like this website
neutral	good experience ordering , and communications were good up until delivery .
neutral	then it went_downhill with messages not passed between made and the delivery company .
neutral	product arrived and it ' s ok . quite average craftsmanship .
neutral	the tiles are perfect - fantastic value , and a great product .
neutral	the delivery not so good .
neutral	£_00 delivery charge for our order and they don ' t even deliver to your flat .
neutral	driver told us they can ' t even go up steps , leaving us with hundreds of kilos of tiles on the floor outside our apartment building .
neutral	not so classy , guys .
neutral	im on 0mb connection however the connection is sooo slow , im hard wired and i have problems with my iphone , laptop and xbox speed .
neutral	i ordered a full bathroom for over 0k and am happy with the product and the quality .
neutral	we ordered
neutral	- left hand l shaped whirlpool shower bath with 0 jets .
neutral	it ' s wonderful but difficult to get around the screen to clean the bath .
neutral	- cube dual with quadrato head and ceiling arm .
neutral	very pretty
neutral	- quadra waterfall bath filler .
neutral	- quadra waterfall side lever basin mixer tap .
neutral	everyone love this .
neutral	- prima soft close toilet seat .
neutral	does exactly_what it says on the tin !
neutral	my issue , and the reason for only giving three stars was with the lack of knowledge and near rudeness with the numerous sales_reps over the phone .
neutral	it was a more complaicated order as i was paying from overseas but they made no effort to try and find a solution .
neutral	in the end a wonderful sales agent , simon thomas from the wigan branch provided a solution .
neutral	without him they would have lost the sale to a competitor .
neutral	i ordered the digital version of pes0000 and they sent me the serial_number after 00_hours !!
neutral	( while they said they would in maximum 0 hours )
neutral	the whole point of buying the digital version of a game is getting your hands on the game asap .. poor service in my opinion
neutral	i ' ve purchased suits in store and the customer_service and quality has been fantastic .
neutral	when purchasing on - line however , the customer_service is non_existent .
neutral	phoning the customer_service team over a period of three days led to no response .
neutral	only when i put my issue on the public profile of their facebook_page did i get a response .
neutral	the clothing is of good quality , there is no issue there .
neutral	i just wish they would actually have a customer_service team you could instantly get hold of .
neutral	just as i expected , nothing too fancy but not too bad either .
neutral	did the job and for a a cheap flight and i had a great holiday .
neutral	treated myself to a business class seat from arlanda to heathrow .
neutral	the business lounge was very bland .
neutral	boarding the aircraft , i found two children sat in my seat , asked them to move , to which a very rude father replied that i should seat where the children should be sitting .
neutral	the cabin_crew did nothing to resolve the situation , so i was left sitting in the wrong seat .
neutral	polite cabin_crew otherwise but bland food .
neutral	on time .
neutral	i have when been a customer of t - mobile been unfortunate to have received poor coverage on my mobile , however with the recent merging of signals with orange then this could really improve their total coverage throughout the uk >
neutral	did the job but prices not the cheapest !
neutral	i have ordered in the past and after two orders having fraud charges following them i decided not to order from this site anymore .
neutral	one thing however , their prices are the best around and that comes in handy when needing to support ones fitness habits .
neutral	plus they beat_competitors prices which is always a benefit .
neutral	one detractor is the shipping cost but when you use the thanks0 coupon_code it basically discounts the shipping to what you might pay with other_sites .
neutral	im giving a neutral review as for right now due to anticipating another possible fraud charge which i hope doesnt happen a third time ..
neutral	i enjoy shopping the large selections and the insane discounts i just cant seem to get my head around the fraud purchases me and my friends have received so this is only to be aware of the possibility of it happening to all the customers out there .
neutral	please call the customer_service line to report any fraud so they can immediately jump on it .
neutral	they cant fix it and find the problem if no one speaks up .
neutral	overall i like this company will update my review at a later date .
neutral	i ' ve ordered tickets to wwe raw in the 00 dublin .
neutral	not sure if viagogo can help here but i ordered the tickets in july & the event is in 0 weeks & i haven ' t heard_anything from them since .
neutral	i usually don ' t panic but i spent a serious amount of cash on these tickets so i ' m starting to worry !
neutral	any help would be great !
neutral	you can ' t buy everything u like because they dissapear from your basket before checkout .
neutral	even if it was in basket and i ' ve paid ... i didn ' t get one item because of an internal error :( also in trousers sizes i can ' t find any measurements and i ' m stuck with 0 pair tooo tight for me that i ' ve ordered in my normal size .
neutral	i ' m basing this on a few purchases made over the last few_years .
neutral	generally , the prices are pretty good on expansys , offering cheaper alternatives to expensive branded products .
neutral	the delivery is actually pretty good and i have had no issues there .
neutral	i have two main things to complain_about .
neutral	firstly , they send a lot of marketing emails ( an_email every 0 - 0 days ).
neutral	i would prefer if they had a more intelligent system , whereby they sent me specific offers i would be interested in .
neutral	my second complaint is about the lightning to 00 - pin adapter i bought - i know trustpilot isn ' t generally for product reviews , but this was an expansys branded product so i feel it is justified .
neutral	the product description showed the same features as the standard apple adapter - support for charging , sync , analog audio , usb audio , and yet the product did not work as designed with a docking station or fm transmitter .
neutral	i am still_awaiting a response from expansys on this , after which i may update this review .
neutral	ordering online was much_easier , especially with available sizes .
neutral	however , there are a few improvements i would suggest :
neutral	0 .
neutral	some of the imagery is not sufficient for you to see the product .
neutral	it was only because i had been in store that i knew what the product actually looked like .
neutral	for example , with the occasion suits , you are offered things like shirts on the same page , with no detailed images of the shirts being worn without the suit jacket .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the navigation on the site looks good , but makes it difficult to see the difference_between certain products .
neutral	it ' s a pain to have to go through various frames of what is effectively a flash banner just to get to the correct product .
neutral	great for mindless browsing , not so good for finding what you want .
neutral	0 .
neutral	charging shipping on a £_000 order is a bit cheeky .
neutral	from all the online shopping i have done , i have found even where shipping isn ' t free ( it normally is ), it is at_least free for higher value orders ( e . g .
neutral	over £_00 or over £_000 ).
neutral	0 .
neutral	while i like the idea of not being charged for your product until you are happy with it , it makes the ordering_process confusing .
neutral	it also tries to lure you into subscribing to the magazine without making recurring charges clear .
neutral	also , there seems to be no option to pay the amount straight_away - it seems you need to wait for a statement .
neutral	i guess you are working on the fact that people may forget to pay for their goods , allowing you to charge interest ?
neutral	quality of the products were good .
neutral	shipping was on time so no_complaints on that side .
neutral	i do get a lot of emails from groupon ( at_least 0 a day , sometimes up to 0 ).
neutral	i think their emails should be more targeted and specific .
neutral	i don ' t want to have to sift through tens of offers to find the ones most suited to me .
neutral	surely you can ask for more information in the user profile and then choose offers accordingly ?
neutral	on a more positive note , the offers are usually pretty good .
neutral	i ' ve taken_advantage of a couple of them .
neutral	i have used this company many_times , the items i have ordered have arrived quickly but packaging can be lacking .
neutral	my most_recent order i specified a day for delivery because i wasn ' t in , but the package turned_up in less_than 00hrs .
neutral	impressive speed but not much good if your not in .
neutral	luckily a family_member was at home at the time of delivery .
neutral	the item i had ordered arrived in a robust box but was far to big and had no packaging to stop it rolling around .
neutral	again i was lucky the manufacture had done a better job with its own packaging so the item arrived in good condition .
neutral	in general the company are fast and cheap but dont always follow delivery instructions .
neutral	packaging can arrive well boxed but on occasions like my last order in a big empty box left to rattle around .
neutral	i found that three had a decent price for the iphone .
neutral	however the reception isn ' t great in all areas .
neutral	the online billing services is fairly good .
neutral	overall a good service let_down by the network_coverage .
neutral	i have been with bt for many years and although i had little problems with them , i find that it becomes more trouble when you are calling them .
neutral	you really need to be patient , and i am not that patient , as i hate to go through telephone systems , hence my 0_stars !
neutral	it feels good to be able to express ourselves sometimes !
neutral	nevertheless , their products are generally quality !
neutral	in my order status i ask you people a question why it isn ' t answered ?
neutral	well_organized but a little too expensive .
neutral	wish there was a schedule , you can never know when the bus will arrive .
neutral	this is just for hk , never used them in other cities .
neutral	i have always found that lidl have been good for people that like to shop for food & a few extra bits here & there on a budget there selection of meat it quite good ( in packets ofc ) and being a single guy with not that much time on his hands that suits be just fine .
neutral	the offers they have from time to time are good also but you always find that the stores near you either arnt running the offer or never get alot in of the products on offer .
neutral	either way im happy with shopping at lidl its shopping @ a budget with some nice products for the price .
neutral	i must_say i am happy with the quality of the delivery .
neutral	however , way too expensive .
neutral	ok casino but like all gamesys sites it can be very unfair !
neutral	most times my deposits are gone within 0 - 00_minutes .
neutral	they offer a daily free game which used to be good .
neutral	no matter what i used to have atleast 00 free_spins a week but after a while it stopped giving me them .. i had a couple of months cool off and started depositing again but it ' s now been 00 weeks since i won on the daily free game .
neutral	makes you not want go go on when your losing your deposits most times and not getting anything back like free_spins .
neutral	casino ' s need to think more about their players and not just the money thats coming in .
neutral	a little something back is always nice .
neutral	i rate this casino 0 / 00
neutral	used to be my # 0 casino to make deposit ' s but my experience suddenly changed !
neutral	after a while virgin games just stopped paying out on the slot machines , every deposit made was just gone within 00_minutes if that !
neutral	they also have a daily free game you can do and collect eggs till the end of the month for guaranteed free_spins and / or cash but you only ever get 0 egg which = a spin .
neutral	i used to get atleast 0 free_spins a week but now when i do my free games it ' s mostly no wins and i ' ve not had free_spins for a while now .
neutral	i deceided to take a cool off from the site at the start of the year as the chat_host i was speaking too was very rude and unprofessional .
neutral	i complained on the last day of the month ( monthly game that offers guaranteed spins or cash ) that i wasn ' t winning on the free games and it had been a while since i won off virgin even after all the deposits made .. other members and the chat_host ' s posts were nasty and it was like they was all telling_me to just go !
neutral	my last reply was " virgin games has just lost themselfs a regular depositing player " and the chat_host ' s reply was " ok , see you tomorrow " like i just come on for the free games ?
neutral	i ' ve recently started doing my free games again and it ' s been 0 - 0 weeks .
neutral	i have still not had my free_spins yet , so .. since my cool off , nothing has changed .
neutral	i will_continue to make deposit ' s on virgin games but not like i used too !
neutral	i have disabled chat so i don ' t have to deal with any chat_host ' s anymore !
neutral	virgin games needs to get_rid of chat_host ' s .
neutral	the only chat_host that took her job seriously was esme but she has gone now .
neutral	i think virgin games needs to update there casino more often and offer better bonuses like deposit matches and free_spins for new game releases , just a pound bonus puts a smile on everybody ' s face !
neutral	there is casino ' s online now that make you want to deposit on that site ... virgin games just dont offer that .
neutral	they are good at providing information and tirned up on time .
neutral	but the guys who delivered our sofa refused to unpack it and take the cardboard away as was part of the deal when we bought them .
neutral	we contacted the seller and they made yodel come back to collect the rubbish .
neutral	quite happy with the main product and speed of delivery , but unfortunately the manufacturer had changed the item : this hadn ' t been reflected in the product description .
neutral	in essence , we ' d chosen the item because the ' freebie ' it came with made it good value compared to other sellers .
neutral	unfortunately , the freebie item was no_longer included .
neutral	when i contacted customer_services , they were great , apologised and assured me that they would contact the manufacturer , who would send the ' missing ' item directly .
neutral	this was followed the next_day by another email_confirming that the item would be sent , but then by yet another email the day after , telling us that the product had been changed and no_longer came with the freebie .
neutral	no offer was made of a partial_refund or other recompense , which was disappointing , and i got no further reply when i emailed to complain .
neutral	a shame , as up to that point was happy with the service .
neutral	very easy to use and straight_forward to use with the latest deal going on .
neutral	i ordered flowers for valentines_day , which arrived looking nothing like the flowers that i had ordered .
neutral	it was missing all but one type of flower that it should have and in the other flowers place was just green leaves .
neutral	i ' ve ordered from see tickets a few_times and although the tickets push it a little in arriving , i haven ' t been let_down yet .
neutral	whilst their prices are brilliant i feel that their customer_service leaves a lot to be desired as i bought an iron from them 0 month_ago and it broke .
neutral	when i tried to return it they tried to make out that i had dropped it !!
neutral	won ' t buy from them again .
neutral	the repayments are great but the price of the products are very expensive compared to other shops .
neutral	i ' ve allowed myself to be limited in which items i can buy due to the prices which is a shame .
neutral	i recommend little woods all the time to people but there ' s a catch prices are higher then other_retailers .
neutral	food is good and reasnoble if you use a voucher but it never seems hot enough .
neutral	cookie was undercooked and coke tasted like carbonated water coloured brown .
neutral	sometimes things are in stock and you get good service ( guildford branch ) othertimes things are out of stock ( including their warehouse ) and the service is lousy or the product is damaged and has to be returned .
neutral	i tend to go to toolstation instead of screwfix .
neutral	the prices are cheaper and service is better .
neutral	come on screwfix get your act_together and you could be a good company again !
neutral	i purchased a masuri titanium cricket helmet for my friend ’_s birthday , he loved the helmet , but the masuri titanium cricket helmet was dirty .
neutral	event thought the masuri titanium cricket helmet was in new unopened packing , the helmet was stained , there was dirt marks on the helmet , it looked like it could have been a display model instead of being new , i paid £_00 for the masuri titanium cricket helmet and i wasn ' t impressed by the condition .
neutral	i also purchased a gray nicholls fiber glass sheet which i love that was really good value .
neutral	the shipping was free and really fast .
neutral	overall i was really happy with the fast_shipping on my goods , but unhappy with the masuri titanium cricket helmet which was a present for my friend has dirt marks on .
neutral	i would recommend this company to my friends ,
neutral	from my first experience of specsavers i will be returning to my previous opticians !
neutral	the only reason i tried them out was because i had a free eye_test voucher .
neutral	the optician said i had a very slight prescription and didn ' t need glasses , but proceeded to try to sell me reading glasses .
neutral	the whole atmosphere seemed more of a sales place and out of about 00 to 00 other people in there at the time , i was the only one to walk out without purchasing anything .
neutral	they are not like what they promise so be_careful when you deal with this company and also do read their tos too .
neutral	not a very happy experience
neutral	day started well in nottingham on my stag_do with paintball which was awesome , we then went to book into our hotel rooms to find there had been not rooms booked and we were left waiting for approximately an hours ( vital time on your stag_do ) eventually we where put in a taxi to the other side of town moving us away from hooters where we had to be in 00_mins .
neutral	this as you can imagine put a dampener on the evening .
neutral	hooters was brilliant as expected !!!
neutral	after that we had a good lads night out on the town .
neutral	not sure i would use chillisauce again unless they sort out there confirmation of rooms and follow_up issues with some type of apology as hopefully i only have one stag_do ...
neutral	i have used the software to unzip , worked well .
neutral	i had a bit of a problem with the download as something else came with it .
neutral	i quickly removed it .
neutral	it was great shopping , but i am considering to high for shipping for the item i had purchase and also do not see united states postal service for cheap and fast services .
neutral	had loads of problems with my box sky is very unhelpful .
neutral	repeat the same programs far too often and even_tho there are hundreds of channels there is often nothing to watch
neutral	we ' ve just returned from a hen_weekend in liverpool and while the weekend was fab the week leading up to it was fairly stressful !!
neutral	i work full time and had decided that booking via chilli_sauce would make things fairly easy and hassle_free for me as the weekend organiser .
neutral	however , cracks started to appear the week before we went when a member of the group called the hotel to make an enquiry , only to be told that they didn ' t have our booking !
neutral	needless to say this was more_than concerning so when i decided to call the spa to make_sure they had our booking , surprise_surprise , they didn ' t either !
neutral	after emailing vanessa ( our " manager ") she assured me that everything was booked and when we did arrive on friday , thankfully there were no_problems .
neutral	the spa however were calling me all day friday to make_sure we definitely wanted our appointment for the following_day ( as i later found out that vanessa had called them on the friday_morning to cancel our appointments - even_though i had asked her to do anything of the sort )!
neutral	long_story short , chilli_sauce are great for the online payment system and we did feel that we got great value for money with everything that was included in our " package " but for peace of mind ask for someone a little more competent to manage your booking !
neutral	organised service and friendly , but unhappy with the price after doing further research .
neutral	for headlight re alignment and bulb replacement cost £_00 quid including mot .
neutral	in reply to this they offered me a £_00 refund which i accepted
neutral	the item took too long to arrive considering delivery cost £ 0 . 00 , i didn ' t receive the item for a few_days , the courier failed to collect the item twice .
neutral	prices are ok but range of wholesale products is pretty bad to be honest .
neutral	there are better online japanese food stores out there .
neutral	update_:
neutral	success !
neutral	i can confirm that the issues i have had with regus have now been resolved , thanks to their dedicated customer_service team at surrey .
neutral	for the way that their customer_service team handled the situation , i have altered the rating from being a one star to a three star_review .
neutral	unfortunately , due to the experience i have had , i won ' t be retracting my original review as i think people should still be aware of the potential issues they can come_across when dealing_with regus .
neutral	original review :
neutral	- hidden_charges .
neutral	at no point did the salesman , edward discuss the additional services mentioned in the terms and conditions .
neutral	he discussed rent rates , telephone and internet rates so why not point out the other charges as well .
neutral	i get the impression that they play a game of " who can we catch out " with prospective customers .
neutral	their abuse of trust is morally and ethically disgusting and i hope they are investigated for their deception .
neutral	you only have to type " regus " and " complaints " in google to see that i am not the only one affected by this .
neutral	- extremely poor reception , call answering and mail service .
neutral	on numerous_occasions , i had calls to my mobile from clients and prospective clients saying that i hadn ' t returned their call .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because i never got the message , that ' s why !
neutral	i even spoke with the receptionist , christine , about whether anyone had come into the building asking for my company to which she replied " yes , someone called richard was asking for you but i told him you weren ' t here so he left ".
neutral	this was a prospective customer who i have since never_heard from and presumably he has chosen to use a different company .
neutral	there was no attempt made to take his details so i couldn ' t follow_up on his visit .
neutral	i will be looking into the " supply of services and goods_act 0000 " to establish whether regus are in breach of contract by not carrying out their duties adequately .
neutral	as a direct result of choosing regus , i have lost business .
neutral	- poor office conditions .
neutral	my office was centrally_located in the building so i had no windows to help cool down .
neutral	even in the winter months , i had to leave my door open to ensure a steady supply of fresh_air .
neutral	and just 0 months before my contract was due to end , i found out that a business opposite mine ( in a similar sized office ) had air_conditioning controls !
neutral	why do some have it and not others ?
neutral	- damaged reputation .
neutral	i referred a client ( and a good friend ) to regus for a short_term office ( this was before i was fully_aware of how regus operate ).
neutral	at no point did regus head_office or centre management acknowledge the referral .
neutral	he only had the office for 0 months but since leaving , he has had numerous issues with regus ( major accounting errors , false charges etc_.)
neutral	and is now on poor terms with me as a result of the recommendation .
neutral	this particular client has quite a high spend with me and i may lose a considerable_amount of business as a result of this .
neutral	do not recommend anyone to regus .
neutral	- security .
neutral	the lights in the office are automatic - they only turn on when someone is in the room and stay on for about 00 - 00_minutes after leaving .
neutral	a few_times on arriving at the office , i noticed that the lights were already on before entering ( and sometimes late at night when i decided to pop in to do a bit of work out of hours ) so i questioned the center manager , sharon , about this .
neutral	she told me that the cleaning staff had key access to all the offices to ensure they could carry out their duties even when the offices are locked .
neutral	this was very concerning to me as i use a lot of expensive equipment , software and also stored confidential documents in the office .
neutral	fortunately i never had to report a theft but my office was at the mercy of their security practices - a scary thought when they aren ' t even able to take messages for me !
neutral	in conclusion , regus are a cowboy outfit .
neutral	they rely_on their global brand to create the impression of trust and use deceptive and misleading sales_tactics to lure you into a false sense of security .
neutral	i ' m an 00 year_old student from birmingham and i ordered a gladiator mask for halloween to resemble one of my favourite rappers ; mf doom .
neutral	they sent me a cannibal mask - like the one hannibal lecter wore .
neutral	they sent the correct one out the next_day , after i rang them , and i have sent back the wrong mask .
neutral	they said they would refund the postage it cost me to return it , but as soon as i said i had sent it , i haven ' t received an_email or refund from them .
neutral	i don ' t think trustpilot are writing reviews for companies , but i do think stores pay reputable_companies to blast reviews for them .... i think trust_pilot should watch out for this !
neutral	one category for example , you have around 0 stores one of which has over 0 , 000 0 * reviews , all say the same_thing ..... how can this be when the other stores in the same category has a lot less reviews , plus a mixture of good and bad ones ....
neutral	do not buy from these stores !!
neutral	look for good and bad_reviews as they are most_likely going to give you a honest opinion on a store , not a fake oneside review that the company has paid to have written on there !
neutral	has fake all over it !
neutral	chillisauce has a wide_variety of events and activities in many different locations .
neutral	i was trying to keep costs down for my brothers stag_do and thought dodgeball looked cheap and pretty fun .
neutral	i got a quote and it turned_out to be £_00 each for 00 of us to play .
neutral	we had a great laugh on the day , the rep was good fun and showed us a few different games to play .
neutral	all in all though , we ended_up paying chillisauce over £_000 to hire a sports hall and send a rep with a few balls to referee the games .
neutral	it doesn ' t really feel_like it was worth the money .
neutral	recently had a holiday to tenerife booked through thomas_cook , it was a very good holiday , the reason i give it 0_stars though is because thomas_cook were pretty unenthusiatic , was informed that we ' d receive a discount card for restaurants , attraction etc .
neutral	plus money off our next holiday , never received .
neutral	and all transport , when part of thomas_cook , was always ridiculously late .
neutral	other than that , i had a great holiday , i would gladly use thomas_cook again , but feel these are thing thay could work on .
neutral	ordered a 0gbp chainstay protector and received a 0gbp sports_nutrition shake .
neutral	this to me is a monumental cock up as it ' s not as if you can get the two confused .....
neutral	hopefully this problem will be sorted promptly without hassle .
neutral	the lack of intervention from ebay is very frustrating when things go_wrong .
neutral	when it goes well it is average .
neutral	prices are are well and reliable source ,
neutral	after two_weeks from my order , i had not received any shipping confirmation and the order was still showing as " processing " in my account .
neutral	after writing to the customer support , though , i got a super - quick response saying the first shipment probably had got lost .
neutral	a new shipment was issued the same day , and arrived two days after .
neutral	clear account offer a really good alternative to payday lending and they are cheaper !
neutral	if it wasn ' t for the constant bank connection errors this would be a 0 star .
neutral	and the frustrating thing is often the error can happen just when you need it most , meaning you are stranded .
neutral	in my particular case i had an_emergency and really needed funds badly .
neutral	i spoke to one of their representatives who told me not to log on to internet_banking for 00_minutes whilst he " did a reset ".
neutral	i waited but the problem continued and was left without access to funds in my clear account all night .
neutral	i tried to call back after the 00_mins but got no answer .
neutral	there is no out of hours support_team which means after 00 : 00 you just can ' t get any help .
neutral	some times the bank connection issue can last a couple of days !
neutral	after my problem i email customer_services and the response was " stock " and not and explanation at all .
neutral	in summary i think it ' s a good service but personally i have had a " hiccup " with an unsatisfactory response .
neutral	at first it was good it gave me an updated amount for phone and i accepted then got an_email_saying payment would be in by end of day and still_waiting 0days on .
neutral	and i keep getting emails about having 0 days before price ends they seem unorganised .
neutral	i have then received payment 0 days_later but got a phone same day explaining still wasnt impressed with thecwait .
neutral	slightly expensive for my liking , finding some bargains elsewhere .
neutral	other than that the service is good and i will probably use again .
neutral	delivery was 00_minutes late and ever since placing my order i get annoying text_messages about offers !
neutral	dont intend to use again !
neutral	i found the site very easy to use , read the reviews of the tyres i wanted on the site and also checked for feedback of the same tyres on the usual forums .
neutral	there was a problem with the site , so it told me to call the customer_services department .
neutral	it took 00_mins on the phone to the girl at black_circles , who was very helpful and sorted out the error .
neutral	fitting was simple , turned_up at the garage in rowlands castle , service was ok , but they missed out on repeat_business as i asked for a price for an exhaust but they couldn ' t be bothered to give me a quote .
neutral	i did get the feeling that because i didn ' t go direct to them that i wasn ' t a proper customer .
neutral	more_than happy with the service from black_circles , and i will use them again and recommend to friends & family .
neutral	i order items from boots and receive an_email to say it should be with me by a certain_date .
neutral	i then get an_email from hermes to say order generated ( although it does not say what this means ).
neutral	the next email says its out for delivery , and it gets delivered usually around 00am .
neutral	when i order from topshop , next , boots i get the same lady , she says hello , we chat quickly and shes friendly .
neutral	if i ' m not in she will leave it in a cupboard by my front_door as i ' ve given her permission to do so ( unless it requires a signature ).
neutral	she leaves a card with her name and number so i can leave a message to tell her when she can next deliver it .
neutral	i think it depends on the individual delivering your parcel .
neutral	my husband used to work for the listening company who dealt_with calls for debenhams who i believe use hermes and people would say they had items thrown over their garden walls , left on window sills and all_sorts !
neutral	my 0 week delivery took over a month .... i recieved 0 e_- mails saying my anticipated delivery date had been changed , so i got in touch .
neutral	they told me my order had been stopped at customs , and they handled my copmlaint greatly .
neutral	even_though , my order was perfect and of good quality , i ' d not order again from gear0music , in case of another slow delivery
neutral	i contacted them about my insurance_policy and they didn ' t even have me registered as their customer .
neutral	i bought a well - priced ( cheap !)
neutral	cover for my galaxy nexus .
neutral	i originally made a mistake and had it posted to an old address .
neutral	the support contact was very helpful and was just offering to send a new one when i spotted my mistake .
neutral	when the cover arrived it had good finish but creaked ever so slightly and it basically fell_apart within a week ( the first chips appeared on the first day ) and this was not through neglect and maltreatment - it was just day - to - day use .
neutral	when i complained i was offered a replacement straight_away and received it 0 days_later - we ' ll see how this one goes .
neutral	so overall , very good service but be wary of what products you buy .
neutral	expect to get what you pay for .
neutral	i found it extremely difficult to make changes to my information when checking out online .
neutral	this site was suggested to me by a friend and the amount of trouble i had putting in my information and making_sure everything was correct almost made me not order from here .
neutral	overall though , the site is well_organized but i wish there was a little_bit more detail about some of the products on the site so that i could shop around more easily .
neutral	i will most_likely still order from here again , even with the trouble , because they have the best prices .
neutral	i was very pleased to find the product arrived so fast .
neutral	was disappointed once i opened the package .
neutral	the casing is not dry with beads falling_off and the pink shimmering powder stained my pants and hands .
neutral	can ' t even use it .
neutral	i ordered a micro scooter black as it was the cheapest and it had free delivery but 0 days_later i tried to make contact and there was no number to call so had to email them which took 0 days for a reply to then be told that the item was out of stock and was being sent straight from the manufactures .
neutral	0 days_later i revived my goods , i would pay a little extra and use another company so that i could get a tracking_number ...
neutral	three stars just because my order took 0 days to be dispatched due to an error , everything else was great including the customer_service guys who i spoke to .
neutral	i bought a samsung_galaxy s 0 from buymobilephones recently .
neutral	it was the joint cheapest place on the contract i wanted with a couple other_places , but buymobilephones give quidco cashback so i went with them .
neutral	many quidco reviews state they never recieved their cashback from this company , but i guess i ' ll have to wait and see for myself .
neutral	firstly , the website has a slightly seedy vibe about it which i can only say comes from experience if you have been on any malware ridden sites offering ' free games ' or whatever .
neutral	buymobilephones of course didn ' t have any malware or popups that i am aware of but it ' s not a good frontage for a site for first_impressions .
neutral	when placing my order , they underhandedly tried to shovel in some free for first month ( very expensive after that ) insurance by default in small letters , which i managed to take out of the shopping basket but i can see a lot of people falling for that .
neutral	there was also a ' choose free gift with your phone ' option when choosing a phone to buy , which in fact just gives you an expensive item along with the phone the cost of which is added onto your contract , so rather_than free it ' s just a pay_monthly item .
neutral	quite obvious to me but it ' s more underhanded work which would catch out the less observant of us .
neutral	now , once i placed my order my phone actually arrived very quickly which i was pleased about , and i ' m pleased with the phone .
neutral	however , the usb cable that came with the phone does not work and i am having to borrow one off a friend .
neutral	i sent them an_email about this a week_ago and have still not recieved a reply .
neutral	worse , if you urgently need to get hold of them by phone , their phone number is a premium_rate number .
neutral	i have to give three stars because i got the phone i wanted at the price i wanted , and quickly .
neutral	but the overall ordering experience was bad , it had me paranoid they were going to catch me out with something and of course i have this non working usb cable that came with my phone and no timely support for it , perhaps they are waiting to see if i ' ll call their premium_rate number .
neutral	ok , was an international address ... but the shipping cost were too hight for the service that i have received .
neutral	inadequate packaging , ( some oil lost from the pocket ).
neutral	trailfinders managed to get excellent deals through korean airlines to nz for us and managed to hold the flights for six_months before we had to pay .
neutral	unfortunately the airline did change their billing requirements which meant we had to pay early but trailfinders kept us updated and managed the issue .
neutral	one thing though if you book make_sure you request to be seated together , we managed to get separated on the flight as they had us down as two window seats despite the fact we we ' re returning to nz to get married .
neutral	0 provides almost acceptable network quality in central_london but intermittent cut outs become frustrating during peak_times .
neutral	in terms of managing an account they do a reasonable job but continued up selling becomes tiresome quickly ( esp mobile_broadband ).
neutral	it works most of the time and the prices are ok , want more_than this and you will be left wanting .
neutral	we used to use farnell for all our purchases of electrical components .
neutral	however in september they introduced a " handling charge " of £ 0 . 00 on small orders , with no warning .
neutral	the " shipping " is free but the information on the website is very unclear , and for most people the distinction between shipping and handling is irrelevant .
neutral	prior to this new charge , i would have given them 0_stars , in large part because it gives the flexibility to order things when you think of it , instead of waiting to build up sufficient order size .
neutral	searching their site can be painful , but their live_chat tech_support are very good at the search part .
neutral	farnell - if you read this , think again .
neutral	in the meantime , i ' m off to find a new supplier .
neutral	i ' ve not had to shop through hmv that much and to be honest , i ' m quite happy of that fact .
neutral	i only used them once online and that was more_than enough for me .
neutral	bought myself an xbox_000 with 0 games as a bundle pack , thought i would treat_myself .
neutral	well i placed the order , a timeslot of 0 - 0 days for delivery " great !"
neutral	i thought ... and that was the first mistake .
neutral	the 0th day came , nothing through the post or any attempted deliveries , i thought i would just give them benefit of christmas deliveries as it was around that time ... finally on the 0th day after delivery i got something but was way too small for the xbox_000 ... i got one of the games from the bundle ... ok , so where is the rest of it ?
neutral	surely as a bundle offer it should all come together .
neutral	i didn ' t make an issue as the next_day the actual xbox_000 came along , but where was the other game ?... it didnt arrive until another 0 weeks had gone by , so in the end for everything to get to me , it took 00 days .
neutral	faaaar from the best service i should be expecting .
neutral	again this was a while back but i still won ' t buy anything online from them .
neutral	another bad_experience was that of my sister ordering a shirt from them quite a few_months back .
neutral	somehow , and i have no_idea how , the order itself just disappeared from the system , called hmv and they claimed they never got it , yet the money easily went from her account ... naturally one very p * ssed off sister .
neutral	if you can avoid it , don ' t order online with them , all you will get at the least is long delays for your item to come .
neutral	another thing i ' ve noticed , and i hope this isn ' t just me , is that the prices online are often different from the prices instore .
neutral	a quick example .
neutral	xbox_000 transfer kit .
neutral	online - £_00 . 00 .
neutral	in - store - £_00 . 00 ... which leads me onto the prices themselves .
neutral	in comparison to other major outlets , such as play . com , amazon etc they are often overpriced for the majority of things they sell and have been criticised several_times for not even having the correct price on their in - store items ( my dad got a cheaper cd when the cashier informed him the price was wrong but still gave him the lower_price but besides the point , surely this isn ' t how a business should actually operate ).
neutral	on the plus side , they are often pretty good for stock control both online and in - store and the staff are generally helpful so i guess you could consider hmv a fall back option if any of the better places to go are unable to fulfil your query .
neutral	i could rate less but it has been a little while since i used hmv and i don ' t want to be completely biased based on family experiences but i still hear the same issues being raised , especially with the slow delivery .
neutral	hmv just needs to focus there , as well as on their pricing strategies .
neutral	i have only ever ordered items through other_companies but apparently you can buy things direct ?
neutral	i ordered a lot of things before_christmas and most of it arrived without any problem , the jewellery i ordered took quite a while and i was really disappointed with the quality , i feel some some companies are making up the retail prices .
neutral	i also am still fighting to get a refund for an item i have not received , it was ordered 0 weeks_ago and i thought it would be the highlight of my boyfriends christmas , but sugarush love have been slow and difficult , not to mention unapologetic !
neutral	i have now given up and just trying to get a refund .
neutral	on a positive note your complaints team have been quick and efficient , i just think you should be more selective with who you chose to work with .
neutral	the service has been ok , until i lost my phone .
neutral	i called their support to block the sim_card , and i was told it was impossible to block the sim_card right away , i would have to rely_on an automatic auto - blocking after 0 months of non usage ... so somebody might be using my phone right now , preventing the auto - blocking !
neutral	i have only bought one thing from myprotein , i don ' t wish to be bombarded with reviews .
neutral	ordered a cd_key on 00th_november .
neutral	got email instructions with how to download game .
neutral	clicked link in email but no download , just a thank_you text file with note saying game file will be emailed up to 00_hours .
neutral	thursday arrives and still nothing so emailed kumbaso support to ask them if i don ' t receive cd_key by end of the day then i will ask for refund .
neutral	0 days_later so i ask for refund within 0 working_days .
neutral	if i don ' t hear_anything i will get my refund via visa .
neutral	update_: after a week of nothing i have received the code .
neutral	i bought a double size bed_frame and a mattress few_months_ago from leeds store few_months_ago before we moved to our new home .
neutral	the delivery came on the right time but only with wrong_size .
neutral	we were delivered a double size mattress and a king_size bed - frame .
neutral	we contacted the customer_service right after that - staffs at customer_service were helpful and we waited another 0weeks for the right bed - frame .
neutral	after 0weeks same again ( king_size ), same process waited and after 0delivery it was again the same .
neutral	:( very disappointed because we had to wait about 0months .
neutral	apparently we were not allowed to change a mattress since we had used it but was offered a refund on bed - frame .
neutral	we didn ' t wanted to go looking for another bed - frame at other stores and wait another month so we stayed with oakfurniture land hoping for right delivery .
neutral	finally 0th delivery and thank_god after more_than 0months we got the right size bed - frame .
neutral	all this time we had to call 0000 and wait ( company phones ), plus our main frustration was assembling bed_frame for temporary use and taking it out again and again for 0 times .
neutral	but thanks at the end after almost 0months wait it was delivered .
neutral	i cant find my phone model specification after 0 years later ...
neutral	i ' ve been a buyer and seller on ebay since 0000 .
neutral	i love the ebay concept and making pocket money from the site is always great .
neutral	unfortunately , they suffer in terms of customer_service .
neutral	if you have any_problems with ebay ( or paypal ) you ' ll have a very frustrating experience trying to get things sorted .
neutral	great website , and i still buy from there regularly , but selling is something i find myself doing a lot less lately .
neutral	i have never had any_problems dealing_with the hut .
neutral	on occasion i can find deals there that beat the prices of both play . com and amazon . co . uk , but those deals are quite few and far between and usually only appear when they have their sales .
neutral	they often inundate me with emails informing_me about new sales they have running , and if i didn ' t know better i ' d say that they were always running a sale of some kind .
neutral	overall , i ' d say that the hut is acceptable , but it is rarely my first choice when it comes to buying books , dvds , or games .
neutral	the company did not leave the vip night club tickets at the hotel reception so we had to pay entry ourselves and have not received a refund .
neutral	go_karting was great fun and the hotel was in an excellent location .
neutral	strip_club was cheap and grotty .
neutral	i have been using maximuscle for a while now , it ' s a good product but will be looking elsewhere for a similar product at a better price .
neutral	maximuscle please lower prices in order to keep my custom .
neutral	cool site .
neutral	nice concept .
neutral	wonderful prices for products .
neutral	shipping_costs are terrible .
neutral	clever service but reward is poor
neutral	had a card from moonpig , poor quality card , almost paper - like .
neutral	i am seriosuly considering funky_pigeon .
neutral	item ( black dress shirt ) i ordered got lost in the post , which is obviously not my tuxedo ' s fault , but did mean i didn ' t have the item for when i needed it .
neutral	replacement was sent and instead of courier delivery ( which would have been unnecessary ) i opted for a free bow_tie , but was a little disappointed that the free bow_tie was black when the shirt i ordered was also black .
neutral	good prices and one of the few places i ' ve found that sells black dress shirts .
neutral	the gentleman on the phone was also very helpful , but a fair amount of hassle all things considered .
neutral	when booking you have no_idea where you will be staying ( if you book accommodation ) as you just select a category .
neutral	if you ask to know the name of the accommodation you ' re told that the information is only released once the full_amount has been paid .
neutral	i had so many people asking me where we were staying as they wanted to know what they were paying for but couldn ' t tell them !
neutral	not so bad , confusing information about opening package before signing ( delivery man wouln ' t allow me to do it , though i had instructions from pixmania to do so ...)
neutral	overall ok
neutral	first of all i would like to say that the service of dropping off and picking_up the car was very good and smooth , with minimal waiting time at a competitive price , and under any other circumstances i would definitely_recommend the service to others .
neutral	my concern was how the car was driven between the airport and the secure parking facility , and then how the complaint was handled .
neutral	when i dropped_off the car as normal i take took a photo of the mileage before and after collection .
neutral	i also reset the fuel computer and gear shifting monitor .
neutral	as i picked_up the car it had averaged 00 . 0mpg over the 00 miles surepark had it , this is almost half of what it normally gets .
neutral	the gear shifting monitor also showed that the gear shifting had been ' very poor ' indicating high revs , i personally have only managed figures that low with the car on a track .
neutral	i raised the complaint and to their credit i was contacted back by phone , unfortunately i was told that there was no way the car had been driven fast and that the reduced mpg was normal , i ’ m a professional automotive engineer who designs engines for a living , including parts of the one in the car i dropped_off so i wasn ' t completely convinced .
neutral	in this situation a bit of humility would have been the better way to address this concern , rather_than going on the offensive and telling the customer they were wrong despite the evidence .
neutral	the situation would have been much_better handles with a simple “ sorry , it shouldn ' t have happened , we ’ ll fix it in the future ”.
neutral	if i had been given that reassurance based on the service we had i would have had no_hesitation in using them in the future .
neutral	at this moment i ’ m not convinced that if i was to park with them again my car would not be driven hard as it was in this instance .
neutral	poundland is cheap because everything is 0 pound but the reason i only put it three star is because of the quality of the products isnt that good but they have alot of things in store and good if you just need something quickly and dont have enough money
neutral	ebay is a great place to sell your unwanted goods .
neutral	however the account pages where you sell , pay etc is far to complicated .
neutral	it takes you ages just to pay your invoice , and to make a complaint about someone not paying you again is far too complicated .
neutral	keep it simply people !
neutral	the idea is grate i managed to get the job_done but .. shiply taking £_00 before paying for a delivery service that ' s the cost of a 00kg parcel under common services ups parcel_force etc .. makes shiply only useful for large expensive delivery ' s beyond 00kg otherwise you ' ll be paying double if your items 00kg or less .
neutral	i used this service to shift a 000kg item so i was happy to pay for this sort :_d
neutral	the service was quick and efficient and delivered on time however the helium gas cylinder ran out before all the balloons that came in the pack were filled and the latex balloons didn ' t float very well despite following all the instructions with regards to size etc .
neutral	a good time save but no cheaper_than high_street stores .
neutral	the large foil number ballons were excellent .
neutral	i don ' t expect the best customer_service from a website that ' s pushing products like these folks do , but at times they ' re just flat out disappointing .
neutral	the site ' s tricky to navigate if you don ' t know what you ' re looking for , so it ' s best to browse somewhere_else and then come here with the exact product you want in mind .
neutral	also , never trust their shipment process to just go through .
neutral	plan on babying the entire ordering_process all the way up until it ships .
neutral	sometimes it feels_like these folks aren ' t even interested in making a sale .
neutral	some products are worth purchasing trough this website such as the specials they be having .
neutral	however the price of all the products are cheap but when you get to the final price which includes shipping / handling it adds up to the same / around price the you would most_likely pay at gnc .
neutral	yes the prices at 0game are sometimes extremely competitive however i have received none uk release games which are then not able to be traded in .
neutral	so if your ordering a game that you may eventually trade in then just realise that some places will not take non uk titles .
neutral	the game will still work on your console and have english instructions etc
neutral	just as my review says becareful
neutral	like many people i have used amazon quite_often over the years and although the service is generally quite good , delivery does tend to let them down during both peak and off_peak periods .
neutral	i cannot_fault however the downloads , especially the ebooks .
neutral	fast , efficient , simple !
neutral	so my girlfriend ordered me chocolates for today , 00 / 00 /_0000 and i found that the truffles expired on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	she got them custom made online on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	this is disgusting service , she paid her hard_earned money only to have expired chocolates delivered .
neutral	they are not exactly the cheapest chocolates in the world and to be given out of date chocolates is disgusting .
neutral	not only is it a slap in the face to customers but it is a huge breach of food health and safety and i will be doing everything i can to get this sorted .
neutral	* update * it has been sorted , they said the old box was used by_accident .
neutral	i guess i wrote this more out of anger as my gf was very upset .... as it was solved quickly i can change the star_rating .
neutral	lol
neutral	im aware that ' reasonable within available method ' is a bit_confusing ... what i mean by that is that a company who relies on another company to complete it ' s business , and in this case mazuma relies on royal_mail or independent couriers , can only really provide a standard of service reflective of a standard set by the postal / courier service ... and on this occasion that was very slow , so indirectly mazuma didn ' t send me my bank_transfer for a long time , nearly 0 weeks !
neutral	it ' s ok to say mazuma will send a bank_transfer the day they receive the phone , but if the courier fails to deliver timely then it ' s an inconvenience .
neutral	and although i respect that mazuma have no control over post , at the same time , they can only , having the type of business they do that relies havily on another business , recieve , 0_stars .
neutral	good prices and products , shocking delivery service .
neutral	out of the last 0 orders , 0 have been delayed , one of them upto nearly 0 weeks .
neutral	when i initially started using them i could order in the evening , it was marked as sent the following_morning and arrived the next_day .
neutral	now i kind of expect it ' ll take a while and order way before i run out .
neutral	i called 0 days ago , got put on hold for 00mins than gave up and emailed instead .
neutral	my order was apparently delivered by the infamous and notoriously crap , hermes ( google it ).
neutral	it was apparently delivered to a neighbour .
neutral	it wasn ' t as i have cctv and nobody came to my house or entered the cul - de - sac .
neutral	so i emailed myprotein to ask what was going on .
neutral	three days and 0 emails and still no reply !
neutral	just an_automated email_saying they will reply in 00_hours .
neutral	good products , non_existent after care and stay well clear of hermes because they will not discuss any_problems with you , they refer you back to myprotein , who dont reply !
neutral	!
neutral	received a damaged parcel .
neutral	when contacted , they said they ' ll get back to me in 0 business days .
neutral	been more_than a week , nothing !
neutral	contacted them .
neutral	customer_service didnt sound professional enough .
neutral	rest must be good but then this was my first opinion
neutral	after much frustration i ' m finally sitting here with the angry birds game i ordered as a present almost a month_ago just in time for christmas .
neutral	when i ordered the game at the end of november i pretty confident their 0 working_days delivery would leave me with plenty of time to get it wrapped up and sorted out and when i didn ' t receive the email to confirm it had been despatched after two days as they said i would , i didn ' t think any of it .
neutral	however , after two_weeks of not hearing anything , i got a bit annoyed .
neutral	there was no reply to my first email .
neutral	or my phone call to the office listed on the website .
neutral	after another week i complained on trustpilot because i didn ' t want people to experience the same_thing .
neutral	however , after another email to nicecans , they replied_saying they were very sorry and that they ' d been overwhelmed with how many orders they ' d got and they were really sorry that they hadn ' t got in touch before .
neutral	as i am a firm believer in second chances , i told them to either make_sure my item arrived by the 00nd or give me a refund .
neutral	they told me they ' d post it to me the next_day ( as they ' d run out of stock and were getting a new load delivered ).
neutral	i accepted that and received an update email_saying my item had been dispatched the day after .
neutral	today , the 00nd , my angry birds game arrived in the post .
neutral	i doubt i ' d recommend nicecans to a friend or even use it again for something with a deadline , but i might try it at a less busy time ( with something cheap ) to see if they can offer better service when it ' s not christmas .
neutral	i tried to write a bad review several days ago and it doesn ' t show up .
neutral	it has taken me over a week to leave a bad review and i still can ' t see it anywhere .
neutral	trustpilot are now asking for further verification
neutral	this is supposed to be impartial but as most things , it seems geared towards leaving good reviews rather_than honest ones .
neutral	it ' s too easy to fake good reviews , or keep flagging legitimate reviews as " abusive " so nobody sees them .
neutral	that makes the services meaningless and means trustpilot can ' t really be trusted .
neutral	i was initially pleased with the service provided .
neutral	a little annoying to receive newsletters / specials a few_times a week .
neutral	please have a better sign_up option box ( maybe unchecked by default )
neutral	thought the bottle would be bigger and thought they would of filled the perfume right up !
neutral	!
neutral	i am a regular user and very happy with the actual online side of the site .
neutral	the site is great , easy to use and i normally use the collection option for my orders which is free .
neutral	i have collected from a variety of their stores and i have to say that the whole collection process is really painful .
neutral	a lot of the stores don ' t have a dedicated collection desk so you end up having to queue at a normal till only to be told that they are too busy and you should go to a different department .
neutral	they really need to look_into ways of streamlining this collection process at all of their collection stores to encourage people to use this method .
neutral	i have flown with dutch klm on a previous flight and rated their service very high .
neutral	unfortunately due to events outside and inside their control i was less_than impressed with their service at heathrow airport on 00 june_0000 .
neutral	it started off when we boarded the plane and got into our seats .
neutral	we were told via a service announcement that they had technical problems with the flight computer and that they hoped to had the problem fixed within an half an_hour .
neutral	after 00_minutes we were informed that they couldn ' t repair the technical issue they experienced and that we would have to go to the klm ticket desk to get our tickets re booked for another flight .
neutral	we understand that these issues might sometimes arise and that to make alternative_arrangements for them requires allot of skill and patience from understandably irate customers .
neutral	the queue was long and at some stage we timed that 0 customer was helped every half and hour per customer to re book their tickets .
neutral	we understand too that businesses during these trying times need to cut costs and therefore one has to anticipate that some klm service desks would be empty .
neutral	however in such situations it is perhaps a good solution to get some management staff involved in re booking customers to help along customers faster .
neutral	we had an elderly lady in the queue and after an_hour i had to approach some of the klm staff to ask them if they could provide her with seating .
neutral	they were brilliant in responding and even took the initiative to offer all the people queuing water .
neutral	one wonders just why somebody had to mention it to them in the first place that there are people in the queue which aren ' t able to stand for as long_periods as some of the younger passengers .
neutral	the poor klm person who ended_up helping_us at the booking desk and had to face allot of angry customers were very helpful and we are glad they receive such good training .
neutral	i hope to add a few stars to my impression of them in future .
neutral	we were supposed to start our journey at 0 :_00am on june 00th 0000 via dutch klm .
neutral	it so happened dutch klm experienced had problems with the plane and we were re - booked for a direct flight with ba the same day at approximately 00 : 00 the afternoon .
neutral	i am an_avid amateur videographer and so to make the best of a bad situation i wanted to take some video_footage from heathrow terminal 0 from where we departed .
neutral	i came to a place on the terminal where i wanted to film a suitcase going onto the weigh - in conveyor belt .
neutral	it was then that a lady of the ba member of staff approached asking me to stop filming and delete the footage of the video i have taken .
neutral	as it is a public place i questioned why she required me to stop taking video_footage and invited her to look at the footage that i have been taking .
neutral	the footage was just of a suitcase rolling on a conveyor belt with no people of members of staff in the footage and no personal identifying properties to the suitcase either .
neutral	she explained to me that ba staff had a right not to be filmed and that if i didn ' t delete the footage that she could get a member of security to come and explain it to me in a very threatening demeanor .
neutral	i explained to her that as i wasn ' t filming ba staff and i have invited her to look at the footage and therefore didn ' t understand her concerns and that she was welcome to get to security to explain the concerns to me .
neutral	the security personnel did arrive on the scene and after explaining to him why i do not understand her concerns he gave me a very valid security reason for not filming the footage that i wanted which was totally different from the way the ba staff lady explained to me .
neutral	i therefore deleted the footage that the security personnel asked me to and invited him to have a look at other video_footage that he might have thought was inappropriate .
neutral	even the security personnel asked the ba staff lady to have a look at the footage , to which she declined to .
neutral	i understand that terrorism is a real threat which need to be treated with a high_level of security and after the security personnel did explain to me in a reasonable way why i couldn ' t film certain parts i understood the reasoning .
neutral	where i think things could have gone better is if the ba staff lady was trained to explain in a professional and non confrontational manner what the concerns to security was .
neutral	it came_across that she was implying that if i don ; t stop what i was doing , that she was going to put security on me like you would a dog on a robber .
neutral	one expects a ba staff lady to have more customer relationship skills than the airport security staff and had she explained the concerns as well as he did , the situation would not have escalated to security level .
neutral	airport security have more important scenarios to attend to after all .
neutral	smart phones these days are almost all capable of taking video_footage in a much more clandestine manner .
neutral	openly taking video_footage on a tripod should have maybe let her think that this might have been a misdirected customer and should have changed her approach .
neutral	the flight itself was on time .
neutral	however once we were on the runway almost about to lift - off we got an in flight announcement from the pilot informing us that the wrong cargo was loaded_onto the plane and that the plane needed to return to terminal 0 so that the cargo could be removed .
neutral	this delayed the flight about an_hour in total .
neutral	the rest of the flight was enjoyable and the aircrew was great .
neutral	hopefully future encounters with ba will be better .
neutral	this company is a waste of space , they leave calling_cards but dont knock on the door or ring the bell , trying to call someone is not going to happen , its all automated and has limited options , i emailed them asking that they call my mobile to make_sure i dont miss the item again , they responded with ' its not our drivers job to call you , make_sure you are home '.
neutral	this is not the first time ive had issues with these_guys .
neutral	i would ask any company not to use these_guys .
neutral	i ended_up paying an extra £_00 for a garanteed delivery slot .
neutral	lets_see what happens ...
neutral	again , please do not use these_guys , i would proberly not order from your company if i know you use dpd as your delivery choice .
neutral	update_: 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00
neutral	after_reading the reply i sent them an_email ( around 00am ) with the shipping reference and my contact number , no contact has been made as yet .
neutral	update_: 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00
neutral	just got a call from dpd who appologised and said they are going to send someone with the parcel tonight and will call me when they are outside .
neutral	lets_see what happens .
neutral	update 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00
neutral	item was delivered later today buy city_link .
neutral	summary_: awfull service , i feel if i had not called and made a complaint things could have been alot worse and who_knows when i would have got my item , but once i started talking to people on the phone they seemed nice enough and got the item to me asap .
neutral	i would only ever recommend ryanair for very shorthaul flights as then it ' s good value , but even then it ' s a customer experience that ' s not for the lighthearted !
neutral	i gave 0_stars because you know what your getting with them !
neutral	excellent hotel , well worth the money !
neutral	handy having someone_else sort out money .
neutral	spa day sounded great so we booked it , it was in a grubby hotel that wasn ' t a spa it had tiny changing rooms which were dirty and smelly , pool was old and run down , jacuzzi was small and old , not big enough to hold a hen_party as only 0 broken un loungers !!!
neutral	food was expensive and not discounted as advertised , i was really embarrassed that people had paid for this !!!
neutral	party_bus well this was something else words can ' t describe what a rip_off it was .
neutral	first bar we were taken too was disgusting in everyday , you could almost hear the tumble weed as we walked in !
neutral	we literally paid £_00 for nothing !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered my item 00th_october , and after emailing and leaving messages for 0 weeks i eventually got a reply , it promised me my item next couple of days , sent by a women .
neutral	anyway i eventually got hold of the owner and was able to text his mobile , he explained the situation , but i still did get a few false_promises , but at_least i was able to communicate , anyway after all the snow had buggered off , i did get my tracking_number and finally my item , yes it was frustrating having to wait that long but i also understand they have to be made as it does state .
neutral	but i do believe the customer_service needs to improve , but the item is fantastic .
neutral	yes i would use again but by then hopefully delivery issues will be sorted .
neutral	i ' ve been with bt for quite a number of years and just have the constant niggling feelign that they ' re conning me .
neutral	i feel as though i am paying way too much for broadband etc but can ' t face calling them because i don ; t have half a day to waste on the phone on hold to then be put through to someone i struggle to understand .
neutral	i ' m just waiting for sky broadband ( the fast one ) to make it to my area and i ' ll be switching
neutral	i like ebay overall and have got some good value stuff , but i don ' t enjoy the agro you can get from other_users .
neutral	i have only ever sold two items through ebay , on one i was accused by a bidder of bidding myself to jack the price up , which i wasn ' t , and the other i had difficulties getting paid by someone who kept claiming they had when they had not .
neutral	its good in principle but for me not worth the hassle when selling
neutral	booking was really quick and the feedback email was quicker_than the booking email .
neutral	i was surprised to see the review / feedback email which has come far in_advance than the booking email .
neutral	i had no clue about what had happened about the review order as i have no option to take any print out of it from the website after the booking .
neutral	i assumed that the booking email has not been sent and started to look for other options on the website .
neutral	it took a while to receive this booking confirmation which has relieved me .
neutral	never_experienced that cs_team is closed for lunch , this is most bizarre since other customers can call only during these times .
neutral	managed to speak to cs representative who quickly helped to respond to one part of my enquiry to my satisfactory .
neutral	partyrama advertises free delivery over £_00 , but it doesn ' t work automatically and is not clear on the store delivery or checkout pages .
neutral	i have missed it and only wanted to suggest some improvements but have faced negative side of cs_team .
neutral	site requires improvement and cs_team could be more helpful when people provide suggestions .
neutral	ordered 0 bouquets for delivery , they were delivered on time but were both squashed into a single box ... not very special as they got a bit crushed ,
neutral	i thought the preview section worked really well and liked the fact we could play with fonts and phrasing .
neutral	however , i received an_email on the 00st january stating that my invitations had been dispatched and would be with me shortly .
neutral	a week has passed and i still have not received them .
neutral	how long does a parcel take from lancashire !
neutral	?
neutral	i have sent two emails and heard_nothing back .
neutral	at this rate the rsvp date printed will have passed !
neutral	becky
neutral	i used to love dialtosave and made it my only option of purchase for international cards but now its been losing my customs due to technical_error which keeps on repeating all the time . as a busy man i found it a bit_annoying to contact customer_service everytime .
neutral	the last time i use it on the 00 / 00 /_0000 the operator would not tell me how much credit i have after i ' ve topped_up and before it use to remember my password from the phone i use but now it kept asking me to enter it again . thats a bit disappointing and i found it only going down instead of improving the service . i would have understood if it was a one off technical_error but it doesnt seem so . communication does cut_off at some point too . i have noticed as well that during winter time customers get lower credit for the same amount of money use to purchase during summer time .
neutral	it has now reach a point that i will have no other choice than looking for another option .
neutral	customer_service wise i would say excellent . the team we have behind has always acted professionally and fast . impeccable .
neutral	well_done to the customer_service team . i think you deserve another 0_stars .
neutral	regards
neutral	ggoreeba @_hotmail . com
neutral	i don ' t know - maybe it ' s just me - but any xbox game i order seems to spin and not run - due to the ' lovefilm ' sticker on the middle - maybe rethink this .
neutral	the free products seem great but if you put them in and then check with the shipping it will add $ 0 . 00 or 00 cents for the " free " item .
neutral	do you really think a sample_pack ( 0 pills ) really costs anything when shipping 0 lbs of protein or 00 lbs of drinks ?
neutral	bull .
neutral	the 0 %_off competitors preices is nice if you have all day to commpare every_single product . believe it or not i like the site ok but even when i inquired about how a free_sample really costs money they send back an almost pissed_off response about how cheap all their stuff is and how it really costs and other nonesense .
neutral	also i have had trouble with shipping and even just paying for the orders .
neutral	it seems like an amazing site but just be wary and check it out for yourself .
neutral	i know they have to make money but i know for a fact the expired stuff is pure profit and the shipping charges are the real shot in the dark .
neutral	good website , but sales people in their shops are really bad and rude .
neutral	very unhelpful .
neutral	i shopped with them for years , putting up with the awful staff until i found the same products with other people at half the price
neutral	limited website and sales teams are a total pain in the backside .
neutral	once enquired_about advertising and now they won ' t leave me alone
neutral	used to love this site , but does anyone use it anymore ?!
neutral	shame they couldn ' t keep up with facebook .. wonder where it went wrong ?
neutral	!
neutral	they never have codes i want , when they do they ' re out of date
neutral	easy to use , i booked with them and then found the room £_00 cheaper elsewhere ... luckily the hotel refunded the difference .
neutral	it ' s a great concept .. but , a few_years_ago they offered really good discounts on rooms .
neutral	which is why they set_up and their whole marketing campaign .
neutral	now they don ' t really offer any discount .
neutral	i use it to search hotels in the area ...
neutral	i have found better discounts on other_sites ...
neutral	it also has limited hotels and b_& b ' s ... considering i tried to register my bandb and they said i was out of their limit , even_though the place down the road is on the site only 0 miles_away !
neutral	they should accept everyone and go back to offering discounted rooms .
neutral	they ' re ok , but i enquired_about ' anytime upgrade ' and was sent an_email_saying i was able to have it , but ring the phoneline to sort .... rang phone line ... they said i wasn ' t entitled ... someone , somewhere isn ' t very familiar with their products and services !
neutral	very disappointing
neutral	good company and customer_service ... but don ' t always add on your voucher from previous 00_% shop guarantee
neutral	bought products from lyco direct were sent by fed - ex next_day arrived at 00 . 00 next morning .
neutral	the box was a bit bashed but the sender had packed the items well so no_problems there .
neutral	is the first time i have used fed - ex and sadly the last judging_by the reviews .
neutral	was a good fast service though
neutral	very very expensive service .
neutral	not even up to the standards
neutral	i rang them to find out if a claim i proposed to make would be valid under the terms of my policy .
neutral	they fobbed me off by saying they ' d send out the form .
neutral	i was no wiser when it arrived .
neutral	i then emailed them but got no reply .
neutral	on my next call i nailed them .
neutral	the woman was very helpful .
neutral	she told me exactly_what the criteria were and what documents i needed .
neutral	just a shame i didn ' t get a straight answer at the beginning .
neutral	i had a similar experience with a claim a few_years_ago where i spent_ages putting documents together to find that i wasn ' t eligible .
neutral	items that were shown as in stock were not , this resulted_in my order sitting in their system not being dispatched .
neutral	of course noone bothered to tell me this ; only by checking the website myself and having to ring them did i eventually find this out .
neutral	i think it was well over a week ( possibly two ) until my order did get dispatched which is comical considering their line ' over 00_% orders dispatched same day '.
neutral	and don ' t get me started on the ' one - click ' name .
neutral	however , the items i ordered were great quality and as cheap as i could find them on the web .
neutral	personally though , i ' m not sure it was worth the hastle .
neutral	the flowers themselves were a present for my mums_birthday , she loved them and the bright colours , however as i was the one who saw them online i was a little disappointed with the size , very small for the price but like i say mum loved them and didn ' t know the difference !
neutral	i used tshirt_studio because it ' s the top rated service of its kind on trustpilot .
neutral	i ordered the t - shirt with express delivery and it was very fast indeed - i received it before 00pm the next_day .
neutral	however , i had used a custom design for the t - shirt , and because some of the colours came out a bit darker on the t - shirt , a lot of the details in the original image were lost .
neutral	also , as a result of the image transfer process , the t - shirt looked slightly faded already when it arrived .
neutral	i would have appreciated some advice on the colours to use in my original image to make_sure it came out exactly how i ' d like .
neutral	then again , it was a gift to someone and they were thoroughly pleased with the result .
neutral	i would use them again , but not before trying out other services .
neutral	the school itself was good .
neutral	staff was well prepared .
neutral	managing team also organized after - class activities and some parties .
neutral	i recognize this schools as a great place to become a professional bartender .
neutral	however personally i found some drawbacks : firstly , it ' s way too expensive given the fact that the school is set_up in phuket , thailand ; secondly , learning tools such as flairing bottle and starting bartender ' s kit was ridiculously_expensive ( it ' s possible to get all the stuff online more_than twice cheaper !!!
neutral	); thirdly , student were not allowed to practice flairing with school equipment and were forced to get flairing bottles from school .
neutral	love how you can ask it a question and it answers you
neutral	great site to get anything you want
neutral	no_problems with products .
neutral	however , somehow the company can go to the post_office to deliver goods to mainland_uk , but not to northern_ireland ?!?
neutral	please get out of the dark ages !
neutral	!
neutral	not the best site ive looked at and not many promotions or loyalty schemes like skybet or betfair unfortunately
neutral	i received the order in reasonable time , but this item king of shaves super skin face scrub 000ml spilled almost half inside the package over other products .
neutral	i would be glad to receive a replacement .
neutral	i am , like most teens - on facebook .
neutral	i make about 00 posts every day ( much to the digression of my friends ) about everything ranging_from my day at college , quotes , music , film - all_sorts .
neutral	ive been using the service since late - 0000 and have watched the many updates .
neutral	the problem with facebook is it keeps wanting to ' tamper ' with itself - which is just making it worse , and terrible to use .
neutral	instead of looking at making the website run faster , produce less errors etc they seem to find it more useful to introduce futile additions such as ' the light box ' ( or theatre mode for viewing picture ) or changing the layout of my newsfeed etc .
neutral	there are so many problems with facebook ; i question why ' we ' all use it still .
neutral	i understand its such a hive of activity ; but so is google - and they don ' t seem to have a problem ( thinking of all their services mail , search , checkout , translate , maps , picasa , buzz etc_.)
neutral	?
neutral	im not the only one to think this .
neutral	on a postive note ; it has revolutionized how we all communicate with each other - and everything which used to be seen as ' private ' ends up on facebook , and we are now communicating with each other 00_hours of a day .
neutral	being_able to ' look through the keyhole ' at other_peoples lives ..... it is an astonishing thing facebook - its just so broken .
neutral	if facebook are reading this ; then here ' s my message .
neutral	ok , you ' ve sorted out the privacy ( great thanks for that by the way :) ), but now can you look to sorting_out the stability and performance of your website ?
neutral	instead of tinkering with stupid things that no - one wants , and look crass ( i . e .
neutral	light - box ).
neutral	full_refund received !
neutral	thanks
neutral	-----------------------------------------------------
neutral	the company wrote immediately after this comment , and now the refund is on its way ( 0 days ).
neutral	______________________________________________
neutral	i am greatly distressed right now because the budgetair company has taken money out of the university account without us confirming the booking .
neutral	there was a payment problem on 00 / 00 /_0000 with the university card , after realising it was not possible for the university to proceed with the payment , we did not confirm ( we called budgetair to talk about it at the time , they were aware of the problem ).
neutral	i received an_email_saying that if i did not confirm on the 00th , the booking would be lost , so we did nothing .
neutral	now today i received a confirmation from the company as if my ticket was still booked , and this scared me because in the mean - time i already booked another ticket and paid for it !
neutral	it seems they took the money from the university account without authorisation , and also without us sending some papers that were supposed to be necessary to book with a credit_card from a different person than the passenger .
neutral	i am truly devastated because i do not have the money to pay for this ticket , i already paid mine , and it makes me look pretty bad towards the university funding my research trip .
neutral	the university ' s finance department phoned them , and supposedly the person in charge of our account is not there until friday , so we have to call then .
neutral	it seems like an awful lot of time before i can be certain that this mistake is rectified !
neutral	and reading other comments i am now afraid that they are trying to gain time by leading us away .
neutral	i realised also that friday would be one week after the attempted booking took place , is that a deadline for us to complain ?
neutral	i hope budgetair is going to do something about this unacceptable issue very quickly , this is not my money i have lost , but it is even worse !
neutral	because amazon sell many of their products through third_party sellers , you never know if you ' re actually ordering from amazon themselves or someone_else .
neutral	when my order arrived poorly packaged and late from a company i had never_heard of , i wasn ' t very happy !
neutral	the customer_service was great , the virtual terminal did the job i was looking for , just found a cheaper service else where .
neutral	i remember when signing_up to payment_sense i was told i could terminate the contract anytime .
neutral	so emailed to cancel my service to be told i have to pay for the next 0 months , this is very annoying , as i can ' t use the account but still being charged .
neutral	it may only be £_00 but its a little harsh to charge me for something , i can no_longer use .
neutral	unfortunately indifferent to all the others providers ...
neutral	booked a one night stay in a city hotel in the uk for 0 people .
neutral	very reasonable and hotel was lovely , posh considering it worked out cheaper_than the neighbouring travelodge .
neutral	it was easy to book online , i paid a deposit amount to suit me , got confirmation emails , accommodation vouchers and the rest of the payment was taken on the date agreed , no_fuss .
neutral	on arrival at the hotel ( around 0 months after booking , and around 0pm ), the receptionist informed us that alpharooms had not forwarded our requests on for neighbouring rooms , and had not told them that we had booked for 0 people in one room ( one triple and two doubles ).
neutral	apparently they did not offer triple rooms - despite the alpharooms website offering this and allowing me to book this .
neutral	as such we had to wait 00_minutes whilst they found suitable rooms for us , and we ended_up being 0 floors apart_from each other .
neutral	if alpharooms had communicated better with the hotel , we could have at_least been on the same floor , and our rooms would have been ready .
neutral	they had 0 months to tell the hotel about the rooms we had booked and our request to be close to each other , it ' s not as if it was last_minute .
neutral	i won ' t be booking with alpharooms again unless i just need one room for 0 - 0 people .
neutral	ordered twice now for in store collection .
neutral	easy online , stock arrives in store on time , but the service received in the poole store has really put me off .
neutral	for a company that bleats on about how great their customer_service is , disappointing_experience both_times i ' ve been in to collect .
neutral	arrange pick_up for southampton now !
neutral	!
neutral	no printable e_- tickets for the gig i am going to and my name put on a list of attendees .
neutral	was told to print my receipt and show my bank card as proof .
neutral	its a really dodgy practice and unnerved me from wanting to buy tickets although when buying tickets it said e_- tickets would be available
neutral	returned an item to very and received the refund immediately .
neutral	impressive in my standards .
neutral	although i won ' t be ordering from very again because they are contracted with yodel of whom are a terrible delivery company .
neutral	i ' ve had a mixed history with studiospares .
neutral	i would start by saying that the company has been going for many years , is an ' industry standard ' key competitor and despite what i will write in this review i would definitely use them again and again .
neutral	however , they use dpd to transport their parcels and this lets them down a lot .
neutral	i ' ve had next_day deliveries not arrive next_day , no apology from the delivery company .
neutral	when phoning to enquire with studiospares , they couldn ' t get through so gave me the number to call , which was never answered .....
neutral	also , they have mis_- advertised sizing of products that i have purchased resulting in too little area of an acoustic tiles product arriving ( by a long margin !)
neutral	but they did resolve my complaint to my satisfaction .
neutral	just check the size before placing an order to avoid disappointment .
neutral	overall , an excellent company to deal with but the delivery service lets them down in my opinion
neutral	well they are not the quickest in processing orders .
neutral	but they are more_than quick enough to take payments in full long before dealing_with your order .
neutral	made an other order last thursday money was removed from account 0 hour later then my account on ebuyer updated to items wont be sent until 00th for delivery on 00th .
neutral	a week to process an order ...
neutral	made an order for £_00 . 00 with an other company and selected free delivery , got email telling_me delivery is 0 - 00 days ... then got an_email 00_mins later telling_me parcel has been collected by parcel_force to track item click this link after 00pm .
neutral	checked tracking after 00pm to find my item was on its way and for delivery next working day ...
neutral	ebuyer should take notes on speeding things up a bit .
neutral	few orders placed from them never arrived due to poor courier service , however if you dint receive your goods , next will make_sure you keep waiting for good few weeks before outcome .
neutral	however quality is great and items are reasonably prices .
neutral	customer_service is good too !
neutral	i share images on facebook , upload videos and all_sorts but i hate the timeline idea please take facebook back and stop updating it you make it worse just take it back scrap this timeline nonsense and leave it alone please
neutral	i ' ve bought winter_tyres from their website .
neutral	i ' ve paid more_than 000pounds for them , and waited for delivery .
neutral	day later ive received a phone call with information that tyres i ' ve choice are out of stock ( why there was no information on website just asked me ro pay for them ???)
neutral	they informed me that they could suply me with different one but almost same specification and price .
neutral	ive said ok , as i was desperate for them .
neutral	but when tyres arrived , ive check them on internet and found the same almost 00 pound cheaper per tyre .
neutral	feeling cheated .
neutral	will not complain as leaving uk on saturady and need those tyres .
neutral	buying tyres via telephone is pointless as you cant actually check them straight_away to know what they are offering to you .
neutral	but if there is no tires available in stock , they should inform about that on website , not jusk ask you to pay for what they haven ' t actually got .
neutral	good communication
neutral	ordered 0 items in past_year , 0 have been cancelled by hmv after anything from a day to 0 weeks for various reasons .
neutral	( maybe i ' m unlucky )
neutral	i still order from them , i ' m just not too surprised if they cancel the order .
neutral	if they truly have the item in stock , you ' ll usually get a " it ' s on its way " email the next_day or so and everything is nice and fast .
neutral	the letting you know the item is in the post is a good touch .
neutral	if you find a really good bargain , just don ' t be too surprised to get a cancel order email a few_days_later .
neutral	the money is refund quick enough so you can buy elsewhere if needed .
neutral	love the target deals , but i don ' t love the organization of the site .
neutral	if a dress comes in 0 colors , why do i need to search for each entry separately ?
neutral	why can ' t i see all options at once ?
neutral	makes it a bit frustrating to navigate , but the prices do make it worth it ...
neutral	haven ' t had any trouble with transtools over several orders .
neutral	stuff takes a few_days to arrive , not a next_day outfit so if you do want it quick maybe look_elsewhere .
neutral	but the prices and range i think are good .
neutral	latest order was sent in two parcels , one parcel went astray but that was citylink ' s fault and arrived the next_day [ website showed 0 parcels but they only delivered 0 ].
neutral	when i emailed transtools , they responded quickly .
neutral	you only know how good a company is when things go_wrong .
neutral	haven ' t had cause to fault transtools yet so until then i ' m happy to keep using them .
neutral	i have asked several_times about the elimis tri - enzyme resurfacing serums ( there is more_than one since i have 0 different kinds ) and i either get told there is only the one or that there are 0 .
neutral	while the 0 is great , i still don ' t know which one is called tri - enzyme resurfacing serum 0 and 0 .
neutral	it seems that the people in customer_service don ' t either .
neutral	otherwise i love the product .
neutral	just wish i could find what i ' m looking for .
neutral	it was a good quality costume , got delivered really quickly , good service but it didn ' t fit
neutral	i ' ve placed 0 orders with them , after about 0 weeks only 0 of them has tracked so have had to lodge claims for the sake of about 00p an item :
neutral	0 with rubbersoles . co . uk which tracked immediately with no_problems
neutral	0 with play . com which have not tracked at all
neutral	0 with tesco which has also not tracked
neutral	i guess it all depends on the reliability of the merchant to report the sale to top_cashback , which it is not in their best interests to do .
neutral	i will keep using them , but if there ' s any more of this i won ' t bother as it ' s not worth my time to keep chasing amounts of 00p odd .
neutral	original review - i would not purchase from ebuyer again ( after spending c . £ 0 , 000 over the last 0 - 0 years ) based on their response to my recent return under the distance_selling regulations , where their trained squirrel quoted an oftguidance document and beleived it to take precedence over the actual legislation !
neutral	' i know about the sale of goods_act ' was her response , which was nice , but tht ' a s a different piece of legislation to the distance_selling regulations 0000 and the oft document is open to interpretation whereas the legislation is clear on leaving the customer out of pocket for returns under the0 day period of the distance sellings regs !
neutral	suffice to say ( fortunately i am in the legal profession so my fees will be coming out of ebuyers pocket ) taking them to small_claims court as it is a principal that amazon , play , and other good e_- tailers don ' t abuse .
neutral	will shop at amazon or dabs from now on as always had excellent service and well trained staff .
neutral	that said , very little has ever been returnred to any of them !
neutral	updated following the very fast ' response ' from ebuyer ' s nikki .
neutral	absolute diddly squat !
neutral	funny how they can instantly respond to such reviews and ' sound ' great and concerned to anyone reading them , but then ... still do nothing !
neutral	if their service was as good as their responding to poor reviews , then there would probably be no poor reviews !
neutral	update !
neutral	should have updated this a while ago !
neutral	ebuyer did remedy this issue and acknowledged that it was the goods at fault .
neutral	although they required chasing which should have been needed , they did reimburse my out of pocket expenses in sending back the defective goods .
neutral	note that they took less_than an_hour to test the items to find them not suitable .
neutral	as such , i have altered the rating to 0_stars as this is a ' middle of the road ' experience now that resolution has passed rather_than a truly_awful one .
neutral	hopefully they will have learnt from the customer_service experience .
neutral	i will find out when making future_purchases .
neutral	ordered bred 00 from the site and they gave me a box with a huge crease in it like it was on the bottom of a heavy stack
neutral	i ordered a humax hdr0000s freesat pvr from electricshop .
neutral	this was my first ever order with them .
neutral	i chose electricshop as they were the cheapest reputable store i could find on the web .
neutral	order communication was good , and the item arrived_promptly today .
neutral	however , when i opened the grey mail bag , i was very disappointed to discover that this item had just been shipped in its retail packaging , and not in a box .
neutral	this is not ideal for fragile products that contain hdds .
neutral	i actually ordered a youview_box direct from humax last_week , and that was sent in a strong cardboard_box and packed with additional airbags to insulate the product from the inevitable rough handling by couriers .
neutral	if humax ship their products like this , then so should resellers of their products .
neutral	i got a good price on my ticket , but bad online reviews made me a bit_worried_about whether i ' d perhaps even been scammed !
neutral	so i checked with the airline ( not crystal ) that everything was booked properly and it was .
neutral	customer_service at crystal itself was pretty hopeless , they just wanted to get off the phone as quickly as possible .
neutral	not the most confidence inspiring experience , but looks_like it should work out ok , and for a good price .
neutral	i use iphone for internet ..
neutral	it took me 00mins to leave a review for a company it only took me 0 mins to book return transfers from airport to hotel not happy .. takes 0 sec delay for what you type to come up on screen ..
neutral	same del in tryin to navigate site :(
neutral	i booked one ticket for beyonce at the o0 on 0th_may and paid just under double the face_value .
neutral	everything went very smoothly and the ticket arrived in good time .
neutral	the ticket looked genuine but i still wasn ' t getting my hopes up after_reading some of the reviews .
neutral	when i got to the o0 and the ticket was scanned , it came up on the scanner as rejected and i was taken over to see a man who worked there and he asked me my name , where i ' d got the ticket from and he had a list of names with the row number , seat number etc with the original sellers name and address under the heading reject and mine was one of them .
neutral	i explained i had bought the ticket from viagogo and he went off to speak to ' ticketing ' at the venue for about 00_minutes , which left me there waiting before he eventually came back and told me that my ticket was fine and i was allowed in .
neutral	i was so relieved i didn ' t think to ask what the confusion was .
neutral	i was worried that someone was going to come along and want my seat through the concert but everything turned_out okay in the end and i forgot all about it once beyonce was on .
neutral	i don ' t think i would use the site again because of this , its too risky !
neutral	edit
neutral	trans id :_0000000
neutral	good , but i ' m jealous of the movie deals from orange at the moment
neutral	i don ' t order much from amazon anymore , i find their prices tend to be more_expensive than other_companies and out of the 0 recent orders in which i paid for a timed delivery i have only received 0 on time .
neutral	however i did receive the money back for the delivery
neutral	love the phone and love orange wednesday but hate the website .
neutral	hard to log on and look at your stuff , improve your website orange !
neutral	i wish the site was more user_friendly ; being_able to view all supplements related to what a user is searching .
neutral	i believe this would help in overall sales proffits , and helping the consumer to find the best supplement for them , seeing how supplements are different for every body type .
neutral	item arrived on time and was quite cheap , but customer_services were very poor indeed when something went wrong
neutral	do not book a collection when it ' s cold - it will not get collected as all their couriers are afraid of snow , ice or even the prospect of snow and ice .
neutral	it took 00 days for one of my parcels to be delivered !
neutral	their service is the cheapest door - 0 - door service .
neutral	all items can be tracked online .
neutral	customer_service is poor - i am still_awaiting a response to a delay claim .
neutral	every order i place i seem to have to return something because the item is faulty , sized incorrectly or not as advertised .
neutral	customer_service staff are not too clever by the responses i get , they appear to fail at the basics of reading an_email .
neutral	additionally , when i item is exchanged , they automatically add £ 0 . 00 p_& p again and every time i have to email and ask them to refund it - getting very tiresome !
neutral	good joe browns range and £ 0 . 00 next_day delivery is great value .
neutral	its easy but its costs more_than going your self i always get less_than when i go and do it myself you cant look for the deals either !
neutral	if your trying to save money go to your local_store
neutral	not great some things are cheap but the rest is overpriced just like b and q
neutral	hostelbookers itself was great !
neutral	i needed to book an inexpensive room very quickly before catching an_hour - long train , and the website made that very easy to do .
neutral	the only problem was that when i got to the hostel that night , no one was at the front_desk .
neutral	i was let in by a couple staying there and left my billing information , because management was still not at the hostel before i left .
neutral	i will probably use the website again .
neutral	paypal takes such a massive cut out of your transactions , it almost isn ' t worth it .
neutral	ebay takes such a huge cut , it ' s almost not worth selling on it .
neutral	booked to usa and got some good tickets , patient people , good prices , was generally very happy .
neutral	it was let_down by the insurance .
neutral	i got an annual policy with them and needed to claim on another trip to france , a few_months later .
neutral	this was by coach to stansted , to france by ryanair and hire_car to the accommodation in france .
neutral	unfortunately i fell ill and the insurers sent a form that applied only to a package holiday and tour operator , not to separately booked segments .
neutral	it was very , very hard to fill it out since it did not apply to the kind of trip i had taken .
neutral	but i got a medical certificate saying i ' d been too ill to travel and a letter from the french accommodation saying i hadn ' t been able to come , and a note that the car_hire in france had not been used , but they still refused to pay out on the coach and ryanair because i couldn ' t prove i hadn ' t caught the coach to stansted and i couldn ' t prove i ' d missed the ryanair flights .
neutral	my husband was booked with a different insurer and claimed for just the same things as me ( we each claimed 00 percent of the joint items ) but his claim was paid in full .
neutral	i am really out of pocket due to the inflexibility of this old_fashioned insurance offered by trailfinders and it has quite put me off them .
neutral	i would have thought they could get a more up to date and flexible insurance , and this definitely did not seem like a good deal to me .
neutral	i know that people are generally opposed to change in all forms , but in facebook ' s case i think that user opposition is justified .
neutral	layout and feature overhauls aren ' t uncommon , and after they are introduced it doesn ' t seem to matter what people think - the changes are permanent .
neutral	they could do well by listening to feedback .
neutral	other than that , it is a solid social_networking site .
neutral	they ' ll probably stay on top for a long time , but the way that they ' re running things is giving plenty of opportunities for better sites to swiftly take away their users .
neutral	first off , i do purchase my music , but the prices on itunes are just off - putting sometimes .
neutral	i would go for the occasional album , but they just don ' t seem to be throwing a lot of offers out there nowadays .
neutral	it can also be frustrating to search for music on their site and find out that they don ' t have it .
neutral	rarely you ' ll find an original and interesting article on ign .
neutral	however , their videos can be decent , ranging_from informative to humourous , and is the strong point of the site .
neutral	unfortunately , they are given an incentive to review certain games favourably , which really tarnishes ign ' s reputation amongst gamers .
neutral	for some reviews this is really obvious and distracting , especially compared to other gaming review sites ( but this practice of companies pushing for good reviews doesn ' t just fall onto ign , don ' t get me wrong ).
neutral	you might as well be reading a piece written by the lead developer of a game in some_cases .
neutral	they do have some good writers , but they ' re just not given enough free will .
neutral	an overhaul is needed of their commenting system , which is poorly implemented and usually just serves the purpose of breeding criticism and arguments between users .
neutral	haven ' t had a huge_amount of history with them , but they have a fairly good site and i haven ' t run into any_problems ( yet ).
neutral	however , there ' s just something about paypal that i can ' t quite put my finger on ; it really feels_like they ' re lacking a useful presence .
neutral	i get the feeling that it would be a nightmare to resolve a problem with an exchange .
neutral	also , adding / changing addresses on the site is stupidly overcomplicated .
neutral	i personally would nt use them again , on the website it states to allow up to 00 days for them to receive items but after that it takes up to another 0 days for the items to be processed in the warehouse then you receive an_email asking to verify your bank_details and states payment can take up to another 0 days .
neutral	i sent my items 00 days ago and still_waiting for my payment to be processed .
neutral	it all seems quite a lengthy time process !!
neutral	!
neutral	great quality products .
neutral	next_day delivery failed ( order at 0 . 00pm , waited in all next_day , cam day after !!
neutral	).
neutral	when arrived wrong hinges in box although invoice said correct , have returned for refund .
neutral	ordered a washing_machine from them , as i really needed it next_day .
neutral	delivered as promised , so far so good .
neutral	however , somewhere between the order and delivery i got a phone call from them where they started by confirming my delivery details and then_proceeded pushing me for an extended protection scheme with monthly_payments .
neutral	i don ' t know why i agreed - i must be slow thinking over the phone .
neutral	got the papers today , did some calculations , and was shocked by how much of a rip_off it was !
neutral	by the end of my 0 year normal warranty , i would have already paid a third of the appliance ' s cost !
neutral	cancelled the policy immediately , without paying anything .
neutral	but hell , they knew pretty well it was a rip_off when they pushed me for it !
neutral	therefore , 0_stars .
neutral	if they try to bug me further , even calling to apologize , an additional star will go for each call ...
neutral	this was only based on a simple mot .
neutral	i have a friend locally who is a mechanic and does all the work on my car so knew that it would pass without any_issues .
neutral	i ' m not sure i would be prepared to have my car serviced through them though based on previous reviews , though this will all come down to the garage doing the work on their behalf and i think on this occasion i got lucky .
neutral	i have been with o0 for a number of years , around about 00 i would say .
neutral	i am on a very low monthly tariff which suits my needs perfectly and have a very up to date phone .
neutral	they offer early upgrades and usually have the latest handsets .
neutral	when , and usually before the contract expires , a free upgrade is offered .
neutral	both the o0 store and o0 online have very good deals with extremely competitive_prices .
neutral	their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price , with the cheapest line installation around .
neutral	however , one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing_customers , they no_longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small amount meaning they are no_longer benefiting their existing_customers , who may now decide to leave .
neutral	transferring money to swedish accounts doesn ' t have any benefits .
neutral	the rate at seb sweden today was 0 . 000000 ( source : seb . se ), in transferwise it was 0 . 0000 .
neutral	a sepa ( euro payment in eu ) transaction costs 0 . 00 €, transferwise charges 0 . 00 €.
neutral	so if i ' d transfer today 000 € then i ' d lose (( 000 * 0 , 0000 ) - 0 . 00 ) - (( 000 * 0 . 0000 ) - 0 . 00 ) = 00 . 00 € usnig transferwise .
neutral	so if the bank is not robbing you , its actually better to use a real bank .
neutral	was annoyed that i had to proof who i am before i got my code .
neutral	i scanned my bank card and passport and about to send it to cjs and bang my code was there .
neutral	no need to send anything to them .
neutral	so what was the point in the email ??
neutral	?
neutral	after keying all payment details when booking flights got a processing transaction message for two minutes followed_by an error_message .
neutral	had to ring company ( phone picked_up quickly by staff ) to find out payment not processed .
neutral	they sent email with a link to sagepay to pay for flights .
neutral	as other_users have mentioned you need to have some confidence in a site especially when paying quite a lot of money for flights and unfortunately this site did not provide that .
neutral	you need to seriously look at improving the payment process as i ' m sure its crucial to your customers , as well as your company .
neutral	also - just realised , after spending some time on the internet and booking through this company , money is taken straight_away , but tickets not issued until 00hrs later , and there is no guarantee you will get the tickets at prices quoted ( see their terms and conditions ) so there is a chance you dont get tickets at all .
neutral	if you dont want hassle and peace of mind , book with someone_else and pay that little extra .
neutral	after_reading reviews , i must_say my story is similar to many others .
neutral	i ordered from them 0 times and every time something was wrong .
neutral	automatic discounts ( buy 0 for 0 ) won ' t work - you have to contact them to fix that .
neutral	and yes , they send you cheaper alternative and don ' t refund the difference .
neutral	and you have spend ages to prove that what they sent you was wrong - emails , sending pictures , phone_calls ... customer_service is yuck .
neutral	will not be bothered to buy again
neutral	good place to shop
neutral	best to shop
neutral	good place to buy
neutral	food was in poor condition !
neutral	stick to purchasing in store !
neutral	big_mistake !
neutral	bonjour ,
neutral	a priori il_y a beaucoup de mécontents , quelle que soit la nationalité des acheteurs ..
neutral	au vu des dernières reviews ( infurn . fr et infurn . com ) je_suis assez inquiète concernant notre première commande chez infurn ( au 000000 ) datant de tout début avril 0000 .
neutral	il s ' agit de 0 chaises victoria ghost ( starck ) et nous_avons évidemment trouvé que_le site d ' infurn était très bien fait , hyper attractif avec_des prix défiant toute concurrence .
neutral	nous ne nous sommes même pas méfié une seconde , l ' entreprise étant européenne avec_des filiales un_peu partout en uk , espagne , etc .. tout paraissait parfait , sauf le délai de_livraison qui était d ' après nous un_peu exagéré mais bon , nous étions prêts à attendre pour obtenir ce que_nous voulions .
neutral	0 .
neutral	livraison prévue la semaine du 00 août 0000 : nous_avons indiqué sur_le site ( dans notre_compte client ) une adresse de_livraison différente de_notre adresse habituelle car nous serions en congés .
neutral	0 .
neutral	lors de ma consultation de_notre_compte au début de_l ' été , je m ' aperçois que_le statut de_la commande est toujours " en attente de fabrication " et que la_livraison est passée à_la semaine du 00 septembre .. première mauvaise surprise .
neutral	et pas un seul message pour nous prévenir : c ' est à nous de le découvrir presque " par hasard ".
neutral	je rédige donc un message au service client en demandant pour quelle raison la_livraison est différée de plus d ' un mois et pour dire que vraiment , là , ça devient trop long .
neutral	réponse immédiate par tél + mail ( une dame a laissé un message sur mon répondeur en me disant qu ' elle m ' envoyait un email ) : les chaises n ' étaient pas conformes à leurs standards de_qualité donc ils les font refaire .
neutral	cette_fois la date de_livraison est garantie mais si je veux annuler ma_commande je_n ' ai qu ' à le confirmer .
neutral	de plus ils s ' excusent , font un geste commercial en créditant notre_compte client ( pas notre_compte en banque , on est d ' accord ..) de 00_% du montant de_notre commande ( à utiliser comme bon nous semble sur_le site ).
neutral	je dis que ok , je veux bien attendre un mois de plus mais plus de blagues , cette_fois je_n ' accepterai pas d ' autre retard .
neutral	0 .
neutral	il_y a 0 jours en consultant le compte client , nouvelle " surprise ": la date de_livraison est passée au 00 novembre pour la même raison qu ' évoquée précédemment : défaut de_qualité , retour à_l ' envoyeur et refabrication .
neutral	cette_fois le compte client comporte un message expliquant tout_ceci , avec nouvelles excuses à_la clé .
neutral	je décide de leur écrire afin d ' annuler .
neutral	tant pis pour_le_prix intéressant , cela fait 0 mois que_nous attendons des chaises pour compléter le salon , nos travaux sont finis et on arrête de rigoler .
neutral	je leur dis dans le mail qu ' ils_ont perdu notre confiance , que c ' est dommage mais que_nous désirons le remboursement immédiat .
neutral	habituellement la réponse du service client est immédiate , mais là , au bout de plus d ' une semaine et 0 emails , aucune nouvelle .
neutral	uniquement des accusés de réception envoyés en automatique .
neutral	d ' où mon inquiétude .
neutral	je me suis donc renseignée , ai consulté différents forums et suis encore plus inquiète !
neutral	!
neutral	si tout_ceci devait s ' éterniser , nous_avons trouvé un moyen de faire appel à différentes instances ( avec juristes , etc ..) pour régler ce litige ; apparemment de nombreux clients d ' infurn connaissent les même problèmes et tout_ceci prends de_l ' ampleur .
neutral	il n ' est_pas dans leur intérêt de jouer comme ça avec les nerfs et l ' argent des clients qui leur font confiance , et_je_suis prête à comprendre que des délais de fabrication peuvent être très allongés , qu ' ils_ont beaucoup de commandes ( et certainement de réclamations ) à traiter et qu ' ils sont débordés .
neutral	je_ne souhaite pas fusiller l ' enseigne et abonder dans tous les forums avec_des commentaires négatifs et ne demande qu ' un règlement à_l ' amiable , comme avec toute enseigne sérieuse et respectueuse de ses clients et de_la législation .
neutral	je m ' estimerai satisfaite quand notre demande d ' annulation sera bien prise en compte + quand nous serons remboursés de_la somme prélevée .
neutral	nous aurons perdu un_peu de temps mais pas plus .
neutral	je rendrai compte régulièrement de_l ' avancée de tout_ceci sur trustpilot et d ' autres forums / blogs .
neutral	en espérant que cette expérience sera utile et se terminera bien ...
neutral	00 / 00 : j ai reçu un appel de jeremie de infurn .
neutral	il m a confirme que_le remboursement avait bien ete fait , ce que_j avais constate moi meme ce matin completement par hasard en consultant notre_compte bancaire en ligne .
neutral	la societe a donc bien recredite notre carte bancaire avant la fin du delai de 00 jours .
neutral	donc , pas tres bonne experience commefciale ( c est le moins qu on puisse dire ) mais societe honnete et de bonne foi , mon experience me le prouve a present .
neutral	je_suis prete a commander a nouveau chez_eux , mais cette_fois uniquement les produits disponibles immediatement .
neutral	autant d attente et surtout de retard , ca n est_pas possible ...
neutral	tryed to buy jewelry set as a present only for the last two days the link saying no deal found after paying , checking my bank_statement this morning to find they ' ve charcged me 00 . 00 twice !!
neutral	fumming , single hard working mum trying to shop about for presents and now £_00 down !!
neutral	emailed and no reply ,,
neutral	i have spoken to a very polite man after a response to this and now have claimed my gift and the other 00 . 00 has been refunded , thank_you would still be a little_weary to use again unaided .
neutral	not to bad .
neutral	ordered a case from them for a very good price but item took longer then expected to arrive and also case was damaged on arrival , not badly but still damaged , thankfully does not effect the working of it or the aesthetics .
neutral	i did not contact customer_services to get this replaced as it was fun and games enough trying to find out why it took so long .
neutral	also ordered a fan controller on a seperate order and this arrived in the given time but on closer_inspection i can see that the courier has manhandled the item and all the knobs were slightly bent , again no reason to get it replaced as the item works and unless your really looking you wont see it .
neutral	i wouldn ' t order from them again , rather pay the extra and order from another company .
neutral	really great , easy way of getting a take out in a larger town , and im sure as the site develops more and more businesses will eventually post their menus etc .
neutral	living in a smaller town on a weekend however proves to be a bit of a nightmare .
neutral	none of the local take outs have joined up or even submitted their menu , but this is hardly just eats fault .
neutral	ok service , would recommend .
neutral	i have been loyal to o0 since owning a mobile phone .
neutral	i love the service they provide and the signal is fantastic for where i live ( in the sticks ) however , the crazy expensive contracts are beginning to wind me up and the repair service is incredibly_frustrating .
neutral	they couldn ' t understand the original fault with my phone so instead replaced the circuit board which hasn ' t helped the problem at all .
neutral	next time , i think i will send it to htc directly as they seemed to understand the problem a lot better when i explained it to them .
neutral	apart_from that , o0 are still a good company , but they need to be more competitive in terms of pricing and benefits if they want to keep up with their competitors .
neutral	buying a domain is an_absolute bargain .
neutral	however the hosting options seem a little expensive in comparison to their competitors .
neutral	switching hosts proved to be a little frustrating and the agent i was contacting proved to be less_than helpful .
neutral	would recommend for cheap domains , but for the rest of the service , including buying email accounts , head somewhere_else for a much more affordable service .
neutral	the aol website is quick and easy to use , but as an internet provider , i just cannot recommend them .
neutral	i used aol before switching to bt , which i still remain on til this day .
neutral	the customer_service and internet_connection was collectively terrible .
neutral	not a month went by without a fault or problem , incredibly_frustrating .
neutral	the customer_service was mediocre .
neutral	occasionally they would manage to reset the line ?
neutral	and it would magically turn back on .
neutral	other times this didn ' t work and we had to wait it out to retrieve connection again .
neutral	bit of a nightmare .
neutral	i ordered a product and specified a separate delivery address ( my work ) to my billing_address ( my family home ).
neutral	it arrived very quickly but i only found out when my mum called me to say that i had post .
neutral	i avoid deliveries to my flat as it ' s not very secure but it ' s inconvenient to have to travel to my mum ' s house to pick_up some makeup !
neutral	!
neutral	in addition , i stopped being_able to make card payments temporarily and when i called up my bank , they said that there was a discrepancy and possible fraud on my account which when we looked closer was caused by the fragrance_direct transaction which failed to pass full security because the addresses didn ' t match .
neutral	i can understand this extra layer of security when its an expensive product like electronics but it ' s a very low ticket item .
neutral	that said delivery was very fast and the price of goods and shipping very reasonable and i would still use fragrance_direct if i could be sure these problems didn ' t happen again .
neutral	have used paypal for many years .
neutral	very useful service but customer_service is generally pretty bad .
neutral	they can also be a pain if you are a seller on ebay , with holding payments until they are satisfied you aren ' t fraudulent .
neutral	innocent until proven guilty anyone ?
neutral	ordered tubes which arrived in flimsy box and both had been snapped , charterhoue resent and luckily new tubes arrived ok but still send in cardboard_box , would think that these could be easily squished
neutral	read the other review and therefore made up my mind to go with company formations 000 instead of the one my friend_recommended me .
neutral	a bit disappointed to be honest .
neutral	check out was quick and easy , they first take money out therefore you have no way back .
neutral	afterward they will tell you what add - on you can purchase however you have already made the payment .
neutral	i first thought the " gold package " includes " registered office service " therefore they will forward the important document to me free of charge , but apparently when i fill in the details they ask if i want to use their redirect services otherwise my residential address will be shown as the services address .
neutral	i would like to point out that the intention for " registered office service " is to protect the director ( buyer ) home address however if the services address is made public and you have to pay extra to protect it .
neutral	it makes no sense to have a registered office address where the public can just find out where you live from the services address .
neutral	and this should be explained clearly in the package page and also they should not take the payment until the final step .
neutral	other then that everything was smooth and solid hence the 0 star_review .
neutral	item appeared to be in stock until i ordered it .
neutral	does not reply to emails .
neutral	not sent until a month after ordering ( ordered on 00 jan , sent on 00 feb ).
neutral	however the item itself was new and in excellent condition as ordered .
neutral	i use this as my platform for blogging and it is fine , relatively easy to use but is starting to feel a bit tired .
neutral	nothing wrong or broken , but i struggle to make my blog feel as modern as others ( perhaps that ' s because i ' m not a great designer !)
neutral	great place for a stag night !
neutral	we ' re with bt at the moment , have been for around 0 years .
neutral	since then we ' ve had numerous charges that shouldn ' t have been on there .
neutral	called up a couple of time to have to wait 00minutes for somebody in india to pick_up .
neutral	they then say they ' ll write a note on the system and the charge will be reversed ( which doesn ' t actually appear to happen ).
neutral	also upgraded with them to infinity , to then get a bill for over £_000 for leaving the previous contract early and £_00 for the existing hub which i refused to pay .
neutral	remember to write down the vol id number when dealing_with them , as they are sloppy in keeping their promises .
neutral	i used to use ebay all the time , but it appears nowadays the majority of auctions are set by companies and ebay businesses .
neutral	there ' s nothing wrong with this , but it ' s not the same as it used to be where people are selling their used belongings for much less_than it would cost in the shops .
neutral	overall good , customer_service lacking though
neutral	so let me start by saying that my product did arrive and it was in good condition .
neutral	however , the company took my payment as soon as i ordered and did not ship the product for 0 days !
neutral	after 0 days i was extremely concerned and had the same customer_service rep telling_me " your product will arrive by friday ."
neutral	i didn ' t see this possible .. on friday i checked again and to no surprise my product had not been shipped ..
neutral	i contacted them again and this time i finally received a different service rep !
neutral	he guaranteed my product will be there by monday , and it did arrive on monday .
neutral	i did not enjoy my experience with this company and will not be using them again .
neutral	i do not recommend this company .
neutral	my first experience with this company was quiete shocking .
neutral	when i arrived to their office i realiyed that i could get the car for the same price only if i want it without insurance .
neutral	seriously who would hire a car without insurance ?
neutral	so , of course i needed to pay than i booked the car .
neutral	except this everything was fine but is not a good attitude for a big company !
neutral	busuu is great for meeting and getting to speak with natives of the language you are trying to learn .
neutral	i like the idea of natives and speakers of the language marking your exercises as you can get fast feedback but it ' s not always trustworthy .
neutral	i ' ve seen plenty of cases where someone has tried to correct an english exercise but the correction was riddled with errors .
neutral	this is not good for someone trying to learn the language .
neutral	they need to see almost perfect english / german / italian / whatever the language may be , if not it can be very easy to get confused .
neutral	everyone seems to correct exercises differently and a guideline for those marking exercises would be useful .
neutral	busuu lacks in one major area which is grammar lessons .
neutral	there are few explanations on the grammar and structure of sentences which is one of the main crucial areas of learning a language .
neutral	this is why i think busuu should only be used as an additional tool coincide with a language course or book and not a single learning resource .
neutral	it would be beneficial for busuu and it ' s users to concentrate on tackling the grammar issues to improve it ' s service .
neutral	i believe a lot of small improvements can be made but the it team ( if they use the site ) should be able to recognise most of these .
neutral	a new feature i would love to see is classrooms .
neutral	this is where users from the same native language could enrol into a class that has a trusted community member ( s ) or a paid busuu staff_member that will help teach the class members .
neutral	this would be much more beneficial than trying to speak to another member to help with your chosen language that doesn ' t know your own language .
neutral	people in the class can speak to one another and help one another progress .
neutral	you can proceed to the more advanced classes when the tutor believes you know enough to proceed and are consistent with using correct grammar and vocabulary within the unit .
neutral	this will help force more repetition and more learning rather_than writing a few poor sentences that get badly marked and then proceeding to the next unit without actually learning anything .
neutral	in summary_:
neutral	i believe busuu is a great place to make contacts with natives in the language you are wanting to learn which makes it a valuable resources .
neutral	without grammar lessons , as it stands busuu isn ' t comprehensive enough to actually learn a language from using it alone .
neutral	there should be trusted community members or paid tutors to go over corrections to make_sure the student of the language is not being mislead by a correction .
neutral	i believe more support needs to be added for members to learn together and stay motivated .
neutral	needs more of a big size section , theres hardly anything ! its good for size 00s and under but what about 00 ' s !
neutral	i made an order 0nd july on some shoes .
neutral	they werent in stock but were supposed to be shipped to golfstoreeurope within 0 - 0 days .
neutral	it has gone 0 working_days and my order havent been shipped or taken care of .
neutral	i ´ m waiting ...
neutral	i used to shop at river_island quite_often however started to notice that the clothes i bought from there ( in particular the tshirts ) got holes in them .
neutral	i wouldnt mind so much if the prices were cheap but when you have other shops that are cheaper selling the same sort of thing its quite annoying !
neutral	i must_admit that i love river_island handbags and they do tend to last .
neutral	i find some of the clothes a little chavvy at times and a bit dated .
neutral	the mens clothes seem to be more fashionable than the womens .
neutral	i have used misco for years but something has happened to their site recently .
neutral	i dont mind the look but the categories are all over the place .
neutral	i ordered a belt for my printer and phoned after a week to see where it was only to be told it was out of stock for another 00 days !
neutral	their other supplier had one in stock but it cost more so they would not send it , not my problem !
neutral	it was listed at a price and said in stock , i dont give a rats ass if you messed it up i just need the flippig thing :(
neutral	ordered the pump on friday_morning and it arrived monday .
neutral	it arrived in the actually pump box which was mis shaped , when i opened up the pump had been rolling around in the box due to cardboard holder in side being lose .
neutral	probably wouldn ' t of happening if the box was packaged in another with bubble_wrap or something .
neutral	in this case the pump was ok but why risk it !
neutral	first time i have ever felt the need to review a company - i ordered at 00 : 00 on friday so just missed the cut_off for next_day delievery ( which as i paid £_00 . 00 for my bracket im not to worried_about next_day ) bracket arrived in perfect order and fits my tv perfectly .
neutral	yes its wednesday so 0 full working_days since my order but as tilting brackets for 00 " tv ' s usually go for around £_000 ... who_cares ?
neutral	not exeptional service but by no means aweful .
neutral	maybe if i were a more anal person i would be concerned_about my tv bracket being a couple of days late .
neutral	it ' s cheap , it works , who_cares ?
neutral	facebook was all craze .
neutral	and so it should have been .
neutral	until they put timeline in .
neutral	i dont think anybody really likes it .
neutral	messaging no_longer works at 000_% sometimes you send a message more_than once or not at all .
neutral	games on there are good but tbh .
neutral	since timeline post people have moved over to twitter .
neutral	i sent my samsung_galaxy_s0 away for a guarantee price of £_000 .
neutral	however a few_days_later i was sent an offer of £_000 because the device tested faulty ( which it was not ).
neutral	in fact they had deducted over £_00 from the guaranteed price because of a very small crack on the corner of the device .
neutral	no where near the screen .
neutral	i used to work in a phone shop and i know that this is classed_as slight cosmetic_damage not faulty .
neutral	i believe that a reduction of that much was unfair .
neutral	good service over all and very fast , however i won ' t be recommending them .
neutral	i ' ve been using american sweets ( aka the stateside candy co .) for quite some time now and i ' m sorry to say my general feelings towards the company have become rather negative .
neutral	the major issue i have with the company is that almost every time i place an order i find that when i open my parcel there are multiple items missing as they , according to the company , have become out - of - stock ( or in some circumstances were found broken in the warehouse ) since placing the order .
neutral	they seriously need to look in to how they can improve their ordering system as it ' s quite disgusting paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery of a parcel with at_least 00_% of it ' s expected contents missing .
neutral	next in line is that the price of clearance items can drop quite sudden and dramatically , and i have contacted them about this before after i placed an order only to find that three items had been reduced in price by 00_% overnight .
neutral	their response was simply " your parcel has been dispatched and therefore we can amend any prices ".
neutral	finally their customer_service skills are lacking somewhat .
neutral	i ' ve contacted them several_times over the year and the tone of the e_- mails ( usually responded to by emma baker ) are rather abrupt , that is if they ' re not ignored completely .
neutral	from reading the reviews of this company by other customers , it seems that all have complaints of a similar nature , and i would highly advise the director to take these issues onboard if they wish to keep customers .
neutral	before i finish , i just remembered that on my last order which had items ' out - of - stock ', the items were refunded ( as i requested ) but the refund was issued by cash enclosed inside an envelope - which i think speaks_volumes about their professionalism , or lack of .
neutral	before you buy from curry check online you will get better price 000_%
neutral	i use paypal a lot they are really good untill you have a problem .
neutral	does nt matter whos fault is it you will end up on losing side
neutral	i recieved some payment in us dollor approx 000 i call them up and ask them if i can transfer they money into my us dollor bank_account as dollor because paypal rate was very bad so i told them transfer they money into my bank and let them do the conversion .
neutral	rep told me yes thats fine and sent the money ,
neutral	i went to the bank and guess_what they converted the money and sent ponds in my account i call them up and ask them i dont want you to convert so i was told not possible i said ok revers the transfer which they did .
neutral	but now i only have $_000 i call again and ask where is the rest and was told it was lost in conversion i ask if i can speak to the manager but that did nt really help they would nt admit it was there mistake and would give me any money back what a joke
neutral	so after 0 phone_calls couple of bank transer i was back to squar one with a lost of $_00
neutral	as much as i enjoy shopping in hobbycraft , i ' ve found slowly but surely that production selection has gone down within my favourite section of craft .
neutral	paper craft .
neutral	now i understand that it ' s not possible to stock every_single product available .
neutral	but after a lot of the stores were done up and it seemed like half the products disappeared .
neutral	i ' ve also noticed it with other sections too .
neutral	also i find hobbycraft very expensive , seeing as hc is the only big craft store in the uk , you ' d think you wouldn ' t need to have such high prices on things .
neutral	i run a business myself and understand profit margins , but some of hc ' s are crazy
neutral	i have two holidays with this company and the first one was a breeze .
neutral	las_vegas trip worked out cheap compared to the deals i was getting during the time .
neutral	recently i booked two days break for dublin and that experience was interesting .
neutral	i checked the details online and was about to book online .
neutral	as we were a party of six i decided to call up the call_centre .
neutral	i got through to an overseas call_centre and managed to find the deal i was looking for .
neutral	i explained to the agent that we were a party of 0 and the money will be paid on two cards .
neutral	i admit that agent was very accommodating and explained the first card payment will be 00_% of the total and the second will be 00 %.
neutral	i informed her that i am not happy with this and she agreed that it will be fine to pay for 0 people on one card and 0 on the other .
neutral	all prices and flight times were agreed and booking continued .
neutral	when it came to processing payment whatever i explained about paying for 0 people on one card went out of the window .
neutral	she quoted 00_% of the charge .
neutral	as we were back to square one i explained what i wanted again .
neutral	agent informed me that it should be done as 0 booking .
neutral	once the second booking was created we carried on with the payment .
neutral	before processing the payment the agent informed me the amount she will be deducting of the card and asked my permission .
neutral	i agreed as everything was correct .
neutral	i was waiting for the first payment to be processed she came back on the phone and informed me that the prices have gone up .
neutral	i was a bit confused and questioned it .
neutral	the agent informed me that she works on a live system and prices can change .
neutral	i informed her that i am not happy about this as you were just about to take payment for a agreed amount .
neutral	she informed me that there is nothing she can do and even a manager cant help .
neutral	i informed her that i was disappointed with the service but " i cant do anything was the reply ".
neutral	i was not happy about this so i decided to book it via expedia website .
neutral	i found that the rates were the same as before and nothing different .
neutral	while entering the details of the passenger i noticed that the agent had spelt one of the passengers name wrong which i was not happy about as this would have coasted us more if it needed to be changed later .
neutral	i entered correct information and continued with the booking .
neutral	once the booking was at payment page .
neutral	the price changed and came to the amount agent mentioned on the phone .
neutral	i noticed that the difference in price was only £ 0 per_person which the agent failed to mention .
neutral	on the positive side we didn ' t end up paying extra to change passenger spelling .
neutral	personally i feel that they should have adjusted the fluxuating rate after the price was agreed which would have been the real expedia experience ( they would have gained that additional 0_stars )
neutral	positive
neutral	easy to use website , good deals , no credit_card charge .
neutral	negative
neutral	overseas call_centre was a let_down both on quality and service .
neutral	rates can fluxuate so until last_minute you wont know how much you are paying .
neutral	to be honest if you get 00 / 00 vision from laser_eye_surgery than brilliant but sadly i did not , though i still have to keep paying for another 0 years on a service that was not completed !
neutral	i was told that it might not be perfect and its not .
neutral	all the staff were amazing and very friendly , sadly though once it was all over and the surgeon said no to a touch up laser i was left in the dark , no options given or offered .
neutral	i just did not get out of it what i wanted - great 00 / 00 vision .
neutral	if you have a so - so prescription or lower_than go for it , if your eye sight is relatively bad than give it a miss .
neutral	( id_0000000 )
neutral	got my tickets for one direction belfast in november i did pay alot more_than ticket price but dont really care because the look on my daughters face was priceless .
neutral	after a very tough year and alot of deaths in the family i knew_exactly_what would lift her spirits unfortunately the concert was sold out months earlier then fortunately ( i hope ) i found ones available on this website ................ i got printed out e tickets delivered to me very promptly .
neutral	im just getting a little_worried after_reading reviews that maybe we might travel the whole way to belfast ( i have a hotel booked and all ) and not get in and most of all my daughter would be devastated im feelin anxious :-(
neutral	on 00 / 0 / 00 i ordered some dog_food and chews for my dog .
neutral	i was contacted the next_day with many apologies that they were out of stock of the chews .
neutral	this was fine , and i was told that once they had received a delivery they would be sent .
neutral	however , i then had to contact them about the dog_food that was in stock , and asked if it was being delivered , as i had not realised they were holding it to despatch both items together , & the food was needed .
neutral	this was complied with , and the food was delivered a few_days_later .
neutral	however , it is now the 00 / 00 / 00 and i have still not heard_anything about or received my chews .
neutral	& so i am not very pleased with the service
neutral	i recently brought a pair of bryan adams tickets ( 0000000 ) for the concert on monday for my partners_birthday .
neutral	after_reading bad_reviews i am sceptical i will ever get them .
neutral	what ' s worst is i have tried to change my address so it can be delivered to my work place and it says can not be done .
neutral	i have emailed regarding this and had no reply .
neutral	lets_hope i ' m wrong
neutral	good service , good price , fast delivery , great website but i ordered my glasses with a tint and they sent me ones with clear lenses so i am not happy at all , now i have to go to the trouble of sending them back
neutral	booked a room through olotels for a stay in london ( reservation number 0000000 ).
neutral	the booking was non_refundable .
neutral	at the time of travel , i feel ill . understanding the hotel was non_refundable - i contacted the hotel directly to ask if they would be willing to allow the agency ( olotels ) to move the reservation without penalty .
neutral	the hotel were fair , and agreed they would allow olotels to move the reservation to a future date free of charge .
neutral	i was delighted .
neutral	i sent olotels an_email on 00th_november , immediately after_speaking with the hotel , to advise .
neutral	the hotel wanted olotels to formally request the change in an_email , and they would agree to it .
neutral	i sent 0 emails chasing this up , each time i got an_email_saying ' we will update you shortly '.
neutral	one time i even called and the agent said she would call back in 00_minutes - and didnt !
neutral	finally , 00 days_later , olotels send me an_email_saying ' i checked into the hotel , and as a result , i will be charged in full '.
neutral	what a fiasco !
neutral	when will it end ?
neutral	i done all the hard work , the hotel were happy to move the booking no problem .
neutral	now olotels have left it 00 days when this could have been sorted in 0 phone call .
neutral	so angry .
neutral	i would avoid them .
neutral	**** update 00th_december_0000 ****
neutral	the supplier offered a 0 night refund which was ok .
neutral	if they acted upon what the hotel offered ( to move the full reservation ) i would not have lost out on one night .
neutral	i feel olotels were too slow to act and this is why i lost out .
neutral	i feel as though the frontline customer care let olotels down .
neutral	shame you have to shout about your bad_experience on here before they take things seriously .
neutral	ana from the customer_satisfaction team was very helpful .
neutral	i hate hidden_costs , like credit_card commisions .
neutral	other than this , it ' s ok
neutral	the windows are excellent , however , the whole_process was arduous and frustrating .
neutral	on arrival of the installation engineer it became_clear that most of what we had asked for over the phone 0 months previously had not been updated on the records so we had a desperate morning liasing between the engineer and their customer_service to make_sure everything was as we wanted .
neutral	this also included unexpected extra costs as we had received new invoices but they were so unclear that we weren ' t able to follow the changes in the charges .
neutral	we ' re happy with the windows but when we replace the future ones i ' m not sure we will use ventrolla as the experience was not a pleasant one .
neutral	a website messed me around with my order so i looked them up on google which lead me to here .
neutral	i ' ve been shopping online alot recently and the reviews here have helped_me alot with deciding who to buy goods from and who to steer_clear of .
neutral	( however with people posting so many reviews with pretty_much the same spammy reviews i don ' t know how much i can trust the reviews on here , scrapping the whole ' our friends ranking ' section would probably lead to more honest reviews and not people seeking ' fame ' or maybe make people elaborate more on their experiences ).
neutral	got the wrong pair of sunglasses .
neutral	it world have veen appropriate with a small compensation for all the bother returning the glasses , and for the delay .
neutral	orherwise the service has bern quick and efficiant .
neutral	i tried ordering cravats for my wedding .
neutral	skc failed to let me know that they didnt have the stock / the line was discontinued ( i got several different stories ) after waiting nearly four weeks for the delivery .
neutral	they promised the items would delivered the following week , and they weren ' t .
neutral	they made no attempt to make up for the fact that they had left me with little time before my wedding to get things sorted ( and colour matched ).
neutral	i asked for a refund , got no reply , and then two days_later ( today ) i got an_email_saying my order had been dispatched , which i explicitly told them i did not want as i have decided to get cravats from elsewhere as i do not trust the reliability or credibility of their business .
neutral	i have updated my review to 0_stars rather_than 0 , as requested by the company and because in light of this review i have had some positive response and effort to sort this ( including the below response ).
neutral	i do hope that the company means what it says when it will review its customer_service , and this is not just for show .
neutral	i ordered a couple of containers and a trackable window cling ( and a few other things ) one of the pots was badly cracked due to it being poorly packaged and the window cling tracking_number did not match the copy tag so i now have a useless trackable in my car .
neutral	i did open a call with geotees and they have said it will be rectified in a few_days so hopefully not all bad :)
neutral	the other products i got were very good quality , the order process was easy and the delivery was quick .
neutral	nothing special and then found thing i brought was cheaper when we arrived !
neutral	the whole tean was helpful and gave a good support
neutral	i have used cash genie twice and they are very quick and professional .
neutral	i would definatley recommend them .
neutral	very slow when processing orders , i know you are a big company but make it faster so i can be a happier customers !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	cheap get aways ... thanks
neutral	köpte en soffa portugal för en tid sedan .
neutral	soffan kom snabbt dock tappar den formen och så fattades det skruvar .
neutral	men jag antar att man får vad man betalar för :-_d
neutral	its service is not really bad .. but some times it delays the delivery too much .
neutral	but in the end my product reaches safe to me ..
neutral	this is an average site .
neutral	there is not much latest material .
neutral	the privacy settings are really awkward now as its harder not to share everything with everyone ... i dont want my feeds to be public , so take that little globe icon away , mark zuckerberg !
neutral	just cos you like to share everything doesnt mean that we do .
neutral	facebook should be for sharing with who you want .
neutral	the fact that usernames cant be changed more_than once means that people can look me up by my username if they cant find me in public searches !
neutral	p . a . n . t . s
neutral	item slipped through quality check was offered discount for faulty item but not a great discount
neutral	ordered a guitar case in summer last_year , which arrived on the day it was estimated and all was well .
neutral	however , i ordered a new amp on thursday and paid extra for it to be delivered on saturday , and i have not even received an_email_confirming it ' s dispatch , which means that more likely than not that it has not been dispatched , despite me paying extra and selecting the saturday for delivery .
neutral	attempted to contact them to find them to be shut from 0 on a saturday , and so now i have to wait_until monday before i can talk to anyone .
neutral	not happy at all - if the amp does not arrive before 0pm tonight i will be requesting a refund for the extra money paid for saturday delivery .
neutral	items collected 00srt september order number 0000000 , still says processing ?
neutral	this service is not quick as stated on the ad , it ' s a very lengthy process !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i got an autogenerated email regarding my order - it had been put on hold .
neutral	i then contacted their help_desk , they replied promptly , and i then stated the correct info they were lacking .
neutral	however , they never confirmed my update nor my order status , so i have no_idea if my order went through or not .
neutral	inconvenient for me as i need my order asap .
neutral	tesco is crap !
neutral	i ordered my item , paid for it and then 0 days_later i received an_email explaining that this item wasn ' t in stock and wouldn ' t be for the next 0 - 0 weeks .
neutral	i emailed back asking to cancel my order and they did so immediately and a refund was issued .
neutral	i waiting feed_back ...
neutral	overall good but wasn ' t very happy about the part getting phone there by a certain time as it may reduce the amount .
neutral	but part from that it been a ok experience
neutral	main thing i love about cams is the chat_hosts an the friends i have met on there
neutral	bought a laptop off them .
neutral	£ 0000 .... money most definately not well spent .
neutral	prices are significant savings compared to other_websites , but delivery is very slow .
neutral	i would expect much faster delivery for ordering online .
neutral	i ordered some stuff a while ago it took nearly 00 days to arrive and needed the stuff for a gig so put me in a compromising position !
neutral	i would use again if delivery times improved
neutral	i was impressed with the speed of delivery .
neutral	i ordered shoes on saturday and they were delivered on monday_afternoon .
neutral	i could track the order online although the stated time_slot for delivery was very wide ( 00 : 00 gmt - 00 : 00 ).
neutral	what did surprise was that the shoes , worth £_000 , were left on the front doorstep following a knock on the door .
neutral	i happened to be in and heard the knock but had i not been the shoes would have remained there in full view ; it is a terraced house with the front_door close the pavement .
neutral	the driver did not wait to see if the door was answered , leave with a neighbour or hide it behind an available large rose tub .
neutral	there was no requirement to sign .
neutral	most goods are good quality and reasonably_priced .
neutral	have noticed that veg are expensive compared to local green grocers
neutral	i have very mixed feelings regarding this company .
neutral	on the one hand ; the food was generally good , although the sausages were very bland .
neutral	on the other ; their customer_service was the worst i have experienced in a long time .
neutral	when i placed the order , it was meant to come with a free ' naked rub ', but this did not arrive .
neutral	no problem , i thought , mistakes_happen .
neutral	so i called to let them know and request a replacement .
neutral	i was told that they could not send a replacement , as they only had large packing boxes , and was offered a refund of 00p as this was the price of the product .
neutral	however , the rub was advertised as costing 0 . 00 !
neutral	after a number of emails , in which i was condescended to quite badly , it turned_out that i had been lied to in the first instance .
neutral	they eventually refunded 00p , as this was the price of the rub minus 00_%_off , and refused to acknowledge my complaints about their cs .
neutral	i know it seems silly to be bothered by such a small item and at first i thought the same , but by the time i had suffered through their customer_services , i was quite irate !
neutral	they were , however , very quick to refund for the low quality sausages , so i am grateful for that , and the rest of the food was very nice .
neutral	i placed an order on dec . 00 hoping it will arrive until christmas ... it ' s jan . 0rd and i still didn ' t receive it .
neutral	i can ' t understand_why they would scam people this way saying it ' s going to arrive in 0 - 0 working_days for my country .
neutral	i wish i read the reviews sooner .
neutral	anyway , if someone from eastern europe , especially romania , did receive their order ( even after 00 working_days ), please leave a comment here because i would really like to know if i should contact them for a refund or maybe wait a little more , because i really do want the products i ordered and i can ' t find them in my country .
neutral	update_: i did receive my order today .
neutral	i guess all this happened because of the busy holiday season .
neutral	i received the products i ordered , all in one piece , in a secure package ( there were no leaks or stuff like that ).
positive	please get unlock my idevice
positive	i ' ve used gmg for a good while now , got around 00 games or more from them as they do amongst the best offers available for them .

positive	they have a nice laid_out website which is easy to navigate and has good ways of contacting customer support if need be .

positive	we recommend it to everyone , fast delivery , work well

positive	when game console repair_centre quoted me just £_00 . 00 for a next - day service and 0 month warranty , i must_admit i thought it was too good to be true .

positive	good customer_service - i had to communicate with the company by email and they answered very quickly .
positive	the only thing is that the next_day delivery is is fact not the next but the second day from the day the item is despatched .
positive	however in my case it was not a significant delay , and may be it was more due to post delays rather_than highlandtitles fault ....

positive	thanks a lot andy !
positive	i was directed to hostelbookers via a comparison site .
positive	hostelbookers had great information on the hotel , as well as photos and reviews .
positive	my favourite things about hb though , was that in my confirmation_email they provided information on the best way to get to / from the airport to / from the hostel - which is second to none , we otherwise would have ended_up forking_out for a taxi and paying way over the odds !
positive	will_definitely be using again !
positive	i ' ve used this site to look for hostels in the us , all over europe , and asia .

positive	i found it to be cheaper per_night to book and also to be cheaper because they don ' t charge the extra $ 0 that greedy hostelworld does .
positive	i ' ve looked online for ages now and wasn ' t until recently i took a risk and purchased some keys online .
positive	so far all the support from cdkeys has been awesome !
positive	quick to respond to any_issues , and keys are valid , active and legit !
positive	i ' ve saved muchos $$$ thanks to cdkeys , so much that i ' ve bought extra games and still have money to spare !
positive	swift delivery , faultless product and 00 month warranty to go with it .
positive	e_- careers are fantastic , both in material content and in value for money .
positive	i was particularly impressed by their technical_support and how quickly any_issues were dealt_with .
positive	i will certainly look at e_- careers when considering another finance course to enhance my career prospects .

positive	i was lucky_enough to find precious_little one online when searching for baby items .
positive	lower_than_expected prices , and good communication .
positive	my order was placed in the evening thursday_night , and shipped friday_morning .
positive	a great sight , and i will_definitely use this one again .
positive	very good customer_service :)

positive	defiantly be using this company again .
positive	thanks
positive	had my pre_- order for far_cry 0 insane edition [ pc ] cancelled by another site , 0 days before_release .
positive	was sold out everywhere [ still is to this day ], however ,
positive	coolshop . co . uk was the only place to get more stock in .
positive	while people were cashing in by selling them on ebay , coolshop sold it for a very reasonable_price .
positive	was dispatched on the 0th_dec and delivered on the 0th_dec .
positive	can ' t say better_than that .
positive	will_definitely use them again .
positive	* only minor problem was the outer cardboard cover of the game was slightly_damaged in transit , but this is only a minor grumble .
positive	despite me waiting in all day , my collection did not take place on the date arranged which was disappointing , but the reason i am still scoring 0 is because of the great service i received when i brought this to p0g ' s attention - within minutes , my agent richard_mileham had rebooked my pick_up for the same day that i contacted them ( using a more_expensive service ) - richard was very polite and helpful , so all in all , i am very happy .
positive	just a side note , i have used p0g many_times before now , and up until this occasion , there has never been a problem , so can only assume that this mishap has been a one - off .
positive	the price_match is phenomenal and the free and discounted products with your purchases make it so there is no doubt in my mind that i ' m getting the best deal when i am cashing out my supplements .
positive	everything always arrives faster_than estimated and the order is always spot on .
positive	i would defo_recommend using seranata flowers to send someone flowers !
positive	really quick & reasonably_priced !
positive	well , what can i say ?
positive	this boy is amazing !
positive	i now have an up and running site that looks awesome and i barely lifted a finger .
positive	he made it so easy for me as he quickly discovered that i have the capability of a cat when it comes to technology .
positive	i literally couldn ' t have done it without him .... lloyd you are my angel !!!
positive	!
positive	big hugs ,
positive	sheryl .
positive	fantastic prices and they have absolutely everything .
positive	customer_service is also money , they have fixed every issue i ' ve had and always respond within hours of my emails .
positive	oh and you gotta_love getting free t -_shirts and shaker_bottles !
positive	easy and simple to navigate through the web_site and easy to purchase with a speedy_delivery , would definitely_recommend
positive	i ' ve been making purchases from green man gaming ( gmg ) for a few_years now , pc games / dlc .
positive	sure you can buy most of the titles they sell elsewhere ( steam / origin / uplay etc ), but they sometimes have good deals on that aren ' t running on the other_sites , they ' ve nearly always got discount vouchers , and you can even trade some of your games back in ( i think any that use gmg ' s " capsule " thingy )!
positive	brilliant .
positive	i ' ve been shopping at aria . co . uk for about 0 or 0 years now , buying various parts for my computers , and those of my family and friends .
positive	there is a number of reasons i always go back to them : fantastic prices , speedy_delivery , very helpful staff .
positive	the community on the forums is ( for the most part ) also a very friendly / helpful one .
positive	twice i ' ve had to return items , and both_times the staff have resolved my problem very quickly ( same day ).
positive	00th of january i ordered myself a new cpu_cooler , the corsair h000i .
positive	i ordered at around 00am , and it was in my hands by noon the next_day ( free delivery too )!
positive	can ' t say_fairer than that .
positive	keep up the good work guys !
positive	i like this web_site , because it can offer very good rooms for optimal price .
positive	descriptions of hostels and casas are very informative and full .
positive	photoes are useful too .
positive	the price_match plus 0 % markdown option is what sold me .
positive	if i found a better price elsewhere , they would beat the price by 0 %.
positive	the free / closeout portion is great for anyone who may want to sample some supplements before buying .
positive	a +++

positive	been using them for a while now and find them a really good service

positive	i highly_recommend supplement_warehouse to all my friends !
positive	fantastic friendly helpful service , not to mention the ' ahead of trend ' range of sunnies !

positive	so happy i found this site ...
positive	i ' m buying from it a few_times a month now ... never had any_problems with products or service ... love it so much that i ' m getting all my mates hooked on it too ...
positive	supplement_warehouse provides the best selection of nutrition supplements you can find .
positive	the free extras are a super bonus , but i love that they will not only match , but beat a competitor ' s price .
positive	my only complaint would be the added cost to shipping when you select free items , but really it is a small price to pay .
positive	the turn_around time is amazing so i never miss a beat .
positive	thank_you !
positive	had a few things go missing and was resent without any_problems .
positive	really great customer_service

positive	a really top_class digital agency that helped push our website right to the top of google for several important and competitive search terms .
positive	i would highly_recommend these_guys .
positive	i found taxday . co . uk on google and through a very simple and helpful process , they helped_me claim £ 0000 back .
positive	i have now booked myself a little trip away for me and the missus and will enjoy that money .
positive	ordered some 0xu gear from this site .
positive	good range to choose from and delivered as requested .
positive	i ordered 0 taps from tap centre , one bathroom and one kitchen tap on 0 - 0 day delivery .
positive	they both came after 0 days .
positive	i will_definitely use again and recommend to all .
positive	despite being in ni , the delivery to england was very quick which i wasn ' t expecting .
positive	the product was well_packaged and works_perfectly .
positive	really easy , sent my ipad on thursday had the money in my bank wednesday_morning , seems much_quicker_than alternative companies and a much_better price , deffinetly recommend .
positive	they have everything i am looking for .
positive	the prices are awesome .
positive	the free_stuff is awesome .
positive	i love this site .
positive	this website has an amazing selection of the top supplements , or if you just need a multivitamin .
positive	it is extremely easy to use , and the best part about this website is that they will match the price of any other website with an additional 0 %_off the competitors price .
positive	it is the very first website i check to look up a supplement i want to purchase .
positive	and it will always be the main website i use for all my supplement purchasing .
positive	ordered a pair of rayban rare prints wayfarer and has the title_says received the next_day !
positive	will recommend to all my friends :)
positive	i booked yodel through p0g - they are useless and didn ' t turn_up .
positive	i personally think p0g should not use them as a supplier .
positive	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
positive	she change our courier to a ups drop_off service .
positive	i will_definitely be using p0g again because of samantha ' s help and just pay for a better 0rd_party supplier !
positive	it would be useful if p0g had a number you could call - the live_chat was brilliant when i eventually found it though !
positive	!
positive	orders are easy and straightforward , loved being_able to get the bits and bobs i go through and the e_- liquid for a really good price and lightening speed .
positive	no more shifty envelopes from china coming through the door .
positive	my only issue is having to be around to sign for the package , but otherwise i can find no fault , will be using again , very soon .
positive	really cant_complain with the service that we received from chillisauce .
positive	the booking process was really simple and allowed individuals to make installments if they wished .
positive	the trip to riga was really well_organised we had bobsleigh and shooting range activities both were great and again well_organised .
positive	the whole_thing is geared for stag groups and caused no_problems at all .
positive	the accommodation was actually quite good , much_better_than i expected .
positive	we couldn ' t complain with any of the staff and we had great customer_service throughout .
positive	in short great customer_service , made everything smooth and easy and good value for money .
positive	no_complaints .
positive	.... oh and plenty of booze which every stag_do should have !
positive	lots of choice , lovely products and excellent delivery service !
positive	perfect all_round !
positive	will_definitely be using temptation_gifts again .
positive	i sent off my old_nokia to mazuma with some reservations as there are some negative_reviews out there .
positive	however i can not praise the speed and ease of service .
positive	i sent my phone to them last monday and by wednesday the sale was complete with the funds in my account .
positive	brilliant service highly_recommended
positive	i was expecting to pay a couple hundred_pounds minimum for a 00 might stay , but thanks to hostelbookers , i am spending less_than 0 hundred total , and still staying in a hostel with reviews over 00 %.
positive	reading the reviews themselves is very helpful , because they give different ratings based on what you care about and why they ' re traveling - so if you ' re crashing for the night , access to a lot of showers might not be priority , but a higher safety rating might be .
positive	a 00 percent rating on safety is fine if you ' re a 0 ' 0 muscular man , but 00 is perfect when you ' re 0 ' 0 can ' t do a push up without hurting my wrist me .
positive	there ' s no booking_fee , so you see what you ' re paying upfront , and the deposit is only 00 percent , so if you have to cancel , it ' s not a major loss .
positive	( a night ' s reservation deposit is never more_than 0 pounds for me .)
positive	i ' m over the moon with the results , i haven ' t been able to see at this level for 00 years .
positive	i had a strong prescription of - 0 . 00 in each eye .
positive	after the surgery i see better_than previously with glasses .
positive	i had the surgery at finchley road clinic in london , professional service , very supportive stuff and excellent surgeon !
positive	i have my 00 / 00 vision back .
positive	thank_you optimax for new life !
positive	i cannot_believe the speed and efficiency in which my order was processesd .
positive	it only took a few_days from me sending the fone in to getting my payment .
positive	the service is excellent and i will_definately use again .
positive	this is the 0rd time i have used mazuma .
positive	the 0st time i received my cheque by return post .
positive	on the other occasions , i have had the money transfered and it was in my account by 0000 on the day they received the phones .
positive	you could not wish for a smoother transaction .
positive	mazuma is a company i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend to my friends and family - 0st_class !!
positive	!
positive	excellent service , giving you the option to track the progress of the unlock .
positive	i certainly didnt just want to put my personal details onto any old website so it took me a while to do , but after seeing 00k facebook likes and plenty of good feed_back i decided to go for it .
positive	very happy i had been quoted around 00 / 00 pounds to unlock my phone in the local town so was very happy to see just 00pound on iphoneunlock !
positive	took 0 . 0 days to unlock and was worth the wait , i thought it would of tool longer !
positive	thank_you !
positive	thank_you so much helped a lot
positive	for a while i have been looking for a website like this , great webste , great giveaways , all_round a great website which i recommend to anyone :)
positive	i was recommended by a family_member to use parcel 0 go .
positive	i had two packages to send to two different locations and it couldn ' t have been easier .
positive	you select the service , weight , dimensions , if you would like to insure for an extra_cost ( i did , as i had expensive goods but you don ' t have to ), and finally the details of the receivers .
positive	once this has been completed , you are provided with the labels and simply print off .
positive	because the website explained that their collections are anywhere between_0am - 0pm , i expected them to be collected at the later time but , to my surprise , they turned_up at 0am the next_day !
positive	also , i received positive_feedback from my customers ( the receivers ) as they were updated via_email , from parcel 0 go , of when to expect their delivery .
positive	really pleased and would definitely_recommend !
positive	company does everything which it says - great price and product :)
positive	good pricing , great product !
positive	thanks !
positive	an easy website to use and always quick .
positive	great to compare different hotels , hostels and etc .
positive	also to compare the locations and prices .
positive	its says how many places are left so you know how long you can wait or think about it .
positive	brill !
positive	will see you again in 00 months !
positive	!
positive	the whole purchasing and delivery process is very good .
positive	you even get a confirmation_email once the package has been delivered to the destination .
positive	i have shopped at number six since it opened in 0000 .
positive	the web store is user_friendly and just a breeze .
positive	i have also visited the number six store in east london and it is beautiful .
positive	i had a query about a measurement and they replied to me within 0 minutes .
positive	the staff are very friendly and very helpful .
positive	i would recommend this store to everyone !
positive	bought a snugpak sleeping bag , as the title describes !
positive	sent out the envelope very quickly , received my phone and notified me even quicker and paid the money into my account the same day - excellent .
positive	very organised site ,
positive	every product is very well displayed and categorised professional_manner ,
positive	really helpful .
positive	these things are not available on different online stores .
positive	rates are normal .
positive	delivery time is good or ok .
positive	but how they deliver is perfect .
positive	but i spent more_than 000_pounds , they didn ' t offer any discount or gift , :(
positive	order process was easy - peasy .
positive	delivered swiftly .
positive	great price .
positive	very happy .
positive	0 . 00 pm : dog attacks vacuum_cleaner , biting straight through the hose , making the whole_thing unusable .
positive	in a panic , i google spare_parts and find the buyspares website .
positive	0 . 00pm : i find the part i need , at a reasonable_price and order , choosing next_day delivery .
positive	00 . 00am the following_morning , part is delivered .
positive	very easy website to use .
positive	simple to locate part with idiot_proof order process .
positive	good communication confirming order & delivery .
positive	rapid despatch of item .
positive	result ?
positive	one vacuum_cleaner now back in working order & one extremely happy customer .
positive	would definitely use again .
positive	thank_you very much indeed buyspares !
positive	good quality and arrived within a few_days accurate sizes to
positive	my outfit came within a matter if days and is of a really good quality
positive	will_defo use this site again
positive	the item arrived within a couple of days and was of a very good quality .
positive	i was also kept up to date as to when my item was dispatched and when it would arrive .
positive	i also found the prices to be excellent .
positive	i ' d made a mistake in the shipping address through paypal so i had to cancel the order and re - order which was quick and painless .
positive	when i ' d re - ordered , the order was shipped within an_hour , couldn ' t really complain at that .
positive	low_prices and top customer_service ( special mention to rich who sorted the cancellation out for me ).
positive	one of my items was out of stock and they let me know the morning i placed the order .
positive	i contacted them to ask for a different item and instead of letting me place the order for the more_expensive item they asked for my system spec and actually recommended a cheaper item ( one that i later discovered was of better build_quality than the one i ordered ) for much less money than i ' d been willing to spend .
positive	i already expected good things from scan but this was ridiculous .
positive	what they lost in extra income that day will be more_than repaid in continued custom and the recommendations i will make to friends .
positive	special mention to the customer_services agent adam b who had fantastic technical product knowledge and great customer_service skills .
positive	i wrote an earlier , rather negative_review based entirely on the fact that i hadn ' t received my order after 0 weeks .
positive	however , this was down to the post_office either not delivering it or delivering the card to the wrong_address .
positive	when i contacted peak_nutrition , they were quick to respond , polite and extremely_helpful .
positive	despite the fact that it wasn ' t their fault that i hadn ' t received the order , they were happy to send out a repeat order without any fuss and were extremely_helpful .
positive	i have now received my supplements which were perfectly packaged and all as they should be .
positive	i would definitely order from peak_nutrition again as i would be confident that they would help sort out any_problems if there were any .
positive	i would also advise that you ask for recorded_delivery as the post_office can be terribly unreliable !
positive	thanks , i am very satisfied for your services .
positive	quality products and fast delivery .
positive	recommand to all this site .
positive	best regards
positive	lilian
positive	i first liked hostelbookers . com because of their blog and regularly updated twitter account but using them to book my stay for a busy_period ( rio de janeiro carnival ) proved - with a lot of price comparing - that they have the cheapest rates and really are the only site without booking_fees .
positive	i was very impressed and would definitely use them again .
positive	fast , great service and the best prices !.
positive	i reccomend to everybody ..
positive	so i was a little_nervous_about recycling my ipad 0 with ipad_recycle but after_reading the reviews and doing some research i decided to give it a go !
positive	i posted my ipad monday_afternoon special delivery and i received a conformation email from euan saying that they got my package tuesday_morning and they will transfer my money later that day .
positive	you cant ask for better service and i am very pleased that i chose ipad_recycle .
positive	i will totally be recommending this company to my friends and family .
positive	thanks again :)
positive	first time i ' d used blackcircles .
positive	have been going to the same tyre place for 00 years - was checking typical prices online and decided i ' d give blackcircles a try .
positive	had the same tyre cheaper_than my normal place ; the centre i chose for the fitting was great - no waiting , courteous staff , job well_done .
positive	nothing but a good experience - will_definitely be using blackcircles again .
positive	i ordered a shower tray and a new sink from wd and it was a bit of a disaster as , even_though it had loads of packaging the courier managed to break the tray .
positive	i rang them and got straight through to a lovely geordie chap , who sent me out a new tray next - day .
positive	mistakes_happen but it ' s how a company deals with them that is a mark of the company .
positive	good stuff wd !
positive	!
positive	i ordered a kit for christmas prezzie and it came within a few_days .
positive	it was the best price i found online and the products were great .
positive	can ' t wait to get my girlfriend sushi making !
positive	i lived in miwaukee wi for many years .
positive	i always used the local supplement_warehouse store to physically purchace my products .
positive	the staff were always knowledgable on products and helpfull in finding the right products for me .
positive	you cant_beat the prices .
positive	i now live in arizona .
positive	supplement companys out here are way over priced and not knowledgable in their products .
positive	i will_continue to use supplement_warehouse as my supplement company .
positive	i also just recently found them on facebook .
positive	they seem to answer peoples questions on there and have a great customer support .
positive	i dont think anybody does it better_than supplement_warehouse
positive	brilliant , it has got to be the fastest delivery i have ever received online ( and i have order a lot !)
positive	and great prices too !
positive	of all the places i ' ve searched for good quality furniture at a reasonable_price , pine_solutions is the best , after my brother and sister recommended the site to me i am now on to my third purchase .
positive	enough said !
positive	great .
positive	experience , i use them always
positive	fast dispatch , good communication in different formats plus great variety of products
positive	got the phone on the day they said i would , whenever i had a conversation with them over the phone they were very professional and courteous .
positive	offered very good deal and would definitely deal with them again .
positive	straight_forward and easy ordering_process ... easy to order and rapid delivery ( ha )....
positive	really easy website to use , great prices , great options .
positive	would definitely use again !
positive	filled the online form , received the freepost_bag the next_day .
positive	and received the money in my bank_account 00_hrs later after sending the phone .
positive	very fast and reliable service .
positive	best price i could find for my item and delivery so quick it showed up the day before_release !
positive	which in a winner in my book !
positive	high_quality supplements with really quick delivery , would order again when required .
positive	this shop is excellent .
positive	prices are fairer than fair , and most_importantly , the staff are honest and know what they are talking_about ... meaning you don ' t get fobbed_off with some piece of crap instrument that ' s clogging up warehouse space .
positive	without a doubt my go - to music shop .
positive	i love muubaa , not that i can shop there regularly !
positive	but the two times i have they have been perfect .
positive	it ' s a big deal to buy luxury leather jackets online when you can ' t try them on .
positive	but muubaa understand this and make the process so easy and pleasant if you need to swap a size or return etc .
positive	but most of all , the jackets are the softest leather i have ever felt ... and so comfortable and stylish .
positive	worth ever penny .
positive	my family and i have used buy wise for many things , from washing machines to mattresses , and have been more_than happy every time .
positive	will carry on going back for much more in the future .
positive	thank_you !
positive	bought fifa_00 for next to half price had it downloading within 0 minutes .
positive	decent service will use again !
positive	cheers !
positive	after upgrading with phones0u , the sales_person advised a recycling comparison site for old_phones .
positive	the result to give most money for my galaxy sii was money0yourphone . com and after some research online , i opted for them .
positive	checkout was extremely easy and in 0 minutes the order was complete .
positive	i had ordered a bag to send the phone in but it took 0 or 0 days to arrive , before which i ' d requested another ( which also turned_up in about the same amount of time ).
positive	whether this is down to m0yp or the royal_mail , i don ' t know .
positive	be sure to send your phone as special delivery as this covers you up to £_000 .
positive	signed for mail i believe is only £_00 .
positive	emails for when my phone arrived with them and was tested are good , meaning you are kept in the loop .
positive	payment does admittedly take a number of days after this ( i had the money in my account in full , 0 days before the date they stated however ) so if you ' re in a rush for the money , you may have to look_elsewhere .
positive	given the amount they gave for my phone , and ignoring the envelope and delayed payment issues , i would definitely_recommend these_guys .
positive	they paid the most for my phone by a good 00 or 00_% i ' d say .
positive	very happy .
positive	a friend_recommended a deal on game collection for a 000 wireless headset and they were by_far the cheapest .
positive	i got the headset in the post 0 days_later .
positive	many bigger retail sites can take a lot longer_than that .
positive	i would highly_recommend game collection and will check them for any future_purchases .
positive	an awesome site with heaps of cheap listings
positive	i ' ve been buying from aria as an individual for several years now and i have never had a problem , either with aria or their couriers ( citylink ).
positive	the company i work for also has a trade account with aria and our account_manager is always friendly and helpful , even_though he supports liverpool fc and not everton fc lol .
positive	i ' m a member of the aria forums and they have many incentives for members i . e .
positive	competitions , free deliveries ( certain_amount of posts ), help and advice from the staff via the forums .
positive	i would and do recommend aria all of the time !
positive	gadget_panda were communicative , efficient and did exactly_what they said they would .
positive	i chose to get payment by bank_transfer and it showed up two days after they received my phone .
positive	all in all , i would definitely use them again and highly_recommend them !
positive	i love hostelbookers , i ' ve used it every time i ' ve been travelling .
positive	it ' s really easy to find exactly the hostel or hotel you ' re looking for , whether you ' re looking for the cheapest , or the one with the best reviews , or one in a specific part of a city .
positive	there ' s no booking_fee and i ' ve never turned_up at a hostel to find they ' re not expecting me !
positive	if your paitent and have your ticket ready to scan your fine !
positive	thankyou guys :)
positive	excelelnt service and loyalty_scheme
positive	my order was despatched promptly , arrived the next_day and was well_packaged .
positive	very good value for money .
positive	this course was so easy to access and complete , everything is given to you and you don ' t need to search for materials .
positive	there are videos as well as written units so if you learn best through either option , they are both presented to you and easy to use !
positive	the course is set at your own_pace so you can fit it around family , friends , work and even university !
positive	i did not know i could learn so much in such a short time_frame , and i thought i might struggle with the technology but it was all set out and explained in a way that i could easily complete all of the tasks !
positive	i recommend you try this company if this a course you are interested in studying !
positive	i was very pleased with the efficient service received from personal_injury assist .
positive	they took care of all the necessary documents and made the process seem so easy .
positive	i would and have already_recommended this company to family , friends and colleagues .
positive	there is always someone to help you online " instant chat " even during out of office hours .....
positive	items arrived when expected .
positive	fast and efficient .
positive	good quality products and was as expected . c recommended
positive	i never_heard of xskins before but seeing the design i was after on their website i thought i would take the risk and order .
positive	really glad that i did service was quick and perfect , no issues with product upon delivery and it turned_out being exactly how i hoped .
positive	would definately order from here again !
positive	being somewhat of a penny pincher i always check multiple websites for the best rates and hostelbookers . com has never let me down !
positive	the website has a beautiful layout that is extremely simple to use but jam packed with excellent search features .
positive	booking the hostel was extremely fast and painless and literally took less_than a minute .
positive	i ' ll be going to hostelbooker . com to book the rest of my hostels for my backpacking_trip through europe , thank_you !
positive	couldn ' t find anywhere doing a sony_xperia sp for cheap but found mobile phone checker and it compared the prices of the contract i wanted .
positive	really happy with the phone , arrived the next_day , contract all setup and cheap as chips .
positive	been a while since i bought from myprotein with getting_married , baby being born and running my business , but got back exercising and got some banana cream spectrum00 as i always struggled with recovery .
positive	it ' s awesome , i feel stronger ( creatine probably ), recover faster and although my sweat smells a little weird ( banana cream and sweat ...) i ' m totally sold on the product .
positive	last_year i used to take a different product but this recovery one feels_like it does what it ' s meant to .
positive	gains in deadlift and squats are much_quicker_than i thought it would be compared to the first few weeks of no supplement with training .
positive	it was a pleasant buy .
positive	great communication , process time .
positive	0 star !
positive	!
positive	i will_definitely be using double0 again !
positive	kept up to date right throughout the process from purchase to delivery and on top of that they gave us an upgrade to our seats for the one direction concert at no extra_cost !
positive	fantastic little surprise when we opened our tickets !
positive	i ' d recommend them to anyone_looking to book !
positive	this company provides the best prices anywhere !
positive	if you know a place that offers a product at a lesser price they automatically adjust and discount their price to beat their competitor .
positive	i always recommend the site to my friends and don ' t buy from anyone_else !
positive	item was dispatched quickly and i received the items far quicker_than the time stated .
positive	very pleased and would order again .
positive	i have used these_guys hundreds of times and only had 0 breakage and 0 lost parcel ... not bad i say !!
positive	!
positive	i purchased a pacman hoodie for my bro at christmas time 0000 & not only was it an exclusive product but at £_00 . 00 inc delivery i nthink it was a good deal too .
positive	ill bear them in mind for the future .
positive	the amazon platform is very easy to use & i like the way the site knows you and has reccomendations .
positive	the mp0 store is also very convenient and quick .
positive	i would like to see them creating jobs for young people - they are a big company and can make a difference to the uks unemployment problem .
positive	i recently_purchased a chauvet gobo 0 . 0 from these_guys and the service and pricing was good .
positive	thanks and keep it up !!
positive	!
positive	very good site and great prices !

positive	der opstod ingen_problemer , mine varer kom i fin stand , og de var hjemme ved mig indenfor 0 - 0 dage .
positive	love fra mig af < 0
positive	you answered questions i had with a professional attitude .
positive	i got my costume in time !
positive	the costume was perfect !
positive	just wanted to say a huge thank_you , finally a company that ' s producing quick ready made dinners .
positive	they don ' t need freezing , just store in the cupboard .
positive	they have really changed my life and they where fun taking them on a camping_trip , just open poor in a pot heat and eat , so quick .
positive	if you haven ' t tried you don ' t know what your missing .
positive	look out for their free_sample , try and you will be hooked .
positive	just waiting for more flavours . i never thought gluten_free dinners where so yummy , wow .
positive	i had no_problems with this company received item quickly and with no hiccups to deal with .
positive	great service
positive	good company and quick nomally free delivery
positive	great website and prices
positive	with no doubts hostelbookers is the best hostel reservation website .
positive	i use to travel a lot and i never had problem with the website .
positive	high_standard
positive	easy to book
positive	no fees
positive	all their hostel i used to visit are great ( good rating standard )
positive	other than the fact that the prices are so low , they beat any competition ' s price by 0 %.
positive	based on that i only paid 00_% of the regular price on an item .
positive	the shipping is fast and fairly_priced for what they offer .
positive	easy to use service and super_fast results .
positive	good value , convenient and prompt delivery .
positive	would shop there again .
positive	not much more to say other than i will buy from them again .
positive	i got my screen within a few_days of ordering and the quality is really good , i am very pleased with the overall product and will order more from ballicom in the future .
positive	it was even better with the extra 00_% so more for your money , and it came within a few_days .
positive	worth it if you either do high intensity sport and are regularly at the gym .
positive	my laptop decided to die on me so i wanted to get something that was better , and something that could also play games at a reasonable graphics level .
positive	i was very happy with the price for what i was getting which is the main_reason i bought it .
positive	it has been running well apart_from a couple of hick - ups but apart_from that it is perfect .
positive	i would recommend buying from here and i ' m sure next time i ' m looking for a computer this will be the first site to visit .
positive	my order went through quickly , and i was contacted by daniel due to an issue with stock that they had .
positive	daniel was open and honest about the mistake and even upgraded my order to special deliver as soon as the watch that i had ordered arrived with them .
positive	will_definitely order from these_guys again .
positive	i ordered some bolle sunglasses via sportpursuit last month .
positive	i got them at a great price and they arrived_promptly .
positive	i couldnt have asked for any more .
positive	am hoping for some good ski kit offers in time for the new season !
positive	so many sites like this look so dodgy and are but this site is the exception .
positive	you pay with paypal so you know your money is safe .
positive	once you have made the payment in the same nano second you receive the cd_key .
positive	its the cheapest way and best way to buy any pc games listed on the site .
positive	i love it i love it i love it !
positive	i think lastminute . com not only have some awesome deals , but they are really helpful on the other end of the phone .

positive	bought a raleigh swift folding bike , halfords have the best bargains for bikes and if there are any_problems you can always take it to the shop for service .
positive	they have several delivery options including saturdays .
positive	the bike folds up so that i can carry it up to my flat on the third floor without any difficulty .
positive	i ' m pleased with the price and benefits of having the bike .
positive	bought an extra hard_disk drive for our main computer at home ( western digital 0tb hard_disk drive ).
positive	it ' s mainly for storing films and music .
positive	the order arrived within four days which is good .
positive	it also installed into the computer ok and was recognized by windows .
positive	all - in - all a hassle - free purchase
positive	i bought a beto mountain bike shock pump gauge & bleed valve mp000 for my husband a week_ago .
positive	it was the best price i could find at £_00 . 00 and arrived in four days .
positive	the recommended retail price is £_00 . 00 so this is very good .
positive	bought a pre_- pay sim from vodafone . co . uk for my daughter .
positive	arrived quickly and was easy to setup and use .
positive	also very good value for money , unlimited calls for less_than $_00 . 00 per_month or just pay as you go .
positive	bought a proline pl000wd which is a standard size larder fridge instead of a wine cooler , the fridge was £_000 . 00 which is more_than half the price of a similar size wine cooler .
positive	this is our second fridge which we will use for beer and wine .
positive	delivery was quick and the website has good size pictures so i new exactly_what i was buying .
positive	the fridge arrived undamaged and works_fine .
positive	well_done comet !
positive	could not be more impressed .
positive	ordered late sunday_evening delivered monday am
positive	i ordered a gates tensioner kit and crank pulley for my mondeo as wanapart were the cheapest supplier by_far .
positive	their staff were most helpful , letting me know exactly when i could expect to receive my purchases .
positive	when the crank pulley turned_out to have been incorrectly manufactured ( not wanapart ' s fault ) they couldn ' t have been more helpful , sourcing a replacement from an_alternative supplier in germany which would have been on my doorstep within 00_hours of my informing them of the issue but for the courier mis_- delivering the item .
positive	when the courier did this wanapart stepped up to the mark and spent quite some time resolving the issue .
positive	whist there were issues they were in no way wanapart ' s fault , in fact they were completely beyond wanapart ' s control , yet they still went to great lengths to resolve them .
positive	faultless and efficient service .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	i would choose talktalkbusiness any day of the week over xln !
positive	kirsty on the livechat was v v helpful with me as was the gentleman on the freephone 0000 number .... the best customer_service : )))
positive	i bought the item from their ebay store .
positive	i live in new_zealand .
positive	item arrived within a week in perfect_condition exactly as_described .
positive	will not hesitate to trade with again .
positive	hadn ' t heard of the company before but received a 00_%_off discount_code from vodafone so decided to give it a go .
positive	fantastic range of products to choose from , extremely reasonable prices , fast and free next_day delivery .
positive	just cannot find anything negative about the service .
positive	would definitely use the company again , as_opposed to the big high_street ones !
positive	i really like this site , and use it for my hotel booking needs .
positive	everything went really smoothly and i ' m going to use it again .
positive	i ' m new to the e_cig world and tried my first try of e liquid from you guys , firstly , express delivery next_day to the isle of wight !
positive	i thought i ' d have a try of the ciggaweed flavour , it tastes extremely sweet and fruity with a nice amount of vapour , love it !
positive	will_continue to order from you always , will be placing more orders for ego and more flavours next week !

positive	emily howell
positive	it was like what it said in the details
positive	this company has blown my mind with its prices .
positive	so affordable for the amount you get .
positive	i wouldn ' t shop with any other company .
positive	since being referred to this company i will never even look at another supplement company .
positive	this company deserves much praise for what it provides !
positive	very nice and easy to use this website . i like it . i recommend to everybody
positive	i have always had a fantastic experience with supplementwarehouse . com .
positive	they have very fast_shipping at an affordable price .
positive	they have a service where they will beat another company ' s price by 0 % which i have personally been able to use .
positive	i also always love the free_samples of products as well as the closeouts and clearance items .
positive	i highly_recommend this company .
positive	i travel a lot and tend to vary my hostel / guest - house booking websites depending_on the places fellow_travellers have recommended to me and whether they are advertised on a particular website .
positive	i have consistently found hostelbookers to be the easiest , cheapest and most informative website to use .
positive	for these reasons it is my preferred choice .
positive	it is easy to navigate each page from the homepage / guest - house pages / map layouts etc etc with clear headers for guidance , in all instances i can remember it was comparatively the cheapest and also not only is the depth of information about each guest - house detailed but also local information is readily_available - and this is almost always reliable as it is not only ratified by yourselves at hostelbookers but by other_travellers who have reviewed , commented and posted about various aspects .
positive	i look_forward to continuing to use the hostelbookers website in the future !
positive	i ordered my new omega_seamaster from iconic_watches in july and simply couldn ' t be_happier with both the service and the quality of the watch .
positive	chris , james and liz kept in constant contact with me during the purchase , and even after being advised that it could take up to 00 days to receive , managed to deliver the watch within a week of me putting my deposit down !
positive	what surprised me the most though was the price of the watch - i seriously doubt anywhere_else in the uk could have beaten them in this area .
positive	since receiving the watch , i have recommended iconic_watches to a number of close friends who are considering purchasing a luxury watch , and i shall continue to do so .
positive	thanks again iconic , you were an_absolute pleasure to deal with and i look_forward to my next purchase with you , when hopefully i can get down to blackburn and visit the shop !
positive	the whole_process was really straightforward .
positive	all they needed was a few bits of info and my phone was unlocked within two days .
positive	very happy !
positive	i wouldn ' t have asked for a sponsorship if i thought they were bad !
positive	strawberry and chocolate are my absolute favourite flavours on the market .
positive	a company based around quality not quantity - seriously competitive_prices and amazing service .
positive	these_guys are gonna be big - watch this space @ rorybrown000
positive	great company , great products , great care , fully recommended .
positive	mazuma are faultless , excellent customer_service team with a quick start to finish service these_guys are always friendly , would highly_recommend - 0 + stars
positive	ordered a set of polo_shirts for our staff and delighted with the finished products .
positive	they came quickly and i would have no reservations_about recommending workwear_express to other_companies .
positive	quidco are friendly and happy to help with any_questions .
positive	the site is great and they put a lot of effort into making it as easy to use and get your cashback as possible .
positive	beauty expert is an amazing online store for make up lovers .
positive	you ' ll find all the great high_quality beauty brands .
positive	i find myself browsing through their range for hours !
positive	my package arrived very quickly in just three days to belgium and service was excellent .
positive	definitely using this site again !
positive	hq_hair is so much more_than just hair products !
positive	they have an amazing range of beauty products as well which is great for a makeup addict like me .
positive	my package arrived really quickly to mainland europe ( belgium ) in just three days .
positive	highly_recommend this site !
positive	i ' m so glad i discovered look fantastic .
positive	their range of products is really great and free international shipping is a huge plus for me .
positive	my package took around 0 working_days to belgium which is amazing .
positive	really pleased with my items and would highly_recommend this site to my family and friends !
positive	ordered a pair of climbing shoes which arrived swiftly after i ordered them , however they did not fit .
positive	i returned them to banana_fingers , but did not receive an_email_confirming that they had received them ( even_though royal_mail tracking indicated that the package had been delivered ).
positive	it turns_out that the postman had left the package in an unusual place , which i found out with an_email that was replied to promptly .
positive	my replacement shoes were then despatched to me the next_day .
positive	overall great service , and i would recommend your company to others without_hesitation .
positive	i wish more companies treated their customers like this !
positive	ordered 0000 microsoft points at 00pm , and the code was in my email inbox by 00 :_00pm - you can ' t ask for more_than that .
positive	also , the price for the points was very competitive , which led me to the site in the first place .
positive	overall , i would unreservedly recommend this company .
positive	i needed to post off a parcel with some speakers which weighed a not - so - small 00kg .
positive	at this weight royal_mail becomes ridiculously_expensive , so i looked to couriers for help .
positive	firstly i went directly to the couriers , which i ( wrongly ) assumed would be the cheapest thing to do , and my favourite courier is ups .
positive	so i logged_onto the ups website and got a quote of £_00 . 00 for them to collect and post my parcel .
positive	this was too much for me to pay , so i researched and found this company , parcel0go .
positive	so i went_ahead and got a quote from them , and gave me a huge list with various couriers and varied speeds that my parcel would be delivered .
positive	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back £_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was £_00 . 00 for me ).
positive	i did initially wonder_how it was so cheap , as it was half the price that ups are offering on their own site !
positive	and i assume that parcel0go takes a share of the price i pay !
positive	well , i should never have doubted anything as the next_day the ups driver came and collected my parcel , and was delivered the day after .
positive	great service !
positive	oh but a word of warning , don ' t use tnt or hermes as they receive a lot of criticism , just pay a couple of quid extra and use dhl or ups !
positive	thanks a lot parcel0go !
positive	i will_definitely be using you again !
positive	like many others , i came into contact with this courier through purchasing off amazon .
positive	i ordered a bulky computer case ( weighing a solid 0kg ) and it was delivered within two days of me purchasing the item , kudos to amazon for the quick dispatch also .
positive	however , this courier showed it ' s quality when i wanted to return an item also bought on amazon , they come to your house and collect it straight from you .
positive	this went_smoothly with the yodel van turning_up on the correct day and the driver being very helpful , telling_me about how long it would take for my package to be returned to amazon .
positive	overall , i couldn ' t ask for more from a courier !
positive	amazon are an indisputably great company , with the right ethos to make it ideal for the customer .
positive	their pricing is always very competitive , to the point where you have to look second_hand to get items cheaper ; they offer a great free ' super_saver ' delivery option on all their products which is as speedy as many other_companies paid - for alternatives .
positive	another area amazon excel at is refunding purchases , they offer a no questions_asked 00 day guarantee on everything they sell , which they actually keep to ( again much_better_than the competition ).
positive	amazon even pay for a courier to collect the item you want to return from your house !
positive	you really can ' t get better_than that .
positive	however , one thing i would urge you to be wary of is unknowingly buying from random companies through the amazon website .
positive	this is very easy to do , with items from amazon themselves looking aesthetically identical to their affiliate counterparts .
positive	the way to check is by checking if the item offers the ' amazon free super_saver delivery ' option .
positive	if it offers this then the sale is fully completed through amazon themselves .
positive	however if you but from a random company , this is like buying the same item off of ebay , albeit a new item off [_external reference_].
positive	give amazon a try , you will soon realise why many people swear by it !
positive	i have to admit , the reason i purchased from this company is that i had money in my paypal account ( from selling on ebay ) and it takes 0 days to transfer money into your bank_account , so i was looking around various speaker sites and found that audiovisual online accepted paypal ( surprisingly the only speaker company i found that does ).
positive	so , i had little choice who to order from , however i am very happy that i stumbled_across this site !
positive	as i mentioned earlier the prices they offer are competitive offering the same price as amazon for the speakers i wanted .
positive	however , having ordered many thing from unknown sites before , i was expecting a large postage cost be be included with my purchase ( in total the speakers weighed 00kg ) but no , the postage was free !
positive	being the skeptical person i am , i was expecting it to be sent by economy post and take a week or more to arrive with me .
positive	however this was anything but the case , for free they used dpd ' s next_day premium service !
positive	this is a great service , with dpd texting me straight_away telling_me the date when my package would arrive .
positive	even better was than on the day of arrival ( i ordered this a 00 at night and it arrived two days_later !)
positive	dpd texted me giving me a 0 hour delivery slot and sure enough the dpd van turned_up slap bang in the middle of the slot !
positive	i couldn ' t believe i got this postage service for free , it must have cost audiovisual good money to use that particular service .
positive	the condition of the item was perfect , with the box in perfect_condition ( just as it should have been ).
positive	i am now enjoying listening to my new speakers !
positive	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use this company again !
positive	they would even be in preference to amazon and such like !
positive	( yes they are that good !)
positive	if only all companies were this good !
positive	i bought a voucher for my web master course from groupon site .
positive	so i redeemed the voucher on e_- careers web_site and this is how my study has begun .
positive	the course is well_structured , it covers not just main topics like html , xml , php , etc_., but contains a lot of material how to manage your online business as well .
positive	in other words it has almost everything that every web master ( not just beginner !)
positive	needs to know .
positive	i would like to say that course really worth it , i have learned a lot new stuff and i really_enjoyed it .
positive	and i would definitely_recommend e_- careers not just for my friends but for anyone who is interested in good quality learning .
positive	oksana karpova
positive	hostelbookers is a really helpful n convenience friend to help travelers in booking accommodation !
positive	it really helps me a lot !
positive	and it ' s easy to search all possible accommodation out !
positive	thanks !
positive	i ordered a t - shirt in the evening , they posted it the next_day , it arrived the day after that .
positive	my t - shirt was a good fit and very funny , the best t - shirt i ' ve ever bought i think .
positive	there is nothing about truffle_shuffle i could complain_about .
positive	also they sent me sweeties in my package .
positive	i sent in my ipad yesterday via special delivery next_day .
positive	i was emailed this morning to say it had been received , then lunch time to say it had been checked , then this afternoon to say they had paid me .
positive	i checked my bank_account and the money is there already .
positive	it literally took 00_hours to send my ipad and get paid for it .
positive	i cannot_fault them , and i will_definitely use them again .
positive	i ' m a little_bit in shock , to be honest .
positive	i didn ' t think you could get service like this .
positive	their new player bonus is genuine .
positive	wow why did i not find this website sooner before i wasted so much money on store bought products ??
positive	im a pregnancy testaholic so these are so beneficial for me .
positive	lets_hope i dont need them all !
positive	!
positive	delivery was really quick too , i would definately use them again and would highly_recommend to people trying to conceive .
positive	fantastic designs , friendly professional staff , and a very clean shop .
positive	overall i would highly_recommend blood sweat & ink tattoos .
positive	ordered my keys yesterday evening and received them this morning , well above my expectations .
positive	the page is really nice , and making reservations is super easy .
positive	no booking_fees , and there ' s always nice hostels and hotels .
positive	would totally book again here !
positive	i will recommend them to my friends and will buy from them again in future if i need anything .
positive	i ' ve heard horror_stories about paypal .
positive	personally , i ' ve never had an issue .
positive	i much prefer using my paypal account to receive small_amounts of money from places such as reward sites where i don ' t want to give out other details .
positive	payments are simple , particularly for ebay ( obviously ).
positive	you can go to local_stores and they just won ' t beat this site .
positive	they match prices and ship super_fast .
positive	they also toss in a lot of freebies , samples , and discounted items with most purchases .
positive	a - 0 place for supplements .
positive	price on website is what you pay , looked at other instant delivery sites mentioning promotions that dont work .
positive	plain simple price advertised is what you pay and instant delivery !
positive	note some website say this but will list weekends orders may take 00_hours to complete , onlycdkeys . com mean instant and 00 / 0
positive	really pleased - from finding the right size , ordering and even fitting was all easy to do / find on the website .
positive	set clear timeframes on when i should received items and stick to it .
positive	says it all in the title !
positive	beware of less well_known recycling firms who offer you more money as they invariably then offer you a lower offer when they receive the phone - no issues like that with muzumba .
positive	i ' m better at consuming reviews than writing reviews , but having found the reviews on trustpilot so positive that i bought an expensive camera from a company in hk , i wanted to backup everyone ' s comments that digitalrev are awesome .
positive	why ?
positive	0 .
positive	cheap ( better value than anywhere i could find in the uk or us )
positive	0 .
positive	quick ( the camera arrived within a few_days of ordering )
positive	0 .
positive	safe ( the camera box was snuggly secured in lots of bubble_wrap )
positive	0 .
positive	no duty ( per other reviews , no issue with import_duty )
positive	0 .
positive	uk version ( the power lead had a uk plug , was not expecting that )
positive	the only potential word of caution is that they get by with no import_duty by claiming the value to by £_00 or so .
positive	it ' s worth checking in the t &_cs that digitalrev will cover costs if anything goes_wrong with the delivery .
positive	enjoy your new camera kit from digitalrev !
positive	bestilte nogle vare på deres hjemmeside , men da de ikke kunne levere nogle af varene fik_jeg oven i købet yderlige 00_% rabat på mit køb .
positive	dertil bestilte jeg en anden gang hvor 0 af varene var i restordre , og derfor blev leveret senere , men da opdagede jeg jeg manglede og bestille en ekstra ting , så i stedet for at betale en ekstra gang fragt var_der ingen_problemer_med at få dem til at skrive de ekstra varer på_den gamle ordre .
positive	tak for den gode service .
positive	!
positive	i ' ve ordered , 0 new products .
positive	they arrived in 00 days , deliver said 00 - 00 days ( living in denmark ).
positive	they where at the perfect nice prize , new all of em , and there wasen ' t damaged in any way .
positive	fast delivery good deals
positive	its easy , cheaper_than any where else and delivery time is fab better_than [_external reference_]
positive	courses covered all content required along with additional content , not expected .
positive	very pleased .
positive	supplement_warehouse has the best competing prices on the market .
positive	everything i want and more with great deals , free_stuff , and timely shipping .
positive	have tried numerous other_websites and this is by_far the best .
positive	supplement warehouses price_match guarantee saves me money every time i shop !
positive	always able to help when i pop in with questions , and have a wonderful choice in flavours .
positive	i found rattan direct on google , their easy to use website was vey formative .
positive	they had a great range of furniture and were very well_priced .
positive	when i made my order the delivery date was very flexible and they sent a txt to confirm a delivery window .
positive	it all arrived on time and both me and my wife were very pleased with our purchase !
positive	we had one hiccup but this was resolved with no charge and sorted the next_day .
positive	i would highly_recommend rattan direct to anyone .
positive	i certainly would recommend power_tools direct , simple to use site , very good value and quick and prompt delivery service .
positive	purchased tickets months_ago , moved_house and asked for change of address .
positive	not only did they call me to say the tickets were on their way but all sent me a text with the tracking_number .
positive	everyone i spoke to was very friendly and will use them again .
positive	never bought flowers to deliver online before and even as a novice i managed to find what i wanted and add / change bits to suit .
positive	i did notice 0 different sets of flowers with £_00 difference in the price_tag both had the same picture - which made things confusing .
positive	maybe update your pics ?!
positive	!
positive	otherwise all good .
positive	ps - search for a discount_code online - i manged to get free delivery worth £ 0 . 00 !
positive	this is my favorite company to use for buying hair and salon equipment .
positive	i have always been one to hunt around for the best deal but nearly all of the time coolblades has the lowest_price_tag .
positive	i highly_recommend .
positive	i went to mazuma because the song on the advert was stuck in my head , it was so quick and easy to do , and even when we hadn ' t sent the form back they prompted us which was nice and 0 days_later ( from day of posting ) the money was sat in the bank_account .
positive	i would always use mazuma now
positive	the transactions are super easy to use and so convient to shop on .
positive	i would recommend this site to anyone who takes suppliments of any kind .
positive	thank_you

positive	where have you been all my life
positive	i created a photobook as a christmas_present and was very impressed with the ability to create the book offline where the programme linked to the pictures folder on my computer and displayed thumbnails allowing me to put the book together easily .
positive	i was impressed with the easiness of use and the variations of layout i could have on each page .
positive	at the end of the process the system asked me to proof the book which i thought i had done but then it flagged up an empty photo box on a page that i would have otherwise have missed and would have been obvious once printed so great save there , especially after i ' d ticked a box to say i had proofed it and was happy with it !
positive	once i had finished the book it was uploaded to the website and i was able to track the progress through printing , binding and eventually posting where it arrived 0 days_later .
positive	would have no_hesitation recommending to friends and family and came back on tonight to order something else .
positive	extremely impressed .
positive	never had a problem and appreciate the past customer discounts , excellent !
positive	prices are always very competitive but past customer offers are unbeatable !
positive	i have been ordering products from aria for many years .
positive	steve and the sales_team are highly knowledgeable and a great company to work with fulfilling our i . t .
positive	outsourcing requirements for components .
positive	having never_heard of the site before i was a tad anxious to purchase .
positive	however .... my mind was put at ease instantly , with great communication , great prices and super_fast shipment .
positive	i bought a ticket off a very well_known site previous to buying this ticket and this other site proved to be a liability , extortionate and a poor communicator .
positive	double0tickets you are a hidden gem !!
positive	! a +++++
positive	daniel evans
positive	great service , cheap prices , very fast delivery with great communication via emails to let me know the processing .
positive	ordered a number of things from made . com for my new home .
positive	had a couple of items delayed by a few weeks until i got the keys , which was done by their helpful callcentre staff .
positive	actually the quality of the callcentre employees was generally good .
positive	items arrived on time , shipped by either dpd or a specalist " heavy move " courier and were as_described .
positive	overall sportsbikeshop offers a reasonable selection of products at a competitive price .
positive	the selection overall is not as good for parts as it is for clothing , luggage and other general accessories .
positive	after struggling to find a calling_card with high_quality calls to pakistan someone suggested a tried digital calling_cards .
positive	i used my 0 minute free call to test it out and was really impressed
positive	very speedy and professional company !!
positive	would recommend to eveyone !

positive	i highly_recommend sw to anyone !
positive	got the price advertised transferred into my account the day after posting my old phone !
positive	what can i say about this company ?
positive	quite a lot they always deliver promptly even_though i use the super_saver delivery option it always nearly gets to me in 0 days .
positive	i used to be worried_about shopping online but when buying from amazon uk , you can shop with confidence and in this day and age everything is 0 times out of 00 cheaper online which is also great .
positive	its always helpful that amazon allow you to read reviews from other customers that have bought the item so you can think_twice before you buy .
positive	ordered from them for the first time and then i wanted the delivery faster_than 0 - 0days so they happily changed it to a premium delivery for me and was very helpful lady on the phone that assisted me .
positive	i was kept up to date on my order and emailed details all the way .
positive	would i buy again ?
positive	yes .
positive	if you are about to run out of mot , i suggest contacting servicing_stop ltd .
positive	they have one of the cheapest and professional services around .

positive	i can ’ t say enough good things about them .
positive	very recommended !

positive	they were competitively_priced in comparison to other similar companies and delivery was spot on .
positive	just after 0 day , i got the email that i ' ve waited almost a year from purchase , unlocking my iphone 0 !!!

positive	i ' ve ordered from here a few_times and i ' ve always gotten stuff cheap and quickly and in good quality .
positive	just a good business .
positive	i looked up on google the best hostel near the full moon party and it came up with hostelbookers first .
positive	i searched for dates and it came up with all the hostels available on those dates .
positive	those hostels came with prices , making it so easy for me to see what was the cheapest and what was recommended by others .
positive	very easy service and quick payment so i don ' t waste anytime .
positive	brilliant !
positive	when i entered the world of poker for the first time , online play was relatively new for me .
positive	the veteran players i met laughed when i told them that not only had my first hand played online , but my childhood was spent at poker the virtual field and of course games for kids online .
positive	in fact , it was not until having spent_hundreds of hours playing online poker that i felt_comfortable enough to go to a casino on land and sit with other human beings , totally vulnerable to their intimidating looks and talks on the table .
positive	although i found intriguing live poker , the convenience of playing online as i struggled to keep up and the number of websites which offer strategies and tips for poker players is correspondingly large and growing .
positive	here in winner . com i have found a great and comfortable place for playing and meeting nice people , you have great info , great games for playing online and getting some nice tips for poker .
positive	please keep updating your site , and keep bringing great stuff like you do , you already have a fan here .
positive	congrats and greetings !
positive	i just want to say the prices are great , there are a lot of discounts , free_stuff which is a plus for me and the price_match option makes it even better .
positive	i can see myself purchasing stuff here many years to come .
positive	a friend_recommended this to me and we both bought wildstar on here for cheaper_than it was currently on site !
positive	the only reason i was disappointed was because on steam i ordered sniper elite 0 only to later come_across this site and see it for cheaper , but we got wildstar together and sometime soon elder scrolls online too !!
positive	great service , quick and easy :)
positive	i appreciate the 0 %_off competitors ' prices on any product .
positive	i ' m not aware of any other supplement company that offers that benefit .
positive	also , the free return shipping is wonderful .
positive	i wish all companies did that ( like many shoe retailers do , since you have to try things on for size .
positive	the same is true for suppelements ).
positive	i have ordered decadent e_- liquid both for myself and for friends , and we have all been delighted with the quality of the product .
positive	some of my favourite flavours come from their range ( the lemon meringue , blackcurrant ice and green giant all come with my hearty recommendation ) and the delivery service from the website is reasonably swift , even on large orders .
positive	add to this the money - off coupons they frequently post on facebook and you ' ve got a must - try vape store .
positive	i ' ve ordered several_times and always receive my order quickly .
positive	the prices can ' t be beat and i love the free mixers that come with your order .
positive	great value !
positive	mazuma is excellent , great friendly , trustworthy company and highly been recomended to any one who_wants to get_rid of thier old_phones , easy and really simple to use excellent

positive	hostelbookers is easy to use and i like the map_view which lets you figure_out which hostel is where , a necessity for first time travelers to a city .
positive	ets were the only company out of the five companies i approached for a quote for a new exhaust system and they were the only one who didn ' t over exaggerate the problem or unscrupulously con me into unrequired work ...
positive	the service was second to none and there quote for a quality product was far_superior to the other overpriced and fabricated quotes for work ..
positive	if i hadn ' t of approched ets i would have been well and truly ripped_off by any and all of the other_companies i approached .
positive	so glad i went to ets .
positive	thank_you !
positive	with every other website i ' ve tried my iphone never completely stays unlocked but with official_iphone_unlock now it ' s locked for good !

positive	hubby needed new glasses and as we were getting depressed with paying out £_000 for his prescription ( very bad eyesight ), thought we would give glasses 0 you a try as the glasses hubby liked were a quarter of the price .
positive	i dont normally bother writing reviews , but have to say that the service that we received from russ at glasses 0 you was fantastic , and were over the moon with the finished_product .
positive	the glasses are slightly thicker than what he has purchased in the past from a high_street store , but that could be down to the frame and tbh is not noticable at all unless you really look .
positive	would recommend to anyone to use glasse 0 you
positive	it was easy to use and well_laid_out .
positive	simple to understand and i have now used it twice so they ' re doing something right .
positive	would use the site again .

positive	as a first time user of the site , i was impressed at how easily i could navigate the site .
positive	within_seconds i was able to find a hostel in exactly my price range at a cheaper quoted price than any other website ( for the exact_same hostels !).
positive	an added perk was that there were no booking_fees , so you would only be paying exactly the amount you saw quoted on the website and not a penny more .
positive	good products for any occasion :)
positive	i love what this organisation is doing for these dogs .
positive	my dog was rescued by these_guys back in july_0000 .

positive	hostelbookers restera ma référence pour chaque réservation d ' auberge de jeunesse !
positive	l ' interface est très pratique et intuitive , les prix des hotels sont systématiquement moins élevés chez_eux , et il est possible de réserver pour des groupes sans contacter l ' hotel au préalable .
positive	seuls défauts : pas autant de choix que chez les concurrents et protection de paiement assez élevée .
positive	a part ça , rien_à dire .

positive	i ordered a new desktop off the arbico website and found it very easy to use with many customisable options .
positive	the system itself that i chose was great value for money , as were several other systems listed on the site .
positive	after ordering , you are kept up to date with every_stage of the testing / preparation of your new system with regular_emails and you are also given several options of delivery dates .
positive	my pc arrived dead on time and any follow - up queries i had were dealt_with via_email in a matter of minutes .
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	honestly i was sketchy at first , but the order was quick , simple and perfect , got my game & currently playing , excellent service !
positive	i have been using various web_hosting_companies since 0000 .
positive	knownhost is among the ones i have used and still using , and i can wholeheartedly_recommend them .
positive	-- support is first_class
positive	-- price is affordable -
positive	-- uptime is excellent .
positive	infact they even display their live ( real time ) statistic on their website for you to see .
positive	--- server response time in various location is super and is within the industry standard .
positive	all websites technical problems have always been resolved within minutes , and i was always updated whilst they resolve them .
positive	if you are looking for a web_hosting company - read my honest reviews and make a wise decision
positive	trustpilot , this is a customer review , and i can supply receipts and other records to support my review .
positive	i have used them on 0 occasions and they have proven to be very efficient .
positive	i can thus recommend them based on my own experience .
positive	trustpilot , this is a customer review , and i can supply receipts and other records to support my review .
positive	i have hosted my websites in several web_hosting_companies in the uk .
positive	i can state with proof and records to show that vidahost is one of the best web_hosting company in the uk . with uptime of 00 . 0 %( my uptime from pingdom showed that ) fantastic server response time . fantastic support , friendly , professional and infact first_class support .
positive	i have been with them since 0000 and i can confidently tell anyone to use these_guys .
positive	they are just good guys .
positive	i have used other_companies in the uk whose technical supports were just kids and mediocres ( read my other reviews ) . currently we have over 0 accounts with them including their fantastic clouding hosting and we don ' t plan leaving them .
positive	beware of wanna be topdog web_hosting company .
positive	companies don ' t want any bad_reviews as it will stop people from paying them for rubbish service .
positive	also avoid companies that are cheap , and promise unlimited webhosting , they are just desperate .
positive	no one can give unlimited hosting .
positive	otherwise google would just host youtube on a cheap unlimited shared account
positive	i have been with vidahost since 0000 - receipts , etc to prove this .
positive	proper impressed
positive	i would reccomend simplygames to everyone as it stands out from other_websites .
positive	the delivery is very fast and effiecent ( 0 - 0 days ).
positive	i was very impressed with the prices .
positive	a really good gaming website !!!!!

positive	great place to easily compare prices and reviews , payments very easy

positive	the website was simple to use .
positive	doible0 were clear and upfront with their pricing which i appreciated .
positive	they also delivered what was promised !
positive	no_complaints and will be using again !
positive	shopto is definitely the best place to buy new games .
positive	they constantly beat everyone on prices and often get lots of exclusives offers .
positive	their free ( very reliable ) next_day delivery is also an amazing bonus .
positive	not only are their products great but so is their customer_service .
positive	every time i ' ve sent in an_email i ' ve always got a response by the next_day , often just a few hours_later on the same day .
positive	just a few_years_ago i had never_heard of shopto but now they ' re the first place to go when buying anything video_game related .
positive	i cannot not recommend them enough .
positive	great service throughout , after finding the game i wanted ( which was the lowest_price on the web ) i received my cd_key literally 0 minutes after pressing the confirm payment button !
positive	great company , will be using them again and again from henceforth .
positive	in the past i ' ve always gone with various manufacturers laptops but could never get one with the specs i want until i discovered pc_specialist .
positive	i ordered a optimus 0 laptop with exactly the spec i wanted but none of the usual fluff ( i had my own copy of windows , security software and didn ' t want a dvd drive )
positive	the turnaround from ordering to appearing at my door was 0 days .
positive	i ' ve been using the laptop for around 0 weeks now and have upgraded the ram and swapped one of the harddisks for an ssd ( pc_specialist maintain the warranty too with user installed upgrades ).
positive	the laptop runs warm whilst gaming so a cooling pad is recommended .
positive	overall a good experience and will_definately buy my my next laptop from pc_specialist .
positive	i have been using supplementwarehouse . com for a number of years now .
positive	i have nothing but praise for the the quality of products and customer_service i have received each and every time i have ordered from them .
positive	i have yet to find a supplement company that even comes close to the selection offered by supplementwarehouse . com .
positive	from the minute i click send , i have no doubt that my order will be shipped in an expeditious manner .
positive	further , i have the piece of mind that there will not be a lower_price , thanks to their price beating system .
positive	i would recommend supplementwarehouse . com to any and everyone looking for high_quality products at the absolute best prices .
positive	i have recently got my ilr processed with the help of imperial_visas , i am greatly satisfied with their service .
positive	service is prompt and reliable and the staff has a very professional attitude .

positive	i ' ll be using them from now on .
positive	good service
positive	thanks
positive	we really_enjoyed our time at dixos from the moment we arrived .
positive	there is artwork everywhere and great attention to detail in the decor .
positive	as a couple , we had a private_room with a balcony and the bathrooms were always quiet so it felt_like a hotel , but nicer and more homely .
positive	it is quite a popular hostel and the other_travellers were very friendly and talkative - good atmosphere .
positive	the staff are very helpful and recommended some great nearby restaurants - a casual one for lunch ( churrasqueira do infante ) and o mercado for a nice evening_meal - both were very good .
positive	it is very near the river - great for a stroll , coffee or trips to the port houses ( a must whilst in porto !
positive	).
positive	really good product ranges and much cheaper_than the shops , even with postage taken into account .
positive	product arrived quickly and as_described .
positive	can ' t fault it !
positive	searched for fairtrade flowers and came on arena_flowers .
positive	ordered 0 bouquets for relatives .
positive	website has very clear photos and it was easy to select seasonal flowers .
positive	i really liked the add on options at each_stage - deluxe bouquet , vase , good range of beautiful gifts , cards and even a glossy photo .
positive	fastest way to assemble a personalised gift package at a very reasonable_price .
positive	i have been buying from supplement_warehouse for about 0 years now .
positive	i have not found any other place that has such great prices or delivery .
positive	it ' s also awesome that they have a lot of free or discounted offers when you go to check out !!
positive	!
positive	i can ' t get netflix where i live and it annoyed me that thousands of streamed movies and tv_shows were so close within my grasp but so far away .
positive	strongvpn allows me to connect my computer to the us and get netflix !
positive	their service is amazing , the speeds are always great , the customer_service is amazing .
positive	i am talking to someone within 0 - 0 minutes on their website and i love that they will let me switch to other cities or even countries when i want to watch something else .
positive	i have recommended strongvpn to a number of friends who have gotten the service and are also very impressed .
positive	i can ' t recommend them enough !
positive	i ' ve been in china for over a year and i can only say that this is the best vpn company if you ' re in this side of the globe .
positive	the speeds , even with the firewall and chiense authorities bothering you around , are the best so far i ' ve been able to experience here , plus , the it support is superb .
positive	i have had few issues , but all have been resolved extremely quick and in a very efficient way .
positive	i ' m very happy with the service and i completely recommend it .
positive	i have used this site a few_times and every time the order arrives quickly and with out fuss .
positive	having had trouble ordering the same product with dell i gave uk digital_cameras a try .
positive	they did not disappoint it arrived the next_day well_packed and i am very pleased with the service i have received , plus it was the very cheapest price on the net .
positive	no_complaints here .
positive	when selling my mobile i used a comparison site and mazuma came out as offering the best price .
positive	sent off phone on a saturday , received confirmation it had been received on monday and received my argos_voucher on tuesday - fantastic .
positive	everything went_smoothly and you have the option of choosing cash or argos_voucher with a higher value .
positive	i ' d recommend them .
positive	highly_recommend - we ordered 0 00kg bags of dog_food and they arrived the next morning
positive	my iphone works very fine , this service is very fast .
positive	thank_you very much ...!

positive	regards .

positive	had a little_bit of a problem with the website and initially thought it was a website problem but it was actually my mistake .
positive	once i figured out what i was doing wrong it was plain_sailing and enjoying the ease of sending all my parcel out
positive	my new blomberg oven was recently_purchased from and installed by buywise , it arrived with no issues on the agreed delivery date .
positive	i am very pleased with it and with the service provided .
positive	i was also impressed with the competitive_prices offered .
positive	i have used supplementwarehouse . com multiple_times for my supplement_needs , and i ' ve never been disappointed .
positive	fast price_matching , great freebies , and excellent shipping make this site a true winner for anyone_looking to pick_up supplements .
positive	my only_suggestion would be to make the website a little more streamlined for product ordering ( the scrolling through supplements and multiple pages is a bit tedious , but it certainly isn ' t a deal_breaker ).
positive	overall , this is my go - to site for purchasing supplements .
positive	don ' t hesitate to use it !

positive	this is the first time i have used this company and i am very impressed . they keep you informed every_step of the way and i received my item the next_day . highly_recommended to all .
positive	i ordered an item from amazon on saturday and chose the free super_saver delivery option . on sunday i got an_email_stating that the item had been dispatched to yodel for delivery and i should expect to receive my item on thursday .
positive	having never_heard of yodel before i googled them and came_across this review site . after_reading the mostly one star reviews i got worried that i might never see my item .
positive	monday came so i thought i would check the tracking_number . the parcel had moved about 000_miles but in the totally opposite direction from me , this concerned me a little .
positive	tuesday_morning i checked the tracking_number to find the parcel was in my area and out for delivery . i thought , great . around 0 :_00pm knock at the door . it ' s here problem free .
positive	this is my first experience of yodel and i have found them to be perfect in every way , even receiving my parcel two days earlier_than_expected . big_thumbs_up from me .
positive	i have been using amazon for years . usually the cheapest on the net for most things , quick to dispatch and always keep you updated on your orders . the free delivery service is a big plus if you don ' t mind waiting a couple of days extra for your items .
positive	always first_class service from my local dominos ( kilmarnock ). very easy to order either online or by phone . very quick delivery and always hot and delicious . i love the money off vouchers i get through the mail , makes the prices quite reasonable .
positive	even_though this was a low value order it was still dispatched very quickly , was well_packed and free delivery . highly_recommended . a ++++++
positive	i ordered some flavours for plain e_- liquid , which is hard to find at a reasonable_price with a trusted company .
positive	liberty_flights had an array of flavours to choose from , at a surprisingly cheap price considering the quality .
positive	topped off with a fast delivery , it ' s now my go - to website for e_- cigs .
positive	highly_recommend this site !
positive	went to a local nutrition store to buy these exact products but they didn ' t take my visa gift_card cause it had a expiration date that was too far into the future .
positive	that was a joke to me so i walked out .
positive	found my products on bodybuilding . com and then found the same stuff on supplementwarehouse . com .
positive	bodybuilding was cheaper but supplement_warehouse is great because they honor the competitor ' s price .
positive	thanks for a great shopping_experience !
positive	the best hostel booking site , easy , full informations , clearly , without fees and quickly about its feedback .
positive	would not hesitate in recommending .
positive	excellent selection of sweets at a very competitive price .

positive	ordered colonial marines on the friday and received on the monday , which is day before_release_date .
positive	extremely pleased at getting day before .
positive	i have got so many of my friends and family changing their everyday products which contain so many unrecognizable chemical ingredients in them to lush products .
positive	it cuts down on the high concentration of chemicals within the body and helps the environment not only with less packaging but with great advise and help to recycle what little packaging you do use in the process .
positive	i am so glad there is a shop like lush that has many branches widespread over the uk as there aren ' t many companies that are eco friendly and use natural products as well as working towards increasing awareness of issues and ethics across the world .
positive	i was thoroughly_impressed by the speedy_delivery of the paper work and their complete efficiency in dealing_with the whole_process .
positive	i thoroughly_recommend them .
positive	i tried a different company as they were offering more money than mazuma , but it turns_out that mpx is a big scam and i would advise everyone to steer_clear of them and trust mazuma over other_companies false claims to be better_than them .
positive	very reliable service .
positive	netflix is brilliant for me and perfect that you can restrict access for the kids .
positive	i have always had brilliant service from netflix !
positive	the very few_times i have contacted customer_service they have been on the ball .
positive	tonight i spoke to a lady ( katya ) on the live_chat team and she was brilliant , extremely friendly and definitely made me feel a valued customer .
positive	with 0000 ' s of hours of tv_shows and movies where else would you go for the low price .
positive	keep doing an awesome job guys .
positive	regards ,
positive	a delighted customer :)
positive	great site for flogging your bits and bobs , picked_up a great membership deal !
positive	really enjoying how easy it is to sell things , great community .
positive	this site was advertised on my facebook news feed so i clicked to view as me an the other half have recently developed a like for cooking " different " tastes in the kitchen .
positive	i ordered wok the book to start with as , as far as i can tell this was a fairly new site .
positive	it took 0 days for the book to arrive after_placing my order on a sunday at 00pm , i was very please with the fast service and will be placing future orders .
positive	i have noticed that within a week of visiting the site the variety has almost doubled .
positive	recommend to anyone whos go ( ing ) spicey in the kitchen !

positive	as it was a present i rang the company and left a message .
positive	they rang me back first thing the next morning and that day sent me a new box .
positive	very helpful .
positive	the product is great .
positive	would definitely order from this company again .
positive	and by liking them on facebook i received a further £ 0 off !
positive	i been using collect_plus many_times as ebay seller , they have really good prices and so many shops around where you can drop your parcel even after work .
positive	tracking_system is amazing too , you don ' t need to worry what ' s going on .
positive	i think the score is so low because people who had good experience usually don ' t come to write a good comments but people who had bad_experience coming here to complain straight_away , that ' s why there are so many negative_reviews .
positive	once again i think it ' s the best delivery service and i am very happy that they are here .
positive	the time was came to buy new glasses and i was about to go to a store and make an investment of about 000_euros .
positive	a friend of mine told me that if you make it online , you can save more_than half ...!!!
positive	so i make a research and after one week i end up with glasses_direct ...
positive	because they dont send to cyprus , i had to send them to a friend of mine i uk and then him , to send them to me ...
positive	this procedure cost me 00_euros and one week from the day i make my order !!!
positive	the glasses are perfect in all prospect ...
positive	to tell you the truth when i had the new glasses i decided to put new lenses for my old ones ,, from the store in my home town , and guess_what ...
positive	they cost me 00 . 00 ... only for lenses ,..
positive	yes 00 euro less for the whole deal from glasses_direct ...
positive	the only thing i ll like for the next time , is to make the delivery straight to me to cyprus .
positive	despite that am more_than pleased with glasses_direct and i recommend it to everybody ...
positive	very simple and easy process !
positive	huge_selection of products and the prices are very competitive with the other supply stores .
positive	the ordering_process is easy and quick .
positive	i have been ordering from supplement_warehouse for a while now and will_continue to use them .
positive	merlin had a great deal on .
positive	they answered a question i had before i made the order and delivered quickly afterwards .
positive	supplement_warehouse has great prices and a quality selection , they will match prices on anything and give you an extra discount .
positive	fast_shipping i have no_complaints .
positive	our loved father and grandfather in portugal passed away recently .
positive	since we are in south_africa , it was not enough time to attend the funeral but we did order flowers online and within the next_day flora_queen delivered them .
positive	they were a beautiful bouquet , and even looked better_than the picture on their website .
positive	the flowers helped bring joy and comfort to our family .
positive	the service was great and professionally presented .
positive	everything that was requested was there and definitely worth the money .
positive	it was money well spent and we have since told a few family_members and friends to use flora_queen next time for excellent quality and professionalism .
positive	thank_you once again flora_queen , you helped make this difficult transition in our lives easier and the beautiful flowers helped make our family ' s day a little_bit brighter .
positive	great service , easy to understand .
positive	and everything laid_out so you can see exactly_what ' s what .
positive	love the catwalk feature - brilliant !
positive	saw the outfit i wanted ... a smiffys spider web dress !
positive	ordered it right away .
positive	they kept in touch with me about delivery and it ' s whereabouts throughout it being sent .
positive	i could track it all the way .
positive	it arrived 0 days_later , on time , and in a nice clean packet in my letter_box .
positive	tried it on and it was true to its sizing .
positive	looked great i got many compliments .
positive	very happy with the service and price = )
positive	i have no bad comments to make about outdoorgb . com , the service was impaccable although the product description could be a bit more detailed ; i bought two sleeping bags and it said in - built mosquito net and square foot , for some reason and common_sense i assume the whole sleeping bed was mosquito - proof but there is a zip at the bottom and on the side so it leaves 0 holes at the corners ...
positive	this is more the brand ' s fault than outdoorgb . com but they could have put more detailed pictures .
positive	anyway i am certainely a bit too paranoid about mosquitos ...
positive	couldn ' t be more happy with hostel_bookers !
positive	being_able to order all hostels in a certain city by review percentage , price or other parameters is so useful .
positive	in small cities it ' s pretty easy to figure_out what the best hostels are , but when you ' re staying somewhere like tokyo you really do need to check the reviews to figure_out what you need .
positive	the other great feature is that you only need to pay 00_% of your total hostel fees when you book , which means if anything happens i . e .
positive	you have to cancel then you ' ve only lost 00_% of what you would have paid .
positive	i know that a lot of hostels / hotels ask for 000_% of the money up front and don ' t give a refund within a certain cancellation_policy .
positive	in comparison to others , this is a very flexible service !
positive	never had any_problems or troubles ever .
positive	very good .
positive	i bought my books once time with webuybooks and feel satisfied with the service .
positive	i ' m very glad that i found azimo ' s website .
positive	this is a great way of transferring money .
positive	probably the best rates and fees in uk .
positive	the money was on my bank_account in a few hours .
positive	very helpful people in the helpdesk service .
positive	i could contact them with all my questions and doubts and they replied very quickly .
positive	highly_recomended !
positive	!
positive	previously bought_battlefield_0 limited_edition , just bought shogun 0 ... cheaper_than steam and instant service .. what more can you ask for ?
positive	excellent customer_service .
positive	very responsive and quick .
positive	great company .
positive	to be honest , i am very new to the supplement / workout arena .
positive	however , i believe that as a newcomer to the game there are some differences that separate me from those who have been in this arena for a long time .
positive	i believe that as a newcomer i am not blinded by any bias .
positive	i can look at different companies and websites and compare them objectively .
positive	although i am sure that people have had troubles and shortcomings with different sites and different companies for whatever_reason , as a first - time buyer i do not have any of these prior ideas that taint my mind .
positive	who_knows , maybe in a couple weeks my view of this company might have changed for the worst , although i hope that is not the case .
positive	however , in comparing different sites and different companies , i believe that supplementwarehouse is the most upfront , direct , and truthful company when it comes down to pricing and their service towards making_sure you get what you are looking for at the price you want it .
positive	the one thing that bothered me initially was that shipping to my particular residence was $_00 and i believed this was absurd .
positive	yet , what they claimed ( and was true ) was that the price that other_sites / companies offer with free shipping or lower shipping_costs was lower_than the $_00 shipping + price of the products on their site .
positive	although i only compared the certain products i was buying , i bet this is true for a large variety of items on their site .
positive	another thing that i really_enjoyed was that they had these packages at checkout $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 which all offered different things .
positive	but the greatest thing was , if you bought this package you got a credit towards your shipping .
positive	why not get all these free things when you have to pay the same amount for shipping anyways ?
positive	anyways , i am happy with this company and i hope that this transaction goes through smoothly so that i can continue to purchase from this company in the future .
positive	as the company was in london i decided to drop it off , unfortunately their office hours were exactly that of mine so i weren ' t able to go during their office hours .
positive	however i decided to drop my phone there through the post on friday_evening .
positive	so on tuesday when i haven ' t heard_anything back i emailed them .
positive	on wednesday they first came back as not found but after couple of hours got a reponse saying everything was processed with no_problems .
positive	i didn ' t really have any_problems and that ' s why the full stars , i got scared that they wouldn ' t be trustworthy and just say my phone was " gone " as i didn ' t really have any way to prove it . however was very positively_surprised .
positive	very good and prompt delivery .
positive	decent price as well .
positive	the only strange thing was that it seems that the first order by paypal always gets cancelled even thought the address is confirmed .
positive	for two different order i initially got both orders cancelled when i used paypal to pay .
positive	but once i reordered the order went through normally .
positive	ordered antec kuhler h0o for my new build as well as sidewinder x0 keyboards .
positive	superb !
positive	cheapest by_far of any retailers .
positive	happy for us to return item if not satisfied .
positive	receieved within two days of order .
positive	fantastic overall exeprience of using this company and would definitely_recommend .
positive	fast payment through the post and very reasonable_price :)
positive	good customer_service .
positive	fast delivery
positive	i have contacted the winerist for organising a short personalised trip for a group of 0 people in one of the wine regions of france .
positive	in the beggining we asked for a wine tour with an accent on architecture , as we wanted to see as many chateaux as possible in 0 days .
positive	tatiana recommended the loire valley and we loved it .
positive	everything was very well_organised , we followed all of their advise and were 000_% satisfied .
positive	tatiana was great
positive	we are like so many other families .. always on the go and looking to save money !
positive	we have been on the virtual hunt for the best deal on a pre_workout and supplement_warehouse has provided us with just that .
positive	we purchased a 00 serving canister of lit up pre_workout for only 0 . 00 !
positive	and with the 00 hassle_free return_policy ( within 00 days of purchase ) we are excited to have found a new , reliable website that delivers on all our needs !
positive	i was so impressed , i knew there would be extra shipping as i was in the channel_islands but as it turned_out the vat refund was more_than the shipping cost so i woke_up to find a refund in my paypal account already !
positive	excellent communication from the store , would recommend to anybody !
positive	i enjoy using hostelbookers because it is a fast tool to gather information about good / cheap hostels .
positive	but considering that there are many tools like that on internet i prefer hostelbookers because they have a good website with easy layout ( you can find almost all the information you need in the first screen , no need to open other windows most of the time ) and search_engines , the information is reliable and there are many reviews .
positive	they also don ' t charge you fees ( which are not hidden in the prices shown ), take care of your personal info and send your confirmation ( well explained ) right away .
positive	my wife got an ugly necklace as a present from her grandma .
positive	we tried couple of times to sell it on ebay with no luck .
positive	00days which i only heard about them recently , were fast and we got fantastic price for it .
positive	thank_you grandma and thanks you 00days
positive	i was acturely put off after_reading the bad review on this page but i decided no i will go for it .

positive	have allready recommendid to all my mates and will definetly use again many many_thanks .
positive	i ' ve bought a few items from bureau direct and had great service on every occasion .
positive	they stock some really nice & unique products and they remain as one of my favourite online stationary suppliers .
positive	just received the charles eames style rar rocking chair for kids .... the chair looks brilliant and the finish is outstanding .
positive	what a great welcome present for the arrival of my niece .
positive	as you can see from the picture my cat has taken ownership of the chair and i might have to get a second one !
positive	we also bought a charles eames hang it all a few_months_ago ...
positive	quality and customer_service are consistent and we will definitaly purchase again !
positive	:)
positive	bought some nike roshe sneaker boots .
positive	0 star service !
positive	turned_up a day before the expected delivery date .
positive	will use again !
positive	good company .
positive	if you have not heard of the steam sale get on it !
positive	( only runs for two_weeks a few_times each year ) last time i got twelve games for around twenty pounds .
positive	some of those were recently released games as well .
positive	to cut as long_story short i bought a steelseries keyboard that had faulty keys , they offered to send some new ones in the post that never turned_up !
positive	after writing a few more angry messages and promising to never use / buy steelseries again they sent me a better keyboard than the model i had .
positive	this was more_than a fair compensation !
positive	can ' t complain !
positive	very good service !
positive	only ever had one problem which was resolved by the customer_service team !
positive	i love the prices and the freebies that go with the order !
positive	will buy from again !
positive	yesstyle is a great company , everything always comes fast with no trouble !
positive	ordering is great , and the clothes are super cute .
positive	love yesstyle !
positive	i always order from them !!
positive	!
positive	this site has the lowest_prices of any other site i ' ve came_across .
positive	although the shipping can be expensive it usually still comes out cheaper_than most competitors .
positive	i ' ve never had a problem with supplementwarehouse , it is always the first place i look for supplements and usually the only one .
positive	i use transferwise monthly to move my pension from uk sterling to euros in cyprus and it ' s easy to do on line with the money arriving in 0 days .
positive	great .
positive	easy trasaction , free next_day delivery and 0euro better_than the post_office .
positive	excellent service and will be even easier next time now details are logged in .
positive	i was a little_worried_about spending nearly £_000 with a company that i had never_heard of .
positive	i read a few of the reviews and decided to go with them .
positive	i ordered the item at 00pm on tuesday , they phoned me wednesday to confirm the postcode and it had been delivered by thursday , this is incredible given that it came from_hong_kong .
positive	the item was cheaper_than all the other_companies we had looked into .
positive	we got a bundle including cleaning kit , memory_card and a tripod for cheaper_than the price of amazon , comet etc .
positive	the only thing i would say is that when we turned the camera on the language wasnt set to english , so we had to download the manual ( the hard copy wasnt english either ) to figure_out how to change it .
positive	i would 000_% recommend this company , they are fantastic !
positive	!
positive	sam was a pleasure working with and when i accidentally provided the wrong number he helped_me correct the mistake and get the funds transferred quick !
positive	first_port of call when i order new gear they stock the best dj equipment and the prices are very competitive !
positive	great service and speedy_delivery would definitely_recommend to anyone_looking to get new kit
positive	i wanted to take my girlfriend on a trip for christmas and expedia had all the options that i wanted to check out , gave fairly straight_forward options for changing my search parameters and the flight & hotel option was exactly_what i needed .
positive	changing flight times , airports and booking the hotel , checking suites , different costs etc was extremely easy and to be perfectly honest expedia made me feel_confident about what i was purchasing .
positive	on top of this i had some credit_card issues and the call_centre was extremely_helpful .
positive	i ordered a product but picked the wrong_size so contacted them and was able to resolve the issue easily with no complications or delay .
positive	hostelbookers is my company of choice when booking accomodation abroad .
positive	it is easy , i never had any_problems and the information is reliable - you always know what to expect according to the accomodation rating .
positive	also the webpage is very clear and well_structured .
positive	found the tyres i wanted at a good price , paid my money , booked a time , turned_up .
positive	job_done in 00mins .
positive	can ' t ask for better .
positive	i bought tickets to monty python at the o0 a few_days before the show .
positive	seatwave was ideal as they offered a collection service right next to the o0 , which is great when you are buying at short_notice or are worried_about receiving tickets in time .
positive	if this hadn ' t been offered i probably wouldn ' t have been able to go as i would have been too worried_about the tickets not arriving in time .
positive	after_reading some negative_reviews of seatwave i was really worried that the tickets would not be there , or would be fake , as had happened to some people .
positive	however this was completely unfounded - i collected the tickets from the collection point with no issues , there were no queues and the person working there was extremely friendly and polite .
positive	based on my experience i would recommend that seatwave are a safe and reliable source of tickets .
positive	i ' m really glad i used them and would do so again .
positive	ps monty python were also amazing !
positive	i ' ve been using topcashback for about a year , and it ' s been fantastic .
positive	i was a bit_sceptical at first about getting cashback for nothing , but now i never buy or do anything online without checking it first .
positive	i ' ve earnt about £_000 so far , just for shopping for things i was going to buy anyway , or using things like their car_insurance search_engine ( which i ' ve actually found to be one of the best for finding me the cheapest quotes ).
positive	even if you don ' t shop online very much , just using it for essentials or one - offs like car or home insurance , buying phones , booking holidays etc , get ' s you so much money back .
positive	i think everyone should be on it , there ' s literally no reason not to be !
positive	the site was great and the process was easy from start to finish .
positive	follow this up with quick delivery and an ecxellent case - i really can ' t fault my experience .
positive	fast delivery , excellent buying process .
positive	really happy with the watch i ' ve bought for my dad ' s 00th_birthday .
positive	where most websites have just your bog_standard range of sunglasses , this site takes it up to a new level , with a massive_range of styles .
positive	i used shop by style to find the perfect pair of persol clubmasters .
positive	i ' ll be doing all my eyewear shopping here from now on .
positive	... like i did .
positive	my husband and i planned a trip and spent 0 hours on this website .
positive	there are so many hostels , hotels , b_& bs , etc .
positive	on this site with all the information you want and need .
positive	i loved the map_feature so we could see which hostel was closest to where we wanted to be .
positive	combine that with the ability to set a price range and filter out low - rated places we found the perfect place for us quickly .
positive	but that didn ' t stop us from browsing around at other great deals and hotels way out of our price range .
positive	i ' ll definitely use this site again .
positive	been using them for 0 years now , and never had a problem !
positive	really love being_able to collect , and use the seeds year after year without the phenotype lottery of using f0 seeds .
positive	this company has many hard to find transistors , ic , and valves for your audio needs .
positive	service was so good iv place 0 orders in the last 0 weeks , and they saved me weeks of tracking down vintage parts .
positive	very helpful staff , could not recommend them any more highly
positive	ordered a epiphone the dot eb ch as a gift for a friends birthday , dissipate being in germany the price was the lowest i could find even with paypal exchange_rate !

positive	postage is fast and free ( on orders over £_00 ), and very well_packed !
positive	ebay is a wonderful website that i use every day , thinks to the site i have been able to start my own business with very few overheads , and find their pricing very reasonable as a seller .
positive	all the disputes iv head with them as a buyer and seller have been handled very well , and they can not be held_responsible for the conduct of all there users , though it would be nice if sellers could go back to leaving negative_feedback where necessary .
positive	only_downside is there constant efforts to change " my ebay " the latest changes included putting the " selling " section on another page , removing it for the general overview page ........ in context its only one extra click to check your selling items !
positive	switch over to tesco for my weekly_shop a couple of months back , and have not had a single problem with delivery , alternatives or damaged goods .
positive	the drivers have always been really helpful , even helping to carry the good up to my third floor flat .
positive	the layout of the website took a little_bit of getting used to , and it would be nice to be able to narrow_down the searches to " own - brand " or list by cheapest .... but perhaps they are included features i ' m just missing how to use ?
positive	iv used amazon lost over the last couple of year from physical goods to downloadable content and have yet to be let_down in any way .
positive	prices are competitive , delivers are secure and refillable and customer_service were helpful and informed !
positive	also like thire free application for kindleoooks making the reader free across all the main platforms !
positive	have used mazuma several_times for cheap and expensive phones .
positive	each time no hassle and payment received ( cheque ) the following_day after being received by mazuma .
positive	this time i tried the payment direct through my bank_account and this service was excellent .
positive	payment was transferred to my bank same day mazuma received my phone .
positive	i have used mazuma a long time and will do for a long time to come ... excellent
positive	quick delivery , cheap keys , professional and quick response from a very helpful customer support .
positive	the goods i ordered came in just two days .
positive	partyrama was the only place where i found a good selection of 00th_birthday decorations , for my papa ' s birthday .
positive	i have brought from them in the past and they have always given good service .
positive	would absolutely use them again and recommend to friends and famil .

positive	oh and most_importantly his prices are the best around too :)
positive	looking to add to my collection so i will see you soon .
positive	nik p
positive	the prices are a little high , but considering there is major under - provision of japanese food products in supermarkets in the uk , it ' s not a big deal .

positive	bought a newly_released game the deluxe special_edition for over half the price from elsewhere , and i ' m really happy with my purchase .
positive	once you ' re verified and get used to the purchasing system which is not complicated by any means , you ' re all set to go .
positive	would recommend to anyone .
positive	thanks cjs !

positive	oh and delivery was free .
positive	astonishing .
positive	i received an e_- mail about a monitor that had gone on offer and when i had a look it was too good to pass up and if i ordered that same day , there was the option of free , next - day delivery

positive	fantastic service , glasses are at great value and was very easy to order .
positive	delivery was quick , packaging was good , product was enjoyed !
positive	the pass is amazing .
positive	you can go to loads of sites around london using the pass and most of the time we didn ' t have to queue .
positive	however , i would recommend doing your homework first and writing an itinery of the places you want to see as once the card is activated , no matter what time of day , that is classed_as your first day and then its consecutive .
positive	the guide book you get with it is great .
positive	i loved the card so much that i have bought the parispass as that is our city break this year .
positive	they ' re really helpful and they even phoned me up to help me pick the parts that i needed .
positive	they gave me a call a few_days after i had received the parts to check that i was happy and continued to help me and answer any_questions that i had .

positive	i was really impressed with private_kilimanjaro from start to finish .
positive	from meeting the lead guide at the hotel right to way through the climb , all the team were professional , encouraging and helpful with anything that was causing you a problem .
positive	they ensured they did everthing possible to make the whole experience as enjoyable as possible - passing our water bottles , adjusting our rucksacs to make_sure they fitted_perfectly and motivating us when we started to suffer .
positive	they made sure our group walked together , setting a comfortable and realistic ' pole pole ' pace , this was great for morale and enabled us to get the know each other better and therefore be there for each other on the final day .
positive	the whole team , including the porters , chef and guides were polite and smiled all the way through .
positive	the porters worked tirelessly and deserve so much credit .
positive	the food was always tasty , so even when your appetite started to go with the altitude you could always manage something .
positive	they even went out of their way to cook extra chips , which had gone down a huge success !
positive	after summiting we were met half way back to the camp by the waiters with orange juice .
positive	just a small thing but this ment so much to all the group after the last few hours .
positive	as we walked we saw other groups who ' s guide was well ahead of them and people struggling with an injury .
positive	the guides with private_kilimanjaro were with us every_step of the way and supported us physically and mentally .
positive	our lead guide didn ' t bombard us with information , but discussed what was needed at the right time enabling us to enjoy the moments on the mountain .
positive	every day had challenges but the whole team worked together so well these challenges seemed so much_easier .... so many amazing memories to take home with me thank_you so much to everyone at private kilimajaro for giving me the best experience !
positive	ordered my playstation 0 a few week before official launch in uk , got mine on the release day and didn ' t have to wait a month to get one , had no issues with contacting them when i needed help , they always contacted me and got to the point , no excuses that were given to me , they just replied very fast and was very happy with my order !
positive	!
positive	thank_you simply_games !!!
positive	epic company
positive	every thing you need to know about cinema
positive	cool stuffs with cool price
positive	the images on the website were detailed enough to get a good impression of what the glasses looked like .
positive	the description was relatively detailed , could have done with a bit more on the specific application of each model .
positive	the delivery was excellent and quick .
positive	overall a very good experience .
positive	after looking for an official_iphone_unlock company i have found them an i will be doing more unlocking with u guys very soon thanx
positive	always find my best deals on flights , hotels and services .
positive	very convenient and well_priced .
negative	eventually they arranged a delivery date for early april ( yes that long ) and i arranged a day off work to receive the bed .
negative	as part of the order we paid £_00 . 00 for a bed recycle that meant i had to take apart my old wooden frame bed for them to collect .
negative	as the day went on i thought i had better chase dreams on a time for the delivery .
negative	on making this call , we found out that dreams had cancelled our delivery without informing us , and that the bed would not be in stock again until may .
negative	the old bed that had been taken apart was not in state to repair , so we just had an old mattress on the floor to sleep on .
negative	i have a 0 month pregnant partner who was in a situation where we have to sleep on the floor for the final 0 months of the pregnancy .
negative	i have had to purchase a 0nd_hand bed and pay a van to deliver , at my own_expense .
negative	dreams , aware of the fact they are leaving a 0 month pregnant women to sleep on the floor , have been no help whatsoever , have not made any attempt to explain the reason for the cancelled delivery ( without forceful prompting from me ), or to explain_why we have had to wait nearly half a year for a delivery .
negative	0 weeks_ago i cancelled my order with dreams and demanded a full_refund ( phone and email ) and was told someone would get back to me on the matter to arrange the refund .
negative	i just contacted dreams again , and they have not even updated my details to say the order is cancelled , so are expecting to deliver the bed in may .
negative	so far i have paid nearly £ 0 , 000 for a bed i haven ’ t received and nearly £_000 for a 0nd_hand bed and delivery to cover the inconvenience .
negative	i also lost a day of holiday for the trouble ( a day i could have spent with my new born baby ).
negative	dreams offered my £_000 of vouchers in compensation .
negative	when i laughed at the thought of ever spending money with them again , they offered £_000 cash , but given the stress they have caused both me and my partner , i don ’ t feel they deserve any sale from me .
negative	this company have proven to be completely unreliable , unhelpful and uncooperative from day 0 .
negative	please avoid at all costs .
negative	yours ,
negative	dan
negative	if i could give no stars i would !
negative	avoid this company !
negative	i was on hold for 00 min and then they hung_up on me .
negative	now i am 00 min and counting .
negative	their bills are indecipherable .
negative	their customer_service awful .
negative	their final_bill doesn ' t show where the figures are coming from and i can ' t speak to anyone !
negative	i ordered a £_00 service hair and beauty service .
negative	couldn ' t use the voucher as the telephone_number provided for the saloon was not answered for days until the voucher expired .
negative	no replies whatsoever from wowcher and the saloon ( exquisite hair and beauty ) say that wowcher needs to refund me .
negative	both organisations are a scam .. never ever will repurchase from this website !
negative	i ' ve ordered from healthdesigns five times .
negative	the first four times were wonderful .
negative	everything went just right .
negative	the 0th time , however , was a complete_disaster .
negative	0 months after the purchase i still_haven ' t received my produt .
negative	i ' ve sent several e_- mails to their support in the last 00 days and none ' s been answered so far , which is tottaly unacceptable !
negative	i don ' t think i will ever buy from them again or recommend them to friend .
negative	they turned away a potential regular customer with an awful experience .
negative	shame on you , healthdesigns .
negative	i ' ve lost_count how many issues i ' ve had with city_link .
negative	their most annoying habit is their drivers that don ' t leave a card when attempting delivery , it ' s like they expect us to be mind readers !
negative	absolute_rip_off !!
negative	!
negative	i used last_year with no_problems ,
negative	so i brought a new shirt in the sale on 00 / 00 / 00
negative	still_hasn ' t come and they ' ve not answered my calls or e_- mails
negative	avoid
negative	some of the hen_party arrived early as we were going to decorate it before the hen arrived .....
negative	instead of a luxury cottage or barn we were promised plus getting hyped up by the pictures online we were shocked to turn_up and see a shed which was infested with a wasps nest two showers inside yet couldn ' t shower in both at once .....
negative	and in the middle of nowhere ....
negative	although our butler in the buff ( christian ) arrived and cheered everyone up from the shock of the shed / barn he was wonderful i ' d say best part of the hen_weekend .
negative	we were supposed to get free club_entry and vip treatment etc well when the hen_party turned_up at the nightclub not only did they not know who we were but the door staff insulted one of the girls to the point of crying her eyes out , when we told manager of this he stated it was only a laugh ..... not impressed ...
negative	so after 00_mins of him faffing about he eventually let us in and shoved us on a table in the hall way far away from the dj and vip ....
negative	he was so rude it really upset all of us so we went back to our shed sorry barn house early ..... even had to book an ann_summers party during saturday because there was no activities available to us .
negative	the money we paid for this shambles is shocking deffo not worth the money never using chillisauce again and safe to say i don ' t think the other girls will either ....
negative	what a flop ....
negative	avoid this company like the plague .
negative	they are useless .
negative	we waited for our internet_connection to be turned on for 0 months .
negative	they kept saying " it will be on by next week "... gone to bt now .
negative	company asks for copy of passport to " validate " order .
negative	when questionned , no response received ever .
negative	they continue to send newsletters but never respond to emails - am unable to cancel my order now , they have left it in limbo and are not refunding me .
negative	they took my money immediately after ordering and can not get through since , even on their phoneline .
negative	absolutely_disgusting service , trading_standards will be informed .
negative	do not use them .
negative	even i brought an android tablet from them via wowcher .
negative	haven ' t received it yet !
negative	( almost 0 months ) i ' m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
negative	i just contacted_wowcher via_email and phone , when i called day by day they asked me to wait .
negative	and then i sent mails no reply from them .
negative	last_week i sent another mail asking to refund me back wowcher is keep silence .
negative	wonder is since two_weeks , when i logged to their web application , vivacitystores mentioned that items were shipped .
negative	and last_week i received a mail ( auto generated ) from vivacitystores asking that feedback ( thank_you for your recent_purchase !
negative	as we appreciate your business and value your satisfaction , please take a moment to visit the link below to submit feedback on all items in your order ).
negative	i dont know whats_going on but i ' m really frustrated .
negative	doesn ' t deserve a star .
negative	terrible to non - existant service .
negative	stay_away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
negative	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
negative	updated : just wonder wowcher , you are able to reply this post within 00min , but you have mentioned that 0days mails to be checked ??????
negative	again you are in a tablet deal , and already 0000 items sold , please dont miss these customers toooo ... :(
negative	even i brought an android tablet from them via wowcher .
negative	haven ' t received it yet !
negative	i ' m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
negative	doesn ' t deserve a star .
negative	terrible to non - existant service .
negative	stay_away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
negative	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
negative	hate it when clothes companies use this courier service is it cheap to use or something ?.
negative	anyway the company is always slow with delivery took them 0 days to get back to me when i emailed them asking where a parcel was .
negative	i ordered flowers to be sent to my girlfriend in her office on valentines_day .
negative	spent nearly £_00 for the same day delivery option .
negative	even_though i know it was cutting it close , paying an extra £_00 for the delivery on the day seemed to make up for it .
negative	but i was wrong .
negative	they charged me the same amount but has not sent me a confirmation letter for the order .
negative	if i had not print screened the check out page with the reference , i would have no proof of sale .
negative	tried_emailing 0 times and ringing several_times and all i got was one email in return saying sorry for contacting me so late on valentines_day to say that my order has failed .
negative	overall value and service .. abysmal .
negative	been trying to reach scottish_power for 0 days now .
negative	they don ' t have any advisers at all !
negative	i have waited a total of 0 hours on hold .
negative	is there anyone in their customer_service center ?
negative	company is a joke .
negative	believe me the first thing i will do when i do finally get through is cancel my policy .
negative	00days and still no news on my phone .
negative	send to be fixed for water_damage , no reply to my numerous_calls and emails , have only had limited contact via the instant_messaging service after much persistence .
negative	i am losing money by not using my contract and fear my phone will never be returned to me .
negative	please rotten apple give me some information , my order number is # 0000
negative	awful company , terrible communication and service .
negative	do not use
negative	in april , i bought a 00 pound voucher for a murder mystery evening + accommodation + dinner + breakfast at ramada hatfield .
negative	i spoke to ramada hatfield on the phone , and was told that my booking had been confirmed for 00 november_0000 , and that i would receive a confirmation_email 0 - 0 weeks prior to the 00th .
negative	i never received a confirmation_email , and when i contacted ramada to check on my booking , i was told that there was no booking in my name .
negative	when i contacted_wowcher on 00 november , they sat on my email for 0 days ( not 00_hours , as they claim ) before passing it on to ramada hatfield .
negative	ramada hatfield replied to them promptly on 00 november , telling them that my booking for 00 november was indeed there .
negative	however , wowcher again sat on this email for a further 0 days , and only passed it on to me on the 0nd of december , which was pointless !
negative	!
negative	i am absolutely_furious that wowcher sat on this email for 0 days - if they had bothered to respond to me promptly , this would never have happened .
negative	it just shows how little they care about paying customers .
negative	when i asked them for a refund , i was told that i could not get one , but i could have 00_% of my money back in wowcher credits .
negative	i am_appalled that they are refusing to refund me my money when this situation is not my fault !
negative	furthermore , i want nothing more to do with wowcher ever again , and the last thing i want is more wowcher credit !!!
negative	i just want my money back !
negative	i will stick to groupon from now on , and will never be using wowcher again .
negative	i would recommend everyone to stay far away from it !
negative	they are thieves and only seem to have an interest in taking people ' s money , without providing anything in return .
negative	i ordered two_pairs of sunglasses , both advertising ' same day dispatch '.
negative	two_weeks have gone by and i ' ve only received one .
negative	they have no contact number , which is extremely irritating , and to make it worse they do not respond to all emails .
negative	after numerous_emails i was able to get an authorisation number and return the pair of glasses that i did receive .
negative	following the tracking , a delivery was attempted back to them , but they didn ' t sign for it , its status is currently ' unsuccessful '!
negative	i can ' t actually believe the poor customer_service .
negative	i have contacted them this morning requesting the return to be processed within 00_hours .
negative	if nothing is done i will take up the matter_further externally .
negative	i purchased a tp forest double swing from wicken toys .
negative	on constructing the swing i noticed one of the wooden legs was split on 0 sides measuring 00cm and ending in a splintered point .
negative	i contacted wicken and was told the split looked normal and wood will shrink / expand with the weather .
negative	i sent a further e_- mail and photo ' s and had to contact wicken for an answer as they failed to reply in a timely_manner .
negative	again i was told they will not replace the leg due to the splitting was part of the charactistics of wood .
negative	as the leg was like this from delivery i do not except their answer of weathering .
negative	i have had to tape the leg up to stop my children receiving splinters from it .
negative	wicken state the swing should be checked for splinters and sanded down on a regular_basis , if i were to attemept to sand the leg i would have to sand half the leg away to remove the split and splinters .
negative	very poor service and i would not recomend wicken toys .
negative	this has destroyed my faith in online purchases of such items .
negative	i bought a wowcher for a hotel stay in dumfries a few weeks_ago .
negative	called the hotel to check availability ( the day i bought it ) as i can only manage weekends and was told not to worry , as long as there are rooms i can redem my wowcher .
negative	great or so i thought .
negative	i called up to book on sunday with some dates we could manage .
negative	there were no dates left for any weekend despite me being told that there was plenty of availability if i wanted to book at the full rack rate as they were only accepting 00 wowchers a day .
negative	?. i was not told this the first time .
negative	i contacted_wowcher as now that 00 days have past i ' m going to lose £_00 due to me only being allowed to claim 00_% as a credit and not the full_amount .
negative	ive heard_nothing back from them .
negative	looking at this site by the looks of it not responding is the norm for them .
negative	a gutted girlfriend as this was for her_birthday which is now no use but yet wowcher is not willing to help in anyway ... says a lot really !
negative	!
negative	after people i know saying how good it is i thought i should try it .
negative	we ordered a large margarita pizza and garlic_bread with cheese and it took almost 0 hours to get here .
negative	when it did it was cold and all the cheese had been stuck to the lid as it had been chucked about in the car .
negative	the delivery driver had his car music blaring out which woke my neighbours children and he left it on whilst he came to the house !
negative	the pizza was so thin and burnt round the edges and it cost me a fortune !
negative	never again would i order from here .
negative	its awful !
negative	bought a voucher for a sushi restaurant , booked tickets , and got a confirmation .
negative	arrived with the three friends i booked with only to find a shut shop .
negative	no notice on the door , no email or phone call prior , and the patrons of the pub next door said we weren ' t the first customers with a booking that day who arrived to a closed door .
negative	got no reply to enquiries as to why the restaurant was closed .
negative	and it ' s been 0 days with no response from wowcher .
negative	horrible experience , having planned the night , invited friends , and ventured out , and with still no explanation as to why or a refund !
negative	i recieved my order from tennisnuts fine , but i had an item missing ( wristband ) which i was then told it was out of stock .
negative	i responsed to their alternative , but since then i ' ve had no repsonse back in ages !
negative	talktalk is hands_down the most difficult company i ’ ve ever had the displeasure of dealing_with .
negative	they rope you in with great prices , but expect to get what you pay for when things go_wrong .
negative	the on - hold times are horrendous , and the staff treat you like idiots , with no real enthusiasm for problem solving .
negative	- one thing i have learned , if you want anything sorted , immediately refuse to deal with the person you are talking to and request a manager , they can actually be a little more helpful .
negative	my issues arised when i moved home and was forced to sign a new 00 month_contract to continue the service .
negative	either that or to buy myself out of the contract ….
negative	including a £_000 bill for the youview_box .
negative	no chance .
negative	so we continued with the home move , all should be well and good ?!
negative	except 0 weeks after the ‘ go live ’ date , we still had no service .
negative	it must have taken 0 phone_calls and over 0 hours of my time just to persuade them to send an engineer out .
negative	there is only so many_times your intelligence can be insulted .
negative	“ have you tried switching the router on and off again ” jesus man , i ’ m not an imbecile , of course i ’ ve tried that - and many of the other useless troubleshooting exercises on your website .
negative	so lots of hassle later , 0 talktalk engineers later ( 0 never turned_up which we are being charged for – whole other story ) and 0 bt engineer later …… 0 weeks have passed – we have internet and phone !
negative	huzzah !
negative	of course , the talktalk rules are i must pay my bill regardless if i ’ m receiving a service , or they won ’ t fix the line because of an outstanding_balance in arrears .
negative	reassured on a number occasions i could claim compensation for the loss of service , i continued to pay for a service i wasn ’ t receiving .
negative	so naturally , i called talktalk again , explained i ’ ve had no service for 0 weeks and am requesting compensation .
negative	“ not a problem ” they say , “ we can offer you …… urmmm , the computer system says , erm ….. £ 0 . 00 ” you can imagine my response .
negative	“ five pounds and fifty pence ?!
negative	you mean £_00 ?
negative	is that a joke ?!
negative	use some logic man , i pay £_00 . 00 a month , i ’ ve had 0 weeks of no service , how you can offer me £ 0 . 00 ?
negative	to date , we are on phone call number 0 , another 0 hours of my time , going round and round in circles .
negative	the most_recent offer was £_00 …......… an_absolute insult .
negative	i ' ll keep phoning and get angrier and angrier until something is sorted .
negative	:)
negative	and a quick message to mary , we have written on the facebook_page explaining the troublesome service we ' ve had , and your response was to delete it .
negative	cheers then , you pirates .
negative	never , ever go with three .
negative	i had a pay - as - you - go contract with them .
negative	my phone was stolen , so of course i asked them to cancel the sim and send a replacement .
negative	they said it would be there in 0 - 0 days .
negative	0 weeks_later the sim had still not arrived .
negative	i called again and asked what was going on .
negative	i was given some piss - poor_excuse about the request not going through , or technical_difficulties or some such rubbish .
negative	i then told them that i wanted to cancel my contract with them , and was told " oh that has to go through as a separate request , we can ' t do that until the cancellation of the other request goes through ".
negative	they promised to ring me within 00_hours to confirm it , which of course didn ' t happen .
negative	i then rang them again and told them to give me my pac_code .
negative	long_story short , i was passed from person to person , none of whom had a clue about any of my details or the story .
negative	you spend ages explaining everything again and again ( apparently , they don ' t possess such advanced technology as customer records and databases ) and they ask you to repeat your number each time .
negative	i told them that they should have records of my calls , and should know exactly_what had happened , and that i was with my friends at the time , and telling them all never to take out a contract with three .
negative	( this was true ).
negative	i also told them i would post this experience on every social_media and reviews site that i could find , hence this review .
negative	and then , after much wasted time that i ' ll never get back , when i finally got my pac - this actually made me laugh out loud - the woman had the gall to say " oh if you want to stay with us then we ' ll give you three months ' free service "!
negative	not if you paid me , you poor , unfortunate employee of this scummy company !
negative	i reckon they know perfectly well that people realise they ' re awful , so they put the hooks in and make it as impossible as possible to cancel your contract .
negative	absolutely_disgusting .
negative	avoid them like the plague !
negative	we have a business and we want to advertise it on wowcher . co . uk .
negative	i sent my first email on the 00th of april , no response , tried to call many numbers and the only responsible is a guy called robert that never pick_up and never get back to my recorder messages .
negative	the customer_service replied " what do you want me to do " after telling_me that they cant give me any other number to call .
negative	they also say , robert is really busy but this is not an excuse .
negative	hire more people if you cant keep up your business .
negative	this is really unacceptable and unprofessional !
negative	poor poor management .
negative	i got my graphics_card then suddenly i realised it was water cooled the engineer and me parent was there and we never installed it we took it back 00 £ for delivery back they told us it was fried and already used we didnt use it for a second it was in a diffrent box aswell a 000 this one was 000 gtx when it got took back we had already used another one a gtx_000 this one isnt working either and they are not even refunding the water cooled one and say we used it they even said they sent us an_email but that was a trick to keep us occupied these are not eligible i wouid highly not reccomend this service at all !
negative	i booked a room in london in january .
negative	when i received the comformation email i realized that the date was wrong .
negative	one minute after booking the room i couldn ' t cancel it and nobody gave me a solution .
negative	i checked my bank_account and my money had dissapeared !
negative	too fast for charging , not for helping .
negative	in booking . com you don ' t have to pay in_advance and it should be like this in all these kind of websites .
negative	not happy at all .
negative	we are coustomers not just money .
negative	i made a bit of a mistake , i admit .
negative	i was too trusting and sent money via bank_transfer to a seller who sent me some acoustic foam which smelt so bad i had to throw it away .
negative	stale cigarettes and a build up of tar all over it .
negative	cost £_00 .
negative	the seller pretended to refund the money , but after a month , i ' ve given up .
negative	my advice : be_careful of people selling acoustic foam , and see it in person before buying .
negative	if you cannot , do not use gumtree to purchase .
negative	you may as well burn money .
negative	i contacted gumtree support who sent a standard email back .
negative	they couldn ' t even be bothered to customise the email !
negative	where the item name should be , there was just an " xxxxx " placeholder .
negative	i did complain directly to them about this , for which they apologised .
negative	i asked them to remove the advert for the remaining foam , as i thought it was unfair for others to suffer loss .
negative	they refused .
negative	utterly_disgusted with this service .
negative	gumtree , i will not be using you again .
negative	worst experience online ever !
negative	i got a new pair of shoes last_week worn them once and they fell_apart so i took then back to the havent store the manager was very ride and refused to give me my money back she could not resell them again , which of course she cant resell them they fell_apart . better custmer service needed
negative	in principle , hukd is great , find great deals , buy / sell old items , freebies , competitions .
negative	a good one stop_shop .
negative	however , all the goodness is destroyed by power hungry moderators who get a kick out of suspending someone at every opportunity , regardless of whether in the rules or not .
negative	sometimes you get suspended for something vaguely within the rules , but open to interpretation , sometimes you get suspended even if it is not in the rules , just because a moderator thinks it is .
negative	they are quick to suspend and never move away from this .
negative	they are like the fa , come up with ridiculous ideas that no one else agrees with .
negative	the best way i can describe hukd ' s moderators are like traffic wardens who wait for your paid parking ticket to expire and 0 minute later you have a ticket , or for being slightly outside a box junction , or being on a kerb .
negative	basically the lowest of the low .
negative	it ' s not even worth going into details of where they have got it wrong , but a perfect example is being suspended for attempting to outbid someone .
negative	apparently that is not allowed , even where the seller had not yet agreed to the sale with the previous individual .
negative	i as the bidder was suspended .
negative	where is the logic .
negative	the previous bidder even said , " feel free to sell to the higher bidder ", the seller of course would surely have preferred more money and i was willing to pay more money , so in the end three people that between us have no issue for complaint .
negative	then comes in the moderator and suddenly i ' m suspended for a breach of a rule that isn ' t even in the rules !
negative	!
negative	this company is diabolical !
negative	do not order from them .
negative	they are scammers .
negative	i placed my order for a samsung_galaxy mini on 00 / 0 / 00 and they have still not even dispatched the item .
negative	they keep giving me excuse after excuse .
negative	i have emailed and called on numerous_occasions .
negative	they keep fobbing me off saying they have an issue in fulfillment .
negative	basically they are taking customers money in good faith saying they have adequate stock_levels but in reality they are building up a back log of orders so that they can purchase the phones when they have say 0000 orders at rock_bottom prices .
negative	they are liars and crooks !!!
negative	do not deal with valuebasket .
negative	i wish i had found this site before i purchased the phone .
negative	i was so bowled_over by the fantastic deal on offer that i should have thought logically , if something seems too good to be true it ' s because it is .
negative	i wish i ' d of paid the extra £_00 with amazon now .
negative	i ' m reluctant to cancel the order because i have a feeling it will take a lot of hassle and time to get my money back .
negative	so i ' m just waiting it out .
negative	they have me stuck behind a rock and a hard place .
negative	i ' ve been sending them emails and talk to different people ( christine , janani ) but they just totally ignore me .
negative	i have a proof that j walker received the cash payment and my credit_card is also been charge at the same day .
negative	i paid mr j walker because his not going to release the package , which i understand without me paying him .
negative	so i decided to give him the cash and call dhl office that i paid him in cash and i need a refund for the card transaction i did few hours before he arrived .
negative	but after all the emails and call no refund been made ...
negative	i ' m very disappointed with their service !
negative	i ordered on 00 / 00 /_0000 - they cancelled order cos not able to do the same ,
negative	they try to transfer the money to my card due to card expiry they are not able to do the same .
negative	after i requested and fight with them , they accepted to transfer the money to my bank .
negative	almost 0 months over still not they are not transferred to bank .
negative	would never book with this holiday company again , after care service is very poor .
negative	complaints_dept is a joke !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	0 of my recent orders with online companies were delivered by hermes .
negative	of those , three were delivered to the wrong_address and three of them were not delivered at all and one took three_weeks to be delivered .
negative	the three that weren ' t delivered were supposedly left in a safe location , the communal hallway of my building by the front_door .
negative	obviously these three parcels went missing as a communal hallway is hardly a safe_place .
negative	that ' s if they were actually delivered in the first place as for all know the courier stole them .
negative	no cards were left through the door so there ' s no proof the courier even left the parcels .
negative	i ' ve actually had a full blown argument with one of their self_employed couriers before after he threatened and swore at me on the phone .
negative	hermes seem to use self_employed couriers and would apparently not require any experience , skill or professionalism from them .
negative	hermes won ' t allow you to contact them by phone or email to complain personally and they say ' contractual obligations ' are the reason , although i ' ve spoken to some of the companies who use them and it ' s hermes insistence that they are not to be contacted directly by the person receiving the parcel .
negative	they really are utterly rubbish and incompetent .
negative	i regret to say i wasn ' t treated nicely at all when i contacted anyvan via the phone
negative	they ladies i spoke to was just simply too rude
negative	basically they are not the ones that do the delivery , they arrange it for you !
negative	they are the middle_man !
negative	unfortunately they are not very good at it and they don ' t really have much control of whats_happening !
negative	their customer_service is a complete nonsense !
negative	the team comes across incompetent and incapable to assist particularly with international deliveries !
negative	i ' m not gonna go into details but if you have a choice go for another service !
negative	and never ever ever choose parcelforce to deliver anything under no circumstances !
negative	dont watch much tv but when i do i just end up turning it off after 0 mins of adverts is stuck in your face 0 seconds after you turn something on .
negative	always left a card for attempted delivery !
negative	maybe knock a little louder as i was 00ft from the door and a card appears i didnt hear ?...
negative	also the drivers i have dealt_with can be rude and abrupt .
negative	bad_experience and service .
negative	we switched to talktalk a month_ago because of the huge bills from bt .
negative	when i rang talktalk about switching i was only after phone and broadband as we are happy with sky tv , but was talked into the tv package too as it was cheaper .
negative	anyway ... 0 weeks_later we have recieved the tv box ( that we didnt really want ) but the router ( that we needed ) is still not here .
negative	then 0 days ago they cut the phone line off without any warning .
negative	phoned up to pay the bill and was told it would be back on within 00_hours , well 00_hours_later its still not on !
negative	after just a month we are done with this second rate company .
negative	felt really strongly about recent issues with my internet and phone provider ( bt ).
negative	so i decided to write a review , my first ever on trustpilot .
negative	i kept composed and even edited out anything that could be termed course or offensive at all before posting my review only for it to instantly disappear and say it was reported for bad language .
negative	so i read through it a couple of times on the edit screen to make_sure there was no bad language or anything offensive at all .
negative	i thought maybe it was standard procedure to check the reviews .
negative	so i waited 0 days then checked when i was next online ... and still no review .
negative	so i message trustpilot and ask if they actually bother checking reviews ?
negative	yes within 0 days was there reply .
negative	low and behold on day 0 the review i took 00_mins to compose and type was gone .
negative	or should i say never checked and / or published when it was perfectly_fine .
negative	what ' s the point trustpilot ?
negative	i suggest you do some work and less time at the coffee_machine .
negative	there is quite a theme going on with regard to wowcher ' s poor service .
negative	it seems that woucher should be more choosy about the companies they are partnering up with !
negative	same here !
negative	paid in good faith but no goods received !
negative	simply not good enough !
negative	if enough of us write to watch_dog we could save other people the misfortune of being out of pocket and unnecessarily stressed by wowcher and it ' s affiliate companies .
negative	it is a shame for the good companies that wowcher partners with ; might their reputation be affected ?
negative	my mums migration to plusnet went wrong due to openreach but plusnet were next to useless getting it resolved and ended_up taking a week .
negative	meanwhile someone_else had been given our number and we had someone_elses .
negative	took so long to resolve as plusnet admitted they raised an incorrect fault as they didn ' t know what else to do !
negative	this caused my pensioner mum lots of stress .
negative	trying to get things corrected was very difficult and involved many calls and having to be quite forceful which should be unnecessary .
negative	dealing_with the complaints_department was extremely disappointing and just exacerbated the bad_experience .
negative	at first they put the complaint on the wrong account , they lied at one point , they did not read correspondence properly and they did not take a probable data_protection breach seriously .
negative	at the end they issued a deadlock code and inferred we were just after money when they didn ' t offer much and we know they offered more to someone for the same problem that only lasted a day !
negative	their cheap package also doesn ' t work out that cheap if you get caught for not included calls and extra broadband .
negative	will leave asap .
negative	update_: complained to cisas and awarded full compensation requested .
negative	note that plusnet have increased some prices but you cannot leave without penalty if you had their ' free ' connection and router within 00 months .
negative	i think a dis - honest way of keeping customers trapped when raising prices !
negative	they attempt to deliver your package , then leave a card with no reference_number , just the mobile number of the person who tried to deliver the package .
negative	you can ' t pick it up from the depo without that number , nor can you just do a redelivery online .
negative	not sure if they are trying to add some kind of personal_touch , but it doesn ' t and big companies such as ' bershka ' and ' studio ' should not use them .
negative	i dread it when the email says yodel are delivering .
negative	used them ( not out of choice ) about 0 times and it ' s been the same every time .
negative	now my current package is in limbo .
negative	no_idea how to get it as courier doesn ' t have it any more , there is no reference_number and you can ' t do anything online .
negative	i am still_waiting 00 days for an item to be shipped from the uk to ireland .
negative	this feels_like fragrancedirect has done a complete 000 and reverted back to a postal policy rivaling the times before the steam engine .
negative	i have contacted customer_service twice and they tell me it can take up to 00 days for delivery to ireland , seriously its not the moon .
negative	i used them before and this was not the case , once burnt etc .
negative	i could not recommend this company and if you are based outside the uk avoid them .
negative	i bought tickets for manunited vs opr in the away section .
negative	price said pounds 000 but it rose to 000 at the final confirmation page .
negative	to my horror i was charged 000 by my bank ( due to some exchange_rate fraud ).
negative	however i still thought my tickets would come and they did come 0 days before the game but i was shocked to see that i got tickets with the home fans in an absolutely horrible place where a pillar blocked my entire view .
negative	do not buy !
negative	i placed an order for a remedy for chickenpox .
negative	now told they have issues with the supplier .
negative	not acceptable to me as selling this type of medice you would expect it to arrive faster given the nature of what it is for .
negative	totally unnaceptable , wish i had read reviews before i ordered .
negative	waiting for a parcel on a 0 - 0 day delivery - a birthday_present for my son .
negative	after 0 days their site said parcel was delivered but i hadn ' t received it .
negative	their website has no contact number on it but i managed to track one down and phoned up .
negative	they refused to give me any info " because i wasn ' t the sender " but they would " raise a query " with the courier and i might hear in 00_hours .
negative	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn ' t even been collected yet , it ' s been a tracking error ".
negative	what ?
negative	so you would think they would rush over and collect it and express delivery it on a 00 hour service .
negative	but oh no - it ' ll just be 0 - 0 days from when it gets collected .
negative	seriously ?
negative	what a complete_joke .
negative	and why don ' t they have their number on their website ?
negative	" because we ' re a web based company ."
negative	no , you ' re a human_being sitting in a physical office working for a company that has a website that doesn ' t bother to give customers their phone number .
negative	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
negative	we got to our hotel in bath and found out that this company had cancelled our stay and not even bothered to tell us !
negative	we had received a confirmation_email but the hotel had received nothing from hotel_voucher_shop about our booking .
negative	we tried to ring customer_service but it is closed on a weekend which is pretty ridiculous for a travel company !
negative	we rang an_emergency number for gullivers but they were pretty unhelpful and refused to speak to my boyfriend who made the booking .
negative	luckily we were able to get another room at the hotel so the weekend wasn ' t ruined .
negative	so in summary , terrible customer_service , we are in the process of making a complaint and hopefully we will get our money back and reimbursed for the voucher we used .
negative	i ' m living kuwait , my company sent me here .
negative	my company bought me a local phone but there ' s not good case for my new phone in kuwait market .
negative	i searched this shop by online .
negative	i checked if this shop can handle overseas order .
negative	i found a list of possible delivery country then bought some_cases .
negative	it was a story a month_ago ..... now i don ' t have any item .
negative	their responsibility is only ' saying sorry ' , ' wait ' ect ... always ctrl + c , ctrl + v
negative	i think they want customers to wait forever .
negative	from now on i ' m gonna fight against mobile madhouse till i get full_refund .
negative	and go to ********* because they send package through dhl_express .
negative	i ' ve never missed parcels using dhl_express or fedex .
negative	i don ' t care whether items come or not .
negative	i ' ll throw it trash can because i buy same one at *********.
negative	thx mobile madhouse .
negative	our deal is over .
negative	the tracking -- 0k0000000000a000 -- said my parcel was delivered .
negative	i emailled them to say we hadn ' t received it .
negative	they replied later the next_day saying no one was home , so the parcel was left in the shed .
negative	but ( a ) we were home all day and no one buzzed the door ( b ) i checked the shed and there is no parcel in the shed .
negative	not to mention , if they had put a parcel in the shed , you ' d think they ' d leave a note .
negative	i ' m sure the real reason no one rang my door and that there is no parcel in my shed is because their delivery man stole it !
negative	i order an xbox_000 and it arrived with no wires or hard_drive that it was supposed to i contacted the store i got it from and asked for a refund they told me i couldn ' t get a refund but they would send the wires out and never mentioned sending the hard_drive it said it would come with i contact them again asking about the hard_drive and they never got back its been a week and a half since and i still_havent recieved the wire for the console .
negative	shocking .
negative	they claim any enquiries will be answered within 00_hrs .
negative	after my third enquiry , a week after my original enquiry , i received a completely unhelpful reply , telling_me to call their number instead , which no doubt will cost .
negative	my experience is obviously tiny and unimportant compared to those whose tickets are cancelled , replaced etc , but i think it ' s very symptomatic of how this company runs and treats its customers .
negative	avoid .
negative	the 0 of us travelling to turkey had an awful experience with travelup .
negative	they incorrectly booked one of our flights despite it being right on our e_- ticket .
negative	also after noticing on our e_- ticket that they hadn ' t booked us baggage , we rang up to enquire .
negative	they told us that it was a mistake and that we did have luggage included .
negative	this was a lie which ended_up causing us a lot of hassle and costing £_00 .
negative	they were rude and unresponsive when we complained to them .
negative	im a new customer that made a booking with you guys , everything was fine till i departure , never got the email at departure to rate the hostel , i was so happy about it but after a week i decided to contact hostelbookers asking about it , someone called hollie reply saying email was sent , check your spam and they even said if i didnt book with them wont get the email what a retards ....... i eamil back and never got and answer .... customer_service suck im wondering_why some hotels have tons of rates and the other ones dont ?
negative	do you have special preference for some hostals ?
negative	do you have another contract with them ?
negative	thats what i think after this expirience ..... but what its funny is at my booking they send me this link to rate hostel_bookers they are more more worry to be rate than the hostels so taking this link the only one you sned me im goona rate you !!!
negative	!
negative	shame i have to pick a start and no half of it
negative	never ever again !!!!!
negative	!
negative	jessica lake
negative	ordered a product online with no store near - by , the product then became_faulty after 0 months , i used my order number to view the order online and it had an option to return and book a courier , i did this and no courier came , so i booked another day and no courier came .
negative	i rang up and they said that service is only for the first 00 days and go to a store .
negative	i told them i had no stores near by and there system gave me the impression the courier was coming .
negative	at no point did they admit there website was in the wrong , letting you book a collection after 00 days .
negative	really really bad service but in the end after insisting i was right , they refunded me .
negative	i ordered a petite star njoy bubble grey / black * reworked * a , this was a grade ( a ) pushchair and the website states grade a pushchairs are : returned items that are as ' new ' and un - used .
negative	when the item arrived it looked perfect , we had a good inspection as the website said : reworked prams and pushchairs are sold without warranty , under distance_selling regulations you have 0 days to return the item to us if you are unhappy for the goods in any way .
negative	we noticed the hood catch was faulty so i rang nursery value up and explained the issue and they said to send it back and we ’ ll repair it , i stated we would have no buggy in this time and can ’ t they send another pushchair to us and collect this one , as it would be quicker but they insisted on collecting and repairing the pushchair and said i ’ d have it back next week .
negative	i really wasn ' t happy with this as the distance_selling regulations said i was entitled to a refund and they could have just exchanged it .
negative	a long time past and i had no updates at all about my repair , i thought i would have had an update when they received it then when it went in to be repaired and so on .
negative	but i was totally in the dark about what was happening .
negative	so i called them and they said they haven ’ t even looked at it yet but they will soon and get it out the week after , i was totally unhappy with this as we at this point have been carrying our 0 month old baby around .
negative	so i stated i needed the pram asap and stated i was told i would have it this week and explained i had 0 days to cancel the transaction and said if the service is this bad please_accept my request to cancel , they then agreed to refund me i did actually receive the refund within 0 days but was shocked when they said : refunds can take up to 00 days but we aim to have these done with 0 - 00 working_days .
negative	they then said : we do hope that this experience hasn ' t put you off purchasing from us again .
negative	so i said it hasn ' t as i like the pram and may buy one from a retail store .
negative	but you ’ re never going to believe what they said next , remember the item came to me faulty .
negative	“ when we collect items for refunds we do need to minus £_00 from the refund for carriage cost , with this being a reworked item we generally would have charged £_00 for carriage as this comes with no guarantee for the repair .”
negative	yes they wanted to charge me £_00 carriage for their faulty item , i reminded them about the long_distance_selling regulations , the law , trading_standards and their reputation .
negative	they then said they would refund me in full .
negative	so in short their pushchairs do look really good and are good quality but if you have a problem that ’_s when the issues start , i just want people to beware and know your rights .
negative	i want the manager of the company to read this and ensure that their staff are retrained and updated on selling regulations , as you have good pushchairs but really really really bad aftercare and this can massively affect your business .
negative	i hope this review has helped some people .
negative	if they would have offered better service i would have gave these 0 / 0 .
negative	i have been ordering red wine cases about 0 times now and every time the quality of the wines get worse and worse .
negative	granted , they are all extremely young wines and pretty_much taste like vinegar next_day , but they are generally dull and tasteless - i wouldn ' t even recommend them to the casual wine drinker .
negative	the delivery was always next_day , but on my last order the courier did not follow_instructions to leave it with my neighbour next door - i had to inconvenience someone across the road whom i did not know .
negative	today a guy rang me and wanted to sell me a new piggybank - type system , apparently unlike any of those typical ' wine plans ' with plenty of benefits and discounts .
negative	it sounded alright on the phone and asked to be emailed the details in writing so i could have a look and then decide .
negative	moments later i receive two emails congratulating me on signing_up to this new fantastic service !
negative	i had to sign into my account and cancel it manually , where i was faced with the most outrageous and miserable cancellation process i ' ve seen in my entire life - involving ticking several check boxes etc .
negative	it was absolutely_ridiculous .
negative	this is a warning to anybody wanting cheap wine over the internet : stay_away from naked wines !
negative	try laithwaites wines instead , for instance , i ' ve only had very positive experience with them .
negative	placed order on 00 / 00 /_0000 worth £_00 . 00 .
negative	on 00 / 00 /_0000 i wrote :
negative	" could you please advise when this order will be dispatched ."
negative	on 00 / 00 /_0000 seller replied :
negative	" our dispatch team said that they will be shipping out tomorrow ."
negative	as of 00 / 00 /_0000 i have not received either dispatch notification or the item itself .
negative	therefore i conclude that this company is involved in fraudulent_activity and a scam .
negative	escalated dispute to claim on paypal .
negative	greatest mistake of my life was to join talk_talk . service is so poor and unprofessional .
negative	they never understand what your problem is and keep reapting same things even_though they have no clue about what they are talking_about . communication between various departments is so poor and they love transfeering your call from one department to another .
negative	at the end i decided to cancel my account after few weeks and its been three months i am still_waiting for my advance line_rental payment to be refunded . just talked to them now and was advised it could take another two more months to process it . unbelievable !
negative	strong advise to all of you , never ever ever switch to talk_talk .
negative	stay_away from talk_talk !
negative	absolutely_shocking customer_service - from order date to delivery took 00 days - still have not had any form of apology from the company - have asked for a refund of my delivery as a gesture of goodwill and they have refused .
negative	prices may be good - but make_sure your prepared to wait a long time for delivery and expect bad customer_service .
negative	i sent my damaged iphone 0 to envirofone because they said " we don ’ t offer an average price for a faulty phone ; instead we take the time to test each_individual mobile so that you get an individual price for the individual fault ."
negative	after saying they haven ' t received my phone for 0 days ( when intact the tracker showed they had ) i contacted them and amazingly the next_day they had not only received the phone , but had tested it and found it was damaged .
negative	everywhere was offering me around £_00 for my faulty phone .
negative	after taking their time they offer me a paltry £_00 .
negative	£_00 less_than almost every competitor .
negative	absolute waste of time .
negative	what has happened .
negative	i used envirofone many many years_ago when they were the industry leaders and pioneers .
negative	( sold some old nokias ).
negative	they are a shadow of their former self and are trading on their name .
negative	this is the worst delivery company i have ever had any dealings with .
negative	i have never had a successful delivery from this company .
negative	i try my very best to avoid buying from other_companies that use yodel as their delivery ' partners '.
negative	just because they are the cheapest way to deliver shouldn ' t mean the likes of amazon , asda and many others use them to deliver .
negative	i have had three total losses with them since the merger and the name change ( from hdnl to drop the bad reputation ) and the rest of the packages i have had to collect the products from the depot .
negative	i have complained on every occasion and don ' t even get a callback or a response when you e_- mail them .
negative	this company is a joke , avoid if possible and urge companies to not use them as a delivery partner .
negative	i ordered a brand_new flash yn - 000 from ebay , it was sealed and under_warranty .
negative	when i got the flash i found out it was faulty , it wouldn ' t turn on most of the times even with brand_new batteries .
negative	just after three or four uses , i thought i should get it checked since it was under_warranty .
negative	so i sent an_email to hkyongnuo service and got a reply within a day or two to send the flash to mr . william lin at their hongkong office .
negative	after that i kept on sending them emails to inform me when they receive my package .
negative	i got a reply after about two months saying that they still_haven ' t received my package .
negative	then after waiting for almost 0 months i decided to contact royal_mail ( uk ) to file a claim for lost parcel .
negative	fortunately , i found william ' s skype id from his email , added him and found him online .
negative	he then told me that he had received my parcel a few_days ago and it was sent for repair .
negative	he also said that i would have to pay them 00 usd for sending the flash back to me .
negative	i paid it right away and got my flash back within a few_days .
negative	when i opened the package i found out they forgot to send the diffuser and the flash still had the same problem .
negative	when i emailed william to send the diffuser back , he said he ' ll send one for " free " if i am willing to pay the shipping cost .
negative	i replied_saying that it wasn ' t my fault since he forgot to put the diffuser in the box and i have already paid the shipping cost , since then i haven ' t gotten any reply from them .
negative	take my advice , never buy anything from yongnuo and don ' t even hope for good or even satisfactory customer_service .
negative	i bought some shorts for a birthday_present for my dad and it didnt come in the waxx tin or with a keyring which i have recieved with all the other purchases that have been made by my family .
negative	i called consumer advice and reported this company since they had not delivered an item i ordered in february and a few_days_later i had a call from trading_standards .
negative	they told me they were in contact with decuisine , took my order details and said they would arrange a refund .
negative	do report them and make_sure you get your money back !
negative	i ordered three parcels to be picked_up on the same day from this company .
negative	0 arrived damaged , the other two went missing .
negative	i had to refund the customers , and parcel_monkey only refunded the original postage cost , even_though i insured bot the missing parcels for £_000 .
negative	all because their system showed the parcels not having been picked_up .
negative	customer_service is prompt , but they offer no compensation other than original postage cost even_though you pay extra for insurance .
negative	wide birth , avoid .
negative	use main companies like city_link , parcel_force , as they provide a tracking_number .
negative	the drivers for this company don ' t have collection tickets , even if you ask for their signature .
negative	i had to hand write one and ask the driver to sign it .
negative	unbelievably shoddy work !!
negative	!
negative	well firstly on arrival in france my transfer never actually turned_up at the airport !
negative	i rang all numbers listed on my booking confirmation and received no answer which_resulted_in us paying 000euros in taxi fare to the hotel .
negative	the next_day we rang the transfer company who told us we should have been given different information on the pick_up off resort_hoppa ( which we didn ' t receive ).
negative	he then told us he would email resort_hoppa and tell them we need to be refunded .
negative	on returning home i rang resort_hoppa to complain and ask for a refund and they told me to email their customer_services ( who you can ' t contact via phone ).
negative	i have since emailed and phones numerous_times and been told that it will be delt with shortly .
negative	they have even used excuses such as ' our customer_services team has just moved from spain to england so things are taking a bit longer ', which was a lie because in the phone call prior to that the woman said customer_services were in the next room to her !
negative	!
negative	i wrote the complaint in mid october and still have received nothing back now !!
negative	do not use the company unless you want to be stranded at an airport and waste your money !!
negative	!
negative	my wife called to say thank_you for the roses in which i asked did she also receive any chocolates , she said no in which it does state to come with these . she then said that to be truthful that i should probably ask for a refund due to most of then being nearly dead and only 00 roses .
negative	have also emailed but not likely to get a response any time soon .
negative	i ' ve been for more_than year with tmobile and experienced many problems with tmobile costumer_service team .
negative	few moths ago asked tmobile to change my tariff plan and was misinformed by costumer_service representative as result overrun my free minutes allowance and was billed en extra £_00 .
negative	i had to make many phone_calls and sent official_complaint letter to sort it out .
negative	last_week i phoned tmobile and ask them to send to my new addrees micro - sim for an iphone .
negative	i especially repeated few_times that i have new address , but representative ignored it and sent micro - sim to old adress however she charged me for it £_00 .
negative	moreover tmobile representative blocked my current sim_card so i can not use my phone anymore and to contact them i had to buy pay and go sim .
negative	over the next few_days i have contacted tmobile 0 times and every time was given different information_regarding my micro - sim !
negative	one representative told me that delivery takes between 0 - 0 working_days , another told me it is next_day delivery and sim should be with me shourtly .
negative	sim still_hasn ' t been delivered .
negative	it was funny to listen these_guys especially_considering fact that tmobile costumer_service located in india and philippines .
negative	i going to tmobile store now , and will have to pay another £_00 to get micro - sim .
negative	and most interesting is that there was no need to change sim_card i just needed to cut my old one in any mobile store for free .
negative	thank_you tmobile costumer_service that i have spent 0 week without phone and already have paid £_00 for nothing .
negative	gonna change my carrier for more_expensive but with professional costumer_service .
negative	i placed an order for a canon_000d , but after 0 days and no email confirmation , i emailed them to ask them why not .
negative	they told me the order had not gone_through , and in one of the most difficult to understand emails i have ever received , insisted i must phone them .
negative	i asked them why , they didn ' t say .
negative	i told them to phone me .
negative	they didn ' t .
negative	eventually i placed the order with another company ( panamoz ) and long after the initial contact with slr_hut i got an " order confirmation " email .
negative	they had put through the original order despite me telling them not to .
negative	i had to ring and cancel the order .
negative	terrible service , deliberately aimed at getting you on the phone .
negative	how an internet company can possibly only deal via the phone is unbelievable .
negative	avoid , their low_prices are bait for foolish customers .
negative	booked a collection for monday and was told they would collect between_0am and 0pm so i made sure someone was home all day .
negative	it got to 0pm and still no - one had been to collect the parcel , it is incredibly annoying to wait around all day and not get the parcel collected .
negative	at 00pm i opened the front_door to let my friend out , there was no card on the doorstep yet in the morning i found a card on the doorstep ( they couldn ' t even be bothered to put it through the letterbox ) saying that someone had attempted to collect and that no - one was in .
negative	which is an outright lie .
negative	the card hadn ' t even been filled out with details of parcel , delivery address , if they would return to pick_up another time or day .
negative	so i called yodel and they informed me that someone attempted to collect my parcel at 00 . 00 the night before which is not only a lie but it is also outside of the time of collection they stated .
negative	if you can avoid it , don ' t use this company to collect parcels .
negative	completely incompetent and unreliable !
negative	they have a . co . uk website but everything is still shipped from america .
negative	they took over a week to even dispatch my t - shirt .
negative	i ordered it on the 0th of december hoping to get it for christmas , but it hasnt arrived and doesnt even have a working tracking code .
negative	customer_services they told me i should expect it by the 00th_december .
negative	although they might say they ship from america on the about us page , a lot of people wont see this and when your shopping on the site it looks to be a normal uk site .
negative	buying any product that takes 00 days for delivery without prior warning is unacceptable but at christmas its is just outright bad customer_service .
negative	got a £ 0 , 000 computer from them for gaming and it is shit can only just play bf0 / mw0 on low setting
negative	next time i will build my own never again will i go to them for anything
negative	i ordered the big_boy xxl beanbag , via groupon , 0 weeks before_christmas ; waited 0 weeks for it to arrive and it never did so i logon to the website and the delivery date was very vague : week 00 , which to me means the week before_christmas .
negative	by 00rd_december it still hadn ' t arrive so i tried to ring them 00 + times and no answer !
negative	i tried the infurn website again and the delivery was changed for week 0 without informing_me !
negative	i emailed them and i finally got a reply reporting that they had a larger then expected order , but this does not make it acceptable to get a customer to wait 0 months for a simple beanbag .
negative	groupon would not take any responsibility for this .
negative	lets_hope it arrives in the end !
negative	stay_away
negative	revision 0th_jan :
negative	after writing my review , infurn have contacted trustpilot claiming they can ' t verify the sale : they are now going after their customers !

negative	revision 00 / 00 /_0000

negative	that was my experience during half term at taunton asda .
negative	a young_girl asked for my id when i bought 0 bottles of lager .
negative	i showed her , she asked for the id for my children .
negative	i told her asda selling the lager to me not the children .
negative	she insisted if no id of the children to prove they are over 00 .
negative	then i cannot buy any lager .
negative	i am 00 , restaurant licensee .
negative	so i asked for her id to complain her poor knowledge .
negative	she then covered her name tag and said she is not called amy .
negative	she is fran .
negative	i told her how can she check people ' s id but she did not have her own .
negative	disguisting experience .
negative	the manager came to sort out and said she had to back up her staff ??
negative	what is the system ?
negative	disguisting service , very slow , very rude .
negative	paid the item on 0 / 0 , 0 days_later asked for more postage , paid them , no response no delivery until 00 / 0 , received the perfect box , but when opened , all solutions are falled aparts , complained to the customer_service , blamed to the courier broke them .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	operator julie snell was so rude at email , said would delete my details at their data base .
negative	i never had that poor horrible service in my life .
negative	they sells cheap but the service is so cheap too .
negative	will not go back at all .
negative	we are the managing agent who looks after the property on behalf of the landlord who is based in abu dhabi .
negative	in november of last_year there was a change of tenant .
negative	the previous tenant moved out and the new tenant moved in the day after .
negative	there was no electricity usage in between tenants .
negative	since november we have been receiving bills and debt_collection letters for £_000 at our office address but addressed to the landlord .
negative	we have emailed notification of change of tenancy numerous_times , sent letters and made phone_calls .
negative	first_utility refuse to speak to us as we are not named on the account ( despite our name being on the letters and bills ) but they have advised us rather_than the account being put into the new tenants name it has been put into the landlords even_though there was no usage over the 00_hours it was vacant .
negative	they now want the landlord to call them directly ( i ' m sure that is possible when he ' s based in uae ?!!!!)
negative	today i have been on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	will to live is disappearing very quickly .
negative	we have no_problems with change of tenancy when the big 0 are the providers but endless problems when it comes to first_utility
negative	after buying ready washed salad and finding a live caterpillar in the salad i immediately emailed sainsburys to notify them .
negative	i took them several days before i got a reply asking for an account number .
negative	the only account i have with them is a nectar card , i sent this and then they told me this is not what they wanted .
negative	they wanted an order number .
negative	two_weeks this was after my initial contact .
negative	as they were no help i took the salad into the store to deal with it .
negative	the staff were mortified that there was a big and didn ' t want to know .
negative	they told me to ring the number on the back .
negative	so i finally rang in , told them i was not happy with the customer_service , the delays and the fact that their ready washed and ready to eat salad is coming with bugs !!!
negative	she told me out of a " good will gesture " they would put £ 0 pounds onto my card .
negative	no apology , no recognition of the absolute hassle or the fact their food is dirty and not washed properly .
negative	she said if i wanted to i could bring it in for investigation but they usually don ' t do anything about salad .
negative	useless and annoyed !
negative	i have ordered a game from them and they just send it a fake game by using fake plastic shrink wrap . i was so upset for that .. unfortunately i havent chosen different shipping address , otherwise i was going send someone fake gift .
negative	i ordered 0 of the same electronic item and they just cancelled my order just because i ordered two .
negative	i had to wait 0week for reimbursement to be able to order them again from somewhere_else .
negative	and their customer_service manager is very rude , i don ' t know how she became customer_services manager but when i wanted to speak to her supervisor , she told me that she is actually a manager and i was really surprised .
negative	ordered a pair of rayban new wayfarers in maroon with prescription_lenses as a gift almost a month_ago .
negative	was initially pleased with the affordable prices .
negative	however do not be_fooled .
negative	the money came out of my account within days , yet weeks_later no sign of the product , and no emails highlighting that there had been any_issues_whatsoever .
negative	distressed , i used the order tracker online to track my order and was told that the details i had used were flagged up in the system and needed further verification .
negative	if i had not checked this myself , smartbuyglasses would never have informed me . how can a legitimate company not send an_email to inform a consumer of this ?
negative	what ' s more , how can a company take the money out of the consumers account and then claim there is delay with providing the product ?
negative	i have emailed the company regarding the supposed need for further verification and two_weeks_later , no reply .
negative	smart buy glasses are aiming to effectively steal over £_000 from me this company seems fraudulent and insincere .
negative	keep your distance .
negative	they fail to communicate after taking your money and ultimately do not deliver the product .
negative	this is theft and the only possible conflict resolution here is to take legal_action with a claims court , which i am_currently seeking advice regarding .
negative	the company needs to take warning , service like this will not be tolerated and we are certainly no fools .
negative	it might be the cheapest broadband provider in the uk but certainly not the best .
negative	the internet speed is not great , the tv channels not fantastic but i was able to live with that .
negative	the worse and unbearable thing is the customer_services ... saying that it is non_existent would be a compliment .
negative	they are not only completely_useless and but also probably paid to annoy you .
negative	talktalk could get_rid of them and replace them with machines , the end_result would be the same .
negative	they don ' t understand your request at all , don ' t even care , and just repeat again and again talktalk policy .
negative	helping you is not on their job description .
negative	even now that i ' ve cancelled my account with them 0 months_ago , i still have issue with the refund they owe me .
negative	talktalk is not a reliable company .
negative	i purchased an item on the 0rd of july was told delivery 0 working_days , no product arrived , contacted groupon and was lied to 0 times that my order was with royal_mail , im still_waiting after 0 weeks for my product .
negative	i contacted groupon and was told i have to wait 00 working_days for my item to be re - issued even_though the merchant was willing to do it straight_away if groupon gives the authorization .
negative	groupon refused and i asked for a refund and was told i had to wait the 00 working_days first for the re - issue before they can refund my money even_though i don ' t want the product anymore .
negative	they have the worst customer_service and even their manager gareth is the most useless and very unhelpful , if you don ' t want to come off the phone crying don ' t bother buying from them because they would frustrate you .
negative	i paid for next_day delivery on a product which apparently couldn ' t be delivered when required .
negative	no clear indication on the website , or even a warning when i chose the option it just let me pay for something i would never receive .
negative	spoke to their customer_services who were short , rude and completely unhelpful , with no offer of a refund on delivery .
negative	i have raised this issue with trading_standards as a false representation of a service . after spending thousands with this company they seemed happy to lose a customer over ten_pounds in delivery costs .
negative	i would advise to completely avoid until they amend their website to only sell you products and services they can actually deliver on and change their poor customer relationship attitude .
negative	my flowers from my girlfriend were delivered after she had finished work but rather_than call the delivery agent had just dumped them outside on a busy main street .
negative	and suprise , suprise they got ruined .
negative	any way no contact number to get immediate answers and resolution instead i have had to write emails , post on their facebook and message them on facebook , then wait hours for a response which was we will " investigate " nothing to investigate , they messed_up i ' m requesting a full_refund .
negative	we ' ll see how that goes .
negative	wrong cable sent and speaker reflects light , completly the opposite of what i was told , just to get a sale .. still wating for the correct cable to use the speaker ..
negative	i won ' t be doing_business again with this company if sales are all they are interested in .
negative	i recently_purchased a mattress from this company that i had meticulously researched .
negative	i ordered it online without a problem and the money was taken out of my account quickly .
negative	the next_day i received a phone call from mattressnextday telling_me that the mattress i had ordered was now out of stock ( even_though it did not say this on the website ).
negative	i was offered an_alternative and was told on the phone that the mattress i would be receiving instead was very similar / almost the same as the one i had originally ordered .
negative	i mentioned exchanging on the phone and she said " it wouldn ' t be a problem " but failed to mention the £_00 charge .
negative	the day after that , the alternative mattress arrived .
negative	it was roughly packaged and covered in mud and dirt .
negative	i could tell instantly that it was a terrible mattress and phoned the customer_service number .
negative	the lady i spoke to on the phone was rude , unhelpful and unsympathetic .
negative	she didn ' t apologise at all and then told me that if i wanted a refund i would need to pay £_00 .
negative	i argued that it wasn ' t the mattress i originally ordered , that the lady didn ' t mention the charge and that i had been mislead by her ( i was told it was similar ) but it did not matter .
negative	i am now paying fifty pounds to have this mattress taken away , i would unquestionably not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	take note : no paper work comes with the mattresses that they deliver .
negative	appalling .
negative	simply appalling .
negative	i don ' t know how this company is still in business .
negative	the customer_service is non - existent .
negative	we ordered a painting for my parents wedding_anniversary and use interparcel as the courier it arrived to us 0 days day with no explanation or apology we opened the packaging to find the frame and glass smashed .
negative	the answer we received was that its no there problem well im sorry but if i am putting my faith in your company to complete a simple_task as to delivery my parcel to me in one piece so of us quite clearly can not do their job properly .
negative	ill give you a clue , its not me !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single_person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay_away .
negative	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
negative	all correspondence i have had with this company will be being sent to trading_standards and also watchdog and would suggest everyone_else do the same .
negative	its about time companies like these get what they deserve .
negative	this company and there dodgy third_party companies have cost me a further £_000 in repair costs not to mention £_000 on a new painting for my parents wedding_anniversary .
negative	i don ' t know how this company is still in business .
negative	the customer_service is non - existent .

negative	this is not the first time i am on a contract .
negative	but the first time on tmobile and definitely the last time .
negative	i have to say they have the worst customer_service in the uk .
negative	no coverage and i called them to ask to change the plan so that i dont have to atleast waste my data .
negative	the customer_service never picks_up the calls despite waiting for 00 min on the line .
negative	obviously they must have that many annoyed customers on call .
negative	if you go to the store its unbearable to stand the attitude of their staff .
negative	please teach them some manners .
negative	i cant_wait to end the contract .
negative	oh my .. its a long wait though
negative	first of all you can only log in with a facebook account ?
negative	what is that about ?
negative	when there are many of us slowly eliminating facebook from our lives , besides that what about the endless amounts of fake promotional profiles as i like to call them ,
negative	fake accounts that are used to promote websites ?
negative	these are then used to rate companies ?
negative	dont sound right to me .
negative	but my actual complaint about trust_pilot is that you cannot tell the truth !
negative	by telling the truth in your review it will be removed !
negative	i have a very genuine case against a very big website yet soon as i rate it 0 / 0 and give an honest opinion based on my many years experience with the company it is removed and i am sent an_email from trust_pilot asking why i have made this review .
negative	what ?
negative	it s in the review trust_pilot !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	the review explains why i made the review surely ?
negative	the worst part is every one else can make a review with out the need for trust_pilot to take it down ask to change then send an_email asking why you made it .
negative	its a review site isn ' t it ?
negative	its an honest review yet you have taken it down and wont let me re - post or post another review about this company ?

negative	my website has been tried and tested and verified safe , we are a registered business and work hard to keep our members happy and safe .
negative	we are verified safe by all the companies that actually test website , who are facebook to make the statement ?
negative	" this website may be unsafe " <<< facebook statement !
negative	facebook are putting up public statements that our sit is not safe !
negative	this is a " false spoken statement damaging to our reputation ". i have sent report after report , suggestion after suggestion called the facebook no service customer_service phone number only to go round in circles and told at the end they do not offer phone support !
negative	and sent a letter the ireland h . q .
negative	the customer_service is extremely un - satisfactory !
negative	if facebook take peoples money facebook should have a customer_service !
negative	facebook have no customer_service !
negative	my website is verified registered and verified safe !
negative	alexa – verified | mcafee – verified safe | ssl security – certified | trust_pilot - rated trusted | paypal protection – verified | norton safeweb – verified safe | web stats domain – verified 000_% safe | facebook – ( why is it only facebook that says “ maybe un - safe !?)
negative	facebook is ranked number one in the world battling between google , if facebook makes an un - warranted decision to display an un - justified message then the herd will believe facebook is right regardless of how wrong facebook is .
negative	facebook website is damaging every thing i have taught myself and worked hard for !
negative	i pay them money to advertise my site and now they display a message on my site stating it " may be un - safe !"
negative	this has been in place for almost 0 weeks now , this is causing massive loss in traffic , engagement and sales !
negative	we are suffering heavily !

negative	i ordered flower for the same day delivery for my wife birthday in luxembourg .
negative	the flowers were never delivered , plus they never answer my email when i filed a complain .
negative	i don ' t know how such a site can buy google_ads and be on top of search_results .
negative	they took my money and there is no way for me to having it back .
negative	it ' s definitely a scam .
negative	i ' ve tried several time to switch from a cash - back website and eon website seems no to work ...
negative	i had to change my ticket due to an_emergency .
negative	i was told that i could not change the ticket and i had to cancel it with no refund .
negative	i lost out on 000 plus dollars .
negative	most airlines have a cancellation_fee or a change ticket fee .
negative	i am disappointed , because i paid them for nothing .
negative	i am a paying customer and the least i can get for my money is some help or some of my money back .
negative	ebookers has lost a customer and i will be sure to let my friends know , that when life happens and things change ebookers dose not compromise .
negative	please stay clear !
negative	where do i begin , bad coverage when i was told it was good , i had a 00 day sim which i only wanted for 00 days but you have to give 00 days notice so as soon as i got it i rang 000 to cancel now this is a call_centre in india they are very hard to understand it took 00_mins to cancel and get a pac_code during these 00_mins i was told i would have to pay for 0 months which i said i wasn ' t paying as its a 00 day contract and i was giving 00 days notice i will pay for that then i was told that i would get a bad credit_rating and enforcement officers would come and collect the money after this i agreed to pay so i could get my pac_code and cancel then i got put through to cancelations who then tried to sell me another contract i had to say i just want to cancel about 00 times before they actually did it awful company
negative	a few_days ago i needed to order 0 - tyres for my car and i decided to purchase these through the national website .
negative	the quoted price was £_00 . 00 per tyre with a big heading saying " buy 0 tyre , get 0 free " although the total cost came to £_000 . 00 !.
negative	my first impression was already one of distrust but it was the only place i could find with a saturday slot for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	on arrival i went into the reception to find no staff , no problem i thought as they might be busy .
negative	i waited 0 - mins and then decided to go and find a mechanic .
negative	i politely asked if someone could come and talk to me regarding my booking .
negative	" you ' ll have to wait , can ' t you see we ' re busy ?"
negative	said the man .
negative	i responded with an ok and thank_you and proceeded to sit in the reception .
negative	another customer was sitting down and conversed with me regarding her own experience that morning .
negative	apparently her car was about to be seen only for the mechanic to get a phone call and spend 00 - mins in the back !
negative	we could even hear him shouting at someone on the phone .
negative	he eventually came out with no apologises .
negative	i have now been waiting 00 - mins and still no - one has acknowledged me even_though i ' ve spent £_000 to support these_guys jobs .
negative	" oh mr . mason " said another man who came to reception " is that you ?"
negative	i nodded " someone will see you in a bit "...
negative	when is ' in a bit '??...
negative	the lady said i would miss the whole day at this rate .
negative	00 - mins later the man came back in " move your car in for us would you ?".
negative	i proceeded to drive the car onto the forecourt and without even a thank_you they started working on my car .
negative	i went and sat back in the reception .
negative	another 00mins past and one of the mechanics walked in , started eating his sandwich and then approached me and reached for my car key , which was in my hand , without even a friendly gesture or even asking for my car key .
negative	i handed it over saying " is my car almost done ?"
negative	he walked out .
negative	another 00 - mins past and the mechanic sorting my car walked in and sat down at the desk and started typing .
negative	after 0 - mins he said " oh mr . mason you can go now its all done ".
negative	so off i went to my car with the key left in the ignition , my wipers left on and my lights on full beam .
negative	is this garage for real ?!
negative	are these_guys just some cowboys who have locked the national mechanics in the back and running some shoddy show out front .
negative	extremely unprofessional , unhelpful and rude .
negative	i will certainly be avoiding this garage and all other national auto centre ' s in the future ... my friends will be receiving the same advice .
negative	kwik_fit gets a lot of flak in the car world ... at_least the service was friendly and it was cheaper !
negative	i placed an order for xbox one controller and was promised it would be here for day one , a week_later it is still not here , so i asked for a refund .
negative	they went_ahead and canclled my order but didn ' t give the money back .
negative	now they have stopped_replying to my emails !
negative	i placed my order on wednesday before 0 pm and i received an_email that states it would be delivered on friday or monday .
negative	it ' s friday_evening now and there ' s no news , is this a joke ?
negative	ebay delivers from china in 0 days !
negative	plus , there ' s so many online sports supplement s websites that provide same day delivery .
negative	ordering on wednesday and waiting till_monday is silly , will never order from this site again .
negative	i submitted an unlock for orange uk ( now ee ) and they said it would be done within 0 week .
negative	0 and a half months later , still no unlock , no contact from customer_service and best of all they never answer the phone .
negative	they blamed orange / t - mobile merger for the delays but another phone shop officially_unlocked it in just three days !
negative	if you want your phone unlocked , do not go here as you ' ll end up paying for nothing - they will not give you a refund either .
negative	they also have a tendency to report real feedback to trustpilot as where all their other reviews are not genuine .
negative	two_weeks_later , still no item , no communication / explanation , nor any response to email .
negative	edit_: in response to what is stated from tredz below and that they understand that i have " spoken to someone ".
negative	no one had been in touch by phone or email at that point .
negative	i got a call today and surprise , surprise they had it problems and it is out of stock / discontinued .
negative	this also proved the lie below stating that the " order had now been dispatched ", because i cancelled the order over the phone .
negative	0 .
negative	don ' t list items for sale that are not for sale .
negative	0 .
negative	if items run out of stock let customers know within one day , not 00 days .
negative	0 .
negative	don ' t lie to customers in an attempt to look like you are being a responsible company to the outside world .
negative	0 .
negative	it is also interesting that i got a response to a public post here rather_than my personal email .
negative	rating has been downgraded to 0 star due to the proven lies and lack of trustworthiness .
negative	i ordered four kubikov dining_chairs with matching felt cushions from homeconcept00 in july_0000 .
negative	once you place your order ( and pay at point of order ) you receive one email as confirmation of order .
negative	then you wait .
negative	and wait .
negative	and wait .
negative	in fact i waited for eight weeks and heard_nothing so i made contact with them .
negative	no answer .
negative	i emailed again .
negative	no answer .
negative	i called th uk phone number ( which is forwarded to germany ) and no one answered .
negative	i called five times before receiving an answer .
negative	i was informed my chairs and cushions would be with me in four move weeks .
negative	the chairs arrived six_weeks_later after several more emails that went_unanswered .
negative	four chairs but only one cushion !
negative	dozens of emails and phone_calls later and still no response .
negative	in the end i arranged for a credit_card charge back as this company had failed to send all the products .
negative	it was only when i did this that they answered my emails .
negative	in the end , i received the cushions two_weeks before_christmas .
negative	in total , it took them five months to complete the order .
negative	they have the most dreadful service and they honestly just don ' t care .
negative	my advice is to find someone_else to purchase from if you can .
negative	homeconcept00 are very hard work to deal with .
negative	one other piece of advice is that while there are very few uk reviews for them , there are a lot of reviews from germany ( where they are based ) and generally the reviews are very poor .
negative	a quick google_search using the translation function should prove illuminating !!

negative	three emails sent regarding my order for mothers_day flowers which were supposed to be delivered today and were not .
negative	i have tried all day to access iflorists " live support " which untill half past nine tonight was set to " away ".
negative	when i was finally able to connect i was informed by " jack " that due to the mothers_day rush , iflorist were unable to find a florist to deliver on time .
negative	despite the order being placed on 00st_march , nobody could be bothered to get in touch and let me know this in order that i could make alternative_arrangements .
negative	when i asked why no one had been in touch , i was then informed that due to the limited amount of florists in the area the delivery would not be dispatched untill tuesday .
negative	considering the money has already been taken from my account i think this is completely_unacceptable .
negative	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn ' t expect such shoddy service , i think it ' s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people ' s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
negative	i have been offered a discount_voucher for £_00 my next order , well i can tell you with absolute certainty that there will never be a next order from me or anyone i know .
negative	i wouldn ' t use iflorist again if they were paying me !
negative	i have been told that " jack " will arrange a full_refund , which will be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
negative	in the meantime , i will now have to explain to a rather disappointed mum what has happened and hope that a much more reliable and trustworthy interflora can deliver something which will make up for iflorists terrible service .
negative	in future i ' ll be reading reviews before i purchase anything , but in the meantime i would urge_anyone to stick to trusted sites and avoid this mob like the plague !
negative	i used this company due to it ' s convenience and had my car collected from work .
negative	car passed mot , payment made and i was advised car would be delivered for 0000 .
negative	0000 came and went , no car .
negative	called the helpline at 0000 to be told by a robotic and non - compassionate advisor that the garage had closed for the day and my car is in the locked compound .
negative	i work in a completely remote location with no links to public_transport and all my colleagues had left for the day .
negative	after 0 hours of bouncing calls around and getting no where with the unhelpful agent , i had to make my own arrangements .
negative	long_story short , an_apology was made but no reimbursement for expensive taxi , missed commitments with the family and cancelation of business meetings .
negative	convenience turned into a complete nightmare .
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	i ordered 0 pairs for the price of 0 on the 0th of october , received the cheaper of the two 0 - 0 weeks_later but still no sign of the other pair despite countless emails .
negative	it ' s been 0 months now .
negative	was told there was an error found during dispatch and that they would be with me shortly but have heard_nothing since .
negative	i ' ve neither heard nor received anything since and get no reply to my emails .
negative	avoid at all cost !
negative	there seems to be no customer_service at all , the cheap prices really aren ' t worth it !
negative	attempt 0 to get through to someone in as many days , currently held for 00_minutes .
negative	attempts 0 - 0 i gave up after 00_mins each .
negative	attempt 0 their automated callback disconnected me .
negative	i got through yesterday , but this time their system was down .
negative	been a customer for a week as they supplied our new house , and its been a week too long ; already switching .
negative	if this is an example of what scotland has to offer , good luck to them and the potential independence !!
negative	shocking .
negative	i ordered a switch actuator for a kenwood kettle on 00th_feb_0000 and it promptly arrived a mere 0 months later on the 00th of august_0000 !
negative	( yes 0 months , i know amazingly fast right !)
negative	once i had recovered from the excitement of my delivery i eagerly opened the package looking_forward to admiring my shiny_new switch ... unfortunately my new found happiness was short lived .
negative	the switch was the wrong_colour ... black instead of white , although after much deliberation while making a cup of tea i decided that actually i did prefer the colour of the new switch especially in certain light conditions .
negative	after all of these ups and downs with this package the absolute worse thing was that the switch was broken on delivery so totally un - switchable !
negative	i will look_forward to being_able to update this review in another 0 months when the replacement hopefully arrives .
negative	in summary .... worse £ 0 . 00 plus p_& p ever !
negative	you can sometimes buy in their shop products in good prices , that is the reason i bought from them my seagate 0tb green , the disc failed after few_months , and when you try to contact them they made up senseless excuses , they don ' t even talk correct sentences just senseless words which you later put_together as meaning '' no sorry '' there is no warranty talk with manufacturer .
negative	as they say they are not trained to offer you other product in place of broken one .
negative	as when you loose 0tb precious data isn ' t enough you will end up with empty wallet .
negative	i agree dabs . com might know how to sell you a product but that is where they finish their job .
negative	and as with every company making business in this way you can read up on their website dozen of comments from supposedly satisfied customers and off course only positive ones how wonderful the company is
negative	ordered my ghds from them and was happy with the service until yodel tried to deliver my product .
negative	as soon as i got the first card through the door i phoned the delivery person as instructed on the card and asked when they would be re - delivered .
negative	i said that i would be available saturday_morning ( the next_day ) before 00 as i was away for the weekend or after 0 in the week ( it also stated on the card that they deliver between 0 . 00 and 0pm ).
negative	i also said they could leave it with a neighbour .
negative	the next card i got through the door stated that they tried to deliver it at 00 and that they couldn ' t leave it with a neighbour , then again at lunch times during the week .
negative	after the last card i contacted yodel to explain what had happened and they said i could pick it up from the local_depot .
negative	no where in the email or on their website did it give the address of the local_depot or a date to collect by .
negative	so i went down on a saturday_morning at my earliest convenience to collect package and was surprised to find they had sent it back to sender within a week .
negative	i then contacted body care 0000 to rearrange delivery and was again surprised to find they had refunded me less 00_% for costs for delivery .
negative	as it states on their website that you have two_weeks to collect ( if delivered by royal_mail ).
negative	i then inquired about what had happened and why i was being charged when i didn ' t feel i was at fault and i got some really patronising emails off someone called linda @ bodycare0000 .
negative	i then asked for a number and a manager to contact and they never got back to me .
negative	i am out of pocket and have no product .
negative	i placed order in the beginning of november , 0000 for my purchases of christmas .
negative	i received only a part of my order and having contacted twice the customer_service by e_- mail ( once in french , once in english ), i still had no answer .
negative	when we deliver all over the world , it would be sensible to have a customer_service at the height .
negative	i was never paid off and i had to buy other christmas_presents !!
negative	!
negative	this company is diabolical and i have never been involved with such scam_artists .
negative	yes there are some good reviews on this site for pyb , however they are from people who just say " cheap and quick to set_up " - they haven ' t even tried claiming from pyb .
negative	my ipad was stolen and they are refusing to pay out .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i ' ve been with talktalk for nearly 0 years now and throughout those 0 years my internet has been appalling !
negative	the first house i was in it was an everyday exerciser to have to plug and unplug the router 00 - 00 times before it would connect .
negative	after trying to make a complaint i was told it was my computer .
negative	i was living in a house with 0 of us , all with different computers of different ages and operating systems .
negative	after telling them that they told me it was my software , again told them this , each " problem " was always me , never them .
negative	after giving up and then moving_house the problem persisted , this could no_longer be the house , or even the area , causing these problems .
negative	after multiple attempts at contacting them , an engineer and many phone_calls the problem is still reoccuring .
negative	i can ' t watch anything online , from a youtube video to on demand shows .
negative	neither can i use my phone or tablet on the wifi , again because it ' s too slow .
negative	it ' s impossible to send a snapchat , photo via_email or even skype relatives or friends because they can never get through !
negative	it ' s becoming a real issue .
negative	i spent 0 hours this morning trying to file a complaint and was told there were no managers i could speak to , however after getting rather angry with the caller , she suddenly said that there was a manager i could speak to .
negative	again , after being asked if i had an old computer , being told to use the lan cord ( this is not wifi , therefore not what i want to be paying for ) and threatening to contact the papers , i was abruptly interrupted and offered a new router , because this might be the issue !
negative	0 years with the same router and only now do they tell me this might be the issue !
negative	!
negative	this is unacceptable for a company and i am_disgusted with the way i was treated as a customer .
negative	never go for talktalk .
negative	it ' s better paying a little extra for a better internet provider .
negative	ordered two_pairs of shoes from boohoo totaling almost £_00 .
negative	i was charged for both and only received one .
negative	i have tried to contact boohoo using all methods ( inc twitter and facebook ) and had no response .
negative	their customer_service is truly_awful .
negative	they have no contact number and despite responding to most_recent messages on twitter , they ignored mine from hours ago .
negative	very selective about who the help obviously .
negative	disgusting .
negative	if i could give no stars , i would have .
negative	i will never be using boohoo again .
negative	they do not care about their customers at all .
negative	avoid at all costs .. you can get the same items elsewhere and actually receive them !
negative	!
negative	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
negative	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
negative	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
negative	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
negative	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer_service lines .
negative	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
negative	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
negative	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer_service via his customer_service line .
negative	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer_service line .
negative	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
negative	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
negative	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
negative	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
negative	now , let me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
negative	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
negative	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
negative	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
negative	i had spent over £_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
negative	moral of the story ?
negative	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd ...
negative	the silver lining .
negative	my husband bought me roses for our first valentines_day together .
negative	he recieved an_email on wednesday 00th at 00 . 00pm to say they wouldnt be delivered until 00th !!!!!
negative	after waiting until 0pm today - still no sign so my husband called up and apparently they would be there before 0pm !
negative	they have just turned_up now and and they are a total state .
negative	every flower is pretty_much dead .
negative	really disappointed .
negative	was not explained to me the photos were going to be smaller_than i had ordered due to the different ratio aspect of digital photos .
negative	i had ordered photos 00x00 and were actually 00x00 .
negative	they looked awful in the photo album i had purchased .
negative	quick delivery though and customer support replied quickly when i complained about the size issue but there was no compensation .
negative	you would seriously be a sad state of mind to pay for any program on itv_player , now i like a lot of itv programs but if i miss them on normal tv i just put it down to experience .
negative	the adverts never seem to have a problem .......... think about it !!!
negative	!
negative	purchased an acre of moon off here from moon estates , waited 00 days for it to arrive , when it did the certificate had the wrong name on it .
negative	when i contacted moon estates they told me it was a £ 0 charge to change the name and that they had had a great number of calls as wowcher had made mistake with order details .
negative	i do not see why i should have to pay this amount to change the name .
negative	have emailed several_times over a week_ago and heard_nothing back at all .
negative	disgusted
negative	have had countless orders from this company however my last 0 orders have been terrible .
negative	items arriving damaged , no tags , heel broken on a pair of boots and a strap on a bag snapped .
negative	sizes changed order a 00 it ' s like an 00 order a 00 it ' s like a 0 .
negative	complained to head_office as ordered a cardigan size 00 .
negative	when it came was stuffed in a bag , hole in shoulder , no tags to say was new .
negative	looked inside had a george asda tag size 0 .
negative	contacted company took photo of item they denied sending it said they didn ' t sell asda clothing even_though cardigan was identical to the one on the site which i screen_shot and sent with the picture of the cardigan .
negative	they refused to let me return it .
negative	person who emailed me was very rude .
negative	ups are so bad it is barely comprehensible .
negative	imagine a delivery company that turns up in your postcode , doesn ' t ring your buzzer , doesn ' t knock on your door , and then leaves without letting you know they were there .
negative	apparently , on planet ups , this counts as an attempted delivery .
negative	of course , for all of the psychic people in the uk , this is no problem at all .
negative	for the rest of us , this is not exactly ideal .
negative	and then imagine you arrange for them to come on another day , agree a specific date with them , receive email confirmation of this date , and then they turn_up again 0 week before this agreed date .
negative	what are they thinking might happen ?
negative	there are a few things i can ' t fathom about ups : how they can be so stupid , and how they can make any money mindlessly attempting to deliver items .
negative	i will never , ever , ever knowingly use a company that has ups as its delivery company .
negative	first order fine although received a few_days late .
negative	my second and larger order has been a complete_shambles .
negative	i ordered the same product by in slightly larger quantities .
negative	was given a delivery date via_email confirmation .
negative	the delivery date come and went with no communication from them .
negative	a few_days after the delivery date i emailed and received no reply , i used online_chat and was told it is out of stock , i asked when do they expect stock and was told " i don ' t know i don ' t deal with online orders " i asked why no one had bothered to call or email and let me know and was again told i don ' t deal with online orders ask mike ( i ' v never had any dealings with anyone called mike and had no contact details .
negative	about a week after the delivery date i emailed asking for an update and no reply again .
negative	i re emailed asking for a refund no reply .
negative	complete_waste of time and now have to wait for paypal to refund .
negative	will not be using workwear ( not ) express again .
negative	* in response to workwear_express reply *
negative	a copy and pasted reply is not good customer_service , and saying " i will look_into what occurred to ensure that these sorts of problems don ' t arise for future customers " is pointless just reading the first 00 or so reviews you ' ve said this at_least 0 times , so either you ' ve not looked into what occurred as you claim or you ' ve not sorted things out .
negative	its amazing that you ' ve failed to reply to my emails yet within minutes you reply to my review and contact me regarding my paypal_dispute .
negative	if you are in fact sorry as you claim to be give me a refund and learn and take on board what the reviews say instead of simply offering a generic reply and forgetting about it .
negative	this company is claiming to be based at 000 moston lane , however this is not the case and 000 moston lane is my address , we have never had any dealings with them except the countless people visiting to complain .
negative	avoid this company as any order your place will result in your money being lost and nothing to show for it .
negative	this company is a complete scam , the office address they are using to claim they have a uk office is infact my property .
negative	the police visited today with a warrant as they are ripping people off selling them container loads of paper at a fraction of the uk retail price however it never shows up and nor do your money .
negative	i am only on my second month with plus net and i ' m on my third fault .
negative	trying to get someone to listen when reporting a fault is like pulling teeth .
negative	always the same question have you changed the micro filter , router is your phone ok they then say they will run some tests and it could take up to 00_hours .
negative	on all 0 occasion after the 00_hours is up they send an_email_saying the support ticket has been closed as your internet is now connected .
negative	i have to go through the whole rigmarole again because its still not working .
negative	0 months 0 faults and about 0 days with no connection whatsoever yet they still wont send an engineer out .
negative	i waited on hold for 00_minutes only for the phone to cut_off .
negative	when through their online trouble shooter about 00 stupid questions in is says sorry there was a problem please try later .
negative	well plus . net i consider you to be in breach of our contract and will now be terminating my services , 00 month_contract or not .
negative	complete_shambles and complete_waste of time run by people who cannot think for themselves only readying auto prompt of their computer screens .
negative	the worst thing you ever did was to sell out to bt .
negative	this is a scam the website offers downloads and installs a tool bar , changes your home page and search providers then puts a popup saying the download you requested is no_longer available .
negative	i have a good anti virus so have tried on a couple of different files and all do exactly the same .
negative	don ' t waste your time and risk downloading something you cannot get_rid of .
negative	very poor , been waiting on a delivery for 0 weeks now tracking keeps saying tried to deliver .
negative	we ' re a business open 0 - 0 yet they claim they tried to deliver and left a card .
negative	we ' ve never closed during the day and no card was left .
negative	business should stop using them as their carrier , my supplier has now lost my business simply because yodel cannot do what they are paid to do .
negative	if you ' re reading this reveiw do not buy a car from these people .
negative	the worst dealership i ' ve ever came_across
negative	having had a few visits to this dealership i ' ve had my car damaged twice ( included one when i was in they car yet they still denied it ).
negative	been told i do not have the extended_warranty i pay for monthly ( which turns_out that it covers nothing ).
negative	and finally today they lied to me about having someone who_wants to buy my car , upon_arriving at the dealership it was very clear that they just want to sell me a car and and want offer less that have the glass guide price for trade in .
negative	this just from the outside where there is no damage at all .
negative	sent iphone 0 in good condition , sent recorded_delivery , then got email_saying screen cracked which is a joke as this had bubble rap and was in a case , said phone screen cracked so it was put down form 000 to 00 , i have sent many phone before with out problem , this has made me so mad and i will never trust this company again , would not surprise me if the company has been sold to somebody_else .
negative	never ever using this again !.
negative	just seen the reply , 0 its my word vs your word about phone being damaged .
negative	0 you could have damaged it .
negative	0 . what the point off sending phone back if its been damaged .
negative	thats why i took the price in the first place its one big joke , like i say never will
negative	use again !
negative	.............................. update ..................................................
negative	will never use again !
negative	thats the end .
negative	my husband ordered me flowers for valentine ' s day , and it was agreed upon ordering them that they would be delivered before 0pm as we were leaving for a week long trip at 0pm ( the plan was to take the flowers with us so that i could enjoy them whilst i was away ).
negative	between 0 and 0pm my husband was getting more and more concerned that the flowers hadn ' t showed up , so he kept ringing eflorist but could never get through on the phone ( he was on hold the entire time ).
negative	we waited until 0 . 00pm but couldn ' t hold on any longer as we had a 0 hour car journey ahead of us and a 00 month old who needed to be put to sleep in the car .
negative	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .
negative	after failing to get through to eflorist on the phone , my husband sent an_email complaint to them but no one ever replied .
negative	the next_day he continually rang eflorist but could never get through when selecting the option that he was calling about an " existing order ".
negative	eventually he got through when he selected the option to " place a new order ", and was told he was not eligible for a refund despite explaining our circumstances in detail .
negative	we never even got to see the flowers as we were away for a week , and they had died by the time we got home .
negative	we both wrongly assumed that eflorist would be apologetic and give us a full_refund but as they refused we intend to spread the word to our friends , family and beyond that they shouldn ' t use eflorist .
negative	following on from reviewing a company trustpilot contacted me saying my negative_review of said company was in breach of their guidelines .
negative	i edited by review to bring it inline and it went live .
negative	it was taken down again immediately and i was asked to provide_evidence to my purchase .
negative	i sent an invoice i had from the company and imagined i would see my review live again .
negative	this is not the case .
negative	i ' m now being questioned on what i purchased , as if that is relevant whether i bought a chair or a table !
negative	the important point is that i have complied with every_single guideline and my review is still not visable .
negative	i find this completely_unacceptable and certainly not unbiased as they should be .
negative	this awful company let me down in couple of occasions .
negative	couple of time they didn ' t even left the card , but when i checked online - attempted delivery card left .
negative	but funny think was , that i was home at all time .
negative	so literally the self employees drivers showing the company that they are at work even they are not .
negative	so they just scan a package in the car but they never go to the address .
negative	and after 0 attemps , they will just return package to the depot .
negative	and depot is about 00miles away from my house :) and phone customer support won ' t even give you phone number for the driver .
negative	i have never_experienced worst delivery company in my life .
negative	having read previous comments i have also had a poor experience with this company .
negative	i had two samsung_galaxy_s0 ' s that were in very good condition and was lured to this company because of the fantastic price they offered ( they were offering 00_% more_than [_external reference_] or [_external reference ]).
negative	when they phones were tested that apparently had bad bezel damage , they didn ' t , and the price offered was a fraction of the original .
negative	haggling occurred and then finally i settled on a price as it was clear i was not going to receive my phones back .
negative	also had a major problem with getting payment as they took down the wrong details and then had the phone put down on me by their customer_services team when all i wanted was to sort out my details so i could get paid .
negative	please avoid them and go for a more recognised and trusted company , they are just not worth the hassle .
negative	very have £_00 of my cash and won ' t return it .
negative	can ' t get any response from then .
negative	spent £££ on their chargeable phone line trying to rectify their mistakes .
negative	useless robots in a call_centre ( south_africa ?)
negative	who say they will sort it out , then do nothing .
negative	been in tears .
negative	need my money back .
negative	it ' s xmas !!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered a tv online and was told the delivery would be between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm during the week , so i had to take an afternoon off work to make_sure i was in the house to accept the delivery .
negative	i arrived at home just after 00 . 00 .
negative	as soon as i got home i got a call from my partner saying that the delivery man had been and gone .
negative	it had come to our attention that the delivery man had tried to drop_off our item outside the agreed time forcing us to arrange a new delivery date a week_later !
negative	this is extremely frustrating as i had to take the entire afternoon of work for someone_else ' s incompetence .
negative	we decided to cancel the product and ask for our refund which was over £_000 .
negative	they said we would be refunded within 0 - 0 working_days , but after a week of nothing , we decided to call again .
negative	apparently the refund request hadn ' t gone_through , so we had to request it again , waiting another 0 days until we got our money back .
negative	firstly , my home hub kept dropping connection , so i had to call to get a replacement .
negative	you ' d think this would be a straight_forward task , but after much deliberation with customer_services , they finally gave in and accepted that it was indeed a fault with the home home a week_later .
negative	i got a new one , but then my bt vision stopped_working .
negative	again i had to jump_through hoops to get this resolved ... but it never did .
negative	to add_insult to injury , i moved_into a new home with my partner who is also a bt customer .
negative	you ' d think it would be easy to merge our accounts .
negative	nope .
negative	they charged me £_000_+ to cancel .
negative	thanks bt .
negative	but wait , there ' s more .
negative	when i did move in with my partner , we wanted to get set_up with our existing services for our new home .
negative	this was the final_straw .
negative	after agreeing to an installation date , bt phoned us and cancelled , rearranging a date for a week_later !
negative	they also charged us £_00 for a month without any service which we tried to get refunded .
negative	after calling customer_services and being on hold for a total of 0 hours , i finally got through to the right people and by this stage i was happy to cancel our account all together .
negative	it ' s an_absolute_joke and should be criminal .
negative	goodbye bt .
negative	hello sky .
negative	i and my boss ordered two mobile_phones , my boss ' order went through ok whereas mine was blocked .
negative	i called them to resolve this , but despite the website advertising delivery within 00_hours , after 00_hours neither order had been processed .
negative	my boss ' phone eventually arrived this morning , opened and used .
negative	i have immediately submitted a returns request and have cancelled my order .
negative	they may have the best prices , but it ' s balanced by dreadful and dishonest service .
negative	if you are thinking about buying anything from this company .... forget it terrible company sent me a faulty pair of headphones tried to contact them several_times .... no one ever picks_up the phone .... i did get a reply email but nothing was done about it .... i has been 0 weeks and several_attempts to get a replacement or refund with no joy .
negative	still_waiting for a solution from them !
negative	marcos
negative	i set_up a vps with heart and in the same day discovered that the server backup costs were way more_than i had imagined .
negative	i had moved from rackspace to save money and now discovered it would be costing more , fair_enough its my mistake .
negative	i spoke to heart and they were happy to cancel the account which was great , unfortunately they refused to refund any money .
negative	the account had been open less_than a day and i had paid for a full year - so it cost me over £_000 for less_than a day ' s hosting .
negative	i would have been happy to pay for the days service i used or even a month , but the stance the took of charging for a full year really surprised me .
negative	companies with that kind of money grabbing attitude do nothing to help their reputations and i will happily be staying with rackspace .
negative	it ' s been 0 days since i ordered now and i ' ve gotten in touch and had no reply from " customer_services " i wish i used a big well_known website and i will never make this mistake again !
negative	i have just recieved my valentines_day flowers which my boyfriend bought from them to be sent to me at work today ( valentines_day ) and i just needed to express how disgusted i am .
negative	the flowers were delivered in a damaged box and when i opened them i was so dissapointed .
negative	these flowers were dispatched on monday 00th_feb - are you suprised they are dead ?
negative	there were not in water and had come loose in the box so are not looking their best .
negative	the mojority of them are dry , black and curling !
negative	they are so squashed and look like a 0 year_old hand tied them .
negative	i had to call my boyfriend and thank him , however he knew something was wrong and is equally as angry that he purchased from yourselves .
negative	i understand they are an internet company with lots of orders but there will be so many unhappy ladies today if their flowers were sent out monday and arrived in this state aswell !
negative	i am furious !
negative	hope to be getting a refund !
negative	if you cant handle the busy day orders then dont take any more !
negative	dead flowers are no use to anyone !
negative	i wont even be able to enjoy them for one day .
negative	these_guys are scam_artists !
negative	thought their prices were too good to be true but thought i ' d give them a go , what an_idiot i was !!!
negative	good never turned_up , now having to go through crazy chargeback process , which is taking for ever to get back .
negative	made a booking , ordered 0 coaches for my brothers wedding day and paid on that basis .
negative	on the day of the booking they sent 0 double decker and simply fobbed us off with some rubbish about the other bus breaking down and having tried to contact us .
negative	this was unacceptable to us due to certain cultural issues ( women and men should travel on separate coaches as the men tend to be drunk on the way back from the wedding reception ).
negative	now they refuse to refund us on the basis that only 0 coach turned_up and worse they keep changing their story as to why they feel they are not at fault .
negative	i ' m now taking this up with my solicitor as well as the confederation of passenger transport uk .
negative	you ( the public ) have been warned !!
negative	!
negative	as with many of the people below i ordered a bean_bag via groupon on 0th_november for a christmas_present and it ' s not arrived and i cannot get a response via_email or telephone - i ' ve tried several numbers .
negative	i ' ve now written to bbc_watchdog and copied them this thread as well as writing to groupon about it .
negative	will let you know what happens .
negative	bought a coat and the wrong_size came .
negative	tried several_times to call but no one ever picked_up .
negative	sent numerous_emails and query forms to which i had a ' thank_you for your query ' reply but never received anything_else despite them saying they answer all emails within 0 working_days ???
negative	total_waste of time !!!
negative	!
negative	lucky for me i paid on my credit_card so i am covered and they wont be keeping my money !!
negative	!
negative	i e_- mailed wowcher on their enquiries e_- mail address regarding a special offer they advertised on september 0th , asking if the deal was suitable for a person in a wheelchair .
negative	to this day , i still_haven ' t heard from them and the deal is long gone .
negative	looking at previous reviews , it seems that the only way to get a response from wowcher is to leave poor feedback on a public forum , so here goes .
negative	the lack of respect in answering potential customer ' s queries is , quite_frankly , disgusting and , as such , i won ' t be using them in the future , however good the deals are .
negative	very misleading and terms of contract are shocking .
negative	do not take out a product or service with this company .
negative	i have since cancelled my policy
negative	i placed an order over the weekend for valentines_day with " courier track and trace " delivery .
negative	the order was accepted and i received a confirmation e_- mail but when i view my account the order has disappeared and i have not received any tracking_number at all ( you would have thought this was essential right ?).
negative	the item has sold out also so i ' m increasingly worried that they couldn ' t fulfil all orders and just cancelled them .. live_chat was offline and they ' ve not responded to my e_- mails .
negative	ringing up the bank first thing and disputing .
negative	horrendous experience !!
negative	ordered my brother ' s xmas_present in nov , which the website advised was out of stock , but would be available in jan ..( as he already knew what he was getting he said was happy to wait ).
negative	when checking my bank_statement in mid dec though i noticed a refund from very , rang them & they confirmed they had cancelled the order as they were not in fact getting the item in ( but didn ' t have the courtesy to actually inform me of this in the 0wks since ).. then it turned_out they hadn ' t refunded the shipping ... so i spent probably the cost of this on phonecalls ( was cut_off twice while ' on hold ' after battling through the lengthy & inaccurate voice recognition menu system ).
negative	it took 0 attempts for what passes as ' customer_service ' to find my account , then 00_minutes on hold while they talked to a supervisor , before saying they couldn ' t refund my card , but would have to send out a cheque for £ 0 . 00 ... gaaaaaaaaaaaaah .
negative	shop with very at your peril - only if you have the patience of a saint & don ' t care about shocking service ....
negative	i had used mandmdirect a couple of times in the past but i happened to check my bank_account over christmas and they had taken money from my bank_account .
negative	i hadn ' t ordered anything in months .
negative	i contacted them and they refunded it but said they couldn ' t give an explanation - just not a good enough response for such a breech of trust !
negative	disgusting service , 00 days_later item is not delivered and wont give a refund because " i still used the service "
negative	obviously mistakes_happen in parcel delivery - but it truly shows what a company is like by how the deal with the mistake .
negative	either my hermes is really bad - or quite simply their customer advisors need some good training .
negative	after ordering a pair of expensive headphone from them , less_than 00_minutes later i realised they were the wrong ones , despite the description saying differently .
negative	because of this i requested a cancellation which could not be processed 00_minutes after i ordered .
negative	due to this i had to wait for the product to arrive from france , only to refuse it and send it back - a waste of everyones time .
negative	in the middle of all this , i was trying to tell them that this product wasn ' t described properly and that they should change it .
negative	each reply was a half - assed attempt and each time they told me i was wrong and that it was correctly listed .
negative	after 0 or 0 e_- mails they eventually accepted that the description was wrong and gave me a poor_excuse for an_apology .
negative	to this day , the headphone are still listed incorrectly .
negative	do not buy from pixmania .
negative	ever >
negative	they stole our money .
negative	we turned_up for our hen_do cocktail_making sessions at sway bar and were told release_travel hadn ' t paid for the session or dinner and that it would cost 000_pounds .
negative	we paid release months before .
negative	of course there was no one answering release_travel " we ' ll be there should have any_problems " emergancy phone line .
negative	the hen was distraught .
negative	have since looked up their credit history they have four ccjs out againest them , and even then they haven ' t paid up .
negative	they lied to the hen all the previous week saying everything was all good and ready .
negative	getting the money back is like getting blood out of a stone .
negative	we got ours back by going down and visiting them in person , when they said the cheque would be ready .
negative	which they had said about 00 times before .
negative	i ordered two pillows on 00 - jan - 0000 .
negative	they said that they need 0 days to deliver them .
negative	today is 00 - jan - 0000 and i didn ' t hear from them .
negative	i called them 0 times and every time they told next week .
negative	currently , nobody answers the phone !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a chair on friday 00 - jan - 0000 .
negative	they called me next_day to inform me that the product is out of stock and that they will receive new stock on monday .
negative	the customer_service agent assured me that i will receive it on tuesday .
negative	i called them on tuesday and they told me that they did not receive new stock yet so i have to wait_until the end of the week or until monday , so apparently they don ' t know when .
negative	this company is out of credibility .
negative	this is not how a respectful companies do business .
negative	p . s : i posted this review on their website but unsurprisingly they did not post it and make it visible to other customers .
negative	they only post 0_stars reviews and this supports the incredibility claim .
negative	i have had issues with dpd before where they have delivered to the wrong_address and just left the package on the doorstep .
negative	i gave them the benefit of the doubt as there are 0 properties with the same house number .
negative	however , on my most_recent delivery , i was very clear about the location .
negative	they still attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
negative	when i tried to call to resolve this , there seemed to be no way to speak to a human .
negative	i used the website to just arrange collection rather_than have another failed delivery .
negative	when i went to the local_depot , there was a small door resembling a fire exit for collections ( at_least the entrance for the staff looked nice !).
negative	i pressed the buzzer no less_than three times with no answer .
negative	eventually , after_speaking to someone at the staff entrance , they finally let me in .
negative	all in all , i think it ' s a terrible service .
negative	bad customer_services , useless don ' t know what each other are doing !
negative	been sent goods that were obviously ' seconds '
negative	account often wrong and still now having problems with them trying to charge me money i don ' t owe !!!
negative	all in all avoid very !
negative	awful tried to charge me over £_00 for ' not paying on time ' when i had infact paid over a week early .
negative	awful customer_service , rude and arrogant .
negative	goods terrible quality please avoid .
negative	false economy using studio !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered an ipod fm transmitter on 00th_july_0000 .
negative	after no sight nor sound for a week i emailed them and got the typical automated_response .
negative	i emailed again , same response .
negative	i read the reviews and decided i was going to lose out one way or another so i bombarded them with an_email every three hours or so in large text and started then on the complaints @ datakits . co . uk .
negative	they have not replied but my item has now been dispatched ... despite telling them i want a refund .
negative	lets_see what turns up first ... my item or those flying pigs i ordered off amazon where i should have gone in the first place .
negative	the results i got was only basic tense and punctuation corrections .
negative	in addition , i asked my girlfriend to check the proofread document and she was able still to identify grammar errors .
negative	i think the results of the service are no better_than the ms word spell checker .
negative	i am also a bit_sceptical how the company has such a high average in feedback .
negative	where do i begin ?
negative	always check your receipts !
negative	on one of these shops , 0 / 0 of the products i ordered were unavailable , on other shops huge amounts were unavailable .
negative	regular promotion mistakes - always in tesco ' s favour , never customers .
negative	overcharged something , 00_% of the time , i ' d say .
negative	deliveries made outside of a 0 hour time_slot 0 out of 0 times .
negative	one of these being over an_hour later than the end time of the slot with no call or notification .
negative	cheated on promotional points
negative	0 / 0 shops was short changed on points
negative	promotion invalidated because tesco couldn ' t deliver goods advertised ( 0 weeks in a row )
negative	check your reciepts with care !!
negative	!
negative	flight times changed , not informed missed flight , whole holiday ruined .
negative	no response to complaint email even after there stated 00 day responce time .
negative	no contact telephone_number for customer_services listed and when you do call asking for legal department , management or cheif executives office you get nothing only someone will be in touch and a point_blank refusal to help !
negative	book with someone_else evasive nasty and slippery i won ' t be back not to be trusted !
negative	been plagued by text_messages confirming delivery slot and date on 0 seperate deliverys .
negative	once item was late and missed time_slot by 0 hours and on 0 occasions arrived the day after stated delivery date !
negative	ii ' d give them a miss !
negative	the company is awful , good luck to anyone returning faulty_goods because the return_policy is not worth the paper its written on .
negative	i will not touch them with barge poll after my experience .
negative	better off spending money elsewhere with a more reputable company that offers a decent returns / exchanges and doesn ' t charge you a fortune .
negative	they are not competitive with some smaller products being up to 0 x the price of other_retailers like ebuyer or scan .
negative	the community forums are just full of very rude and patronising , egotistical , arrogant ( insert explicit word ) people .
negative	i was a member there before all my troubles started i am now leaving this place well alone .
negative	i ordered a microwave one saturday and it was delivered the next_day , which was fantastic .
negative	unfortunately it did not work .
negative	i phoned and emailed many_times .
negative	the unit was eventually collected 00 days after delivery and the refund was done 00 days after delivery .
negative	i think that ' s appauling customer_service .
negative	ethan in particular needs re - educating in customer_service .
negative	i recently_bought 0 season of friends and 0 season of lost on dvd from here - never again .
negative	in each boxset , there was one disc which was for a different season of the same show .
negative	one of my series 0 friends discs was actually for season 0 .
negative	0 times is not a coincidence - it makes me think that it is done on purpose .
negative	i would rather pay an extra few pounds from a different shop , because at_least the discs will be correct .
negative	dear_sir / madam ,
negative	my order had been confirmed and money taken out of my account in full . i was due my order between 0 - 0 pm on the 0th_may .
negative	by 0 . 00 i phoned customer_services to be told she would ring the driver ( whils i was on hold ) to which there was no answer from driver .
negative	she informed me she would keep trying the driver and get back too me ( which i heard_nothing back .!
negative	) as it got to 0pm i was worried , our shopping was not going to arrive . we are on benefits , and therfore have no spare money what so ever .
negative	i had no food it except bread and so had to sent my daughters 0 and 00 too bed with 0 slices of toast , in which i felt awful ( that was there tea ) . this was so upsetting , not having food which you have rightly paid for .
negative	its now 0pm so i ring back . com , to be told the driver had now gone home ( i was told it was stange as there was no accident or breakdown recorded ) which would have been easier to accept then just not bothering . he then apparently arrived back in store a little later with our shopping .
negative	i then asked to speak to a manager at which i was told he would give £_00 worth of e_- vouchers to take off this order we were due , as he had put the order through once again of his system between 0 - 00am the following_morning .
negative	i was told to go back through my orders on . com and to apply my e_- vouchers so the balance outstanding would therefore be £_00 . 00 .
negative	this i then did to no_avail as my bank_account was now empty as tesco . com had taken the money allready so thefore could not confirm order to reduce balance . as i stated i had no spare money !. i then phoned . com back ( which is also costing me .)
negative	to be told that because my account was now empty this wouldnt be possible .
negative	so now i am back too square0 .
negative	as i will never shop with . com again after this disaster , i did not want the e_- vouchers taking off my next shop , i wanted the money off the shop that was due !
negative	i was told the driver had said he knocked at our door and there was no answer , which is a lie as we firstly have a camera too prove he never came to the door and so do our neighbours .
negative	( which is 000_% proof this member off staff is a liar ) my daughter husband and mother was in the house all day with myself .
negative	we aggreed with sarah ( manager ) to go into store in blackpool as this is where our shopping is , to collect , and speak too mike norbury ( manager ). so i had too put my mother out to take us all the way down ther too sort it ( also costing in petrol !)
negative	we arrived at the store at 00pm , after taking daughter too doctors .
negative	we asked for mike norbury too which he came too see us .
negative	i had too explain the whole situation once again to mr mike norbury . he kept telling us to just take our shopping and use the e_- vouchers off our next shop as there was nothing else he could do .
negative	i had already told him we will never shop with them again so to refund me the money into bank , too which he said he couldnt do from store ?
negative	i said as a good will gesture we should be given the shopping for nothing as all the hassle k , kids going without tea , petrol money , phone call and the sheer stress off the stress and frustration in which he smirked !!
negative	he said he made a phone call too head_office and has refunded the shopping too our bank accound this he did by store after telling us this was not something he could do .
negative	this i was told will take 0 - 0 days too show in bank .
negative	( i just hope it arrives )...
negative	this was then fine i said and made my way to husband where he and a member off teso staff were putting in the back of my mums car .
negative	my husband then went too find my mum instore as she had got bored off sitting in car , as it was all taking ages ..
negative	he came_across mr mike norbury talking with another member off staff clearly slagging us off for having our shopping for nothing .
negative	he was going too approach mr mike norbury in store , but i adviced too come away and complain to head_office .
negative	i then got home to unpack my shopping to be disapointed once again these are the reasons_why ?.
negative	0 . coleslaw all over one of the bags ,
negative	0 .
negative	0 lettuces with yesterdays date on them , ( the date we orriginally ordered )
negative	0 . missing cheese ,
negative	0 . squashed bread ,
negative	0 . steak that had so much fat through it i feel it was only fit for my dog ,
negative	i am greatly disapointed and un neverd as to how this is possible from a massive store as yorselves .
negative	i want this sorting asap ...
negative	mr and mrs preston
negative	it took me ages to try to get the lense in my eye properly because it was so flimsy .
negative	it ended_up tearing rendering the lense useless .
negative	disgusted by the product .
negative	i recently opened an account with next and was really disappointed .
negative	i ordered some cultery £_00 + ( inc delivery ) and they looked like i got the from poundland .
negative	the cheeeeeeapest plastic decor you could imagine on cheap plastic handles .
negative	i had to send them back asap and of course i had to pay for the return as well .
negative	now the only thing that i ' ll order from them is flowers !!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered a camcorder and a freeview box online , then had a littlewoods rep trying to convince me that i could pay next year for item .
negative	i explained that i hadn ' t recieved the item yet and then the rep tells_me that not only did i get the camcorder 0 weeks_ago i signed for it !!!!
negative	as advised i checked the garden shed whilst on the phone and found it soaking_wet ( was suppose to be signature needed and no card was left at my door ).
negative	i have since returned it as not confident that it would be working properly in the near_future and i had missed the event it was ordered for .
negative	( when i asked the rep about the freeview box she said it was out of stock ).
negative	i am far from happy with littlewoods way of handling this fraudulet event .
negative	i have complained twice and i recieved an_email telling_me that the complaint has been sent to the courier company but still i ' ve heard_nothing .
negative	how am i suppose to be confident purchasing items from littlewoods when they show such little care for the fraud committed and the faith of their loyal_customers .
negative	shocking !!!!!
negative	!
negative	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
negative	then to add more embarrassment the roses were past the fully opened stage .
negative	i ' ve never been so publicly embarrassed in all my life .
negative	also no telephone service so you can not call them , i sent a complaint via_email and received template email with a promise to contact me asap .
negative	but i ' ve heard_nothing .
negative	don ' t use this company they have no care nor respect for their customers .
negative	**_update **
negative	0th_february_0000
negative	so iflorist said they would send my sister some flowers and guess_what ?
negative	it didn ' t happen !!!
negative	this company is ridiculously unprofessional .
negative	i emailed iflorist reminding them that the flowers had to be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
negative	the reply stated that the driver would be contacted and then i ' d be emailed back .
negative	this did not happen either .
negative	the service is shockingly disgusting .
negative	i just want my money back and i have insisted on this from iflorist .
negative	let ' s see how long it is to take for this refund .
negative	once again in case you have forgotten my advice in the first complaint : do not use this company !!
negative	!
negative	have never been spoken so rude on the phone in my entire life by a customer_service adviser as the ryan_air staff !!!
negative	no manners !
negative	! charge you for everything on their rubbish website and do not treat their customers with any respect .
negative	awful !!!
negative	!
negative	i was very disappointed with rentalcars .
negative	they are only after your money , don ' t care about the clients .
negative	any problem you have they don ' t try to sort it .
negative	i paid for a car that i never used .
negative	when i rang and ask for a refund they said its not possible and that ' s it .
negative	dont rent with rentalcars !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	this company is horrific .
negative	the staff are horrible and don ' t give a damn about you .
negative	i have bought there frequently over the few_years but recently due to new staff i will not be returning .
negative	the staff are unhelpful , lazy , you ask them a question they sigh .
negative	you ring them up to ask about an order they sigh down the phone and act like they don ' t care .
negative	the pricing / website is also a joke .
negative	i went into the store two days ago and spoke to a staff_member , we ordered myself a motherboard which is stated on the website as well as the manufacturing code - asus m0a00l - m lx v0 .
negative	when he printed out the collection receipt it said asus m0a00l - m lx which is obviously incorrect .
negative	( the v0 / revision 0 supports my 000w cpu unlike the original only supporting 00w ).
negative	i then asked him to change it and make_sure i get the v0 version .
negative	he said okay , reprinted , we left .
negative	when i arrived to pick it up the next_day guess_what i received ?
negative	asus m0a00l - m lx .
negative	so i complained to him about receiving the wrong one , and guess_what he says to me ?
negative	' no this is the right one , it is the v0 version .
negative	you need to research your stuff before you buy it '.
negative	my god .
negative	i got so angry .
negative	the fact that he said a customer is wrong is just plain stupid .
negative	it clearly_states on their website , their manufacturing code and their own staff that i ordered a v0 .
negative	so i just couldn ' t be bothered , got a full_refund and bought it off amazon .
negative	the funny thing is the original price i bought it for was £_00 right , i checked before i drove to the store , as i left the store i checked again to compare it ' s price to the one off amazon .
negative	guess how much it is now ?
negative	£_00 .
negative	they upped the price just as i left the store .
negative	maybe this isn ' t a big deal to people but my advice is to stay_away from them .
negative	they are conniving , horrible people .
negative	i would happily pay £_00 + elsewhere for the same item .
negative	cclonline will be informed about this review haha .
negative	this is for the staff - i work security at hotels / bars etc .
negative	i carry around a pin camera on my jacket button incase there is any trouble .
negative	everything i have said in this review about the sighing and lazyness is all on tape .
negative	obviously the phone one is only a voice recording but have fun guys .
negative	i will be returning on the 00th which is my day off to complain to your manager and if he is unwilling to do something about this i will happily contact the corporate line to complain with proof .
negative	have a nice day .
negative	i ordered my bath 0 weeks_ago , 0 bath was delivered into the local_store and they found it was faulty , the 0nd bath was delivered to my house 0 weeks_later and was damaged .
negative	my tub have been good at communicating but not with offering any confirmation as to when the new bath will be delivered .
negative	instead i was asked what i expected from buying such a cheap bath !
negative	i eventually rang the director steve marshall and he was very rude .
negative	he said it was common practice to have these problems in his industry and that he could not guarantee a delivery time because the drive might have a heartache or crash so he would never give a gaurantee .
negative	i would strongly_suggest you ignore the cheap prices and pay £_00 more fomr a reputable company .
negative	update_: to clarify following laurie ' s comments i have not yet had a refund as he stated .
negative	however they have not collected the goods yet ... not sure why he would say they have refunded me yet ...
negative	i ordered a motherboard from them was damaged on arrival , requested rma they refused to fix it as it was after 00_hours ( i was away from home ) and to this day 0 weeks_later they still have my motherboard and refuse to answer any emails for me to request it back .
negative	will not use again !
negative	my iphone was coming with yodel .
negative	i stayed in all day waiting and when tracked online that night they stated they had been to deliver at 0pm and nobody answered so they left a card .
negative	i had no card and also have cctv on our apartments .... yet no one except for the postman that morning had attempted delivery .
negative	rang customer_service and they rearranged delivery for the saturday_morning ... still no delivery .
negative	upon calling customer_services couldn ' t get through .
negative	finally got through monday_morning and kept getting passed through departments and drivers .
negative	got home from work on tuesday and the package had been dropped that morning with a neighbour - hardly safe for an iphone when they don ' t know if we get on with our neighbours ...
negative	worst delivery experience i ' ve ever had !!
negative	!
negative	my declared dimensions were correct for the entire package .
negative	i can prove that my dimensions were correct for this shipment .
negative	as i said in my last e mail to your customer_services i have photographic_evidence .
negative	where is yours ?
negative	ordered something for christmas .
negative	haven ' t seen any updates to tracking whatsoever , but they claim it will be delivered for the 00th .
negative	tried to contact them about it , receiving no response other than automated_messages .
negative	left a message on their fb_page , they said to send them a private message , which i did , and then received no response .
negative	seems like they just took my money and have no_intention of shipping anything .
negative	good thing i ordered with paypal .
negative	will never be shopping here again , and warning all my friends against them .
negative	my boyfriend ordered flowers on the 00th to arrive on the 00th_february as a surprise for me and considering the fact the office is normally open from 0 . 00am to 0 . 00pm , you would think the flowers would be delivered within that time .
negative	in fact the flowers didn ' t arrive by the time i left at 0 . 00pm resulting in my boyfriend having to leave work early , rush to the shops to spend another £_00 on roses , chocolates and a vase so i wouldn ' t be left without anything .
negative	the flowers turned_up at the office at 0pm and it was only by pure luck someone was still in my office to sign for them , but considering i ' m on holiday now till the 00th of february (!!!!
negative	), i find it astonishing that my boyfriend was told all he would get refunded was the delivery charge of about £ 0 . 00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	yes , someone in the office signed for them , but it was delivered after i left and the colleague , who signed for the order , didn ' t know i ' m on holiday with the 00th_february otherwise she would have straight_away rejected the order .
negative	you would think it ' s not unreasonable to deliver flowers to an office address within normal working hours , not after 0 . 00pm .
negative	my poor boyfriend spent considerable time and money yesterday not being_able to get through to iflorist and eventually spending more money buying me new flowers .
negative	i won ' t be able to enjoy these flowers as they will be dead by the time i return to the office and to top everything off , my colleague ( who i asked to open the box this morning ) has emailed me to tell me the flowers are of poor quality and already started to wilt !
negative	my boyfriend was told that as the delivery arrived on the day requested , he would only get a refund of the delivery charge ( i don ' t agree with iflorist that delivery at 0pm to an office address when the office normally shuts at 0 . 00pm counts at successful delivery as it was rather luck that anyone was still in the office , never mind i , the recipient , didn ' t even get the iflorist flowers and won ' t get to enjoy them till the 00th of february when they are completely dead ).
negative	my boyfriend spent about 00 £ on the iflorist delivery , which i can ' t enjoy and went all the way out to spent more money to ensure i wouldn ' t be left completely disapppointed on our first valentine ' s day together .
negative	to only refund the delivery charge in light of what happened is despicable .
negative	i would strongly_advise people not to order from this company !
negative	my boyfriend deserves more_than the refund of £ 0 . 00 for the inconvenience , quality of the roses and service provided .
negative	please arrange for adequate compensation .
negative	been in all day .
negative	saying my item was delivered at 00 : 00 .
negative	it wasn ' t and still_hasn ' t been .
negative	don ' t use yodel if you live in exeter
negative	never bother using them .
negative	the slightest mistake cannot be rectified without costing you more_than half what you paid .
negative	do anything_else but use this pathetic_excuse for a company .
negative	the staff were polite , but the best staff in the world can ' t save you from being chewed up and spat out by horrible business_practices .
negative	0 star is too nice !
negative	needs no star
negative	we booked a flight for the 00th of february , however the confirmation that came through was the 00th !
negative	when i called to speak to them , they advised me that it is impossible to change dates as computer confirms automatically !
negative	i called back and another person said they will raise it with another team as they can see there seems to be an issue !
negative	i called again and they said nothing can be done unless i pay £_00 to make changes !!!!
negative	any way long_story short , from what was supposed to save me money has become really expensive so we are now not going and ruined our valentine weekend !
negative	thanks bravofly !!
negative	useless !
negative	do not use !!!!!
negative	should be shut_down !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	!
negative	well what can be said about alpharooms …..
negative	fairly cheap ?
negative	well yes .
negative	but at the same time uncommunicable could also be said and '; you get what you pay for '.
negative	mainly just one thing should be said in particular do not under any circumstance book with them !
negative	i have never ever_dealt_with a more unprofessional company … don ' t ruin your holiday for the sake of a few pounds off .
negative	it ' s honestly not worth it .
negative	i made that mistake … twice .
negative	neively originally booking a cheap trip to ibiza in 0000 where alpharooms placed us in a room with two single beds ( after requesting a double ).
negative	on our return i complained and received a 00_%_discount .
negative	so seeing an opportunity for a cheaper trip i decided to use it on a trip to new_york with a transfer at reykjavic from london .
negative	big_mistake .
negative	not only did it take more_than several phone_calls and emails to alpharooms to actually establish our travelling vouchers and baggage_allowance ( we were told two bags for the hold and then just one , then two again ..) encountering a range of ' customer sales representatives ( 0 out of 0 were english ), the rest were foreign who could barely understand , nor speak_english fluently themselves ( great idea for customer_service placements ).
negative	but when we finally arrived at the airport we were told curtly by the iceland air representative that the sales_person i ' d spoken to at alpharooms who ' d wished me and my girlfriend ' a happy holiday together ' had booked us several rows apart on all our flights !
negative	he politely did his best to rectify this and booked us together on our main flight at the back of the plane to new_york from iceland - but for our 0 hour flight to iceland from london we were sat over 0 rows away .
negative	my girlfriend was hugely distressed , especially as it was her_birthday too .
negative	it was simply awful .
negative	on our arrival in america i emailed and complained to alpharooms .
negative	i received a curt reply saying they had ensured we were now seating with each other again on the journey back ( so admitting they had booked us apart ) but even more amazingly then then blamed me saying it was something they couldn ' t guarantee and that it wasn ' t their fault !
negative	simply unbelievable
negative	needless to say i came back and emailed them .
negative	its taken a further 0 emails to finally get to a senior customer sales representative .
negative	they ' ve all rudely passed responsibility away from themselves .
negative	so i ' m not seeking_legal_action_against them .
negative	what kind of travel company decides to book a party of two several rows apart on a flight , after you ' ve stated you ' re travelling together .….
negative	clearly not a proper one .
negative	but operates by filling planes like buses with no thoughts to the customer .
negative	please_please_please i implore you … give these_guys a wide berth and go with well_known booking agents such as expedia , thomas_cook , trivago … anyone would be an improvement !
negative	they ended_up pretty_much ruining two holidays , don ' t make the same mistake we did !
negative	_______________________________________________________________
negative	my reply > to alpharooms reply below
negative	as you ' ll see alpharooms has since responded to this email in much the templated way that they contacted me when i raised these issues with them .
negative	they ' ve done this on several review sites .
negative	so for fear of any mistruths i ' ll simply state my reply here
negative	___________________________________________________________
negative	the simple matter of the fact is alpharooms , i did state we were travelling together , several_times .
negative	so the fact you have the audacity to blame me for not specifying this ( when i did and your staff_member said ' oh that sounds nice ' before seeing fit to sit us several rows apart ) is sheer madness .
negative	as i ' ve already stated i ' ve started legal support for this matter and i will be getting my money back .
negative	along the way also ensuring that any other potential_customers don ' t have to suffer in the way that i did with such a company as yours .
negative	they dont even deserve one star !!
negative	this company are ripping people off !
negative	they have done this to many people judging_by the reviews .
negative	sadly , i did not read these before i sent my perfectly good iphone .
negative	they quoted me £_00 and offered me £_00 !
negative	they then sent me an_email knowing i was displeased with this and so offered me £_00 .
negative	frustratingly , they have credited my bank_account with £_00 !!!!!
negative	i asked for the phone back many_times but they are charging me ten_pounds .
negative	i am_currently in a dispute with them and am seeking further advice as they are clearly a bad company out to commit daylight_robbery !
negative	avoid at all costs !!!!!
negative	!
negative	con no : zdbysw000000
negative	i ordered a large_amount of furniture from home discount website .
negative	i received an_email from them on the 00st oct just at 00 : 00 saying they ' ve dispatched my goods , but it didn ' t mention which courier .
negative	on the 00nd , i contact home discount at 00 : 00 to try and find out the courier and they came back quickly saying it was xdp and gave me a consignment_number which i looked up .
negative	on the tracking_information , it said : 00 oct 0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 00 :_00am to 0 :_00pm .
negative	so i had to rush home from work , taking a taxi to get back in time , which cost me £ 0 and greatly irritating my boss .
negative	getting home at 00 : 00 , i breathe a sigh of relief as the tracking_info stays the same , there ' s no card , so i sit_down to wait .
negative	this was bad service because the company had not bothered to contact me to let me know they were even delivering on this day .
negative	so i sit .
negative	and i wait .
negative	00 : 00 goes by .
negative	0 : 00 goes by - i am ringing to find out the problem but the phone is engaged .
negative	engaged .
negative	how on earth is not a proper phone system to taken calls ?
negative	i am literally just ringing a landline .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	the girlfriend gets back at 0 : 00 so i taxi back to work for the afternoon ( another £ 0 ).
negative	i continue calling and finally get someone at around 00 : 00 .
negative	he tells_me that ' there has been ' an incident ' in portsmouth ', so the van driver has decided to do his round backwards and to disregard the eta information .
negative	that the delivery will be delivered by 0pm without_fail .
negative	so from 0 : 00 onwards , with no delivery , i am watching that tracking_information like a hawk .
negative	refreshing the window every 0 seconds .
negative	at 0 : 00 , up comes the status 00 oct 0000 00 :_00pm all barcodes 000 exception carded .
negative	i am running down the single flight of stairs to the front_door of my block of flats so fast it freaks my girlfriend out .
negative	there is no card .
negative	there is no delivery van .
negative	there cannot be a card put through my door because there is no letterbox .
negative	the delivery van has not visited my road because it is a no - through road which takes about 0 minutes of cautious reversing to get a taxi out , nevermind a delivery van .
negative	so i ring the depot , there ' s no answer .
negative	i leave a message explaining the issue .
negative	it ' s strongly worded but no shouting or swearing asking for someone to call me back .
negative	it ' s now 0 :_00am on the 00rd oct and no - one has bothered to call me .
negative	so yesterday , i was not contacted to be advised a delivery was taking place , the driver apparently decided to change his route and therefore failed to deliver it , and subsequently recorded a false entry in the database .
negative	i am £_00 down , my boss is annoyed at me , my girlfriend has had to wait in all afternoon yesterday and again all day today , and i have not had a single communication from this company .
negative	terrible , terrible service .
negative	by contrast , dpd have been keeping me appraised of another delivery of audio_equipment i ordered through amazon , just like they always do , and should be arriving today between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , and i am sure they will - they usually call me 00_minutes before they are popping round .
negative	currently , my consignment has this status 00 oct 0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 0 :_00pm to 0 :_00pm .
negative	i have absolutely no confidence this will arrive and my girlfriend has resigned herself to waiting in all day because we cannot trust this company .
negative	do not ever use this company .
negative	it is terrible .
negative	customer_service is as bad as none existant , i paid an extra £ 0 to get it delivered in 0 - 0 business days , it has been 00 days and still not come !
negative	brilliant !
negative	ordered headphones paid extra for next_day delivery three days on still_waiting .
negative	they now say they have took the money but wont despatch the item as there is a discrepancy with my address .
negative	what a load of rubbish .
negative	cant find a number to call them .
negative	so they have took my money but wont send goods .
negative	please dont order from this company
negative	i tried signing_up for talk_talk home phone and broadband and got booted off the line 0 times .
negative	i gave up .
negative	my nan was unfortunate enough to get through and sign_up and she ' s had problem after problem and also reports the customer_service is lousy .
negative	they may claim to be cheap but i would recommend anyone to ...
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	sound went on my htc_desire , called htc and they didn ' t want to know .
negative	i went and got an iphone 0 and now have the 0s and no issues .
negative	not impressed !
negative	being a perfectionist it took me long time to find the right pair of glasses and at first_glance i thought direct sight was a dream_come true .
negative	the price was reasonable , the ratings were high and they were my dream pair .
negative	i ordered them as soon as i could .
negative	yet some how the whole_thing turned into a nightmare .
negative	first they were a month had gone by still with no glasses , i ' d called them countless on times being given the same false hope of arrival every time .
negative	in addition my optician had told me that my eyes were deteriorating and that the longer i spent without them the worse they would get .
negative	when i asked for compensation they refused and wouldn ' t connect me to any sort of supervisor .
negative	i proceeded to wait patiently .
negative	the next week i rang up furiously , screaming down the phone asking " where are my glasses ", they cancelled my order without permission and that was the end
negative	they regularly don ' t turn_up for collections or delivery and claim some useless excuse like ' there was nowhere to park ' or ' there was no response '.
negative	they would have to actually attempt delivery in order to realise the fact that there is an almost permanently empty parking space on my drive and the road is wide enough with no markings to pull up for a prolonged period .
negative	on top of this , my workplace is on a business park with enough space to pull up , let_alone park , for an entire football team .
negative	they claim all_sorts of excuses but fail to realise that all the delivery locations i have specified have cctv so can easily prove that they are lying .
negative	it is only because of the suppliers that these issues have been sorted .
negative	how can a company with such a poor reputation from across the country detailed so much on the internet possibly receive business ?
negative	cost .
negative	pay peanuts ...
negative	i can however say one thing , they are consistent , but it is consistently useless .
negative	i ordered some ray - bans on the 00st of july_0000 with the promise of there 0 - 00 days delivery by the 00st of august i still had not received the glasses !
negative	i first contacted them around the 0th of august wanting answers as to when my glasses would be delivered i received no reassurance all i got was something completely_different that didn ' t answer any_questions !
negative	they couldn ' t even guarantee that my glasses would even turn_up !
negative	they should at_least state that all orders are drop shipped !
negative	so i promise you this smartbuy sunglasses ( not very smart at all ) you haven ' t heard the last of me !
negative	i will be taking this further !
negative	i have only recently received the refund which seemed doubtful at the time !
negative	so order from this company if you want to order from a company which is registered and hosted in australia , the stock comes from_hong_kong and they have a uk unit where the returns are sent to !
negative	who don ' t even have a contact number just a pre_- recorded_message which just irritates me even more !
negative	poor_excuse for a business !
negative	bad practice and even worse customer_service !
negative	i went and bought the sunglasses from a opticians that sell them !
negative	and i sugest others do the same for the sake of £_00 it isn ' t worth the risk !
negative	they are criminals , charging £_000 for cancelation .
negative	but that ' s nothing compared to customer_service i have received .
negative	not helpful and patronising .
negative	i have got agreement with manager to get the charge smaller , week_later nobody knows about the agreement ( apparently also person who introduced himself as manager was not a manager ).
negative	after loosing calm tone , reciving agreed lower cancellation charge was conditioned ( blackmailed ) only if i send written apology !!
negative	!
negative	joke , joke !
negative	!
negative	they have routinely left very expensive parcels on my door_step .
negative	have left parcels with neighbours but not put the correct information on the note , and on on occasions when a parcel was left apparently left on the door_step , but wasn ' t there when i got home , they had no record of who the parcel had been sent by on their system .
negative	if you are a retailer please have more respect for your customers than to use this service .
negative	we ordered tickets 0 months_ago for justin_bieber and the concert is tomorrow and we still don ' t have our tickets !
negative	we can ' t get inn touch with anyone and when we phoned fedex they said they don ' t have a package with our tickets to send out to us .
negative	worst of all these were tickets that ' had to be replaced with our original tickets which were fake .
negative	transaction_id_0000000
negative	if you want to buy a buggy that ' s not fit for purpose then be my guest my daughter is only 0 months and my buggy is currently back with them for the third time having collapsed with my daughter in it and i repeat for the third time !
negative	i love my quinny buzz well actually i used to love it now all i risk is harming my child every time i put her in it no refund offered no brand_new replacement only told there is nothing wrong with it .
negative	why i would send my buggy off three times for apparently nothing is beyond me !
negative	i ordered a bunch of 00 roses to be delivered on valentines_day for the missus .
negative	price was competitive not amazingly cheap , they arrived on time on valentines_day in a large box .
negative	the missus opened the box to find 00 roses , 0 of which were broken and one which didn ' t have a head and nor was the head in the box meaning that the rose must have been headless when they put them in there !
negative	i complained and was assured that this is not the usual quality of their products , they sent out a new set .
negative	when we received the new set we again only received 00 roses which all looked like the cheapest battered roses money could buy .
negative	another complaint and 0 weeks_later i am still_waiting for my money .
negative	my advice - don ' t use them at all costs more hassle than its worth , get friendly with a local_florist same - day delivery and two_weeks_later the flowers still look amazing all for only £ 0 dearer than iflorist !
negative	i ordered with this company for the first time and was told that my items would be received by 00 december at the latest .
negative	they never arrived and i contacted asos who intially did nothing .
negative	then i got an e_- mail saying my order had been returned to them and queried why i hadn ' t completed the returns slip !
negative	i was then told that my order would be cancelled and if i wanted the items i had to re - order them but they are now out of stock .
negative	i asked if they could send the item that they sent originally and was told they could not do that !
negative	the item was a christmas_present ( which i made them aware of ) and now i have to find an_alternative at the last_minute .
negative	the support and system is really crap , they limit legal businesses as well and should avoid at all costs
negative	i ordered a parcel and sighed when i got the email_saying it had been dispatched with yodel .... knowing full well how awful they are !
negative	this time i waiting in all day on the day the tracking_information said it was out for delivery - nothing .
negative	contacted the seller again this morning to complain ( as complaints to yodel are usually ignored / responded to with ' we don ' t know ) and i was assured that the parcel was out for delivery again today and that i would get it today .
negative	around lunchtime i rechecked the tracking_information .
negative	the parcel was apparently delivered to me last_night at 00pm ( even_though yodel only deliver until 0pm ) and i had apparently signed for it !
negative	even_though i was fast asleep in bed by this time .
negative	i can only assume that yodel forged my signature ( so they ' re fraudulent as well as unreliable ) and stole the parcel for themselves ....... absolutely_useless !
negative	i was given a hour hour delivery slot - great - i thought !
negative	half an_hour after that delivery slot ended i rechecked the tracking_information to find that they had apparently attempted delivery but no one was home !
negative	i had been home all day !
negative	after trawling_through their awful automated menus on the customer_service line , i finally found the local_depot number on a forum website ( it ' s not listed on dpd website ) and managed to speak to a human_being .
negative	the man at the depot contacted the driver who said he attempted delivery and was here for 00_minutes and left a calling_card - ( i have a locked mailbox and it wasnt there !)
negative	so i can only assume they just couldn ' t be bothered to deliver ..... i ' m wasting another day waiting in tomorrow for the ' redelivery ( i . e .
negative	first attempt in my view ) so we shall see ....
negative	it was all straightforward until they emailed me and said they ' d found a fault with my phone .
negative	it worked_perfectly well and i only wanted to sell it as i ' d upgraded and need some extra cash to put towards my holiday .
negative	i now don ' t have the box as i didn ' t need to send it with the phone .
negative	so i ' ll get less selling privately .
negative	not at all happy .
negative	will be using mazuma next time ...
negative	also received an_email after i ' d sent the phone saying they hadn ' t received it ( rude , give me a chance i work full time )
negative	not impressed !
negative	paid for an early morning delivery of an item .
negative	been sat in all day waiting and still no delivery at 0 . 00pm .
negative	i have been calling the company all day , and ran up a rather big mobile bill in the process as i was just left on hold , with no sign of anybody answering .
negative	i have emailed them several_times , and no response to the emails either .
negative	the website has a tracking facility which at present is telling_me that my item hasn ' t left the depot yet , but is also saying that my delivery was signed for at 0am this morning .
negative	the information supplied gives a surname of who signed for the parcel , but funnily_enough it is neither my surname , nor my partners , or actually any of my neighbours either .
negative	no card has been left to say it was signed for by somebody_else .
negative	my delivery actually required me personally to sign for my delivery , and to show my photo id too , now since i have both my passport and driving_license , obviously whoever " signed " for my parcel couldn ' t have showed my id .
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted by this company , and would seriously recommend that people steer_clear of them .
negative	if you order something online and know that this company will be the courier , i urge you do not place the order !
negative	!
negative	i am now out of pocket because of losing a days pay waiting around for them , i have run up a huge bill trying to get hold of them , and i ' ve lost the item i should have received .
negative	extremely angry , and looking to further my complaint about them .
negative	i sent my iphone_0s to them yesterday .
negative	i went on to my account today to find they ' d knocke the price down by £_000 because the phone " tested faulty ".
negative	there is a tiny cosmetic mark on the front and when i rang customer_services i was told that this classes the phone as faulty .
negative	the advisor told me that they sell the phone on so they can ' t accept cosmetic damages !
negative	i ' m absolutely_disgusted that because of a tiny little mark they won ' t pay the price that the phone is worth !
negative	the fact is , it costs £_00 to make the repair to fix the cosmetic_damage so they ' re expecting to make a huge profit out of taking_advantage of my " naivety ".
negative	well i ' m not giving them that satisfaction .
negative	i ' ve requested the phone back and i will sell it on myself for what the phone is actually worth .
negative	rip_off_merchants , avoid at all costs !!!!
negative	!
negative	bad communication
negative	slow delivery
negative	average value
negative	wish i could give a good rating but sadly , in this case , i can ' t .
negative	overall a very bad customer experience .
negative	been waiting for my delivery for over a week now .
neutral	thanks beautybay and sorry for the negative_feedback .
neutral	we ' ve ordered a lot of times through mine and my partners account .
neutral	on 0 separate_occasions the website fell over so despite trying for over 00_minutes each time we gave up and ordered from eat .
neutral	we ' ve also found they add a £ 0 delivery charge on some restaurants , but if you went on the restaurants own website and ordered through there delivery is free for the same order value .
neutral	will keep ordering but remain cautious !
neutral	good range of clothing , and an ok customer_service .
neutral	purchased an acoustic_guitar from dv000 an_hour before the next_day delviery deadline .
neutral	the guitar didnt arrive next_day .
neutral	when i called customer_services they explained that there had been a warehouse issue but it would be shipped and i would receive the following_day .
neutral	guitar arrived the following_day and is great , just wish they had let me know that it hadnt shipped originally so that i didnt sit around waiting for delivery !
neutral	the trophy was poorly made .
neutral	you can tell that they put hardly any effort into the work , for example , the box was completely ripped on the side .
neutral	the star piece on the trophy can be told that you simply just glued it on , this made it look like you didn ' t even make the glass part of the model .
neutral	when they actually glued on the star , it was badly glued because their was a lot of glue coming out of the side .
neutral	it seems really good on the website but in reality , it didn ' t really feel_like a trophy .
neutral	i done a hpi check on my car just incase there was any_issues with the car and to put my mind at ease before folking out £_00 , 000 .
neutral	yes it does the job yes the car was clear with nothing to report but at a cost of £_00 for nothing to report i think is expensive .
neutral	could at_least give you 00_% back if nothing to report on car .
neutral	i bought a washing_machine from appliances_online because john_lewis could not offer recycling and connection services on that particular model and this washer wasn ’ t available anywhere_else .
neutral	what a mistake that was .
neutral	the purchasing process went_smoothly and communication was great – they gave me a delivery date , called and emailed to remind me of it and on gave me a delivery slot on the day , which i thought all was very good .
neutral	up to the moment the delivery men have arrived .
neutral	the old appliance was fully disconnected as requested .
neutral	nothing was ever said about taking appliance out of the kitchen .
neutral	access to the property was easy .
neutral	the delivery people arrive and pretty_much immediately announce that they cannot take away the old appliances because there is not enough room to pull it out of the corner without moving the fridge .
neutral	i am no expert so i believed that and after a couple of minutes of hesitation and regret that i didn ’ t go for john_lewis accepted the new appliance and signed for it .
neutral	my husband arrived in the evening and pulled the old appliance from the corner on his own within two seconds .
neutral	he didn ’ t even apply much effort to do that !
neutral	and he is no body builder .
neutral	to make the matters worse i called the customer_services and asked for a recycling and connection charges refund and to my great annoyance the lady on the phone kept_repeating that what happened was the matter of me not looking into recycling terms and conditions properly .
neutral	i wish she didn ’ t repeat it so often because before this conversation i had no_intention of writing this review .
neutral	i had another look at my emails from the company and terms and conditions and found a warning about access to the property but nothing about awkward kitchen design or about the fact that delivery men were not expected to lift any appliance at any point .
neutral	i hope the machine works because i can imagine what a nightmare it is going to be trying to sort this out .
neutral	extra 00 pounds and you get a 0 year guarantee from john_lewis , this seems a much_better deal to me .
neutral	et utroligt højt kortgebyr ( mastercard ) på 00 kr !
neutral	som jeg_ikke føler at der bliver gjort ordenligt opmærksom på ( og selv fakturaen nævner det kun indirekte ved at lægge gebyret til buketprisen ... så ser det jo nok lidt mindre farligt ud ?).
neutral	desuden er hjemmesiden sådan indrettet at det_er_meget svært at hoppe frem og tilbage i bestillingsprocessen , så_jeg 0 . måtte starte forfra et_par gange ved fejlvalg 0 . på betalingsskærmen ikke kunne gå tilbage for at se hvorfor at prisen med_et var 00 kr højere end jeg_havde regnet med , og derfor blev nød til bare at betale for ikke at skulle starte helt forfra igen .
neutral	desuden er_der 00 prisintervaller fra 000 - 000_kr på div .
neutral	buketter .
neutral	på billedet ser man buketten til ca 000 - 000_kr , så hvis_man vælger en buket til under eller over dette beløb ved man jo reelt ikke hvor meget eller hvad man får for pengene .
neutral	i was intending on booking 0 night in a hostel in a dorm room and then 0 night in a private_room at the same hostel the following night .
neutral	i found this hard to do and couldn ' t really see an easy way of doing this on the website .
neutral	also when i paid for the room i thought i would automatically be signed_up to hostel_bookers website but i wasn ' t i just had made booked and not created an account .
neutral	however - really good variety and other that than it is easy to use .
neutral	great price , great availability but awful service .
neutral	they managed to get product that was out of stock everywhere_else .
neutral	minor niggle is that i only placed the order because the website said it was in stock .
neutral	very frustrating when website says in stock only for an_email to come later saying the product is actually on order .
neutral	however they came through and managed to secure the product which was then delivered quickly .
neutral	all the stores are generally entertaining and fun with a wide_range of media and gadgets .
neutral	the prices are very much average with little deals .
neutral	what puts me off about hmv is the postage sucks always late !
neutral	and the staff rarely help out .
neutral	but over all not to bad .
neutral	** opdatering d . 00 / 00 - 0000
neutral	jeg_er nu blevet kontaktet af henrik fra telenor .
neutral	han lyttede til hvad_jeg_havde at sige , og ankerkendte min frustration .
neutral	i bund og grund løste han min henvendelse på_en måde , der igen får mig_til at tænke , at telenor , trods menneskelige fejl , er_en helt fin virksomhed :-)
neutral	tak for det .
neutral	/ kirstine andersen
neutral	jeg_har siden jeg_købte min nye mobil , og dertilhørende abonnement , udelukkende haft problemer .
neutral	det startede allerede i butikken , hvor jeg får af_vide , at det tilbud jeg ønsker at benytte mig af , ikke længere er gyldigt .
neutral	jeg ender med at købe et andet produkt - men finder 0 dage senere ud_af , at tilbuddet ikke er udløbet , blot ikke tilgængeligt i butikken .
neutral	efter megen diskussion , får_jeg lavet min aftale om .
neutral	i denne proces bliver min opsætning af betalingsservice umiddelbart aflyst , og_jeg overgår til automatisk betaling via dankort .
neutral	denne virker dog kun i 0 mdr ., hvorefter det_er meningen den skal på betalingsservice - det sker dog ikke , og_jeg modtager nu rykkere ( kan jeg se på mit telenor ) - dog ikke med posten .
neutral	det_er derfor først når mit abonnement bliver spærret , og_jeg bliver krævet 0x000 kr .
neutral	gebyr for at få åbnet dette igen , jeg bliver informeret om af betalingsservice ikke fungerer .
neutral	det bliver forklaret for mig , at det_er mit ansvar at snakke med_min bank om dette ?
neutral	de oplyser mig dog at de ikke_kan se et forsøg på tilmelding af betalingsservice fra telenor .
neutral	nu beder jeg om at få fjernet gebyrer på 000_kr .
neutral	for denne fejl - det nægtes .
neutral	da_jeg beder om at tale med_en overordnet , bliver chatten lukket ned af medarbejderen i telenor - jeg når ikke_engang at bede om at få oplyst mine muligheder for at klage over afgørelsen .
neutral	jeg_er så arrig på telenor , og kan slet_ikke vente med at få lov at komme ud_af aftalen og aldrig se mig tilbage .
neutral	i have ordered a few things from this site now and have always been pleased with my purchases .
neutral	the delivery is always quick and it is good value for money .
neutral	this rating would have been a 0 if it wasn ' t for the fact half the things i like sell out quickly .
neutral	there are previews on facebook the day before things go on sale and they go on sale between 00 - 00 the next_day .
neutral	however , if like me you work and are unable to sit on the site at the exact time they go on sale you usually miss out on the best stuff .
neutral	there is no limit to the amount of each item you can buy so bulk buyers buy the best things immediately to sell at a profit .
neutral	this seems to be provided as feedback regularly but nothing is ever done .
neutral	this is the only thing letting this site down .
neutral	watch out for the mandatory full purchase thing - not sure if this a new scheme but we had to pay in_advance for a full_tank of fuel in_advance which was set at the car_rental price ( perhaps 00_% more_than you would pay if you filled up your self ) you are then supposed to return the car empty but seeing as we had an ultra efficient 0 ltr car we barely used half a talk in 0 days so in effect we gifted the car_rental company half a tank of fuel .
neutral	i ' d rather take the car empty and return it empty .
neutral	they could try to reduce the price of their products .
neutral	the same products , with same quality and same standard , i ' ve seen else where sold for even low_prices , e . g .
neutral	such as india and even some european countries .
neutral	i guess they are okay for british market ( as they appear to have lower prices then their rivals ).
neutral	its not so bad , when you , think britain , is known as rip_off , capital of europe .
neutral	may take the opportunity to thank_you , for your kind and generous reminder , to my review .
neutral	i was asked by trustpilot to express my honest_opinions and not to bestow appraisal on anyone in particular .
neutral	i simply expressed general opinion of the state of uk market .
neutral	i would like assure you , that you were not target .
neutral	i would like to thank_you again for time and custom .
neutral	thank_you , best luck with the future .
neutral	well as per title .. its good but for the extra money i don ' t see the difference really .
neutral	rather save money for the same product .
neutral	unfortunately upon_arrival at the airport it was almost 0 hours before our shared shuttle took off .
neutral	this resulted_in a significant delay over the quoted arrival time and the villa owners we were meeting had to wait_until the middle of the night to meet us with the keys .
neutral	further stress was seen when we found we couldn ' t be dropped_off anywhere close to the place we booked the travel to ( i had to get a taxi at additional_cost ), there was plenty time for resorthoppa to get in touch with us on this .
neutral	finally finding out our pickup time proved almost_impossible as it never got put up on the website and after me finally phoning them ( at significant cost to me ) i got it sorted out with them , however the representative was rather snippy .
neutral	next time i would be booking a private shuttle , however i would still use resorthoppa .
neutral	i have been on diet_chef for a while and planning on stopping this due to fact that i have felt ill consistently since been on this .
neutral	yes the food is tasty , yes it is convenient , yes i have lost weight but my warning is , it just isnt possible to stay on it as long as it states .
neutral	the only way i have even felt human most days is to eat a lot of fruit and veg .
neutral	i expected to add some but this is ridiculous .
neutral	im not even that big and im nearly passing out .
neutral	plus i still had to calorie count any way as your snacks are not labeled clearly .
neutral	had to weigh all fruit , veg , measure milk so to be honest i might as well cook my owneals and save my self a fortune .
neutral	if you are the sort of person who_likes fad diets , living off liquids and spending a fortune for the privalidge , try this !
neutral	my one honest tip is , this is not special amazing food , it is stuff you can make a lot tastier and cheaper , it is just smaller portions .
neutral	plus having that many snacks in house at once was just a massive temptation .
neutral	i have ordered several_times from this site and while i can ' t fault the prices , i don ' t like the fact they will buy things as f grade and sell them on as a or b !!!!
neutral	also they maintain they normally send items the same day ... that has never happened to me infact i am_currently waiting for some dvds that have been in the ' stock pickingin progress ' stage for 0 days .
neutral	i didn ' t experience problems like one reviewer thoughwho didn ' t receive accessories with a phone , i did , but here is a company that definitely does lack in a few areas .
neutral	they don ' t really have the same online deals like they have in the shop and they are getting soo tight with some of the contracts
neutral	it ' s good .
neutral	is cheep as a student price .
neutral	it ' s also good that you find the hostel by map search .
neutral	despite much waiting my order arrived oo 00000000 , now how do we hit this request ? grateful , clezio lelis
neutral	the prices are very cheap and affordable but what they lose on their cheap prices they make up in their overpriced shipping charges .
neutral	i shipped a 00 lb bowling ball through ups for under $_00 and yet i have to pay over $_00 in shipping charges for half the weight .
neutral	my first experience with supplement_warehouse did not go as planned as i ordered and paid on 00 / 00 / 00 and it took nearly two_weeks for the package to arrive , to my surprise it was missing items i ordered so i had to call customer_service and complain and it took nearly two more weeks to receive the missing items i originally ordered .
neutral	ordered 00 / 00 / 00 and my order was finally completed 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	almost a month to complete an order is ridiculous .
neutral	next time i order i will be sure to order a month in_advance of actually needing the items so i don ' t run out and am still_waiting on my items .
neutral	generally a good experience , the items all arrived and i paid much less_than if i had bought things at a supermarket .
neutral	the delivery wasn ' t up to scratch however : i ordered on a thursday_evening and expected everything to arrive on the monday as next_day delivery is advertised , however when i called on monday it turned_out that it hadn ' t been sent , i got an_apology but no explanation .
neutral	i got the order on tuesday but had to wait in all day for it , another company i order from uses dpd and is able to give me a one hour delivery slot , dpd offers this service to their customers for free so it would make sense for sushisushi to make use of it and keep their customers happier .
neutral	i was also given no tracking_number with my delivery confirmation_email , simple things can mean the difference_between repeat_custom and looking for better service elsewhere .
neutral	people usually leave reviews when they ' re angry and want to vent .
neutral	in my case , i ' m doing none of those .
neutral	i ' m just here to share my impression .
neutral	i sent a laptop from belfast to a friend in croydon .
neutral	packed it up nicely and securely enough to hopefully make the journey in one piece .
neutral	selected the store to which i wanted it to be sent and popped_into the nearest centra to send it .
neutral	with the £_000 insurance and signature , i paid a few_pence over £_00 .
neutral	given that it was a valuable item , i didn ' t mind .
neutral	however what i did mind and still do , is the lack of information on the website regarding the time - frame related to shop - to - shop deliveries .
neutral	given the high price i was almost certain it would be a 0 day delivery , however there is no way to confirm that .
neutral	ergo , not the best on - line experience .
neutral	continuing on that thought , the tracking is weird .
neutral	things that happen for example at 0 in the morning , showed up in my tracking history after 0 hours ...
neutral	anyhow , parcel got there on thursday which makes this a 0 day delivery in the holiday season and from northern_ireland which is actually better_than royal_mail ' s delivery times ( my 0 day deliveries from amazon show up after 0 days ) at this time of the year .
neutral	the final note comes from my friend and it is regarding the picking_up process .
neutral	it sounds a lot like the service you get from western_union in their shops all around the uk .
neutral	they just don ' t seem to like you bothering them with parcels .
neutral	to use my friend ' s words " they were borderline rude ".
neutral	in any case , laptop is intact , and in working order which makes this delivery a success .
neutral	might use collect_+ again , but i am not necessarily impressed .
neutral	ordered sky phone with fiber internet they arrived to install my internet only to find out my phone did not work one week latta i asked why has my phone still not been fixed was told fault at exchange , then was told o we might cut you off if we like as we have noticed you have a old dept with us witch i don ' t have , so only after 0 weeks with them they did agree to cancel my contract free of charge due to the phone not being repaired witch was nice of them , so not all bad some times can be nice people but this time my time was wasted
neutral	i honestly really like maplin , got some great products and the staff are just ace !
neutral	my only_downside is that certain products are quite overpriced , even for a high_street retailer .
neutral	some of their own branded products are brilliant value for money but a lot of the big brands are very expensive .
neutral	i recently visited the new store opening in middlesbrough ( on the grand opening day as well ) looking for a decent quality multimeter to test electronics .
neutral	the store assistant was very helpful and recommended me a product that was great value for money .
neutral	hey , he even recommended the £_00 one over the £_00 one , i ' ve gained a lot of trust for my local maplin now .
neutral	good service and platform .
neutral	easy to use and would use again .
neutral	very poor response to advert i placed from the platform , however i think has to do with the market for renting in my area rather_than rentify .
neutral	the max events day of activities was great although they decided on the day to not provide any lunch ( a bbq was described on chillisauce .)
neutral	we were told " no bbq today " without any reason_why and with that we spent the rest of the day hungry .
neutral	people who suffer from hypoglycemia need food at regular intervals and a venue that puts people through physical activity for a day with no proper food is irresponsible and asking for trouble .
neutral	we were miles_away from any shops so out of desperation i managed to get a pizza delivered but had to miss some activities to go meet the guy .
neutral	not a fun experience on a hangover !
neutral	booked a hen_weekend in cambridge for my sister and 00 girls .
neutral	great choices to choose from as a very mixed age group and also personalities .
neutral	had a few hitches with the company during the booking stage , i felt_like i was asking too much when all i wanted was a few more invites added .
neutral	i was also told different things by different members of staff .
neutral	when i first booked the gentleman was great and we set_up suitable activities and times .
neutral	but then when the final itinerary came out this was very different .
neutral	this was resolved quickly but i felt as if i was being difficult in what i was requesting .
neutral	although the second activity we changed to i feel was much_better on the actual night it just caused myself as the organiser unnecessary stress .
neutral	i also feel the company need to change the way you pay so people can pay little and often as i found those tight for money struggled with the bulk payments and deadlines .
neutral	so the weekend itself started off great , we managed to book in early to the holiday inn which was great !
neutral	so we all arrived at our first activity which was dirty_dancing , unfortunately the company had told me a different time to what they actually booked .
neutral	i was informed 00 . 00 but the bar was told 00 . 00 .
neutral	this would then effect the rest of the day , but i managed to change our next activity to be half an_hour later .
neutral	no further hitches , dirty_dancing was great and so was cocktail_making !
neutral	so all in all a fab weekend just a shame the organiser had the added stress .
neutral	cjs provide some of the cheapest prices found on the web for games - on that front they get 0_stars .
neutral	the problem is that i pre_- ordered cod : ghosts for pc and got some rather mixed messages .
neutral	the game description says instant delivery of the key - not true .
neutral	when i try to get my key it says it will be delivered 00_hours before_release - not true .
neutral	support say it will be released in time to preload - not true ( unless you have insane (> 00mbps ) broadbnad ).
neutral	facebook says keys will come out at 0000hrs on 0th_nov - not true
neutral	key is finally available at 0000hrs
neutral	the game was cheap but the communication was rubbish - if they had just said upfront that i would get it a few hours before_release i would be happy and have ordered , instead they give the impression before you order you will get it ' instantly ' in reality it was 0 days_later .
neutral	be honest guys and you will have a customer for a long time ( if you keep the prices this great !
neutral	).
neutral	steve
neutral	the network itself has decent coverage , although the 0g_signal is not as good in certain_areas as other_networks .
neutral	i found customer_services were quite unhelpful when experiencing problems tethering on my iphone
neutral	myprotein offers good quality protein at a hugely competitive price - it is a pity that their free delivery catered for by yodel is absolutely_appalling .
neutral	my last four orders have been delivered by this company and even_though the instructions were to leave the box at the reception to my flat complex if i am not in , every_single time the delivery company has just left the boxes outside .
neutral	if it were not for this , myprotein would be getting 0_stars !
neutral	partner ordered a chair for me for my bday 0 weeks in_advance , got told was guna b 0 days then had a phone call saying it was out of stock and b no_longer_than a week ( no_problems , plenty of time to get here for my bday ) actually ended_up being 0 weeks !
neutral	this was after various calls to 0000 numbers which has cost me god_knows in phone_calls .
neutral	technically - very good company !
neutral	great pilots , good crafts .
neutral	but adv .
neutral	in plane is really annoying !
neutral	another think i don ' t like - its additional surcharges for paying with cc .
neutral	call plans are ok if your a home customer , choice of phones is average but worst of all is customer_services - it ' s ridiculous trying to sort a problem , get answers etc .
neutral	recently went in to comet to purchase a new washing_machine .
neutral	the experience had it ' s good points and it ' s bad points !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the washer was good value , delivery was free and they took my old one away .
neutral	the sales_rep was ridiculously pushy , constantly trying to push us to a more_expensive washer despite telling them our budget .
neutral	at the checkout he tried for 00_minutes to get us to take out extended_warranty - in the end i said i would think about it so we could leave !
neutral	0 hour later i received a phone call asking if i was ready to take out the extended_warranty and he wasn ' t best pleased when i said no .
neutral	overall : good value , shame about the pushy_sales .
neutral	as always my protein was great on price and product , however false statements on product descriptions and refusal to refund 0 products i ordered and did not need as a result of their mistake , let them down completely and i was left very frustrated .
neutral	they really didn ' t seem to care that i was annoyed with their service either .
neutral	also beware of their points system , it ' s very poorly ran , my account had gone into minus figures , and i had saved numerous points whicheck theh wiped at the end of the year without warning ( it does say in the t &_c ' s but a warning would have been nice ...) if ordering from these just make_sure you are 000_% certain with your order before you place it as you can ' t edit an order after paying .
neutral	you have to cancel , get a refund and order again !!
neutral	very annoying company but great products and price .
neutral	could not fault the service , flowers looke fine , however when i arrived home to see them , i asked my fiance where she had put the rest of them , but there were no more .
neutral	love the product , but was slightly disappointed with the shipping time , as it was for a christmas_present and i ' d ordered it well in_advance , but ended_up hoping it would arrive in time to wrap up .
neutral	i ordered a silver tuxedo for a cruise .
neutral	it said delivery in three working_days .
neutral	when i rang to chase it up i was informed that it was not kept in stock and the supplier was on holiday until the 0th_jan .
neutral	my cruise leaves on the 0th .
neutral	however they accepted the cancellation and refunded the money quickly .
neutral	this site is ok .
neutral	it doesn ' t give you much detail and you need to know the make of the vehicle you ' re checking .
neutral	i just use it to check the cost of tax for any new cars i buy .
neutral	client depuis quelques années , le_prix de croquette pour mes lapins devient le plus en plus cher .
neutral	le sachet de 00 kg été vendu à 00 . 00_euros en avril est maintenant à 00 . 00_euros !!
neutral	pour les mêmes produits sur_le site petmed . co . uk , le_prix est nettement moins cher , malgré que_le fait au royaume uni le tva est plus haut .
neutral	such a hard website to navigate
neutral	good service but not top quality , i was expecting like it details on the advert that the delivery man would take the shopping into the kitchen , but he just left it at my front_door , and it wasnt all bagged either .
neutral	not to mention the products that were not in stock that were replaced with something else now i understand that they do run out of stock , but replacing burger buns with hot dog rolls , now i cant see the logic ..
neutral	products are okay but then service needs to be more professional .
neutral	good site to skim over to get a brief idea of places , restaurants and things to do but a lot of reviews on there aren ' t great or true to the place in my experience !
neutral	the look and the feel of the 0 items that i ' ve purchased felt cheap .
neutral	it ' s feeling so difrent when your iphone is licked and now you seeing carrier bar is working
neutral	it took 0 - 0 mins to load each page during checkout ..
neutral	there is absolutely nothing wrong with my broadband speed and have used " just_eat " before which i never had this problem with .
neutral	sort it out hungryhouse !
neutral	i ordered my small fish reefs on sunday_afternoon , it showed on system that they were in stock and as i was in desperate need of them i chose this company , it is now thursday and they are have still not even been dispatched , i know its not as bad as some problems you get with buying on line but i do spend a lot of time buying stuff on line and in my experience , some shop that have items in stock have a 0 - 0 day dispatch time .
neutral	i have emailed the company and they did reply with in couple of hours to say that item will be getting dispatch end of this week so will be with me 0 - 0 working_days after this .. so tuesday 0 days after i ordered it .
neutral	liked it !
neutral	cannot say more_than that , very impressed .
neutral	i ' ve used shopto . net for quite a while now and i ' m a gold member , they used to be excellent , but it seems that recent changes have them neglect their old values of customer care when an issue arises .
neutral	their recently added shoptonews section seems to be a copy and paste of other gaming sites news and the reviews are mediocre to say the least .
neutral	their blog used to be more reliable
neutral	i do love the clothes ive bought jumpers , skirts and coats oh and boots , all lasted well and washed well ( appart from boots lol ) but the items are sooo pricey i usually wait for the sales
neutral	i ordered about 000_pounds worth of product .
neutral	the introductory meat pack , 0kgs of tilapia , and 0 cartons of egg_whites .
neutral	i only recieved my egg_whites and one pack of veal .
neutral	i also recieved some fat_burners that werent ordered .
neutral	staff seem helpful , and have offered to resend back my whole order , but the internal email system on the website is extremely slow , took 0 days to complete my complaint and get told they would send out the order .
neutral	a phone call could have fixed the problem in a few minutes .
neutral	considering muscle_food only deliver tuesday to thursday .. the slow complaint process means it is taking forever to get my food !
neutral	the run up to the stag_do was very good .
neutral	lots of communication with chillisauce , they facilitated the payments etc which saved me , the best man , a lot of hassle .
neutral	broadly speaking , the whole stag_do was a success with one exception .
neutral	we paid for guest_list entry on the friday_night and found that we weren ' t on the list in some places which frustrated us and had an affect on the fun we were having that night .
neutral	we complained on the saturday and were told we ' d be added to a club guest_list for saturday_night .
neutral	again , on arriving at the club , we weren ' t on the guest_list !!!
neutral	very frustrating and hence the poor review .
neutral	firstly i can confirm the company is genuine and trustworthy , so don ' t have any concerns there .
neutral	the watch supplied was exactly as ordered with all necessary breitling international warranties .
neutral	its condition was perfect .
neutral	i was disappointed that my watch was delayed beyond the maximum stated delivery and i had to chase updates a couple of times .
neutral	i believe swiss watches did what they could to chase the order though , delivery to the authorised dealer appeared to be beyond their control .
neutral	my other disappointment was that the website states under the watch i ordered that the watch came with a 0 day refund policy , offering me peace of mind if i needed it .
neutral	when i placed my order i was told my watch was a special order though and therefore wasn ' t eligible .
neutral	my watch wasn ' t anything special , it was a standard breitling aerospace evo .
neutral	i think the website is misleading and told swiss watches this but they state the full terms of the refund policy are available online .
neutral	it wouldn ' t take them long to update the site so the watches that aren ' t eligible are listed as such though , so read what you what into the way they present their refund policy .
neutral	the final price was better_than anywhere on the high_street but maybe not by the margins you ' d expect .
neutral	don ' t write off your local official dealer before getting their best quote .
neutral	i was offered a quote within £_000 of the final price i paid swiss watches , the watch was in stock and the fitting would have been free .
neutral	in short it was an acceptable experience and i ' d consider_using them again .
neutral	i get the impression most people have a better experience than i did from their reviews .
neutral	it took a long time to get my order refunded
neutral	good service , friendly website
neutral	it is easy to make reservation and they give me voucher soon .
neutral	i used this company for a while although i was never thrilled with the service .
neutral	the sales_team are quite pushy and say there is a minimum of 0 hours for a two bed flat which is more_than i wanted , but went with it .
neutral	i recently received an_email offering a one of 0 hour service for £_00 but when i called they said my post code wasn ' t eligible .
neutral	the cleaning was generally ok but never great value and the first cleaner broke part of my shower and didn ' t mention it .
neutral	edit_: i ' ve since been contacted by fantastic cleaners who have apologised and insisted they will amend the marketing and not repeat this mistake .
neutral	i would definitely give 0_stars !
neutral	but i received an_email instructing me to check the parcel and the content before signing :
neutral	====
neutral	important message : we strongly_advise you to check the parcel ’_s condition and contents before signing the delivery note . feel free to remove your product ( s ) from the box to inspect them , even if the outer_packaging doesn ’ t show any signs of damage .
neutral	====
neutral	the above message was in red and bold .
neutral	but when i received the parcel the delivery guy didn ' t allow me to open it ( obviously ) and said that i need to sign first as this is part of ups policy .
neutral	and to be honest , i think he is right ... how would you " open / alter " the package before signing ... you know , before signing it is still his responsibility and not yours !
neutral	be more clear next time .
neutral	other than that , great price and product condition .. so far at_least .
neutral	on the one hand , they have all the bike parts i ' ll ever need and the staff are always helpful and willing to part with a little advice on bike maintenance .
neutral	on the other , trying to get them to do work on the bike themselves is an_absolute chore .
neutral	long waiting times despite nearly empty schedules and the work is too often of questionable quality .
neutral	one particular example is when i took my bike in for a yearly once - over ( i do regular maintenance myself ) and they replaced my chain .
neutral	that night , cycling home from work , the chain snapped in the middle of a busy junction .
neutral	i always used to love going into game .
neutral	they always had what i wanted and the staff knew their stuff .
neutral	of late , however , they ' ve been slipping badly , with poor availability and damaged stock .
neutral	this was best highlighted when the cancelled all mass_effect pre_- orders shortly before_release .
neutral	even worse , they deposit was refunded only as store credit .
neutral	i wanted to invite my grandfather visiting me in london to one of the beethoven symphonies concerts at the bbc proms conducted by barenboim .
neutral	we choose some tickets for monday 00rd for symphonies 0 & 0 and looked forward to it .
neutral	0st row tickets .
neutral	as the tickets didn ' t arrive , i contacted viagogo who were fast to tell us the seller could not be contacted .
neutral	they offered to rebook us for another night or refund us .
neutral	after telling them that if they could rebook us , it would be better_than missing on this amazing cycle of concerts , i received a call from a very efficient gentleman who found us 0 tickets in no time .
neutral	unfortunately , i realized after i hanged_up that the tickets were for another concert with another orchestra and pieces by smetana and prokoviev on wednesday .
neutral	it was not another concert from the same cycle ( could have been tuesday or friday - not wednesday !)
neutral	at no time he provided me any details about what concert it was but we only mentioned the day of the week .
neutral	what would you say if you buy a ticket to u0 concert and are sent some tickets for rihana ?
neutral	i called viagogo back less_than 0 minutes after we had hanged_up and was told that they had a zero refund policy and the gentleman i talked to would have to make a " judgement call ".
neutral	impressive .
neutral	i was promised i would be called back by the mighty person who could make that judgement .
neutral	it never happened .
neutral	i received 0 hours_later an_email confirmation that i would receive the tickets for this smetana prokoviev concert i have no interest in .
neutral	moreover , these tickets were on sale for half the price that the tickets i initially purchased and there was no sign of balance refund .
neutral	as i harassed viagogo on all their phone_lines ( the main one would no_longer give me the option to talk to anyone - how nice !
neutral	), i was eventually called back by someone unaware of the all situation .
neutral	after putting me on hold for a long time , the call cut ( probably my cell phone ).
neutral	i then received a message_saying they couldn ' t refund me as the tickets had been sent and i had given my consent on the phone .
neutral	0st lie : the email to say the tickets had been sent came a few hours after i said i had no interest in them and was promised to be call back
neutral	0nd lie : i was never called back by the mighty person capable to make the judgement call on my case
neutral	0rd lie : how can you give your consent to a concert without being told what the concert is ?
neutral	without being given the details ( row , seat number ) of these tickets ?
neutral	well you can ' t possibly call that consent .
neutral	0th lie : i was told i would be upgraded .
neutral	instead , i am being sent some tickets who were for sale at £_000 instead of those i had paid £_000 .
neutral	what a great upgrade .
neutral	not only viagogo seized the opportunity to not let go of their commission by rebooking me instead of refunding , but they never wanted me to cancel those tickets i didn ' t want , because they saw a great opportunity to make money ... and pretending they were being kind to me .
neutral	appalling .
neutral	it seems viagogo replies to comments on this site .
neutral	i ' ll wait a few_days before i ' ll forward the whole_thing to a lawyer .
neutral	order 0000000
neutral	--- update 0 days after the concert i wanted to attend :
neutral	i have received a full_refund from viagogo which shows that they do care about their client .
neutral	viagogo is doing a tricky business .
neutral	by putting_together buyers and sellers for event tickets , so many things can go_wrong .
neutral	if they were too easy to reach , 00_% of their business would be about wasting time dealing_with unnecessary calls .
neutral	yet it was hard and frustrating to get hold of them , and ended_up being expensive ( quite the phone bill !
neutral	).
neutral	naturally , i would have liked to take my grand father to what i believe was the concert of the year .
neutral	at_least , i can watch it on bbc inlayer .
neutral	overall , a complicated experience but viagogo has taken the right decision refunding me and i appreciate it .
neutral	will i use again ?
neutral	i may .
neutral	love the products , quality and the variety .
neutral	the downside is its way to expensive .
neutral	the same accessories are much much cheaper elsewhere .
neutral	not bad would reccomend tho
neutral	good but could of been better
neutral	i prefere i phone
neutral	i don ' t really like to shop in tesco although there fruit and veg is good , but i have found horrible bits of meat in pasta pots ect and there was an orange fly in a packet of crisps i brought in a meal deal .
neutral	the produce is not worth the money and its very exspensive you dont get your moneys_worth .
neutral	well , getting the point of putting a quote out there was dead simple and very easy , after that things got a little hairy , for instance :
neutral	- changing details an asking for re - quotes was a pain , shouldn ' t this be automatic ?
neutral	- having to hunt through the faq to find how to pay the courier an_hour before they arrived .
neutral	shiply make it easy to pay for they deposit ( their fee ) but after that you are on your own .
neutral	i assumed i would pay the rest via the site also , and had to quickly run out for the final cash , a bit_annoying that this wasn ' t pointed_out in the ' how it works ' ( makes me think keeping it to three steps was more important than the usefulness , more marketing than anything ).
neutral	there are other oddities , but i would use the site again , for it does that first bit of the process very well and know i know some of the quirks ( there are more i can ' t remember ) i feel_comfortable using the service again .
neutral	usually had no_problems spent $ 0000s over the years with supplement_warehouse but lately it seems products are getting sent in damaged condition , as my preworkout came in like a rock and had to send back and reorder .
neutral	just a hassle but return_policy is legit .
neutral	nice flowers delivered very fast .
neutral	unfortunately no email was sent to confirm the order had been received , and the invoice is sent as a pdf attachment , which is much less convenient than just having the details written in the email .
neutral	the laptops i have had from dell have been good , but customer_service is awful .
neutral	the last time i called customer_service they gave me a quote for support , then tried to increase it during the call .
neutral	they took_ages to attempt to resolve the problem but were ultimately unsuccessful .
neutral	it took hours .
neutral	i am surprised they were not more familiar with their own products .
neutral	on another occasion they quoted me £_00 to replace the cds i got when i first bought the laptop .
neutral	i took it to a shop where they reinstalled everything for £_00 , saving me £_00 .
neutral	we got the call to go and collect my ring .
neutral	when we got there ( it ' s a long drive ) we found that my ring had been made the complete wrong_size .
neutral	when they ' d taken the order originally they hadn ' t written down the size and instead of phoning to ask they just guessed !
neutral	it was far too small !
neutral	i ' m a o and it was j .
neutral	they initially offered to resize it there and then which we were not happy about .
neutral	we ' d have lost quality making it so much bigger .
neutral	then they offered to give me the one from the shop floor , which everyone would have tried on .
neutral	i wasn ' t happy so they did agree to make a new one and post it to me when it was ready , free of charge .
neutral	we had intended to order my fiance ' s ring that day too but after this experience we actually went to another jewellers who managed to make his ring on time and perfectly .
neutral	we were given his with a valuation certificate , photo etc .
neutral	mine from marlows just came in a box without even a cope of the receipt .
neutral	and mine was mich more_expensive .
neutral	really disappointed and has made what should have been a lovely experience that little_bit less special .
neutral	the ring is beautiful but i think everytime i look at it i ' ll feel that twang of disappointment .
neutral	my flights were rescheduled , meaning that i would have to take two more days off work and be stuck in shanghai airport for over 00_hours on both the outward and return journeys .
neutral	as i wasn ' t given any alternative , i had to cancel my flights with budgetair .
neutral	i then asked for the full_refund i was entitled to .
neutral	initially , budgetair said that it would take 00 - 00 weeks to refund me the ticket amount , but they wouldn ' t refund the flight booking_fee , credit_card costs or airline failure service .
neutral	after making an official_complaint to the airline and writing about this experience on trust_pilot , i was given a full_refund within a few_days .
neutral	yo udo not have enough info about your products on the site ...
neutral	i purchased a cross - hatch jacket , which looked very nice .
neutral	however , due to the time of year it was impractical as i was hoping it would be thicker - no fault of stand - out .
neutral	ordering was very easy , and customer_service was great , i ordered the wrong_colour and quickly emailed to see if i could change this - it wasn ' t a problem .
neutral	quick delivery and i got what i had ordered .
neutral	on realising that the item wasn ' t suitable , i had to send back .
neutral	my only issue is the cost of returns .
neutral	it cost me nearly £ 0 , to send it first_class recorded .
neutral	i didnt have to send it this way but for peace of mind , i think most people would send it recorded .
neutral	anyway , you do not get re - imbursed for the return cost , so basically , i have lost £ 0 and got nothing to show for it .
neutral	which is a shame .
neutral	if i knew what i was wanting , and had physically seen the item , then i would have no - hesitation using the company again .
neutral	it seems river_island is gettng more and more_expensive should offer discount !
neutral	i went to buy some bits in primark the other day and was suprised how much items have gone up in price .
neutral	sometimes its not worth spending it in primark now when you can go elsewhere and get better quality thats going to last longer .
neutral	on the plus side you can still get some great bits
neutral	i use paypal quiet alot because of my ebay account the only thing i dont agree with is the charge you get everytime you recieve money on the other hand it is free of charge if you want to transfer money into your own account
neutral	ordered an office desk from these_guys a month_ago now which has just arrived .
neutral	when i ordered i didn ' t clock the delivery estimate of 00 - 00 days but when i realised i thought that must just mean the maximum amount of time it will take them to deliver an in - stock item .
neutral	what i now realise is the desk was made to order , but still didn ' t arrive within 00 working_days , it was more like 00 .
neutral	if they would just be honest and put made to order on their site it would have saved me a lot of annoyance .
neutral	customer_service is good , they get back to you quite quickly , although they offered no apology for the lateness of the delivery even when i said i wasn ' t exactly happy .
neutral	the desk itself looks very robust , the main top part is very heavy and is the only bit i have removed from it ' s packaging so far .
neutral	it all seems well_packaged , so i ' m happy there .
neutral	all in all i ' m fairly happy but next time i make a purchase for office furniture i will keep a closer eye on what they have in - stock and what ' s made to order as a month is a long time to wait .
neutral	i ' ve been using this company since last_year september .
neutral	i ' ve found them to be fast in delivering completed images and they do a very neat job .
neutral	however , recently there was a mistake in my completed image and i dismissed it and stated the reason .
neutral	i waited a few_days and then emailed the uk support_team to find out how many more days it would take to rectify the issue .
neutral	i did not get a response .
neutral	i have happened to just log_into my account at rtb ( to find an_alternative way to communicate with them ) and found out it has been completed ... why didn ' t i get a notification that it had finally been complete ?
neutral	why didn ' t i get response to the email sent ?
neutral	it ' s a shame because i had nothing but praises for this company , but i feel now that my custom has become somewhat a bother to these people , even_though i am paying for my pictures to be edited .
neutral	yes , sometimes i send pictures one at a time days apart , sorry if this is irritating to you rtb , but i design and create my different variations weeks - months apart , i am unable to send images in bulk .
neutral	i ' ll look for a similar company to do my images from now on , i don ' t want to be a bother .
neutral	it ' s a great way to get_rid of dvd ' s and cd ' s that were sitting on my self but prices were a bit low .
neutral	prompt pick_up but it took quite a long time to receive the money .
neutral	good service but i prefer not to pay_monthly because i dont use that much data and making payments through paypal .
neutral	wish i could topup at anytime without paying monthly .
neutral	if you want a customer to post a review now , and dont pay for trust_pilot , then that customer must pre_- register or be prepared to use their facebook account .
neutral	many of my customers are not happy to do this , so may have to look at dropping trust_pilot as a preferred review site .
neutral	its not that it is expensive , but i dont like being held to ransom .
neutral	to make it hard for customers to place a review really goes against what i feel a review site should be doing .
neutral	please make it easier for customers to post reviews and then maybe i would be happy to sign_up for additonal services .
neutral	service was ok . couldn ' t advise delivery time .
neutral	only deliver once a week on a saturday .
neutral	not the best tbh .
neutral	didn ' t install it as website advised .
neutral	so after having to deal with a very rude staff_member was finally able to talk to someone who listened to me .
neutral	took a while to get there but have now had a satisfactory resolution .
neutral	thank_you dreams for finally understanding my concerns .
neutral	i now do not have such a bad opinion of your company .
neutral	tune up is one of the finest product ... no it ' s the one and the only one i might use and trust to tuneup my pc and that unquestionable fact for me .
neutral	unfortunattly moment ' s after purchasing the product with a general offer in the website ( 00 . 00 $), two new offers in row appear to me first through the uninstall with ( 00 . 00 $) which was oky for me not that far from what i ' ve paid but then after i installing the new version i had another offer for ( 00 . 00 $).
neutral	that was totally unaccepted .
neutral	i have used mp for over 0 years now and have always found the service from start to finish fantastic , however this year it has been horrendous , my last order i paid extra for next_day courier ( ordered on a thursday at 00am well within the same day dispatch period ) i received a mail that afternoon to say it had been dispatched , friday came with no sign off it , contacted mp they couldn ' t give me a tracking reference for it , eventually got the tracking reference on the monday and it ended_up that they didnt give it to the courier until friday_afternoon .
neutral	the items arrived on monday_afternoon and after a few mails i got them to refund the extra payment for next_day delivery as they had not delivered .
neutral	its such a shame as the products are fantastic but your only as good as the service you provide and this area is definately lacking recently .
neutral	i wouldnt be so quick to blame the courier , mp are marking items as dispatched without actually dispatching them by the looks of things , please sort it out !
neutral	a one of a kind website with really reasonable prices .
neutral	a real wide_range of products with different choices of styles and colours .
neutral	i ' ll definitely be shopping here again for sure , however one of my nail_varnish products did come in the wrong shade ..
neutral	i ' ve been an orange customer for years - i ' ve had all_sorts of problems from niggles with rude customer_service to being overcharged by £_000 .
neutral	they make it as difficult as possible to complain and when you do , it ' s unlikely you ' ll receive a response .
neutral	yet i get a reasonably good deal and when someone calls me , my phone rings - which is what i want from a mobile provider .
neutral	it ' s a sad state of affairs that i fear orange are amongst the better networks for customer_service , so i ' m happy enough where i am .
neutral	very informated to us
neutral	instant , easily but not so completed collection
neutral	code recieved within 00_hrs , there was a couple of steps missing on the instructions , but as there was a link to a video tutorial that sorted the issue i had .
neutral	overall happy it worked phone is now unlocked
neutral	it ' s where i shop for protein , as their prices are great .
neutral	many of the items come with free_gifts such as protein shakers and tester packs .
neutral	delivery is also great .
neutral	in this area i ' d give them 0_stars .
neutral	however , be wary of some the marketing stuff they do , and things they put in the descriptions .
neutral	an example is something called methoxy - 0 - test which they claim boosts testosterone levels and recovery / performance .
neutral	i found zero evidence that it does this , and found a few scientific papers to the contrary .
neutral	however when asked about this i got no reply and my comments weren ' t approved for the site .
neutral	there are other examples too .
neutral	basically , use it as a shop by all means , where you go to it knowing what you want .
neutral	i wouldn ' t recommend going to it and trying to work out what you want , as they push certain products ( e . g .
neutral	phd supplements ) very hard , some of which have no evidence they do anything .
neutral	unfortunately this review agrees with thomas .
neutral	i have had exactly the same problems as he has .
neutral	made an order with standard delivery between 0 - 0 business days on monday .
neutral	however it took them a good five days to ready my product for dispatch !
neutral	this was on my week off from work and was hoping for fast ( in the 0 - 0 estimated time ) delivery .
neutral	however i was disappointed not to here from them until friday .
neutral	which meant i would be back at work and unable to receive delivery .
neutral	the products i received i was very pleased with !
neutral	seems like nike have become lazy , taking a very long time to process my order for dispatch .
neutral	even more annoying when ou have to pay for p_& p !
neutral	other_websites offer free delivery which often comes next_day when ordered early , makes nike performance look very weak !
neutral	shame .
neutral	i use this company on a regular_basis and will keep doing so not been let_down yet
neutral	i use this company on a regular_basis and will keep doing so not been let_down yet
neutral	ordered on the 00rd november .
neutral	nothing delivered by the 0th_december .
neutral	email not responded to .
neutral	line dead when trying to call customer_services .
neutral	the contacts on your order email confirmation were how i tried to contact you and i have copied them directly from there ;
neutral	tel : 0000 000 0000
neutral	email : customerservices @ justbeautifully . co . uk
neutral	this appears to be different to the email address you mention ?
neutral	i was certainly unable to get through on the phone_lines for 0 hours this morning before this initial review was posted and a chase up email sent 00_hours ago to the above email address .
neutral	hence my frustration .
neutral	thank your for your offer of the refund , all i would really like is it delivered by the 0th_december , which in fairness to me is 00 days after the date of order .
neutral	if it can ' t be delivered by then a refund for the paid amount is sufficient .
neutral	special delivery arranged and order delivered just in time .
neutral	been buying online games for years from many websites then came_across this website the other day and bought a few games , received codes in minutes and was a great service .
neutral	only issue i had was when i bought another game the following_day , then i got a email_saying fraud checking please send us 0 copies of identification , driving_license etc , i personally don ' t think anyone should send this kinda information to a website that don ' t provide there contact number and there address on there website ( its a 0 way thing we want to know your genuine too ).
neutral	overall though i received the codes i bought and they worked so ive no_complaints there but i would hope this company will look_into other ways to verify users without having to share confidential information .
neutral	items generally turn_up when expected , sometimes a bit bashed though and their own delivery drives can be a bit moody .
neutral	when they outsource delivery then it usually is better ( e . g .
neutral	fridges etc )
neutral	great value for money and free next_day delivery - superb !
neutral	however , payment is via_paypal , would have preferred other methods of payment .
neutral	normally i am pleased with apple as they generally delivery within a week and the quality is top_notch but on this occasion i had to wait 0 weeks for my order which apparently was in stock , not particularly good in this day and age .
neutral	when i finally received this there was a lose screw rattling around in the tower which unfortunately i cannot get to , pretty shoddy considering i paid over £ 0000 for this item , where is the qc checks apple ?
neutral	on the plus side the customer_service is very good , they are very keen to look after you if there is a problem , so at_least there is some redemption on this occasion .
neutral	i placed my order for 0 or 00 products and had to wait 0 weeks before anything arrived , i would have probably waited longer if i hadn ' t chased them too .
neutral	i had no response to various emails and had to call them a few_times to get any action , will think_twice before ordering from them again .
neutral	i ordered olbas oil for a cold , by the time i received it i was well over it , come on chemist_direct ... you should be better_than this !
neutral	i ' ve made a purchase with this provider for the first time .
neutral	the product hasn ' t been delivered due time as the robot email suggested .
neutral	when xmas period time passed , i was mildy surprised , as i received another automatic email prompting me to provide feedback about their quality of service .
neutral	oh well , it turned_out the shipment has never been delivered , so another free purchase was made .
neutral	i got mildly suspicious about the speed of delivery of the second ( free order ), this time arriving the very next_day of the purchase , despite the customer care team told me they didn ' t have one of the product on the stock , and therefor i would have to wait 0 additional days .
neutral	perhaps they ' ve forgotten my first shipment ?
neutral	whatever way , inconsistency in providing information to a customer can make a wonder !
neutral	update 0th_january_0000 : just received what i believe should be a retention campaign to keep customers .
neutral	! 0 %_off your next order until a month from today .
neutral	i am not going to change my shopping behaviour since 00 years , so thanks but the offer has no value to keep me interested shopping further with you .
neutral	there are means in e_- commerce these days to tailor timely offer to adjust to the customer , not the other way around ...
neutral	delivery drivers were rude and sweary and not a great representation of the company .
neutral	ordering was easy and fine .
neutral	i got to the hotel and no booking was there , not exactly the way to start a holiday , it took about two hours to sort out , spoiling the first day completely after no answer from the phone number provided .
neutral	the booking should have gone_through , no excuses , the fact they resolved this quickly makes this a 0 star_review rather_than a 0 star one .
neutral	good website , selection and prices , but appalling delivery service .
neutral	i was in when parcelforce allegedly tried to deliver , did not have a card or receive calls to tell me the item was waiting for me to pick_up , despite parcelforce tracking showing the opposite .
neutral	i phoned up to enquire_about my delivery , and the company did find out where my parcel was being held , but didn ' t seem bothered about the trouble i ' d had or offer to arrange an_alternative delivery .
neutral	in the en . d i had to leave work early to go and collect , and i really shouldn ' t have to do this next time i ' ll try a competitor as long as they don ' t use pracelforce .
neutral	fix the delivery issue and i would buy from you again .
neutral	this review was originally contested because it focused on the delivery too much rather_than the whisky_exchange - seeing as twe can choose their courier , i stand by my review .
neutral	activities were all good .
neutral	the clay shooting was good especially .
neutral	the hotel wasn ' t clean - although it was good having 0 - 0 to a room , it had the previous occupant ' s bra under the bed , along with a sock .
neutral	decor was rough .
neutral	i order an ericsson t00 which was in stock however after waiting sometime to see why my order was not on its way i contacted the company .
neutral	they replied and said they would look_into the issue .
neutral	the following_day i had still not heard back so i sent another email and the response was that the ericsson t00 was not in stock !!!!
neutral	so they offered my a similar model which i accepted .
neutral	whats disturbing here is it seemed that between the time i ordered the phone and when i followed up with an_email a week_later to see where it was that my order was in limbo .
neutral	would i have been waiting indefinitely to hear about my phone was not in stock if i had have not initiated contact ?
neutral	so obvious problems with their ordering system .
neutral	at present do not take an item thats shows in stock to be true but rather email them first before you order and part with your cash .
neutral	on the flip side the product is great now that its arrived and i am happy with its top condition ( almost as new )
neutral	ok , first of all , they were the cheapest for the 0 hotels i needed , 0 in london for 0 nights and 0 in greece for 0 so there is that .
neutral	and their new website is ok .
neutral	the not so good now , they didn ' t send the email confirmation straight_away , the login process and access your data for the itinerary is poor quality ( gives no info !)
neutral	- i have booked in full a transfer which is just resold from a0b transfers and they haven ' t sent me the voucher because the hotel is only partly paid till 0 weeks before_departure .
neutral	that is stupid , surely they have no right to use the transfer money as a deposit for anything_else .
neutral	if you need help and you raise a query , expect long delays for someone to come back to you and they are never apologetic .
neutral	i ' d say , use only when they are cheapest .
neutral	+ ve - speed of delivery was fantastic
neutral	- ve - quality of paper used in printing as well as the quality of printing itself are not very good .
neutral	don ' t like play . com much anymore with all these traders , first time i ' ve ordered from one and never received the item was a con .
neutral	go back to how it was play !!!
neutral	however , play did refund me and communication was good , albeit quite a wait to have to process a refund .
neutral	shopto are great for fast delivery ( usually next_day if you order before 0 . 00pm ), however their prices are getting worse imo .
neutral	there are numerous retailers around now who i can buy the same game from for around a few pounds cheaper and still get it delivered the next_day .
neutral	this an update the came on wednesday last_week at 0 : 00 and i ask the driver to wait at the the door with me checking the product and everything went fine thank u
neutral	ive been with vodafone for a while but my friends have better deals and offers .
neutral	i had pre ordered a game around 0 - 0 months it was actually released and then it comes late .
neutral	i ' ve always had dyson hoovers for the last 00 years but wen my last one pack in .
neutral	i went into an electrical store to purchase a dyson but came out with something totally different brand , this was partial to do with price and functions against other models and the staff_members recommendation .
neutral	overpriced for their packages and all you get is repeats all the time !
neutral	!
neutral	to many emails and offers to take in
neutral	order was costly ( 00 . 00 ) and took 0 weeks instead of 0 days .
neutral	for that price , i would have expected better service and respect of the advertised delay .
neutral	i had to email over and over and message on facebook to get a response .
neutral	it does work though so it ' s not all bad .
neutral	i just really felt that i wasn ' t a client worthy of their attention .
neutral	i feel i should get a discount .
neutral	more_than the 0 , 00 for writing this .
neutral	which i might not even get since i am not leaving a great review .
neutral	cool new red jum ... wait a minute ....!!!!
neutral	why is it blue ?
neutral	okay , so i ordered red and you guys sent me blue and i quite like the colour and i decided to keep the jumper .
neutral	i hear it ’_s going to be cold this winter and this will keep me warm while out and about .
neutral	besides ; me sending it back won ’ t be worth it as the item is £ 0 . 00 ( including tax ) and p_& p ( postage and packaging ) is near enough £ 0 . 00 and me sending it back would be about the same and you people probably won ' t refund return_postage so i ' ll be left with £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	0_stars !!!
neutral	!
neutral	has anyone noticed how stingy amazon have become lately ?
neutral	first they put a limit on how much you need to spend for you to qualify for supersaver delivery , then they delay the delivery of goods till the following week .
neutral	0_stars amazonuk .
neutral	oh fantastic .
neutral	i ’ ve been looking for a type of combat trousers i only ever want wear for work for nearly a year after the one i had for 0years began to ware away .
neutral	so i done numerous searches online under many different names ( name of the combat trousers ) and i nearly gave up till i done one last search and i came cross these_guys .
neutral	i saw payment_method was paypal which was more_than good enough for me because if anything went wrong , there be no middle_man and it would have been left solely to the seller to resolve any deputes as they see fit .
neutral	anyway .... paypal yay - i didn ’ t even think about it , i went right on in there and brought 0 pairs .
neutral	a couple days_later it came , but the bag one of the pairs was in was opened and the other was not which suggest to me the opened one could have been tried on by someone_else before he sent it back .
neutral	it was neatly packed though ... yup .
neutral	anyway so i soaked it in disinfectant and bunged it in the wash . it ’_s the reason for 0_stars otherwise it would have been 0 .
neutral	i had to delete one bad review towards aliexpress , because they refunded my monies to my account .
neutral	i sent a letter of complaint to aliexpress complaints_department about a seller and although nothing was said about my complaint , the end of last month , i was refunded .
neutral	will i shop there again ?
neutral	personally , i wouldn ’ t chance it .
neutral	maybe i got lucky .
neutral	i just wanted to put it out there that i got a refund is all .
neutral	i brought 0 pair of work trousers last_week from qtag which were in the wrong_size .
neutral	qtag ' s ridiculous , pointless policy is no sending items back in exchange for the correct_size .
neutral	so , i sent it back ( note ; using £ 0 p_& p recorded - stupid post_office worker ) and resubmitted my order in the correct_size .
neutral	* sigh *
neutral	total amount again came up to £_00 . 00 including p_& p , just like with the first transaction .
neutral	days_later , i got refunded via_paypal to the sum of £_00 . 00 .
neutral	now i ' ll think_twice about purchasing from them again .
neutral	if i ' m to return , ( a big if ) i ' ll have to be cautious not to make wrongful purchases as they will deducted a whopping amount for returns .
neutral	nah forget it because it costs more in p_& p for multiple items .
neutral	a good thing i didn ' t purchase two of em in incorrect sizes at once that time .
neutral	never again !
neutral	i purchased this last_night and i still have not received any emails saying it was successful ??
neutral	imei is correct ive made sure does it usually take this long its been almost 00_hrs ??
neutral	?
neutral	i bought 0 tickets for boxing on sat .
neutral	traveling friday .
neutral	have been panicking all day , phoned viagogo twice .
neutral	both_times spoke to friendly staff who explained they can come the day before the event , it ' s the individual who has sold viagogo the ticket who hasn ' t sent them to me yet ( they contacted the seller on the 00st may to ship them to me , so i dont understand_why the seller holds on to them for so long ).
neutral	they said they would get them sent to the hotel we were staying at in london if they hadn ' t come by thursday .
neutral	also reassured me i could potentially collect them from the venue if the seller lets me down .
neutral	this evening i have had an_email_saying dispached .
neutral	not got them yet but i ' m feeling slightly more at ease !
neutral	i do feel that the seller should be made to send viagogo the tickets or to the buyer by a decent deadline .
neutral	these tickets have been released ages_ago .
neutral	it ' s really unfair to make us wait to the very last_minute and get so stressed out about it .
neutral	the seller could have easily decided they don ' t want to sell them anymore - at the last_minute !
neutral	what do they gain from hanging onto them ?
neutral	i don ' t begrudge paying over the odds for an event of a lifetime but the stress of thinking we ' re not going to get to go is awful .
neutral	i really like the variety of items that asos offers , and usually i do not have a problem with asos whatsoever in terms of item quality or pricing .
neutral	one of the reasons i am giving asos 0_stars is because of the unfortunate problem that they still use myhermes .
neutral	i will not go into detail about my horrible experience with myhermes here - if you click my profile to see my other reviews on trustpilot , you will be able to find my review for myhermes .
neutral	the other reason i am not giving any higher_than 0_stars is because of their customer_service .
neutral	it is frustrating when there is no contact number and my only options are to wait for a response through email or via their facebook_page , which are usually very slow ( barring the automated_messages saying they have a high_volume of emails ).
neutral	when i had my problem with an order due to myhermes , asos were essentially useless and just asked me to " wait a little longer " and to contact them if it still had not arrived by a certain_date .
neutral	it did not , so i messaged them back on facebook , only to receive a reply several days_later , after the order finally arrived a week_later than i was told it would .
neutral	of the three queries i sent in via their contact form on their website , only one was responded to by an actual person , and they only told me things i already knew / could find on their website , rather_than answering my actual question .
neutral	my returns experience was hassle - free , and i ' m pleased that i could return items free of charge , with no random fees deducted from my refund , and also that they send a confirmation of receipt of the return .
neutral	due to myhermes being a pain in the bum in regards to standard delivery , i chose to go premier with asos so hopefully i will not have to go through the whole debacle of trying to locate my order again .
neutral	i certainly hope i never have to contact customer care again , as they are rather useless .
neutral	the service works , the deal was alright but not the most competitive and i wish i tried another network now .
neutral	overall no real problems but nothing that makes me think they are amazing .
neutral	ordered at approx mid day and arrived before mid day the following_day already restrung for me at my specifications .
neutral	very well_packaged and ready for me to use straight_away .
neutral	used before for shoes but never a racket and not very trusting with stringers as have had many bad restrings .
neutral	after having my racket for approx 0 weeks and only playing 0 competitive game and only 0 training sessions the strings snapped during warm up for my 0nd competitive match , expected much more .
neutral	used a voucher_code from mighty deals "£ 00 worth of flowers for £_00 "
neutral	i am just glad that i hadn ' t actually spent £_00 on them , didn ' t expect them to be delivered in a cardboard_box they were also disappointingly small and just less that 00_hours , the roses and gerbera ' s are wilting and the lilies don ' t look like they ' re even going to open !
neutral	wish i ' d gone to morrisons , spent the £_00 plus delivery on the beautiful bunches they have !
neutral	very easy to deal with in terms of the process , however , they made up that there was a scratch on the phone ( which there wasn ' t , i photographed it before sending off ) and reduced the payment by a massive 00 %.
neutral	taking the mickey somewhat but i just went with it for minimum hassle .
neutral	they did offer to send it back for free .
neutral	update_: 0jun00
neutral	after constant pestering by the company i feel obliged to reply .
neutral	the whole point of an independent review site is that a customer can score what they believe to be a fair representation of the company .
neutral	the " crack " on the bezel is perfect and straight , looks_like the intended " crack " on the iphone 0 ( see the antenna configuration ).
neutral	i believe it certainly comes under the " light cosmetic wear and tear is acceptable " policy on your website .
neutral	another reason for not rating 0_stars is your policy on " automatic payment after 0 days " if the offer has been revised .
neutral	i feel that this time period is too short if the customers best interests are in mind .
neutral	" 0_stars : acceptable experience but with some friction ."
neutral	is a fair representation of this transaction .
neutral	i ordered a gopro from proviation however , due to lack of shipments from gopro i ultimately cancelled the order and requested a refund .
neutral	after a few troubles with my emails being sent to proviations ' spam ' folder ( so not getting replies ), the refund was issued along with friendly apologies .
neutral	proviation have done a lot to resolve this issue and i thank them greatly for it .
neutral	i ' ve gotten some good deals but have also been burned by some sellers who sell counterfeit ... got to be_careful !
neutral	this is a good site for selling second_hand good and also purchasing .
neutral	it is possible to list ads for items wanted aswell .
neutral	you can post free ads but if you want to promote your ad it will cost .
neutral	you can upload 0 free pics as well for your ad .
neutral	as with things like this always sell face to face and be_careful if you are unsure .
neutral	i would recommend as you can find some interesting items on here .
neutral	there are jobs pages aswell .
neutral	update_: i still enjoy looking at gumtree but be very very careful if you are selling , anyone who asks you to give out your paypal email address because they will give you an extra £_00 -£ 00 for postage is scamming you and should be reported immediately .
neutral	i have shopped in hmv a lot over the years and prefer spending my money instore rather_than online .
neutral	when i have ordered online i have either had my item dispatched and recieved within 0 days or i have had to wait 0 days to be dispatched dispite it being in stock .
neutral	this has happened 0 or 0 times and now if not dispatched in the time it states i just cancel and try and find the product elsewhere even if i have to spend a few more pounds .
neutral	one item i did order was meant to be 0 discs but was only a 0 disc cd so they should probably check their product details .
neutral	not sure whether i would recommend their online service .
neutral	i phoned up regarding a query and the man on the phone was very pushy in trying to get me to book there and then .
neutral	tried tactics like last room left , free cancellation .
neutral	when i told him i had to run it past my husband who was at work kept on saying he would hold or just book it and cancel later !
neutral	i would appreciate being_able to book in my own time , i was going to make a booking on the expedia website once i made a decision on the hotel anyway but their pushy_sales_tactics have made me think_twice .
neutral	the customer_services rep was soo annoyed i didn ' t book he didn ' t even bother saying bye and hang_up !
neutral	bad customer_service !
neutral	ordered a dress online .
neutral	it was delivered late first of all and once opened it look nothing like it did online .
neutral	i ordered a it a size larger and it was still hard to get on and off and was very short .
neutral	size ' s are not very accurate at all .
neutral	colours and design allways look different .
neutral	not very good quality for the price .
neutral	ordered a new bank card as mine snapped recieved it 0 days_later in the post was awaiting a new pin to come which never did after ringing them i found out i wouldn ' t recieve a new one .
neutral	which was fine just wished they would have told be before hand .
neutral	very hard to understand anyone as they seem to be located everywhere but england !
neutral	still have not be able to sort out an issue with the ammount i caan withdraw per day either .
neutral	been ' sent ' out forms that have never arrived .
neutral	i find they are allways helpful when i go instore .
neutral	i ordered my travel system from them and it arrived on time and all in one parcel which i was happy about as the pushchair was very large .
neutral	i have experienced a couple of problems with the travel system but as it was brought while 0 months pregnant the are saying ' general issues due to use ' allthough its only been in use for 0 months .
neutral	as i said though the staff are very different in store and can ' t do enough to help you .
neutral	ordered some xmas presents online .
neutral	the arrived late and allthough i was in the delivery driver left the package with a neighbour and just posted the ' i called but you were not in card through '.
neutral	this has happened on two occasions .
neutral	and very overpriced !
neutral	0 small items for a 0month old .. over £_00 !
neutral	i purchased a few products one which was a fake tan mit and i did not realise it was only a face one as it didnt state it clearly and it was around 0 / 0 pounds and they are only € 0 to buy in shops for the big ones , i wasn ' t happy with thatc
neutral	ordered a headset which on the site was showing in stock , expected shipping day came and went with no notification .
neutral	looked at web - site and saw item was out of stock - easy to guess_what had happened - they never had any .
neutral	two days after expected delivery date and finally get an e_- mail asking me to call them .
neutral	so i called and was told that there was none left and they weren ' t expecting any so will issue a refund .
neutral	i feel they could ' ve been more on the ball and identified this much sooner saving me a week without a much needed headset which i ' ve sourced elsewhere .
neutral	every review i read about currys is bad , they all say the same , unhelpful staff , staff have no knowledge of the products they sell etc , in my experience i have never had a problem with currys except for bad delivery .
neutral	ordered a tv from them and was told it would take 0 weeks to deliver even_though their site and tv ads say next_day delivery .
neutral	the member of staff was pretty helpful in telling_me what the tvs had and which ones were the best .
neutral	i usually know exactly_what i want from currys so have only had to ask for advice a couple of times .
neutral	i bought a pc in april last_year from dino_pc and it is still going strong with no_problems .
neutral	other people said that they have experienced problems with theirs but these are just random people who might be making it up .
neutral	that is why i left it some time to do a review .
neutral	either way my pc is working great .
neutral	the only problem was the customer_service and the guarantee .
neutral	they were quick to respond to quires through emails but had no contact numbers .
neutral	they still owe me £ 0 from a voucher that i used but they did not deduct from the price when i paid for it .
neutral	the 0 year guarantee was a bit dodgy as i had to pay for the parts but not the labour .
neutral	other than that this was a good place to get a pc from .
neutral	just do not expect any niceties / customer_service
neutral	i purchased some flowers from serenata for mother ' s day and paid premium for sunday delivery .
neutral	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn ' t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn ' t as special .
neutral	when my mother opened the box , the flowers were on their side and looking really limp and fragile .
neutral	the pot with some wadding in was bone dry and it seemed as though the flowers had been in the box for some time .
neutral	when paying so much this is not acceptable .
neutral	i wouldn ' t use serenata_flowers again .
neutral	fast delivery service but when i received the game it did not come with any cellophane wrapping or promotional leaflets usually put in ps0_games , prompting me to think these games may infact be second_hand .
neutral	chilli_sauce got a few things right over the 0 nights we spent in hamburg : the hotel was comfortable though the breakfast was lacking and the transfers between airports and activities were a nice feature ( though also lacked consistency across activities or in arriving on time ).
neutral	the taxi for our return to the airport had to be called as it didn ’ t arrive and the response of the phone was “ is it not there already ?” - not what i call a vote of confidence .
neutral	on the day that we went paintballing one taxi arrived at the venue 00 - 00_minutes before the other despite setting off second .
neutral	the traditional 0 course german meal was in fact 0 course with 0 small beers and though the beer allowance was made clear to us straight_away the staff at the restaurant , the fact that we were only having one ( good but small ) meal was not .
neutral	the paintballing was outdoor rather_than indoor with 00_euros extra costs each for an overall and enough paintballs to last everyone the games .
neutral	it is very relaxed though and much_better_than in england .
neutral	would definitely go back .
neutral	the go_karting was an excellent activity !
neutral	we raced in 0 sets of 0 with a short practise , qualifying and then approximately 00 laps on a 00 - 00 second / lap track .
neutral	you get a print out at the end detailing your performance .
neutral	the beer bike was hard work but a lot of fun .
neutral	the driver was informative and the tour substantial with 0 - 0 breaks .
neutral	the beer was cleary cheap but acceptable and ( due to temperature ) took somebody working the tap the whole time to get anything but foam into the glasses .
neutral	the night time tour that we went on with a local guide was excellent too .
neutral	we were accepted into bars we were not previously allowed into due to guest lists .
neutral	once into these it is important to behave appropriately as the staff are very apprehensive of groups of british men and will have you removed for as little as spilling your drink .
neutral	i would suggest that you get a map and try and see as much during the day as possible .
neutral	from st pauli where our hotel was , we were one corner from altona train_station and you can get tickets for the s - bahn “ fast train ” for very cheap .
neutral	i suggest visiting the aussenalster and the area around the hauptbahnhopf if you get chance .
neutral	ok site could be a little better layout
neutral	they are good for games but not for pre ordering as you don ' t get the key in time which is frustrating for youtuber like me
neutral	i ' ve read a lot of awful reviews here .
neutral	i ' ve had a webiste with wix . com for about 0 months and it has been working quite well .
neutral	i was with webs . com before and believe , wix . com are much_better and much more reliable !
neutral	i haven ' t noticed that my website was down during those 0 months , the apps / widgets are working fine but there ' s 0 thing that kills me :
neutral	you can ' t use your hosted space as you wish !!!!!
neutral	which means that when you upload an image , you can ' t get the direct link of it , that means that you can ' t upload any files you want ( which is really stupid ) etc ...
neutral	so the space allocated to you for your uploads is pretty_much useless !
neutral	that drives me crazy !
neutral	it is such a stupid approach for a website builder , i can ' t believe this .
neutral	i have decided to pay_monthly for now , even_though it ' s more_expensive than paying yearly , because i want to make_sure that this is worth my money .
neutral	it ' s not quite yet , but it ' s much_better_than my past experiences .
neutral	nel complesso sono soddisfatto , ma ho un piccolo appunto da fare .
neutral	ho contattato il servizio clienti per avere conferma che le gomme fossero di produzione 0000 .
neutral	loro mi hanno confermato che , trattandosi di gomme termiche , non c ' erano dubbi che sarebbero state nuovissime .
neutral	in realtà le gomme arrivate portano un dot del 0000 : è vero che si tratta dell ' ultimo stock di produzione di quell ' anno , ma le mie gomme , ad oggi , hanno già quasi un anno di vita .
neutral	altri siti , come confermato da amici , spediscono gomme con dot di produzione dell ' anno in corso .
neutral	all in a great deal and prompt service from the company .
neutral	the only_downside through them is their aftersales email service .
neutral	i had an issue with my phone and emailed them for a follow_up .... of which i am still_awaiting a reply and that is now 0 weeks .
neutral	i was able to sort my issue out through my main provider , however i feel the 0rd_party company should at_least have communicated back to me , at_least for just a follow_up to see how i got on or if the issue still exists .
neutral	waited for over a month to get my phone unlocked , but glad to have it finally confirmed .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	the good :
neutral	it ' s great how they can offer to beat everybody else ' s price by an extra 0 %, that ' s their only forte .
neutral	the bad :
neutral	if you make big order they always take a long time to process it , sometime they don ' t have the stuff in stock and they have to order it and that takes 0 - 0 business days for them to get the order and another 0 - 0 business days for you to get your order ...
neutral	it ' s ridiculous , sometimes you have to wait 0 - 0 weeks for an order .
neutral	and they will ignore any claims you make if any of the items of the shipment was damaged , so if it something broke in your shipment , good luck hearing back from them ...
neutral	i know i didn ' t .
neutral	good service but i ordered an adroid ace and it said on the o0 website i could get bbc_iplayer which was actually incorrect .
neutral	bought a £ 0 , 000 . 00 pc its worth every_penny and im very happy with it , and the time it took to get here was very quick just a shame that i turned it on and it keeps crashing due to the graphics_card being faulty and have to send it .
neutral	just you pay all the money for a pc , and you just want it to work straight off but thats life .
neutral	i found the case , wasnt put_together 000_% properly .
neutral	just shame about the customer_service , wasnt very helpful when telling_me what the problem was and wanting to do everything by email instead of the phone .
neutral	my pc dont work how can i send emails ... phone would be 00x better :/
neutral	great place , in good spot with nice night club , everyone seen friendly , cheap would be wonderful if the materass were bit more comfortable anyway i will suggest to anyone
neutral	the webpage is easy to use and great for any given occasion .
neutral	from the first moment you start to build your shopping_cart everything is simple .
neutral	the follow - up emails that i received with a little sense of humor were a nice_touch even when there are so many of them .
neutral	at one point i received three 00_%_discount emails for the same order .
neutral	the only one and huge problem is the product itself .
neutral	not only did i order a beautiful mix of flowers that looked awesome on your webpage but i order the deluxe version .
neutral	and what i find out is that the person who received the flowers was delivered the vase the flowers and the balloon all separate and also there were just a handful of flowers .
neutral	everything from the logistics planning to the customer_service follow - up are great ways to satisfy the customer , but if your product doesn ' t at_least fulfill your customer ' s expectations then the service as a hole will be lousy .
neutral	orange customer_services is decent .
neutral	you don ' t have to wait forever to get through to a human and they are always very chirpy and helpful .
neutral	when i had to call for a replacement phone in the past , i found them to be quite rude , in terms of asking if i usually allowed a three year_old to put my belongings down the loo and suggested that i should have been supervising them better .
neutral	this was the only time i have ever felt quite angry with them but , as with most companies , if they are taking your money they are excellent , as soon as you owe them money or you want something from them they become quite rude !
neutral	they are better_than many providers ( i . e 0 ) but probably not the best out there , i think i stay with them out of habit , more_than because i get a brilliant deal with my contract .
neutral	my friends are staggered that i pay over £_00 pm and only receive free texts and my handset isn ' t all that either ( which i ' m stuck with for 00 mths !
neutral	).
neutral	been using them for years , loved the price_match guarantee , but on my last purchase they didn ' t accept the price_match and decided to charge me more .
neutral	be wary , i ' ll probably cancel my order and order it from the other source who is cheaper .
neutral	the delivery for boohoo has been great ( ordered twice ).
neutral	however the quality of the items is left to be desired .
neutral	they are quite cheap but the first item i ordered ( a white quilted jacket ) had black dots randomly on it .
neutral	i never returned it because it seemed like hassle but now i never order clothes and warn_people if they are contemplating it .
neutral	i bought some shoes and they ' re good quality but again unfortunately had a few random marks .
neutral	this means i won ' t be ordering items form here often .
neutral	with my most_recent order , i selected next_day delivery because i really needed it today , but it didn ' t arrive .
neutral	it wasn ' t a problem with the courier either ; i checked the bp website and they said it still hadn ' t dispatched more_than 00_hours_later even_though it ' s supposed to be guaranteed same day dispatch .
neutral	so be warned ; you may have to wait longer for your order than you ' ve been told .
neutral	that said , the products are generally good value for money .
neutral	i just wish they would expand their range a bit .
neutral	some nitrite - free beef jerky would definitely make me a customer for life :)
neutral	i order bed and mattress , i get the mattress without the bed ... and they promising delivery of the product in 00_hours ..
neutral	still they have in stock those beds and keep selling them and i waiting for my bed 000 hours and on the order tracking says - awaiting shipping and nobody telling_me when i get my order , nobody answering the phone , and on my emails just a reply with working hours , it was my last time when i buy something from world stores
neutral	if they don ' t care about the clients it should be your last place for shopping
neutral	finally i get my bed :)
neutral	the website was quick and easy to use , the main thing that let my experience with double0_tickets down was that the tickets did not arrive until very last_minute and i found myself on the phone to them various times having to try and trace where my tickets were to ensure they would arrive in time .
neutral	i found the customer_service quite poor as the woman seemed vey unsure and gave me false information about when i would receive the tickets .
neutral	she also seemed very against the idea of changing the address to that on my hotel so that i would definitely have the tickets in time , as this may have caused more hassle for her .
neutral	saying this , i have finally got my tickets today in special delivery but any later then i would have been unable to go to the concert which i payed just under £_000 for .
neutral	the only good thing is that it `_s cheap .
neutral	the seats on the plains sometimes smell .
neutral	still better_than ryanair though .
neutral	dan
neutral	the site is fairly easy to use , better_than all these so called ' chep flight ' sites that just send you to easyjet or ryan_air ' s websites .
neutral	jst be_careful about the baggage_allowance , insurance , car_hire etc they try to sell you along the way .
neutral	international services definitely requires improvement .
neutral	prices need to bejustified
neutral	a group of 00 lads on stag wanting to have a good time !
neutral	having shelled out all that money , we would have expected more !
neutral	chilli_sauce did not have to do any of the leg work as we told them what we wanted , thye priced it up and we went with it .
neutral	not a good experience , will not book again and will tell friends and family not to book with cs either , suggest trying red seven ( sufficient good experience )
neutral	i like itunes but it has got very expensive .
neutral	i recently ordered a brake roller repair kit and a custom designed poster .
neutral	the poster was designed and a proof sent for my approval within hours and the design was perfect first time .
neutral	the only thing that let the order down was that the repair kit and poster were send in the same parcel and due to the weight of the repair kit the poster arrived with several creases in it and doesn ' t look 000_%.
neutral	for the price i would have expected it to arrive in a cardboard tube at_least .
neutral	i found it dissapointing that i could not get a sample on the internet before ordering .
neutral	when i phoned to find out about it i got told different reasons .
neutral	the first time they were going to send me a copy for free .
neutral	then the second time i phoned because via e . mail they were unwilling to send me one , the person i spoke to was quite rude and told me a different_story to the first person i spoke to .
neutral	the only reason i ordered from this website is because i can not find the same invitations anywhere_else but i wont be using the website again .
neutral	the poor website design hampers the experience of shopping on this site .
neutral	i used to shop from here regularly but the website re - design over the past_year or so makes the experience frustrating .
neutral	i ordered home mobile_broadband with the 00day rolling_contract but the process was far from smooth .
neutral	it took multiple phone_calls with different advisors to get my order processed and neither advisor was clear about the pricing of the package .
neutral	i had one salesman continuously try to sell me additional sim_card which would save me some money - but i had to repeat that i did not want this and wanted the mobile_broadband only .
neutral	the actual service has been good so far but getting there was a pain to say the least .
neutral	the actual product and delivery were good and on time but i had problems placing my order .
neutral	my first attempt resulted_in an_email and a text the following_day saying there was an issue with the order , after being on hold for about 00mins i finally got through only to be told that there was a problem with my payment and i would have to place another order .
neutral	it would have been much more efficient had they just said this in the email to begin with .
neutral	after figuring_out my billing_address was incorrect on my saveonlaptops account i went to change it only to find there was no option to do this on the website .
neutral	the account management tool on the website is very poor and i was forced to create a new account again to place the order .
neutral	i feel that an improvement to the website and the way in which order problems are communicated would be very beneficial for future customers .
neutral	prices on products are great but the shipping is pretty high .
neutral	i can usually make out cheaper on large purchases from supplementwarehouse . com , but the discounts are not enough on small orders .
neutral	well_organised , user_friendly and reasonably_priced will be taking a look at other courses on offer staff always available to help .
neutral	hat the hidden_costs , but still the cheapest !
neutral	et très bon tarifs .
neutral	mais la prestation en a été autrement .
neutral	la voiture , louée via hertz , était dans un état déplorable , sale et avec_des détritus a l ' arrière .
neutral	peu satisfaisant .
neutral	i recently went to tenerife with a friend and the company gave me all i needed for a cheap flight and cheap accommodation .
neutral	however , when we arrived in playa las americas the hotel had no_idea who we were and was unaware of any booking ...
neutral	bearing in mind we arrived at nearly 00pm so it was nearly the end of our night and we had nowehere to stay .
neutral	luckily the hotel staff were very helpful and we were transferred to a much_nicer , larger hotel for free ...
neutral	result !
neutral	i love the speed in which you can order things from next .
neutral	i hate the way they automatically gave me a next store card .
neutral	i did not want a store card and yet i couldn ' t pay for my things until a month later when my store card statement arrived .
neutral	really annoying .
neutral	some of the palest foundations were still very orange and muddy looking
neutral	my name was spelt wrong on the cheque so had to he sent back therefore delaying cashing of the cheque
neutral	overall prices are higher then competitors .
neutral	however - worth to check for offers .
neutral	especially with discount coupons .
neutral	great delivery service .
neutral	finally received my order after 00 working_days .
neutral	happy .
neutral	apologies for the previous comments . make correction that the delivery may take up to 0 month or more to make people aware . i bought different argain oil , but will be keeping this from wowcher us well .
neutral	their website just isn ' t very well_done , its often tedious to find things , and it takes a long time to add things to cart .
neutral	also , their shipping_costs are outrageous .
neutral	however , they have phenomenal deals on products that keep me coming_back for more .
neutral	flowers where a gift to my nan for her_birthday and she loved them along with the little cake we included however they where delivered a day earlier_than requested when we kne she would not be in so nan had to go and collect them herself which wasn ' t great .
neutral	too expensive , and can not cancel the order before wtf
neutral	had a text_message_saying funds had been transferred , nothing has arrived in my account !
neutral	now thinking cashgenie will still try and take the repayment even_though i didn ' t recieve the loan .
neutral	i would still use the online shopping service provided but am aware of possible occasional disappointment .
neutral	usrd this co a few_times and helped_me out when needed .
neutral	horse - lovely
neutral	zebra - amazing
neutral	ostrich burger - so tasty
neutral	ostrich steak - they didn ' t send any :( and all they would do is put a credit on my account but i ' ll never order again and i feel ripped_off .
neutral	thought the prices were steep !
neutral	paid 0x the face_value without knowing until the tickets arrived .
neutral	im sure the event will be great but i probably wouldnt use again .
neutral	dont like to be ripped_off .
neutral	upgrade nag screens ruin my experience of bd .
neutral	you have no business spamming me like that - as a result i will not be renewing .
neutral	the prices are good compared to other_places , but what is wrong with there delivery options ?!
neutral	i ordered a in - stock rat 0 mouse , delivery was expected after 00 - 00 working_days !
neutral	ridiculous_amount of time required !
neutral	overall , i would recommend that you try them out at_least once for the good range of flavours they have - which was my primary reason for using them .
neutral	just allow a few extra days for delivery and hope that you ordered a good flavour :)
neutral	i will most_likely use them again thanks to some of their prices and range of flavours , just hope next time the flavours i choose taste more like they should be ;)
neutral	i used twice the service of booking . com and from customers point of view all was good .
neutral	however after_speaking with couple of friends working in hotels , i got a different perspective of booking . com methods , that are very aggressive , particularly against small independent hotels .
neutral	a huge_range of products available but no depth of customer_service ; the whole experience feels very impersonal .
neutral	no_frills , cheap flights to european destinations .
neutral	when price is more important than luxury .
neutral	i ordered £_000 worth of pc parts to build a pc from aria as i found their site yet again very easy to use as i have the last 0 or 0 times i have bought products from them .
neutral	i have never had an issue with the website , delivery of the items or the items that were delivered ( i . e .
neutral	no faults ).
neutral	unfortunately i was given a fan which had a fault with one of the wires into the connector .
neutral	i thought that i would call their customer_service to thought things out , only to hear that you can ' t return items over the phone .
neutral	i thought this was rather peculiar and questioned further about the return of the item .
neutral	i was told i would have to pay for the item to be sent back unless i wanted to come into the store , but before 0pm .
neutral	i thought this was strange again and then discovered that they are allowed 00 days to check for a fault .
neutral	so having received every part for the pc within_00hours of ordering it from the website , i could then potentially be without the faulty part for 0 weeks allowing for delivery .
neutral	i informed aria about the problem through their website and explained i could not afford to send the item back and that coming into the store before 0pm would prove probably too difficult .
neutral	i was immediately sent a code to put on a package to return the item , to then find out that i still had to pay to send that package and i had just received the standard returns and delivery procedure offered by aria .
neutral	i personally believe this has been a poor customer_service and response to a customer who has spent in excess of £ 0000 at aria over the last 00 months all over a £ 0 000mm fan .
neutral	it ' s the first fault i have had with any part yet i believe aria have failed to deal with the problem in an adequate way .
neutral	my friend ordered a part off amazon , it was faulty , they sent him a fresh one out with the return instructions and paid postage included .
neutral	that is the kind of customer_service which is acceptable .
neutral	it didn ' t take 0 weeks until he had a working part , he didn ' t have to call up to be told he had to return it online , he didn ' t have to complain_about their service and he wasn ' t ignored by their customer_service team in addition to not having to pay any return costs despite aria informing_me they could refund any postage for it for up to £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	overall i believe amazon won with their customer_service as well as providing by enlarge lower prices .
neutral	i wonder where i will be tempted to get my pc parts from in the future ...
neutral	have brought from amazon many_times and mostly i find good prices and delivery but have also had some issues in the past when the goods aren ' t shipped by amazon themselves but via other sellers .
neutral	i brought a digital slr camera earlier this year which i didn ' t realise until afterwards was actually being sold by a company in germany via amazon .
neutral	the delivery due date came and went and when i contacted the seller they told me it had been lost in the post and that they would refund me !
neutral	to be fair they refunded me quickly and no harm done but my advice would be to check the good are actually being sold by amazon and not one of their partners .
neutral	also its a shame amazon don ' t pay proper taxes in the uk - will think_twice before making large purchases there again .
neutral	i ordered a nook which i was expecting within a day or two .
neutral	however the stock ran out but staff was corteous enough to call me and let me know and gave me a choice to cancel my order .
neutral	great service , quite fresh and lovely flowers .
neutral	ordered it for my friends birthday and it was a surprise .
neutral	she loved it but when i saw the greeting card i was disappointed .
neutral	instead of nice greeting card which i paid for , it was the free card which was sent to her .
neutral	it was too_late to do anything so i had to just deal with it and say nothing about it .
neutral	i would definitely buy flowers again but would not trust with anything_else .
neutral	groupon do a lot of good deals , offering nice savings on items and days out etc .
neutral	but a lot of their deals ( on physical items especially ) are just over - hyped .
neutral	they say you ' re saving 00_% but in fact if you shop around a bit the saving is more like 00_% or even 0 .
neutral	for example , i bought a hoody for £_00 instead of £_000 .
neutral	so a big saving right ?
neutral	well it turns_out the deal was by a rip - off company who sells at stupid prices .
neutral	i wasnt actually saving any money since i could ' ve got the hoody at the same price from the manufacturer online .
neutral	the occasional gem does pop up so i always visit every day .
neutral	£_00 for a round of golf for two was the best deal ive_seen .
neutral	we bought 0 of those vouchers and saved a good £_00 during the summer golfing season !
neutral	game . co . uk is just ok .
neutral	speedy free delivery on their many products .
neutral	they offer reward_points on purchases which are nice .
neutral	the company also tends to have exclusive offers such as the special ' epic ' edition of gears of war 0 .
neutral	their negatives are :
neutral	0 ) their lack of customer_service ( in my case anyway ).
neutral	i messaged them twice about minor things and they didnt respond .
neutral	this is rather worrying - what if i ever have a real problem ?
neutral	0 ) their prices are normally quite uncompetitive .
neutral	you just can ' t charge £_00 for a game that has been out for over a year !
neutral	0 ) many items such as older games and action figures are out of stock all the time .
neutral	pre_- ordered xbone expecting it to be delivered the day before or at_least at an acceptable time on launch day .... paying close to £ 0 for delivery to have it arrive at nearly 0pm when i could have ordered elsewhere and picked_up at the previous midnight i find dissapointing
neutral	delivery was very quick , although the driver did have to phone my partner to find her address , which spoilt the surprise somewhat - he could have phoned me or just checked google_maps etc ...
neutral	also , the flowers looked fairly tired , which is a shame because at £_00 i ' d have expected better frankly .
neutral	this is the second time i ' ve been disappointed with seranta ; i won ' t be using them again .
neutral	i was happy with the product i purchased but delivery was very slow .
neutral	i personally find the site a nightmare to navigate .
neutral	the search feature is next to useless .
neutral	it ' s easier to use the ' site :' operator on google (" keyword " site : amazon . co . uk )
neutral	the recent ( not that recent ) feature update that allows anyone to sell on amazon also unnerves me a little_bit .
neutral	i use amazon because it is a big company that i can trust and is generally cheap , but i find it miss - leading when amazon is ' displaying ' a product that they do not sell .
neutral	they only get 0_stars because when i do order , it ' s fairly cheap , items usually get dispatched before the expected date , and the free super_saver delivery is actually pretty quick !
neutral	i placed an order on the 00th of december and was promised delivery on the 0rd of january , on the 0nd of january i received an_automated email_saying my delivery date had been changed which annoyed me but i thought because of the busy christmas_period etc this could not be helped so let it go .
neutral	then on the 0th of january i received another automated email_saying they could not deliver again , i thought this was very poor and didn ' t even tell me when my order would be delivered !
neutral	so i emailed customer_service and to be fair the guy who dealt_with my complaint was very professional and explained why my items had been delayed and offered to split my order so i could receive part of my order .
neutral	what annoyed me the most was advertising items on their website which can be delivered by a certain_date but cannot follow this through because the item are not in stock ??
neutral	anyways i ' ve been promised these items tomorrow but we shall see , i doubt ill use g0m again .
neutral	needs to be a better / fairer middle_man .
neutral	fees way too high .
neutral	paypal takes a lot too .
neutral	need a competitor badly .
neutral	will not let you withdraw decimals !
neutral	so winnings were £_000 . 00 .
neutral	wouldn ' t let me withdraw the 00p .
neutral	fix that , and they would be decent .
neutral	had good and bad_experiences with the company .
neutral	when it works , great .
neutral	( slow delivery though )
neutral	main problem is that , twice , i have been sent the wrong product .
neutral	first time , i was sent a fake ' replica ' item .
neutral	did get a refund .
neutral	second item i received a wrong product , it was a bigger version of the one requested .
neutral	customer_service is great .
neutral	however , they have to contact the supplier , so it all takes a lot of time to go through the stages .
neutral	most of the time , saving a few pounds from amazon isn ' t worth it .
neutral	great site , well made .
neutral	however , companies can claim against all reviews that don ' t put an order number !
neutral	seems bonkers as most won ' t take the time to come back to update proof !
neutral	definitely not somewhere i shop often , however was surprised to see how many people actually in the store !
neutral	very busy despite the poor prices on most items .
neutral	well firstly , this was meant to be a supprise , but the delivery failed as no access to the building , i questioned this , as the building is fully staffed from 0am - 0 :_00pm and had a reception with directions to deliver , i was told that the package was mis_- scanned and the driver came back and delivered the parcel within an_hour of my complaint .
neutral	serenataflowers did a great job , flower are lovely and the girl i sent them too really really loves them , however her special supprise was ruined when i was forced to phone her before they eventually arrived to be on the lookout for a package .
neutral	not happy with the delivery company .
neutral	after hearing such positive_reviews about this company i decided to proceed with my order of selling my ipod_nano .
neutral	initial estimate of £_00 seemed very good indeed compared to other 0rd_party companies , however i then received an_email to say that it had ' less_than 0 scratches on the front ' and decreased the value to £_00 . 00 , although still a fair price i accepted , but i know for a sure that the equipment was in pristine_condition when it left , so i would like to know where the ' scratches ' appeared from .
neutral	would i recommend them ... most_likely as it was a smooth_transaction .
neutral	nice pizza , too expensive
neutral	would have been 0_stars but as the database on there side has been down so unable to save my progress .
neutral	all in all a very enjoyable course & will_definately use again in the future ( hope there system comes back online by then !)
neutral	great idea but when withdrawing money you dont get all of it they keep some after advertising on the site it costs notjing as they make their money from advertising which is lies
neutral	the shirts are outstanding , so much so i ' ve purchased 00 of em '.
neutral	the service provided is another issue all together ... no matter what shirt you buy it never seems to be in stock .
neutral	0 weeks appears to be standard for delivery know matter what you want .
neutral	dunno if this is just so that my money is sitting in there account for a while for whatever_reason .
neutral	even if by chance one of your shirts are ready & you happen to have purchased 0 , they will wait_until the other is ready before delivery , coincidently around the 0 week mark .
neutral	also .. they wont inform you of any of this , its not until you loose patience & phone up & ask that you ' ll get any information out of them .
neutral	i ' ve come to the conclusion that there ' s one person out the back making shirts on a loom .
neutral	my record so for is fastest - 0 0 / 0 weeks , slowest - 0 weeks .
neutral	the shirts are fantastic , the rest is just frustrating .
neutral	i find that theres not enough information on what products they regularly sell , only information on the special_offers
neutral	ordered some sunglasses after finding a great deal on groupon ( props to that guys ) on a sunday_night .
neutral	the order processing took a little longer_than_expected which is fair as the deal must be very popular .
neutral	my main problem with my order was that in ups .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they delivered my order to an entirely random address where i don ' t live .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they promised to collect the mis_- routed parcel and delivery to the correct address on the same day ... and didn ' t .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they finally delivered my parcel , but to a neighbour without leaving a card at my address !
neutral	and this was all in the middle of the queen ' s jubilee weekend so my sunglasses will have been floating around some ups van / picking centre for almost a week .
neutral	not good ... but hey , that ' s not sunglasses_shop ' s fault .
neutral	also , the instant message chat help service isn ' t working too well .
neutral	i was passed around 0 separate operators and ended_up giving up and calling to get help when tracking incorrectly delivered order .
neutral	transaction_id :_0000000
neutral	a few hours ago , i purchased two tickets for the kanye west show at hammersmith apollo this sunday ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
neutral	after_reading reviews for viagogo on various websites , i am now close to tears at what seems to be the inevitable prospect of losing a couple of hundred quid .
neutral	i wish i hadn ' t purchased them in the first place .
neutral	after paying £ 0 . 00 for " express delivery ", i assumed i would be receiving the tickets by this friday at the latest .
neutral	however , i ' m now extremely doubtful this will happen .
neutral	the quality of the furniture is fantastic and we love our new dining_set and nest of tables .
neutral	however , the customer_service team are poor .
neutral	i called twice to change the contact phone number , and add an additional mobile number , neither of which were added to the delivery instructions .
neutral	this resulted_in the delivery can waiting outside my house ( due to a cancellation ) and a subsequent voicemail to the original phone number ( which we changed as i don ' t get any signal on my mobile at work ).
neutral	the delivery driver sounded a bit hacked off , but i explained that it was the fault of the customer_services .
neutral	good job the driver hung around until somone was coming to the house .
neutral	my partner wanted some funky patterned wellies for triumphant victory in the schoolyard fashion competition .
neutral	she bought almost exclusively on design ( pattern ) rather_than functionality or price but we were pleasantly_surprised at the price of those she chose in the end .
neutral	delivery was very quick , no_qualms about the service at all , but we can see why they were so cheap .
neutral	the pattern is fine and i ' ve no doubt they ' ll keep her feet dry but they ' re an awful shape .
neutral	loads of ' bagginess ' at the calf that folds when you walk .
neutral	they ' re almost comical .
neutral	it ' s a shame for her as she wanted wellies people would turn to look at , now she ' s panicking that they might do exactly that !
neutral	tip : know what you ' re buying ..!
neutral	!
neutral	oh , and care less what your peers think .

neutral	i can not understand how it seems to take so long for the tickets to be dispatched .
neutral	as i know these tickets have been released and people on ebay seem to have them in there hands already .
neutral	i would prefer some update on my order states as the website is crap at this even the track your order page !!
neutral	as reading the reviews below its not looking promising
neutral	to your reply 0 days before the event is taking the mick as i know the person selling the tickets will already have them in they were released months_ago how do i know to trust the person who is selling the tickets , have you not noticed the other reviews you have here stating that people have had problems with getting tickets in the past i do not see many happy customer reviews
neutral	have been using pet_supermarket for a while now and not had any_problems until my last order .
neutral	for some reason our company name was not put onto the box so the delivery company were unable to deliver without speaking to us and rearranging .
neutral	instead of us receiving the food we ordered on the saturday , it was monday before it arrived .
neutral	not a major issue , but one that meant we had to buy food elsewhere to cover the gap .
neutral	prices are not much cheaper_than other_places to be honest .
neutral	probably wont order again .
neutral	liked it , good service
neutral	slow process and still_haven ' t got my cheque after 00 days !
neutral	the items were collected on the 00st_march and still havn ' t had my cheque even_tho they did email me on the 00th_april saying it will be with me the next working day - that was a week_ago and no sign of it .
neutral	they also state there processing time is 00 days , it has been 00 !
neutral	i have no emailed them asking if my cheque may of been lost and waiting for a reply
neutral	if they do finally pay up i will have no problem with the delay as i am in no rush for the money , but there website should state that the payment can take up to a month !
neutral	i first purchased a 0000 rolex sub from watchfinder in may 0000 but not quite happy with the watch ( even_though this does not reflect on the fine service provided by tommor holland initially ) i continued searching watchfinder web_site and up came a 0000 sub which was my sons birth year . having made enquiries about part ex the 0000 sub with the 0000 with sam beer a deal was struck and i sent off my watch to watchfinder . a couple of days_later i recieved a call from jonathan brett saying i had to pay an extra £_000_pounds due to the watch having a small chip on the glass , now this is the problem . this chip was already on the watch when i recieved it ( in the 0 weeks of owing the watch it has been stored well and only worn twice ) thinking that due to the cheap price this is what you obviously get , obviously this was missed before sending out to me or some member of staff is telling porkie pies .
neutral	my 0000 sub is great but i feel that watchfinder have squeezed an extra £_000 from myself and that has left me with a slight bad taste !!
neutral	!
neutral	ok so i loved sky go when it came out and the recording aspect .
neutral	problem is that sky is far too expensive for what it is .
neutral	the films are 0 - 0 years old unless you want to pay for box office .
neutral	the other channels just don ' t float the boat , 000 channels and nothing on .
neutral	the only thing i now watch is the footie 0 - 0 times per_month , so i ' ll be off down the pub and will get properly oiled on the £_00 i give to sky .
neutral	some pretty good prices , but hate that you have to sign_up with a paypal account .
neutral	i received the printer i ordered promptly , although a kind neighbour came to my door to inform me that it had arrived there the day before .
neutral	i hadn ' t met my neighbour before , so it was a good job she was honest , otherwise i may never have seen my printer !
neutral	the printer works_fine , and so far i haven ' t had to sample the aftersales service .
neutral	i ordered 0 chairs and 0 desks .
neutral	my email to ask for delivery date was not replied .
neutral	and no one contacted me for delivery of chairs in_advance .
neutral	however , i was contacted in_advance for the separate delivery of 0 desks .
neutral	although it was confirmed that the delivery would be in morning , the lorry didn ' t appear in morning .
neutral	when i called the company , i was told that it will be delivered in late_afternoon .
neutral	close to 0pm , i called again and was told to wait for call back .
neutral	no one called back and the desks were not delivered either .
neutral	in the following_day , the lorry turned_up unexpectedly .
neutral	the problem to me is some extra days off work to wait for the deliveries .
neutral	then i found that the desk size was not what i expected .
neutral	i checked the invoice , and it is very likely my mistake .
neutral	so i asked to return the desks .
neutral	i was told to pay £_00 +_vat for returning the desks , which in my opinion is quite expensive for £_00 +_vat desk .
neutral	as i ' m putting in a replacement order , so the collection can be done with new delivery .
neutral	so i asked whether the costs can be reduced .
neutral	i was told they will still charge the same amount .
neutral	this policy is not totally unreasonable but could be more considerate to customers .
neutral	used to because the portion sizes are shrinking , but the meal prices are increasing .
neutral	nevertheless , still amazing food
neutral	good but a bit_pricey and delivery wasn ' t rapid .
neutral	order clothes that came very quick ( ordered on sunday they came tuesday ).
neutral	one item was missing ... when i put the order in it said low stock ... and the item did not arrive , so i worked out they didn ' t send it and lucky refunded me for the item without having to ask .
neutral	failed to inform me that they were not going to send that one item .
neutral	i will use them again .
neutral	good website .
neutral	bought a bra , and only after paying was i informed they didn ' t have it in stock .
neutral	disappointing having to wait so long for it , as i wouldn ' t have ordered it if i ' d known it was out of stock
neutral	i should start by saying that the laptop i ordered , was itself fantastic and in perfect working order .
neutral	however , for a 0 - 0 day build , it took 00 days for me to receive it , over twice the expected when you factor in shipping .
neutral	on top of the late delivery , the mouse i ordered was not included nor was any explanation as to why it wasn ' t included , i was forced to call their support_team myself and enquire , only to be told that they were awaiting stock and then that the mouse i had ordered had been_discontinued .
neutral	arrangements should have been made to inform me that this was the case .
neutral	that being said , the people themselves were very pleasant and not at all defensive .
neutral	the matter was resolved swiftly and with no hassle , although i did have to wait for a while before my call was answered .
neutral	haivng had two parcels from amazon recently dropped over the back fence , the second lanfding in the snow and being left for the weekend by initial review would be much lower .
neutral	( amazon replaced the damaged goods without any fuss - proves how cheap hdnl must be !)
neutral	however since my partner caught one of the drivers and had a discussion they have since started leaving our parcels with neighbours .
neutral	i aplaude the thinking that leaving the parcel in a secure place would be helpful and they didn ' t leave it in plain sight , but sadly this was let_down by the fact they could no see over the fence and obviously had no consideration for the contents of the parcels .
neutral	whilst they continue to undercut the post_office amazon will still be using them so the problems will_continue .
neutral	my advice - help the drivers apply some common_sense and ask for parcels to be left with a neighbour .
neutral	they paid out for all of my items that i sent , which i was happy with .
neutral	however the courier didn ' t turn_up on the day they were supposed to after waiting from 0am_till_0pm .
neutral	i emailed to ask why they had n ' t arrived .
neutral	that worked and they came few hours_later .
neutral	when they turned_up i said i thought she was coming the day before she just shrugged .
neutral	the process of the stuff getting there , being_processed and sending the check is fast approaching a month and am still_waiting .
neutral	having used chilli - sauce for my hen_weekend last_year with some minor hiccups ; ( chilli - sauce didn ' t confirm go_karting numbers until last_minute even_though provisionally booked 0 months prior , so indoor go - karting became out - door as not enough karts at completely_different venue , * however they apologised and compensated ) i recommended them to a friend .
neutral	when my friend booked with chilli - sauce she specifically requested the ibis hotel at explore lane bristol and we ' d stayed there on mine and loved how close it was to prism which was in our event .
neutral	however around 0 weeks prior we ' d discovered the ' rep ' had booked the ibis hotel at temple - meads .
neutral	the rep wouldn ' t except responsibility and was adamant the hen didn ' t request explore lane when we were all there that day and know she did .
neutral	we ended_up having to go to the travel lodge hotel instead which alright was only 0 minutes walk extra but the stress would ' ve been easily avoided if communication would ' ve been sent via_email soon as it was booked .
neutral	overall they did ' good '
neutral	placed an order with garden best buys .
neutral	over a week_later , i ' d had no communication from them ( apart_from a ' rate your experience ' email , ironically ).
neutral	i emailed to ask if my order had been dispatched , and when i might expect to receive it .
neutral	only then was i informed that the item was out of stock , and offered a refund .
neutral	in fairness , the customer_service was good once i got in touch , and the refund was given immediately .
neutral	but the fact that the plant was out of stock , and i received no notification until i chased the order was disappointing .
neutral	all my friends and i had heard of gak , so when i said i ' d been ordering my next guitar from there , it was no big deal .
neutral	i placed my order and got my confirmation e_- mail , and my account was debited .
neutral	the next e_- mail i received was completely unexpected , it was telling_me that , even_though the product was listed on the site , even_though they ' d let me place my order , even_though there was no indication that the product was out of stock , it was in fact , out of stock .
neutral	not only this , but it wouldn ' t be in stock until 0000 .
neutral	i needed it in time for xmas .
neutral	so i accepted this , these things_happen .
neutral	but then it suddenly occurred to me , that now i needed to wait for my refund to come through before i could buy a replacement .
neutral	in no way am i blaming gak for the time it took for the refund to come through , i know there is multiple factors that can contribute to a few_days delay in refund , but the fact is this delay could have been avoided had gak not falsely advertised a product on their site .
neutral	the site should indicate beside the product that it is out of stock but i ' ll receive it in the next delivery and when that delivery is .
neutral	i essentially paid for a promise , the promise that one day , i would receive my guitar , but not any time soon .
neutral	i have always used gak as a sort of catalogue for products , whenever i ' m in the market for a new musical instrument i look on there , because it has literally everything .
neutral	now i understand , they don ' t actually have all those products , they just have the ability to order them in one day if you happen to be foolish enough to order it without ringing them first .
neutral	so my negative_review is based on gaks misleading website .
neutral	i could have rated it lower but i do believe i may use gak again , but i will 000_% phone or e_- mail first to check the availability of the item i require .
neutral	the prices are sometimes cheaper_than elsewhere but can cause hassle , shipping times can be good or very poor .
neutral	i found that i couldn ' t save items to my basket which was so annoying when i wanted to order something later , also i believe they don ' t have a paypal option which causes hassle and made me feel unsafe .
neutral	the site itself is a good idea and reasonably easy to navigate after a while however the constant changes with lack of respect for what the users want is disgraceful .
neutral	especially with the new ' timeline ' major changes that affect the users are forced upon them and make the site confusing and annoying however it is still a good place to connect to friends you can ' t see in person a lot .
neutral	although the website is a little hard to navigate and the pictures are not the best quality the clothing and items are very nice when received .
neutral	my order was a little delayed however nothing major .
neutral	some of the sizing can come up a little weird ( ever when measured by their size guide ) however the quality is good .
neutral	i had published my review about the company called roompaddy about tricking their customers in booking a room to rent which doesn ’ t exist and then charge full sum of money from their accounts in_advance without them even knowing about it , then refuse to refund it trying to buy the time for the money to sit on their accounts .
neutral	i wrote a short review which soon was removed because roompaddy made a complaint about it .
neutral	a couple of days_later i have received an_email from <_private data_removed > asking to provide some proof that transaction has taken place and only then to reinstate my review .
neutral	i have provided the required documents without delay , but my review was not published and <_private data_removed > requested to modify my review because he said there was not enough information about the whole_process between me and roompaddy .
neutral	i have explained that my review was genuine and it reflected my experience showing how i felt about it .
neutral	but <_private data_removed > still insisted that review should have been modified promising to publish my review as soon as i do it .
neutral	soon after i have modified my old review and put more information into it .
neutral	but <_private data_removed > did not keep his promises and made an unbelievable third request to modify my review stating that “ scam ” is a swear word .
neutral	i could not believe such ridiculous statement made by <_private data_removed > and was appalled by his unhealthy interest to keep my genuine review out , hassling me with his emails with overwhelming demands , making false_promises he did not keep .
neutral	now i can see that other people had the same experience as me and managed to post their comment .
neutral	my review however has never been approved by <_private data_removed >.
neutral	london is famous as the place for knowledge since ages and there are hundreds of colleges and universities to serve the world and nation .
neutral	we are proud to be the citizens of this historic city of uk .
neutral	wanneer je het product zelf komt halen moet je zo lang wachten .
neutral	jammer dat deze shop al enige zoveel heeft dus wachten moet dan maar .
neutral	easy to book , pleasant staff and on - time flights .
neutral	just unfortunate , that they feel it is acceptable to charge for pre_- booking seats .
neutral	some stuffs can be really cheap
neutral	too expensive though
neutral	it ' s a good site for doing bookings , but many people use only for control clients telephone_numbers .
neutral	this is my first time using hostelbookers since 0000 .
neutral	the last time i used them was on a rtw trip during which , on more_than one_occasion i have arrived at a hostel with my hostelbookers reservation email , and the hostel has had no confirmation of the booking so rooms were not available or suitable , or in the worst situation we were charged the rack rate when it should have been the rate advertised .
neutral	i hope things have improved since then .
neutral	i can ' t really complain .
neutral	it arrived and was a good price compared to elsewhere .
neutral	however , it arrived 0 week_later than_expected due to it being out of stock ( i found this out by phoning up , but when i ordered and even when i spoke on the phone , it said it was in stock on their website ).
neutral	the other annoying thing is , i only received one email to confirm my order but then nothing from them on .
neutral	i had to constantly login to access the status of my order and the messages that had supposedly been sent to my email regarding the dispatch of my order , definitely weren ' t sent !!
neutral	anyway , like i say , it arrived and i ' m happy about that .
neutral	i think i probably would use again , but only if the price of any product i ' m wishing to buy is significantly_cheaper_than elsewhere , otherwise it ' s not worth the hassle .
neutral	but i also want to point out that this was just my experience and i ' m sharing it , however , there are probably people who had better experience and no doubt people who had worse , so you just have to take the majority i guess .
neutral	i bought the experience for " afternoon_tea at kensington palace " and found that :
neutral	a ) they send you a voucher in the post , which may take up to 0 days .
neutral	so if you are looking for something last_minute , do not buy from lastminute . com .
neutral	b ) the price " on the door " is actually cheaper_than buying with lastminute . com .
neutral	you also have more choice if you pay " on the door " as there are numerous different_types of tickets , and afternoon teas .
neutral	the experience itself was great , but i would not buy from lastminute . com again .
neutral	mixed feelings .
neutral	i was very excited once i ordered my tag_heuer 0000 because i have always been a huge_fan of tag_heuer .
neutral	after waiting from the 00th of february until the 0st of april the glasses finally arrived .
neutral	unfortunatly they were the wrong ones whoch looked completely_different to what i had ordered .
neutral	so i sent them back .
neutral	then a few_days_later i got an_email_confirming they had receved them and were sorting_out the lenses .
neutral	after those 0 days of sorting_out the lenses they had sent them off .
neutral	to my suprise they had sent them to the wrong part of the country despite having my adress .
neutral	after having the glasses sent back to them so they could send them off to the right person they finally got hear on the 0th of may .
neutral	i am extremely pleased with my glasses but as much as i love the product i would not take the risk going back .
neutral	overall thank_you very much and great email co - operation and friendly staff who are very useful .
neutral	i ' m happy with this site
neutral	have been on ebay for nearly 00 years , and live by it .
neutral	only slight_issue these days is that buyers seem to be under the impression that they don ' t have to pay if they win .
neutral	ebay always swing into sort , but it does create extra hassle and is putting me off selling that often on there .
neutral	i have been customer to this company for years although their prices are good i have to admit their cigs is useless
neutral	the service was average .
neutral	arrival - we travelled late arriving in turkey in the evening and had to wait the best part of an_hour for other passengers to arrive from their flight .
neutral	although the resort_hoppa representative was very friendly , we were extremely tired and had no real explanation of how much time we might have to wait .
neutral	departure - the app that we were told to download didn ' t allow us to find out our pick_up time , so i had to call them .
neutral	this was very tricky because the turkish representatives spoke little english and so i had to ask our hotel reception staff to speak with them for us .
neutral	all of this was pretty stressful at the end of our holiday , as we were panicking that we may need to arrange alternative transport .
neutral	booked a webmaster package for £_00 to help set_up and run my own business .
neutral	found the html and php sql training very useful .
neutral	the learning style did take me a while to get into but once i got it the course was quite addictive and i spent hours on it .
neutral	i then purchased their key 0000 skills course for the adobe dreamweaver package but found this completely_different , the style of learning was different and hard for me to follow .
neutral	they should follow the same training structure throughout all their courses as the video based stuff isn ’ t as good as the interactive courses .
neutral	emma was very helpful on chat today .
neutral	i use them about for 00 parcels a week , within 0 years i have only have about 0 minor hiccups and 0 parcels gone_missing , but again it ' s from about 000 parcels .
neutral	i definitely do not like the way how they scare you with insurance .
neutral	i understand it is where they make their money , but is not ethical to do it on our fear .
neutral	reasonable insurance / industry standard is more about 0 %, but they have it about 0 . 0 % from content value .
neutral	that insurance factor is the only reason they get 0 / 0 , otherwise it would be 0 . 0 / 0
neutral	oh_yeah .... it is somewhat hard to connect to customer_service chat .
neutral	the worst experience regarding delivery services !
neutral	still i gave it 0_stars due to a good soul working at the depot who did everything he could to sort out my problem .
neutral	monday_morning got a text_saying " your parcel will be with you today " as i was on my way to work , called in sick and ran home .
neutral	and waited , waited and waited , at 0pm decided to check the website and track my order , when to my surprise it says " your parcel was sent back as it was a duplicate order " huh_?
neutral	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn ' t think too much about it .
neutral	0 :_00pm came by and i finally decided to call a customer_service number i found online .
neutral	she then tells_me that i wasn ' t at home when the driver stopped by ...
neutral	what ?????
neutral	that ' s a lie !
neutral	have been on the sofa watching stupid tv_shows all day long waiting for the driver , he never came !!!!
neutral	she then checked the gps and it was confirmed that the driver had been nowhere_near my place .
neutral	she then tried to contact the driver unsuccessfully + the depot also unsuccessfully .
neutral	its now 0 : 00 and she tells_me she finishes at 0 and as she cant get thru the driver nor the depot i ' ll have to call back in the morning !
neutral	hahahaha you gotta be joking , keep trying !!!
neutral	i didn ' t miss work for nothing !
neutral	at 0 . 00 , after being on hold she finally manage to get thru to the depot and came up with a ridiculous story saying the driver had gone to the wrong_address and the person at that address had said they ' d already got their item .
neutral	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
neutral	i now had to call currys to sort out this issue in order for them to re - deliver my parcel and as they refused to allocate me a time_slot i then arranged for thursday .
neutral	thursday 0pm , still no parcel , i called customer_services again and to my surprise there is no record on the system regarding my parcel .
neutral	i called the depot and its is confirmed that my parcel hasn ' t been dispatched and also that they don ' t know where it is .... is this for real ???
neutral	i lost my temper and had a go at the person talking to me .
neutral	mr kwame then after apologizing a million times said he will find it and sort it out .
neutral	0 hours_later he called me back , he had located my parcel and was gonna send it to my house .
neutral	it arrived at 0pm .
neutral	thanks to mr kwame i didn ' t have to waste another day waiting for nothing .
neutral	everybody else i spoke with were useless , specially customer_service , if they can be called that .
neutral	by choice i ' ll never use them again .
neutral	i dont like how there isnt any paypal option to pay .
neutral	good variety of restaurants available on the site , with some new entries that i can ' t find on any of their competitors ' websites .
neutral	nothing special about the website as a whole .
neutral	they do offer some form of customer_service ( which i haven ' t tried ), but they take no responsibility for actually getting the food out to you .
neutral	can ' t see the functionality to store favourites , card_details , etc_., which would be good for repeat orders .
neutral	worth a visit though .
neutral	it has everything you need from asda , all your shopping needs for your everyday need .
neutral	though i have to admit i find the site a little time_consuming , and to be honest i do prefer to shop in - store , theres a little less choice in - store but your in and out in a time scale you want and you can pick the fresher packs .
neutral	i use game to purchase all my games for xbox wii etc ..
neutral	just a little disappointed that they are struggling and are closing most of there stores down .
neutral	i don ' t even know where my nearest store is anymore
neutral	over the recent months i have started to see the customer_services slip in my local_stores ; not to mention that the prices are creeping up and are become less competitive with other out lets .
neutral	because of this it means i have been looking elsewhere for my items and to be honest finding them cheaper and with better customer_service .
neutral	i am just generally un - happy with the overall service and value i now get from argos .
neutral	hi , i received the outfit reasonably quickly but when it arrived i noticed the dress had a hole on the seam .
neutral	i decided to not send the outfit back for an exchange as i was unsure if i would receive the replacement in time for when i needed it .
neutral	i do not fault the service and delivery but disappointing that the outfit was faulty when it arrived .
neutral	lynsey thomas
neutral	my first purchase was a black knitted dress from the site , the dress came in the post in a couple of days , very good delivery service !
neutral	however when i opended the parcel the dress was crumpled up in a plastic_bag inside and the material felt very cheap !
neutral	the fit was not very flattering and i felt that i could have bought the dress much cheaper with a better quality at a shop like primark !
neutral	the hasstle of returning the package to a collection shop and filling in the forms meant that i have ended_up keeping it !
neutral	i think the return_policy should be longer .
neutral	i would be wary of purchasing from the site again as my dress looked a lot better on the site , and for a garment that is so simple to get right i would be afraid to get anything_else !
neutral	the clothing on the site is quality and the pricing is reasonable enough .
neutral	however after recieving the wrong_size item i sent it back at my own_expense and was told to wait a maximum of 00 days to be processed .
neutral	it was processed on the 00th day and i was told the correct_size would be sent out as soon as possible .
neutral	00 days_later and still no sign of it in the post .
neutral	i have used the site before without any_problems but since this i have realised that their returns_policy is a joke .
neutral	has highly put me off using them again .
neutral	i have purchased from here a few_times for e_- cig liquids .
neutral	they are ok but i have had a few batches that didn ' t taste right .
neutral	i always order the same liquid but it ' s just not a consistent flavour .
neutral	the last one i purchased was so sweet it made me feel sick and has put me off .
neutral	i received my package on time however the packaging for the fragrance i bought was partially opened , wrinkled and damaged .
neutral	the item was bought as a present to someone_else , which makes it even more disappointing .
neutral	we have been dealing_with mdp for around 0 years and we have experienced many issues with them over the years .
neutral	mainly down to incorrect orders unfortunately .. often the products are wrong , aren ' t included , wrong sizes etc ..
neutral	but i do have to say they always sort the problems quickly and at their own cost .
neutral	parcels often arrive damaged , which you could put down to the delivery company or the thin boxes that are used .
neutral	we have tried to find other_companies who have an order process as easy as theirs but nothing compares at all ( including on price ) so we just stick with them and deal with the mistakes .
neutral	let me say before starting this review .
neutral	shop - to . net are still one of the best websites for buying your video_games from .
neutral	they are very hard to beat but .....
neutral	i have been using shop - to . net for over 0 - 0 years now and have a great knowledge understanding on how they work .
neutral	over the years with the growing population the service has suffered in my option .
neutral	for example .
neutral	i used to pre_- order games a lot from the site .
neutral	never would a game be processing over night .
neutral	it would always be dispatched the same day as processing .
neutral	to this day i don ' t understand_why games are being process overnight as no one is in the offices or warehouse !
neutral	since the website was updated ( sorry i cant remember when the update happen ).
neutral	it is really difficult to use and i find really confusing .
neutral	it never seems to load very well , even waiting over a minute sometimes for it to load a page of 00 games .
neutral	the forums were taking away and have never been replaced .
neutral	i used found them extremely_helpful .
neutral	even little matters i had , i could always ask the forum for help .
neutral	the forum moderators were fantastic .
neutral	but now gone .
neutral	i could go on but will stop here .
neutral	if you are new to shop - to . net it is one of the best game buying websites around and are hard to beat .
neutral	for me as a long time user i feel the standers have slipped .
neutral	i made mistake on tickets listing , i have pdf tickets , not a paper tickets , but listed as paper tickets .
neutral	tickets are sold , now i am asking what to do ?
neutral	sent printouts to buyer ?
neutral	and who can guarantee , that the printouts will not be multiplied , i will get my money ?
neutral	transaction_id_0000000
neutral	quick delivery really good service and simple to use
neutral	the prince0 foundation and practitioner course was good , although a bit too formal in its language and tone for my taste ( more practical examples would have provided more insight ).
neutral	the course is thorough and is logically structured .
neutral	i ' m sure the people behind it have given the material and the way it ' s presented a lot of thought .
neutral	the team behind e_- careers were helpful and accessible at all times by chat and e_- mail .
neutral	i did find , however , that the course itself came with a lot of non - mandatory , but highly_recommended extra - costs , such as buying a manual and exams .
neutral	this was , however , stated beforehand , but people need to be very aware of this when buying the course out of own pockets .
neutral	all in all , i found that the course was worth - while , although - for me personally - not as learning as a face - to - face course where the tone is more informal and questions are easier to ask in person .
neutral	the initial flights are reasonable but no better_than other budget_airlines however the hidden_charges are far worse in my opinion .
neutral	charges for a bag , check in online dont checkin online .
neutral	the comfort of the flights i have taken has generally been ok .
neutral	pre orded ps0 console in plenty of time to get on release day as surprise gift for husband .
neutral	then was going to leave it up to him to buy games as i cannot_afford them as well .
neutral	then a few weeks before launch ( when to late to pre order from anywhere_else ) was then advised that to be able to get order i would havd to change to a package including an extra controller which he would never use for extra £_00 .
neutral	ish or game and controller for extra £_000 . 00 ish .
neutral	so i had to ruin the surprise to be able to borrow money off husband and know what game to get .
neutral	felt bullied into buyinv more_than i wanted .
neutral	negative_feedback from my friends made me a stay_away from amazon , but the positive_feedback i read from forums made me write this comment .
neutral	i want to buy a watch from amazon but i am a little_bit_unsure_about the risks involved , like limited support from amazon or from third_party sellers .
neutral	anyhow , i will have to decide first .
neutral	good points : woolworths seems to attract you in as if there is something you think you may need or you may have actully thought it never had it
neutral	bad points : woolworths never seems to be open and all the shelves look bare these days .
neutral	low qualiy rubbish if it was their own_brand stuff especially tools
neutral	general comments : a fantastic shop with nothing that i ever feel worth buying
neutral	vistaprint is a useful site for me as a budding avon rep whose hands cramp something chronic after writing out my information 000 times on the order forms .
neutral	i have been able to pick_up a rubber stamp at a reasonable_price , and was lucky_enough to catch the free postage offer this time around .
neutral	i do rather object to the almost constant emails i have been receiving , however .
neutral	vistaprint , i will buy what i want when i want and need it , i do not need to be showered with emails about " special_offers just for you !!!
neutral	", which nine times out of ten are entirely irrelevant to me .
neutral	i will keep shopping there , because the products i have received * have * been of good quality ( and i really do need the stamps !).
neutral	i will be attempting business_cards next .
neutral	all - in - all , if you can handle getting a plethora of emails a couple of times a week , vistaprint are a good place to pick things up from .
neutral	i have used glasses_direct before and am always over the moon with the glasses i receive .
neutral	last time i ordered from them last_year there was an issue regarding the ' free tint ' offere they were running at the time .
neutral	rinning customer_services proved useless but my issue was dealt_with once i emailed .
neutral	i have recently had my eyes retested and found that my prescription had altered slightly so looked again at glasses_direct , all the frames i liked seemed pricey so i decided to try a few frames on a home_trial basis and wait for a groupon_voucher to come up .
neutral	luckily i didn ' t have to wait long and the same day my voucher came through i received an_email from glasses_direct saying they had a 00_%_off frames offer .
neutral	brilliant i thought , suddenly the frames i thought were out of my price range were affordable so i promptly ordered another home_trial to check the frames i wanted and placed an order .
neutral	unfortunately , like last time , the promotion was misleading and not available in conjunction with my groupon_voucher .
neutral	this put me in a difficult position as i had already paid for the groupon_voucher and so felt that rather_than waste the money on that i had to make the purchase .
neutral	i could have chosen less expensive frames but didn ' t want to be stuck with frames i didn ' t like .
neutral	i am now looking_forward to receiving my new frames , am just disappointed that once again i ' ve felt let_down by the incentives to purchase .
neutral	all in all great place to learn a new language .
neutral	sometimes i have problems with page loading and wont load some exercises , tried customer_services and did everything they recommended but still not loading recording exercises .
neutral	its annoying because i cant complete the tests .
neutral	i have used this site so many time for the information about latest fashion products i have also buy so many items from this site , and our product is really awesome .
neutral	placed my order using the 0 % match guarantee as well as coupon for $ 0 off , but even after this they only beat the competitor ' s price by less_than $ 0 .
neutral	shipping ate up my savings .
neutral	00_% fee just another name for booking_fee ?
neutral	thought there was no booking_fees ?
neutral	at_least prices were cheaper then the other website i checked though their tactics seem misleading ..
neutral	i did end up booking a few more others .
neutral	we ' ll see if my reservations are honored .
neutral	this shop is an okay one .
neutral	all the stuff is ridiculously over priced compared to other_sites like amazon . co . uk .
neutral	i only really use it if i need to get stuff quick and can ' t be bothered to search for a cheaper price .
neutral	i have had a few_times where i have reserved an item and got to shop to find that they are out of stock which is annoying .
neutral	well , i purchased " steelseries siberia " headphones and i assumed that everything would be nicely_packaged .
neutral	however , that was not the case .
neutral	it arrived in a very messy box , which had steelseries box inside , so that ' s understandable .
neutral	however , before opening steelseries box , i noticed some damage to the box and when i inspected the headphones , i saw plenty of dust and some " cloth particles "?
neutral	i ' m not quite sure how to describe them .
neutral	the plastic box on which the headphones were laying down was also damaged .
neutral	return transfer in mallorca didn ' t turn_up but after persistent emails to resorthoppa customer_services we were given a refund for the taxi fare we had to pay for to get to the airport on time .
neutral	not sure what the story would be if we had missed our flight .
neutral	i think it ' s important people realise resorthoppa are an agency for transfer companies so its not entirely their fault if a company is bad , they obviously do need to scrap some in mallorca altogether if they don ' t sort things out though .
neutral	we followed the procedure of confirming our pickup times etc .
neutral	everything was confirmed , we had the pickup time of 00 . 00 .
neutral	well 00 . 00 came and went .
neutral	got to 0 . 00 and we started panicking , tried to call the " emergency contact number " over 00 times and it just had an announcement in spanish on the other end .
neutral	we got a spanish speaker to help us and we found out the so called emergency number was just a mobile phone turned off .
neutral	it was like this all day .
neutral	we tried every other number that funnily_enough stopped_working , even_though it was fine the day before when we used it to confirm our pickup times .
neutral	it was like the transfer supplier had decided to just take a day off and turn off all their phones .
neutral	customer_service has been good since we sent in a complaint , shame that the transfer company in mallorca is unreliable and the actual service wasn ' t provided .

neutral	a week_ago i ordered a crocodile costume for my son ' s school assembly .
neutral	i needed it quickly so i chose next_day delivery .
neutral	sure enough the costume arrived bright and early the next morning - no_complaints there , although i do think £ 0 for delivery is a bit much !
neutral	( oops , i think that was a complaint !)
neutral	anyway , my son came home from school eager to try the costume on before the assembly .
neutral	normally i dont mind him wearing fancy_dress at home but this was a big_mistake .
neutral	the costume shed little green hairs everywhere he went .
neutral	a week ( and several_times around with the vacuum ) later and i ' m still finding them .
neutral	so straight after the assembly i had to lock the costume away in a cupboard and it won ' t be seeing the light of day again .
neutral	a [ 0 - year - old ] crying shame !
neutral	some of the highest prices in the e_- cig game but saying that there customer_service has alwayse been good and there red labell tobacco juice is next to none if they sorted there prices it would be a 0 * companny
neutral	verry good price !!
neutral	but the tast was verry unplesent :-( i had to add extra flavouring to get_rid of a very harsh and chalky taste but as i say verrry good price
neutral	i ' ve bought and sold on ebay many_times , and i think its a fantastic website once you know what your doing , but intially it will take a while to fatherm it out , which is a shame .
neutral	what else lets it down is obviously the ' con ' artists on the site that will sell you something that doesnt ever arrive or mislead you into buying things , but this is not ebay . co . uk ' s fault
neutral	my 0nd order was the biggest disappointment of any online purchase i ' ve made .
neutral	took over 0 weeks to receive my order , but it ' s hard to argue with their prices and ease of price_match .
neutral	if this new 0rd order can arrive within 0 - 00 days i ' ll change to 0_stars .
neutral	i visit chemicaluk every so often to look at the latest clothing as it ' s one of few places in the uk which fully promote street / skate wear brands .
neutral	i used to buy from the store quite regularly however i feel the emphasis has gone more towards typical high_street brands and styles rather_than sticking to it ' s original roots of streetwear and the pricing of new products when you include tax is at top end of the rrp .
neutral	the website has also now started to sell designer fashion wear which are at the top end price bracket rather_than promote the smaller low key streetwear brands which offer good value and something unique , i guess the unique element has gone_missing somewhere and it feels no different to any other menswear site online , which is not exactly a bad thing but is the reason_why i don ' t really shop at this store anymore .
neutral	the delivery is usually fast and efficient , easy check out service , great range of the latest music software etc , overall 0 out of 0 for the reasons stated above .
neutral	used these a few_times , prices are ok but service seems to have slipped a bit recently .
neutral	used to get my orders within 0 days , now it takes 0 - 0 days which is annoying when you want your stuff quickly .
neutral	order from gameseek all the time but this game never arrived to day after launch on the friday wasn ' t sent to the thursday very late in my opinion . everywhere_else order from the game arrives between 0 and 0 days before launch . if you don ' t mind waiting a extra day for your game i recommend gameseek if you like it on time or a little early order elsewhere .
neutral	the overall process was ok but the delivery charge is expensive and wasn ' t particularlyquick .
neutral	i ' m returning the boots i bought because they didn ' t fit , which at_least i can do in store but will lose out on delivery .
neutral	i wouldn ' t use ellis bvrigham online again .
neutral	i ' m not sure how i ' m supposed to rate a company before i receive the product that i ordered from them .
neutral	the website was a little tough to use .
neutral	none of my searches brought back results , so i had to manually search for everything , which was a pain .
neutral	but the prices are great , and that ' s what matters .
neutral	won ' t use again but was satisfactory
neutral	ok i have a mixed review here with some good points and bad points .
neutral	i have been saving up for a gaming_pc for a long time and a friend_recommended cyber_power .
neutral	i explored the market and found cyberpower to be the cheapest for what you get .
neutral	i was surprised at the amount of customization and really impressed with how simple it was to do .
neutral	i ordered my pc and within 00 days it arrived .
neutral	i was very impressed that i received a phone call to say it had been sent and a text asking me if i wanted to change delivery dates as well as a tracker sent to me to tell me the very hour it would arrive at my house .
neutral	all 0 / 0_stars for this aspect .
neutral	now the day it arrived i had a few friends over to all set_up the pc since we are a group of nerds and upon setting it up and turning it on a bsod came up .
neutral	i reset the computer and got the error_message checksum does not match computed checksum .
neutral	me and my friends tried to re install windows to fix this with no luck .
neutral	this really frustrated me because after forking_out the amount of money for this thing i expected it to work from the word go .
neutral	so in this aspect 0 / 0_stars .
neutral	so the next_day was a weekend so i could not phone tech_support but decided to email them .
neutral	a gentleman called chris mckay emailed me back pretty fast which i was surprised about because it was a weekend probably out of working hours too .
neutral	now chris was extremely_helpful and explained to me how to fix this issue through simple easy steps which worked through changing some of the profile settings in the bios and now i have a working pc .
neutral	overall cyber_power has excellent pricing , brilliant customization , brilliant service on delivery and amazing tech_support to say it was out of hours on a weekend .
neutral	downside the computer did not work on arrival which is a major flaw especially went i paid so much .
neutral	but mistakes_happen when building pc ' s , can ' t always get it perfect every time .
neutral	i ordered late on the 0th and it has yet to ship , of course payment was taken straight_away .
neutral	i was wary before ordering so i ordered £_00 ( 0 items / phone stuff ) so i ain ' t overly upset if it doesn ' t come .
neutral	i emailed them 0 days ago , took them today to answer .
neutral	they sounded polite , apparently it ' s because of the holiday so there ' s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there ' s no mention on the site ).
neutral	i shall see what happens from here .
neutral	update
neutral	i received my order a few_days ago and everything is as it was described on the site and came well_packaged .
neutral	however i ' m still annoyed from before .
neutral	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
neutral	whether they have delayed site updates or what i don ' t know why but whoever i emailed should have known my order was already shipped and never confirmed to me when it was shipped after i asked them to .
neutral	the site itself is not bad , they need better customer_service and to stop lying to customers about 00hour shipping that doesn ' t exist .
neutral	it ' s an alright shop but isn ' t anything special .
neutral	the clothes in my opinion can be a hit or miss and some items intended to look expensive are just tacky but have an extra £_00 added on .
neutral	they have some nice stuff because i ' ve bought a jumper there that looked lovely and also a pair of shorts aswell as basics but even these i could buy cheaper elsewhere at the same quality .
neutral	i attempted shopping online with them once last_year but the accidentally ( just bad luck ) canceled my order but left it a long time before telling_me so half of the stuff i wanted was sold out .
neutral	customer_service was okay however they agreed to give me a money off code because of the issue yet i never received this until i had to email them once again asking for it .
neutral	i haven ' t actually used it yet ( and i assume it will have expired by now ) but it was only 0 %_off anyway and i haven ' t seen anything online that i ' ve wanted to buy from them since .
neutral	i will shop at there stores from time to time but it just isn ' t really my favorite shop .
neutral	they finally emailed my code after about 00_hours , not what i was expecting at all .
neutral	but the code worked , and was the le version on top of it .
neutral	would i use sg again ?
neutral	not without_hesitation , but they are cheaper and just maybe i was just a bit unlucky .
neutral	the company issued an invalid price comparison and canceled my order .
neutral	after i sent an_email explaining how i achieved the price all they did was resend me the reason_why they cancelled the order and said to file another ticket .
neutral	i ' d rather pay the extra $ 0 or so for a supplier who will respond with a human response .
neutral	i paid for a return_flight
neutral	outbound
neutral	klm
neutral	manchester to lagos ( 0nd april_0000 - 0am departure time )
neutral	stop over at amsterdam
neutral	inbound
neutral	flight : klm
neutral	lagos to manchester ( 00th_april_0000 - about 00 . 00pm departure time )
neutral	payment included flight ticket , sms and mail alert as well as the premium package plan .
neutral	issue
neutral	i have been debited but still_haven ' t gotten my invoice and confirmation as well as detailed itinerary as i have scheduled on d site .
neutral	even you numbers provide are not reachable , this is becoming worrisome as i have been debited already . i have sent a full detailed mail with payment details to d email addy on your site service @ tripsta . co . uk
neutral	the transaction number designated to me by your mail delivery system is 0000000 .
neutral	kindly attend to this as this is of great concern .
neutral	i ' ve brought tickets ( thursday last_week ) for v_festival this weekend .
neutral	i ' m slightly_concerned with the delivery time .
neutral	we are planning to leave for the event on thursday but when should we actually expect the tickets ?
neutral	if they don ' t get posted until wed / thurs then we won ' t be able to leave and get there on time !
neutral	so how long do we leave it for tickets to get here before we look_elsewhere to purchase some more tickets ???
neutral	i ' ve noticed quite a few bad_reviews where people have not received their tickets !
neutral	any help appreciated
neutral	roses were well_packed and delivered on time but it was a very small and pretty shabby bunch for £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i could have got a much_better valentines bouquet for less_than half the price from morrisons .
neutral	it seems to be impossible but is true that official_iphone_unlock team can really unlock iphone s and they have been done 000 unlocks a day !
neutral	its just amazing !
neutral	printed some orders of service for a funeral and while they were extremely_helpful , efficient and had good prices the finished booklets all had a yellowish tint to them .
neutral	the blacks were clear and defined but the greys appeared faded / yellowish , which was a real_shame given the time it had taken to put_together .
neutral	it was acceptable but didn ' t look as professional as i had expected and due to the occasion i didn ' t have time to take them back for a refund / replacement .
neutral	i have two iphone0s which are locked by carrier .
neutral	one is softbank from japan and another one is us at & t .
neutral	two months_ago i tried pre_- order the japan iphone0s unlock .. until now still no news .. i tried email to u guys but didnt get any reply or refund .. i ' m very disappoint ..
neutral	yesterday i tried one more iphone to see whether the feedback of your customers is real or not .
neutral	so i bought the at & t iphone0s unlock service from you .
neutral	it goes well .
neutral	then what about my japan iphone0s ?
neutral	i can ' t get refund ?
neutral	why no reply ..
neutral	please reply me if you see this review .
neutral	but the way it ' s still lucky for me .. this site is not completely fake .
neutral	there are so many fake unlock web_site out there .. other_sites i tried to put incorrect / fake imei to test and they replied it ' s valid iphone and ready to unlock ... lame ..
neutral	i ' m sure the coach service they offer is very good , just be mindful to use a disposable email address when enquiring or booking via their website as " sophie " from national express will spam you relentlessly with " offers ".
neutral	this is the second time i have used glasses_direct .
neutral	the first time it took more_than 0 months for my glasses to arrive .
neutral	this time i have been sent the wrong glasses .
neutral	i need the glasses next week so will not have time to send them back for a replacement .
neutral	** edit - glasses_direct did call and sent out the correct glasses in two days without asking for the other pair to be sent back .
neutral	prices are not that competitive compared to buying off a more reliable website like amazon .
neutral	sellers are also put at a disadvantage where they can ' t leave negative_feedback , so the buyer always has an advantage over the seller , which can be bad when you open a case with ebay .
neutral	the selling fees can be very expensive when you sell an item over £_000 so this can discourage users from selling expensive items on ebay .
neutral	sembra novella duemila
neutral	ma la brutta copia a ah aha ha hahahah aha
neutral	great website , easy to use and understand .
neutral	delivery service was very poor on my recent_purchase , disappointing .
neutral	i ordered a trophy which i heard via_email ( a few_days after ordering ) wasn ' t available ( despite still being shown as for sale online ).
neutral	due to the timescales i went with another trophy which wasn ' t ideal but the best fit .
neutral	a few_days_later it arrived .
neutral	i would mark 0 . 0 out of 0 if i could
neutral	the items arrived in promised time and acceptable condition .
neutral	however , there are no previews on save the date or thank_you cards .
neutral	which i guess would be fine in most_cases , but in our case they couldn ' t type the special character in the middle of my name .
neutral	and without preview we didn ' t find this out until we received our order , so we had to manually correct on each card as it was too_late to order new cards .
neutral	i think , the website should have a preview on everything considering the amount each customers spends .
neutral	also , from the website it wasn ' t clear , that there will be no difference_between the thank_you and save the date cards .
neutral	as the evening invitation had evening invitation on the front , we wanted to use save the date cards to invite guests to our afternoon drinks reception celebrating our_wedding abroad .
neutral	but as the save the date ' s were the same as thank_you ' s we had add decorations to make them presentable .
neutral	so overall we were disappointed with the order .
neutral	we ordered our_wedding invitation form here previously and they were lovely , so i guess we had higher expectations
neutral	i booked with prestigia once , since i found that they had the cheapest price on trivago for a hotel in mallorca .
neutral	i initially booked 0 double_rooms and 0 single room , but then i wanted to cancel the single room , so i contacted them .
neutral	the agent was very helpful .
neutral	and i actually got my deposit back in 0 week .
neutral	i sold tickets on viagogo for muse concert that was in riga on 00 . 00 . 0000 .
neutral	i got email on 00 . 00 . 0000 that i was payed and after that , hell started !
neutral	it ' s about 0 months passed and i didn ' t got the money !
neutral	i contacted viagogo customer_service ( which is worst customer_service , ever !)
neutral	and was informed that " there ' s payment issue ", than they asked me to call paypal to claim my payment , i called them but paypal could not find any payments on my name .
neutral	than i contacted viagogo again several_times , via_email and via phone and every time answer was " there ' s some issue , will try to find out what ' s the problem ".
neutral	after 0 months of payment , this company even can ' t say what ' s the exact problem with my payment !
neutral	today , i have sent viagogo last email , after that , i ' ll contact directly to their management ( i was lucky to get direct phone number & email ) and if no luck , than will ask my lawyer to help me to get my money .
neutral	update # 0 :
neutral	as i can ' t respond directly to viagogo representative , i ' m updating current review .
neutral	as representative told ( you can see the reply from viagogo ), company has sent money i have refused it .
neutral	the truth is , that i have not refused anything ( maybe paypal had , not me ).
neutral	i didn ' t got email from paypal to claim payment , also there was nothing in my account .
neutral	i searched for the transaction_id that viagogo sent me and also was not able to find it .
neutral	i responded viagogo via_email & facebook to , sent screenshot of transactions and waiting for response but without any luck .
neutral	also i didn ' t got any payment today , as representative promised .
neutral	so i ' m still_waiting for resolution of my problem till tomorrow , then i ' m going to contact viagogo management directly .
neutral	update # 0 :
neutral	at last , contacting a lot of people in viagogo & paypal we solved problem .
neutral	the reason , why i could not get money , was the paypal registration country .
neutral	i was registered as an ukraine citizen & ukrainian accounts can ' t accept payments .
neutral	that ' s why i could not get payment .
neutral	so after contacting paypal and getting this info , i used my sisters account and got the money .
neutral	i think that viagogo could find the reason of the problem when contacting with paypal , but didn ' t .
neutral	now it does not matter .
neutral	thanks to the guy , named prab from viagogo , we solved problem .
neutral	topcashback offer some great cashback rates on a range of purchases but the payout speeds are so protracted .
neutral	it takes months to get payouts .
neutral	i understand this is often to cover return periods but the system employed to keep you updated is poor and the ability to contact topcashback is poor and often blocks you from contacting a member of staff by giving you an_automated_reply .
neutral	on the upside , the ability to turn cash into tesco points is brilliant , shame it ' s capped at £_00 a year but that ' s up to £_000 in clubcard rewards !
neutral	brilliant !
neutral	the website is great and extremely easy to use and navigate with any winnings paid directly into your account , no having to claim in store .
neutral	however , the odds of winning are ridiculous .
neutral	especially if you are hoping to win more_than a tenner .
neutral	vodafone seem to have started charging more and more for their service compared with other_networks .
neutral	as someone that couldn ' t care less about formula 0 offers through their sponsors i would rather pay less and lose this " benefit ".
neutral	from experience vodafone customer_service can be incredibly hit and miss , like no other .
neutral	one phone call you get someone who ' s lovely and would go our of their way to help you and then you get someone who very clearly cannot wait to hang_up on you .
neutral	something that really needs to improve especially if they insist on being expensive !
neutral	i ' ve been with the aa for years on my breakdown_cover but when it recently came to renewal my price hit the roof .
neutral	telephoned them and managed to get the price back down , received three different quotes in the post after that .
neutral	having spoken to a number of advisor ' s as a result of these quotes coming through the post i was assured my lower_price would be charged .
neutral	surprise_surprise when they took nearly double what they had quoted me .
neutral	i have now cancelled my breakdown_cover .
neutral	wouldn ' t touch their insurance with a barge_pole , i ' ve had a quote every year that i ' ve been driving and theirs is always one of the most expensive quotes i get .
neutral	time_consuming , especially when you think you are almost done and then its try , try again until hey_presto you can actually book some semblance of the tick you were after , great idea , but needs streamlining and if a ticket is not available it should not show up as available .
neutral	the price is good .
neutral	however , as far as i could see they did not tell you before paying that you would need to provide_evidence to show you are not a fraud .
neutral	what if i had not had such evidence , and yet still would have paid nonetheless ?
neutral	for some reason after a while they seemed to change their mind and send me the code anyway ... am i no_longer suspicious then ?
neutral	i understand the need to dig out frauds , but needing to provide_evidence after purchase is ridiculous and needs to be made more clear .
neutral	to end on a positive however , the code did arrive quickly once the former was sorted .
neutral	my mother ordered me a ted baker ladies watch a couple of week_ago .
neutral	we have it the 00 working_days delivery estimate but it has still not arrived !
neutral	we have emailed wowcher twice but still no response !!
neutral	!
neutral	i signed_up to quidco a few_months_ago , and i am generally pleased .
neutral	but , why is there no general ' contact us ' feature ?
neutral	my clicksnap thing refuses to work as it states i have the wrong log in details .
neutral	i tried to contact quidco , and found i could only view some useless faq_section which does not allow you to send them a message .
neutral	the mobile checkins are great as these are not included in the retention fee , but sometimes the app has problems and you cannot check in .
neutral	on the whole , i like this company and all of my transactions with them have gone_smoothly .
neutral	delivery and dispatch are usually quite quick , and they often have huge discount days .
neutral	the problem with this site , is firstly , the swatches of the products .
neutral	it is impossible to tell what shade you are in their foundations , and even some of the nail_polish swatches are completely untrue to real_life .
neutral	secondly , the quality of the products varies so much !
neutral	you can buy a product , love it , then repurchase it and it will be horrible !
neutral	i don ' t understand_why they don ' t have better quality_control .
neutral	even some of their more_expensive products have problems .
neutral	i bought a lipgloss from their mineral range and the packaging is so bad you can barely get any out of the tube !
neutral	not sure if i would buy anything again .
neutral	i have used this company many_times since i found out about usn ' s 0hr protein as they seem to be the only company that sell it .
neutral	but up until recently i have had no_problems with their service with parcels arrived as intended on time with no damages .
neutral	however 0 of the last 0 orders have been messed_up .
neutral	first i received the wrong goods and i had to make arrangements for them to deliver the correct goods and i was offered some loyalty_points to compensate for the mix_up .
neutral	then my next order was fine but the one after that which was my most_recent order there was another mix_up and this time the parcel had not arrived as intended .
neutral	when i phoned i was told that the parcel had not left the warehouse and after a bit of haggling i was offered a refund on the delivery onto my card or the amount refunded as loyalty_points .
neutral	for the life of me i still do not understand how firstly someone can put the wrong products into a box when they surely have some piece of paper with the exact name of the items on them and then secondly how the parcel could not be collected from the warehouse .
neutral	its not exactly rocket_science .
neutral	yes it was sorted in the end and i received loyalty_points but only after chasing after them about compensation , i mean this should be offered be offered straight_away and apologies should be made for the mix_up .
neutral	they should also offer more_than just a refund of postage cost , perhaps a discount on your next order or something of this sort should be offered as these mistakes should not happen and especially not on more_than one_occasion .
neutral	overall i was impressed when i first started ordering from this company but after recent performance , i am very dissappointed and if it weren ' t for the protein_powder , i would have gone back to monstersupplements where i have had no_problems with orders being mixed up .
neutral	order number 000000 parcel delivered late
neutral	order number 000000 wrong items delivered
neutral	i am due to go on holiday in july and thought this would be great for some cheap and cheerful clothes , how wrong was i ?
neutral	they have very few select items that are 00plus therefore i now have to go elsewhere and spend extra money al because they don ' t cater for the bigger lady .
neutral	overpriced , sure ; the food is nice .
neutral	but £_00 for one pizza in this current economic_climate ?
neutral	seriously , have a word .
neutral	used viper active bars for a 00 mile super marathon , £_00 . 00 and i felt no difference with them .
neutral	also used them for a football_match , results were nothing spectacular .
neutral	all products vastly overpriced , would probably be satisfied if i only paid about £ 0 .
neutral	will look_elsewhere for similar products , and i advise you to do the same .
neutral	really please with the suit i bought however one of the suits was super slim and this was not what i purchased ( or described in the description ) from the site .
neutral	i sent the suit back and had to chase for the refund and communication was poor although i thankfully have been refunded .
neutral	been with virgin_media on and off for a while now .
neutral	due to my job ( as an it specialist ), i need fast , solid broadband .
neutral	virgin always seem to offer some pretty sweet deals , so i normally end up with them ( in an area that they serve anyway ).
neutral	our current package is tivo , 0 virgin hd boxes ( tivo in front room , hd box in the 0 bedrooms ) and 000mbit broadband ( that is connected via sockets to every room in the house , including 0 offices ).
neutral	overall this 000mbit feeds about 00 internet connected devices .
neutral	virgin seem to have a problem with stability ( and not really just at peak_times )..
neutral	when it is working ( about 00_% of the time ) 0 of us can be hammering the internet ( including me with large server backups etc ) with fantastic speed .
neutral	however , occasionally we can end up with dropped connections , the pbx ( phone system ) being dropped randomly then an_hour later it ' s all fine .
neutral	previous to virgin we had bt_infinity ( 00 mbit , managing about 00mbit on average ), and that was rock solid .
neutral	never missed a beat .
neutral	if that + sky for 0 rooms wasn ' t so damned expensive we ' d have stayed with it .
neutral	when we placed the order with virgin , they got it all wrong .
neutral	the guys turned_up to do the install and were a box short .
neutral	then when they sorted this out virgin added another £_00 to our bill ( which admittedly they refunded as a " good will ").
neutral	their tech_support is generally " turn it off and back on " and can often be more of a hindrance than a help .
neutral	however , if you manage to get through to level 0 , or a senior tech , then things tend to get sorted out a lot quicker .
neutral	overall .
neutral	for bundles of features and seriously quick internet at an affordable price i would recommend them .
neutral	if you want a faultless connection 00 . 0 % of the time , i would probably say spend the extra and go with bt_infinity and sky +.
neutral	machinemart is a great one stop_shop for all you tool and machinery needs .
neutral	there is a large range of items in stock ready for immediate collection and great advice from staff too .
neutral	the prices are not wonderfully competative so its worth seeking price matches if possible although their vat free events make prices far more desirable .
neutral	their range of clarke tools are ideal for the diyer although i wouldnt rely_on them proffesionally to earn the mortgage although thats reflected in the prices compared to the likes of makita and dewalt .
neutral	thornaby store has superbly helpful staff .
neutral	well_done .
neutral	basically .
neutral	i have used cjs a few_times previously and they have always delivered quickly and efficiently , however i decided to use the random auto_key feature for steam to see if i could get lucky and get a nice game that i dont already own ( and if i do then give it to a friend double bonus ) however one of the keys was doa and would not work on steam regardless of what combination of letters / numbers and copy / pasting didnt solve the problem , after contacting the site for assistance i read that i could take upto 0 days for a response about it , kinda frustrating but im sure they will sort it out , hell they usually sort it out double quick :_p
neutral	easy - to - use website
neutral	ordered an asus transformer for my gf for xmas on the 00th_dec ( was charged instantly for it ), website said it was in stock and advised delivery within 0 days due to the busy_period , which i thought was fair_enough as long as it arrived before_xmas .
neutral	however alarm_bells rang when the website had my order status as ' new ' even 00 days after i ordered so chased up via_email as that seems to get a response rather_than wasting time on hold to the customer_service line , vanessa was helpful but seemed unable to do much .
neutral	item finally arrived on the 00th , i was glad to actually receive it given all the bad_reviews but their customer_service really is poor and they mislead you with delivery times & stock_levels which is not on , especially over xmas !
neutral	thankfully my gf was understanding when it finally came !
neutral	!
neutral	their prices are cheaper_than elsewhere but only order from them if a ) you are prepared to wait 0 - 0 wks for the item b ) you don ' t mind it coming with us plugs c ) you can put up with poor service and not hearing anything about the status of your order until literally the day before it arrives seemingly out of thin_air !
neutral	lots of branches open 0 days .
neutral	bought a camera bundle online .
neutral	arrived in a week all good .
neutral	i used to love vodafone as a network and think no one compared , however , since they released ' sure signal ' they seem to have lessened the signal_strength .
neutral	my calls seem to drop so much more , and i am no where near as happy as i used to be ...
neutral	one whole month i had to wait for compensation payment for a parcel that parcel0go had lost .
neutral	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
neutral	many_times with the livechat i was sent away and told to wait with no direct answer .
neutral	the people ( i ' m_guessing they were people on the other end ) were rude and not very helpful at all .
neutral	that was until today when ashley was able to sort out my refund giving me a number of payment options .
neutral	he gave me direct answer straight_away without making me wait .
neutral	although my experience with the company thus_far was awful i must_say ashley turned it around :) i would recomend the company as the prices are very good but i would suggest cover as parcels do get lost and you wont get the value of the products unless your covered .
neutral	all in all i see that there are some workers who literally carry the company .
neutral	hopefully all the hard work will be noticed and due praise and promotion given .
neutral	thank_you ashley :)
neutral	when i found flights to rome for 00 a head i thought it was a great deal .
neutral	with all the extra costs it ended_up being so much more .
neutral	also they have lowered their hand_luggage_allowance to 00kg and charge a whopping 00 quid for a 00 kg back for check in .
neutral	if you cantravel with just hand_luggage you do generally work out cheaper , but it ' s never as convenient and the airport is generally quite far away from its description
neutral	i have had several experiences with delayed shipping - stocking out of products .
neutral	if you say you have a product , make_sure you have it .
neutral	we had a great time in glasgow with the activity day being a massive success .
neutral	we did a lot of things for the first time and got to do them together as a group .
neutral	the comedy night was also fun , however we were lucky to get in as chillisauce did not confirm our booking with the venue .
neutral	we therefore had to pay for our own food and were stuck standing in a corner with a pillar in the way of the stage so we could not see .
neutral	i ordered my glasses on the 00rd of feb_0000 ( now 00th_march ), i have a very basic prescription ( 0 . 0 in both ) so i assumed it would take up to 00 days to get them .
neutral	i ' ve tried_emailing to see when i can expect them since at the moment they are apparently still in ' the lab '; but i never get a reply .
neutral	seems like they spend more time leaving time on here because the comments are public than they do replying to customer emails !
neutral	their prices are good and their website is nice , but it stops there - fingers_crossed i don ' t have to wait as long as other people have had to !
neutral	update_:
neutral	ok i just received an_email , the frames i ordered were out of stock ( however they are still on the website with no out of stock message ), i ' ve asked for a different frame - lets_see how this goes ....
neutral	i have been made aware that the new frames will be dispatched on monday ( today ) and should be with me mid week - they also wavered £_00 since the frames i chose were more_expensive that the original pair .
neutral	if all goes well , i will up my rating since i have received awesome support and money off .
neutral	well i am a long_term just_eat user .
neutral	i think on the whole this is a place i can be happy ordering from .. when things go right , but when they do not ... you are up some sorta creek with no paddle .
neutral	i have been waiting for a refund for over a month .. have called ... told someone would contact me .. not happened .
neutral	tried to use the online_chat thing .. omg ...
neutral	i had a revolving argument with the man ( sandeep ) about how it was my fault for not having the information he wanted .. even_though he could not find the same information .
neutral	grr .
neutral	so still_waiting for refund but kinda gave up now .
neutral	other issue is .. the point shop !
neutral	had so much cool and terrible stuff , but it did not matter as it was free if you had enough points .!
neutral	wooo ... but .. now i have enough points , what can i buy ??
neutral	hmmm xbox ?
neutral	wii ???
neutral	speedboat ?
neutral	!
neutral	?
neutral	.... no .
neutral	i can use my points to " be in with a chance to win " cinema tickets .
positive	i spoke to the policy store to get advice and everyone there was so helpful and friendly .
positive	we ordered personalised thank_you cards for my son ' s first birthday .
positive	they are lovely .
positive	a really good service with extremely_helpful staff .
positive	an operator called jenny helped_me with an international shipment and looked in depth into a query for me .
positive	i will_definitely use again !
positive	it ' s hard to trust a cd_key website , but when i decided to order after seeing so much positive_feedback about this site , i thought i ' d try it , purchased 00 months xbox_live gold for £_00 ( bargain ), ordered through paypal , within a minute i received email with the cd_key which shows on the back of a card like you would get from retail .
positive	i simply redeemed the codes and right away , it worked .
positive	legit website , superb prices , awesome job !
positive	ordered the item on the thursday and was delivered on the friday of the next_day !!!
positive	i had one very happy little_boy !
positive	would most definitely use again !
positive	and the item purchased was £ 0 cheaper_than other_retailers in the high_street !
positive	and £ 0 cheaper_than amazon with faster shipping .
positive	a trusted seller
positive	after years of chopping and changing supermarkets finally finding one that does everything it says on the tin has been difficult .
positive	sainsbury ' s is the closest one to that mark , the online ordering and delivery service is 00_% foolproof , although i do find i have to switch off the substitutes as some of the replacements are questionable .
positive	delivery is always on time , the driver is polite and understanding , and they take a number of cards including electron and solo !!!
positive	which is a bonus for most people ( unlike tesco !)
positive	products are not always the cheapest however are great quality and easily replacable if they do not meet my standards .
positive	the nectar card is great ...
positive	i use it everywhere i go and it saves me a fortune over the year ( last_year over £_00 just over a weeks shopping ) sainsbury ' s has an easy layout of products allowing you to just pop in and grab or spend an_hour doing the weekly_shop , i do find i spend time wandering around the home section though spending more money than i needed to and buying items that i don ' t actually need , its very clever the way the layout is in sainsbury ' s !
positive	( or i have no self control lol ) staff are always friendly and helpful and seem to have gone_through a reasonable level of training .
positive	the scan as you shop gadgets are fab , it makes sure you don ' t go over budget on your shop , the only annoying part is when you get up to the till and have to have a re - scan !
positive	although you can help yourself here , make_sure you scan everything that goes in your trolley or basket , the more sainsbury ' s can trust you with your shopping the less likely you will get re - scans !
positive	i would also like to point out in this review that i have a disabled relative who also uses sainsbury ' s in a number of stores across the country ( mainly as i live in essex and she is in shropshire ) we have never had an issue borrowing any form of wheelchair or acquiring goods from the top shelf at any of the 0 stores we regularly use , they also have ramps for the cash machines and a lower machine for wheelchair access .
positive	all in all a great all_round supermarket !
positive	we have been purchasing items from 0000rpm for the last 0 years .
positive	our small business relies on fast_shipping / deliveries and good quality products , which is exactly_what we get from 0000rpm .
positive	any_issues with a delivery are sorted within a very short_space of time .
positive	my exprience of 0000rpm has always been and i hope will_continue to be reliable , professional , quality and great budgeted company .
positive	items we have bought include , printers , inks , cds , cases , flash_drives , cd readers , speaker systems and various hard ware / motherboards / soundcards etc .
positive	we are overall very satisfied with thus company and shall continue to purchase items and spread the word about them .
positive	update most drivers on my laptop .
positive	it ' s hard to sum up how refreshing it is to see a company like this .
positive	the prices are smack on and some of the best around and you ' re at a great advantage , not having to wait on parcels being received if you purchase serial keys .
positive	i ordered mine for guild_wars 0 and had the serial code in about 00_minutes with no issues_whatsoever .
positive	the customer_service is great , as you ' d be able to see if you read the below reviews , with any_issues being called up on with detailed and sincere explanations .
positive	you just don ' t find this these days .
positive	i also ventured over to the facebook_page as i was waiting and read about how they deal with the empty boxes and unused discs that they end up with through people buying serial keys and found that they ' ve recently sourced out recycling firms that can handle both .
positive	not only that , they use carbon neutral servers to host the website .
positive	the company not only treat the customers with care but also everything that they affect in doing their business .
positive	i was totally dubious and actually genuinely worried_about what i ' d paid for and how reliable it would be but all of my concerns were laid to rest .
positive	you ' re in great hands when dealing_with ziip and if anything was ever to go_wrong , you know they ' d do their best to correct it quickly , efficiently and intelligently - without the usual and hideously commonplace shady business attitude .
positive	i will_definitely buy from here in the future .
positive	i am a repeat customer due to one reason , the prices can not be beat !
positive	after going down to my local dreams store i had no_idea what i wanted after half an_hour i had purchased 0 beds and one tempa mattress .
positive	i opted to have the beds installed as they have the storage underneath and i never wanted all the hassle getting it right .
positive	come the morning of delivery had a call to say the guys would arrive at half 0 and they was here on the dot .
positive	dave and seb was the installers and i could not fault them at all very polite and professional and cleared up all the mess they made unlike some company ' s .
positive	overall very satisfied !
positive	very quick easy way of getting some cash .
positive	placed an order for brake levers on the wednesday_afternoon and choose the free delivery option .
positive	i unexpectedly received the delivery the next morning , very happy !
positive	rhea
positive	i unlock my iphone 0 ios 0 . 0 . 0 with bb 00 . 00 . 00 in just one day an half .
positive	the website is very easy to do make orders and in just one word .....
positive	professionals .........
positive	i give them 0_stars
positive	tks too official_iphone_unlock
positive	cheapest , large_selection and they will beat other prices
positive	great company , fast delivery .
positive	perfect !
positive	i have never had a problem with yodel and have always found their staff to be very happy and friendly .
positive	the parcels are always on time and they keep you well informed as to when your parcel was dispatched and where it is now .
positive	great service !
positive	supplement wearhouse is one of the best sites for researching as well as purchasing supplements for your workout_needs .
positive	not only is it easy to navigate , it is consistently the lowest priced supplement webpage around .
positive	it ' s accessible and helpful to all types of people , weather a novice or a dedicated gym rat .
positive	fast and reliable company , good quality cables and great value
positive	this is amazing im speechless
positive	i really enjoy the products that i receive from supplement_warehouse and the low price definitely helps .
positive	the addition of many samples with my orders is also something that separates the site from others !
positive	great business .
positive	hey there !
positive	i highly_recommend you to do not worry to deliver your iphone blindly to official_iphone_unlock ....
positive	have purchased two games from cdkeys . com . au
positive	one was swtor , the other bf0 .
positive	both deliveries were quick , cheap prices , and no hassle .
positive	will be buying all my cdkeys from here
positive	i ordered a grade a phone for my dad .
positive	wasn ' t very sure with second_hand phones , but the phone arrive as if it was brand_new , ordered 00 am received the phone next_day .
positive	that is super_fast delivery .
positive	i would highly_recommend them
positive	i bought a phone for my nephew , super_fast delivery , great customer_service and excellent product .
positive	highly_recommend .
positive	will buy again
positive	i ' ve never found any other hostel booking website to be as efficient , cheap and easy to use as hostelbookers .
positive	000_% recommended to use hostelbookers instead of hostelworld !
positive	fast delivery , everything as i ordered , the best prices on the whole net , very happy with my second purchase from them !
positive	excellent selection .
positive	reasonable prices .
positive	and cracking customer_service when required .
positive	definitely buying here again .
positive	tried to get tickets for me and 0 friends to see taylor swift in concert at the o0 ...
positive	this was impossible on ticketmaster as they sold out ridiculously quickly .
positive	searched for tickets on google and double 0 came up .
positive	brilliant service , quite expensive compared to original prices , but i have the tickets !!
positive	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you !!!
positive	!
positive	very fast delivery , good prices and very helpful assistance .
positive	i recommend it to anyone who_wants to make good deals .
positive	this humble shop is a small paradise for hobbyists who collect blind boxed quirky figures / charms / etc .
positive	these_guys do the opening and identifying for you , so you know what exactly_what you ' re paying for , instead of dishing wads of cash on blind boxes in an vain attempt to finish your collection ( not speaking from personal experience -- honest !).
positive	if you think that sucks the fun out of collecting , then they do sell unopened boxes to fill the needs of those feeling lucky or want a surprise .
positive	dinkybox also has a nice collection of japanese figures ( such as pinky street and revoltech ), as well as books and manga supplies .
positive	they don ' t quite have the biggest_selection around , but it ' s a nice shop with a reliable service and great prices .
positive	i ' d say it ' s worth a browse .
positive	i ' m usually skeptical_about buying clothes online since i ' ve have problems with many sites but yesstyle is one of the few i ' d say is pretty good .
positive	the clothes are very attractive and there is a really big selection of styles .
positive	the website itself is very easy to browse and its easy to find what you ' re looking for .
positive	delivery is super_quick , especially if you choose clothes that ' ship within 0 - 0 days '.
positive	i ordered on sunday_night and it arrived today -- rather quick for clothes that are imported !
positive	all the shirts and jumper fitted_perfectly and i will_definitely use this service again .
positive	my only gripes with the site is that the delivery is quite expensive , but understandably so since the clothes are imported from asia .
positive	i think its best to order lots of clothes at once so that the delivery fee is worth it .
positive	plus , you get can free delivery if you order enough .
positive	another problem is that many of the clothes are one - size only , and mostly suit to a medium to petite frame .
positive	they don ' t seem to really cater to anyone who is a uk size 00 and above , much to the disappointment of some my friends .
positive	if i could give cultpens more_than 0_stars , i would .
positive	one of the best online stores i ' ve used !
positive	very quick delivery ( arrived in less_than 0 days ) and an easy to use website .
positive	i would not have been disappointed if my package came a bit late in this busy christmas_period , but i ' m surprised that it managed to arrive today !
positive	the products i ' ve ordered is good quality and exactly_what i was looking for .
positive	would use this website again , once i run out of supplies .
positive	reliable , quick delivery .
positive	very easy to personalized your own card .
positive	the selection of cards are fun and quirky too .
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	i am not sure how i came_across this website , maybe a google_search and i found the amazing , money saving deals .
positive	the main and most_important thing on their website is the competition pricing .
positive	what this is basically is you go to a different website where its listed for cheaper , supplement_warehouse doesn ' t just match the price , it gives you it for much less .
positive	great website and company , will recommend to friends and family , and use the service again !
positive	easy to use site , great range of products although not everything i wanted was on the site , fab prices , great service i would recommend to others and will buy from them again x
positive	usually deliveries thats say they are next_day to northern_ireland from england are not , this was , i was quite happy .
positive	product arrived in perfect_condition and i got a very polite email which i will quote , " thank_you for your business and of course if i can help further , please don ' t hesitate to get in touch .
positive	kind_regards .." so you can see why i gave this 0_stars
positive	i receive my camera in 0 days without paying any aditional charges .
positive	i was very skeptical when my friend told me about this website and all the great deals .
positive	i looked it up today and found every product i have been doing research on .
positive	the deals the have on the website were beyond anything i have ever_seen .
positive	all the free products made it that more enjoyable and allows me to try things i would have never thought of trying .
positive	i am exstatic when i see a product i have heard about and they have a promotion on it .
positive	i can always find something to help boost my results and the description they give help me choose the correct ones without any doubts .
positive	i will be back with more friends for more purchases !
positive	ordered a pair of long_distance new wayfare glasses which arrived 0 days of the dispatch date and in total 00 days from order date .
positive	the online order progress keeps you informed every_step of the glasses pathway .
positive	not a scratch on the lenses and no_problems with my perscription .
positive	couldn ' t find a better price online .
positive	my one regret , not selectspecs fault , is that i did not look in the shops at what i was buying online .
positive	if i did i would have chosen the colour havanah instead of dark havanah .
positive	my fault entirely so guess the motto is try before you buy .
positive	house_network were great all_round .
positive	the price was fantastic , saving us about £ 0000 on estate_agent fees .
positive	they took lots of excellent photos of every room , all making the house look great .
positive	they also gave thorough descriptions and a floor plan .
positive	they sent us statistics regularly .
positive	they were always easy to contact , and got back to us very quickly with any_queries .
positive	we chose house_network after viewing a property they were marketing as we found them cery helpful .
positive	overall we would definately_recommend them for the price and service .
positive	my phone was locked for 0 months i was looking for online solutions all over the web , this is the only dicent and trustworthy i found .
positive	i highly_recomend this guys .
positive	thanks alot .
positive	very happy with the packaging and the fast and i mean fast delivery ...
positive	for the amount i bought and not getting charged extra postage for it i was very happy .
positive	i would definitely_recommend chillisauce .
positive	they were great at giving advice on what hen_party would be suited to us and answered any_questions that were asked extensively .
positive	they provided us with a really enjoyable hen_party
positive	i have rated incrystals earlier this month , and the service only keeps getting better !
positive	i ordered 0 gifts yesterday , and received them today .
positive	you have made 0 people very happy this christmas .
positive	thank_you so much
positive	sarah xx
positive	easy to use website , fast and secure .
positive	collection is easy to organize
positive	downside ( very small one but ...), pity collection times can not be more specific than 0am_till_0pm for example ?
positive	not parcel0go ' s fault would be a nice addition in my opinion to their website .
positive	also a surcharge for using paypal is disappointing as i use ebay and paypal a lot !
positive	support staff both on facebook and website all very helpful and knowledgeable , a credit to their employers !
positive	trustpilot is a flawed system .
positive	you can overide the authorisation code normally by typing in a sequence of numbers ( 000000 ) or letters ( abcdefg0 ).
positive	you can reply as a company even when you are not the company .
positive	i cannot understand_why companies are paying good money for such a system .
positive	i bet after a few seconds , this comment will be deleted because trustpilot is also an unmanned system , no body is ever checking .
positive	only if it is in the interest of trustpilot .
positive	i ordered my canvas from hellocanvas , it came two days after it was shipped , and it is top quality !
positive	add that to the fact it worked out at £_00 - £_00 cheaper_than i could get anywhere in shrewsbury .
positive	will_definitely be going back to this group as i redecorate my flat !
positive	would definitely_recommend using this company to anyone .
positive	product was in excellent condition and arrived the next_day as promised .
positive	will be using this service again
positive	no_complaints .
positive	would use again .
positive	posted phone on the thursday , received money in my bank by tuesday .
positive	very good service and very easy to use .
positive	definitely support these_guys , they ' re a great bunch and always very helpful .
positive	ordered shower doors .
positive	arrived within a couple of days and very well_packaged .
positive	very grateful .
positive	will_definitely_recommend !
positive	super_fast_shipping !
positive	friendly staff , very helpful !
positive	nice easy shopping_experience with game code available within a few minutes of completing transaction and worked with no issues .
positive	had to have verification via text_message due to having a different e_- mail on my paypal account compared to one i used for cjs but no issue with this and worked easily and quickly .
positive	would deffo_use cjs again
positive	the plumbing engineers i used from pgs were friendly , punctual and did high_quality work .
positive	they give convenient time slots , and more_importantly , call half an_hour before the engineer arrives to avoid you having to wait in all day .
positive	this is the third time ive used mazuma , each time we have found it so quick and easy .
positive	we always get argos_vouchers , and always have that within a few_days , but we are kept in the loop via_email to let u know when ure fones been received and when ure argos card has been sent out .... im so happy with the service that i havent even considered trying out another company ... and we will_continue to use mazuma twice a year to recycle our old_phones .
positive	keep up the good work !
positive	!
positive	this company is so cheap and them delivers of the keys is so fast .. i am so happy with the servies of this company ... " like "
positive	great service , quick delivery and all for a very affordable price !
positive	very smooth pleasant_transaction
positive	i have never written a review for anything before but i honestly am so pleased with my service and product .
positive	i am 0 and a half months pregnant and have just bought a new mattress .
positive	it ' s so hard i have been in real discomfort with my back .
positive	i decided to order a memory_foam topper and after searching the net found zleeps to be the cheapest .
positive	i ordered a silver topper it came within 0 working_days and i got two free memory_foam pillows !
positive	very pleased very comfy .
positive	don ' t be put off by bad_reviews these people were either very unlucky or the reviews are fake .
positive	i am going to be recommending this site to friends and family
positive	boohoo from the start of my order were fantastic , great communication_throughout and all their products were a great price .
positive	the only_suggestion to customers would be is if you are in a rush for your outfit to pay extra for delivery as standard delivery does take a while .
positive	i had seen a number of isofix car seats on the market and struggled to make a decison .
positive	i then came_across the britax isofix seat on precious_little one and read the customer reviews and product specification .
positive	it was high in the safety ratings and also has a recline feature .
positive	the car_seat when it came was high_quality and was dispatched very quickly .
positive	as always great quality & service provided by precious_little one .
positive	the item was just as expected , and arrived in great condition and super_fast .
positive	i would recomend to anyone .
positive	this site is very user_friendly , easy to navigate and find what you are looking for , as well as lots of information on each hostel .
positive	it is also cheaper_than hostelworld .
positive	fast dispatch , item exactly as_described , great price !!!
positive	!
positive	i needed a wetsuit and had found the site link on an info board down at the lakes where my friends jetski .
positive	i found the website very easy to use and found a suitable wetsuit at an extremely reasonable_price within about 0 minutes of looking .
positive	it was a thursday and needed it for the weekend so ordered next_day delivery but realised it had to be before 0pm and i placed the ordered at 0 . 00pm but it still came the next_day !!
positive	i was so stoked and it fit me perfectly .
positive	now anything i need for the water i ' ll be coming here first !
positive	need some booties next :)
positive	had a great weekend cheers_guys
positive	i like the choices i have while shopping here .
positive	they not only have a large_selection of supplements but they are at great values .
positive	his products are excellent and the quality is perfect .
positive	services also very friendly .
positive	my only option to book a hostel .
positive	no booking_fees and payment protection is the best .
positive	wanna save a hella good amount of money use this website bra .
positive	i was really impressed with the speed of dispatch , low_cost ( ie , free !)
positive	delivery and the lovely saving off the rrp of the lens :)
positive	there is only one thing sweeter than being_able to choose your very own trove of tasty goodness to be delivered direct to your door .
positive	no , not the exceptionally good price for such a service .
positive	the truth is that service makes any good deal all the sweeter and mr big tops are no exception .
positive	community engagement and loyalty driving are two things that i love to see in a company ; the team over at mr big tops do this so very well !
positive	whether it ' s frequent giveaways or their great engagement and conversations on twitter and facebook , they ' re clearly very much in love with their product .
positive	let ' s face it ; who wouldn ' t be !
positive	if you love candy , vintage flair and charming service , you really should at_least try one box for yourself .
positive	being_able to have your favourite sweets delivered to your door in snack sized packages on a regular_basis is heaven for a sugar lover !
positive	the perfect website for anyone who_likes to have a bet .
positive	odds from a wide_range of bookies and best prices are clearly highlighted .
positive	also really useful for checking things like historical price changes and statistics for the prices of different bookmakers .
positive	i mainly bet on football and horse racing and just about every market i need is on there .
positive	if you bet even just a couple of times a month , you really should be using oddschecker to get best value !
positive	it can be a struggle finding the perfectly fitting frame and sending something away to be framed can take an age .
positive	then l found this site .
positive	with a range of different frames and whatever size you want , with a range of mounts , it was really simple .
positive	all l had to do was measure the item l wanted framed , pick the size and dimensions of mount and they sort the size of frame for it .
positive	couple days for it to be delivered .
positive	will be using them again .
positive	the item l ordered from here arrived quickly and was brilliant quality .
positive	i was looking for something different for christmas_present and loved the range and prices available on this site .
positive	the items l ordered arrived quickly and were great quality .
positive	also delivery was well_packed to ensure little chance of damages - other_companies should take note !
positive	really impressed with them and will_definitely be using them again .
positive	i had been needing a new watch strap for a while but l really wanted to get the right one to go with the model of my watch .
positive	i had been struggling to find it until l came_across babla ' s .
positive	they didn ' t have the strap on their site but had an option to put in my make and model of watch and they would source the strap for me .
positive	it took them no time at all to find the correct strap and have it sent out to me .
positive	i would definitely use the site again and recommend it to others .
positive	they are ok
positive	transfer from halifax to bv takes minutes
positive	i suspect they have automated_system for deposits , which is nice , not like in goldmoney . com when you wait for days
positive	did some withdrawal months_ago , no problem , fast and good
positive	fees per_month range from 0 usd to 0 usd for each metal
positive	overall they are ok
positive	secure because they send sms ( 00 pence price ) to phone of activities
positive	and only deal with one main bank_account address
positive	so all ins and outs are fixed to main acc
positive	thinking , since uk gov taxes silver 00_% vat , is it not a bad idea to have silver in uk vaults ?
positive	have some , and worry_about thieving uk gov
positive	i am a massive fan of asos and have been for years now .
positive	it ' s such a pleasure using their site ; really easy to navigate and ( being a picky girl ) i love the search and filter functions .
positive	my favourite part is most_likely the saved items page , this has been so handy since it was introduced i really hope it stays as i now find every site that doesn ' t have this to be quite a pain .
positive	i don ' t often return things as sizing is generally spot on with their own branded clothing and the brands they supply , but when i have had to return it has been free and the refund is actioned really quickly .
positive	as far as issues with orders or products , this is where they shine .
positive	i had an order turn_up with a product missing ( the top of the package had been sliced , i assume at the courier depot ) and i was refunded straight_away as a replacement could not be sent .
positive	on another occasion a product turned_up and had a defect so i emailed customer_services , then shortly_after received a response offering compensation ( part refund ) so i was really chuffed to have a resolution , and a positive one !
positive	i wholeheartedly_recommend asos , really great company .
positive	would recommend mazuma to everyone one who asks about selling a phone .
positive	really fast reliable from beginning to to end .
positive	00 out of 00
positive	got my 0 pair free_trial which took no time to come , was happy with 0 of them so ordered them .
positive	easy online form and as soon as i had my prescription they took no time to send them out .
positive	very happy with the service .
positive	i ordered from elitekeys today as i wanted to get into wow as i have just stopped playing my other mmo due to it being pay0win .
positive	i had a looka round numerous sites for a long time thinking which one is a honest and true trustworthy website to buy from .
positive	i stumbled_across elitekeys the website looks professional and not all buy gold buy gold cheap price ect like the other_sites i was looking for game keys from , i came to here also and read the reviews before purchasing and everything seemed legit .
positive	i ordered my copies of the game and after 00_minutes i got an_email with attached photo ' s of my game codes which is a more satisfactory idea as you know they are more then likely to be legit and someone hasn ' t just copied the code into an_email and maybe got to code wrong .
positive	personally i will be ordering from this website again it is a good reliable source to buy from professionally set and hassle_free .
positive	plus from what i see delivery time is quicker_than the estimate of 00_mins - 0 hours , thats always a bonus !
positive	!
positive	when looking around for a case for my samsung note 0 , there were many available on ebay but none actually stated they were for a note so didn ' t want to buy just in case .
positive	i came_across this website and the description matched exactly_what i was looking for .
positive	purple is my favourite colour and delivery was when it was expected .
positive	i ' m very happy with the service that i received and the product i purchased !
positive	they were great !
positive	they always came_across very professionally , friendly and helpful .
positive	i didn ' t feel under pressure .
positive	loved the reviews on the digitalrev youtube page and this is what convinced me to make a purchase with dr , i obviously looked everywhere online and researched for many weeks for a new dslr and came to currys uk , amazon uk , and then digtalrev .
positive	the price_match was very reasonable with dr so i chose them and i ' m very happy with product and will buy other products , such as lenses with dr , in the future .
positive	delivery was very fast and had a online tracking_system with dhl .
positive	very well_done dr !
positive	placed an order for 0 identical sd cards however only one arrived in parcel two days ago .... no sign of the other one .
positive	have e_- mailed regarding this but heard_nothing .
positive	so unfortunately the price wasn ' t so good , paying for two and only receiving one !
positive	would ' ve been cheaper on high_street after all and not the hassle , i ' m disappointed as this is my first order .
positive	****** update *******
positive	have received email and was offered full_refund or replacement for missing item and requested replacement as i really needed the sd_card .... so i am going to upgrade now to five_stars as they were very helpful .
positive	will review again when replacement hopefully arrives !
positive	**** update ********
positive	replacement card arrived by registered post as promised .
positive	would definitely now use this company again as their customer_service is excellent when things don ' t go to plan .
positive	supplement_warehouse has all the products that you could possibly need and more .
positive	i am a returning customer and i will not go anywhere_else to get my products .
positive	the price_matching option is the best solution to finding great products for even greater prices .
positive	i ' ve used gear0music loads of times and pretty_much rebuilt my drum_kit with the things i ' ve bought off them .
positive	my cymbals were always immaculate when they arrived and even_though all the pieces of bubble_wrap and cardboard were a pain to get_rid of , it was well worth it .
positive	staff were very friendly when i rang them up with a query and they emailed me everything i needed to know within minutes !
positive	i ' m actually due a delivery today so as long as it turns up , 0 / 0 every time :)
positive	i really rate these_guys - its very rare that i shop on line and get the feeling like 0 .
positive	i ' m dealing_with human beings and 0 . they care about the customer and are not after a quick buck .
positive	i will_definitely shop with these_guys again and i highly_recommend their services to anyone and on top of all this they have great stock which just shows me they know what they are doing .

positive	barry ' s an excellent employee who provides his service thoroughly and seems to be the type to go out of his way for a client , that ' s the type of attitude needed to make organizations work .
positive	thank_you world bound
positive	thank_you refurb_phone for the pleasant iphone that you provided me .
positive	:)
positive	needed some bankruptcy advice after my debt management plan failed and found them to be very helpful and sorted my bankruptcy application out for me
positive	very easy to use - genuinely the cheapest we found .
positive	their customer_service through the online " chat " function was excellent and ensured we got just what we needed .
positive	very trustworthy and will_definitely use again .
positive	i cant_believe_how easy it was to use etyres .
positive	one simple phone call was all it took .
positive	the lady on the phone was polite and really helped_me understand what tyres i needed to go for .
positive	i made my selection , booked the most suitable day for me , sat back and relaxed .
positive	the day of the fitting came .
positive	i received a call from the fitter promptly at 0 . 00am who said he would be there at 00am and at exactly 00 . 00am he turned_up .
positive	the fitting was done quickly and efficiently , he even took away my old tyres !
positive	" all included in the service ," he said .
positive	he then asked for my signature , showed me how to tighten my bolts properly and was on his way .
positive	the whole_thing took under half an_hour which is an eye opener compared to the 0 hour wait i suffered at kwick fit .
positive	overall i cannot_fault the prompt friendly and affordable service i received .
positive	i was very happy with the case when it arrived . it looks great , you just can ' t get great unique designs like this in the uk .
positive	it fitted my samsung_galaxy_s0 perfectly .
positive	the only issue i have with the case is i use an aux cable regularly in my car to play music through the stereo and you have to push the cable quite firm to fit past the silicone casing .
positive	other than that delivery time was great and i ' m happy i spent the money on a decent good quality case
positive	fast , simple and all you need to get the right informations and make a safety reservation !
positive	i have used quite a few cd_key websites and without a shadow of a doubt simplycdkeys is the best out there by_far !
positive	my pre_- order was delivered the day before_release so that i could preload the game which is perfect for my under par internet_connection .
positive	other orders i have placed also arrived around 0 minutes after making payment at the checkout .
positive	if you have any sense at all then you will shop with simplycdkeys and never buy your games from anywhere_else again .
positive	i was very surprised at how fast and simple ordering from go0arena was .
positive	the delivery was so fast .
positive	i received the cd_key within 0 minutes of placing my order !

positive	their delivery times are very fast and setting_up your online account is straight_forward and easy .
positive	they make it even easier for you to return items you decide you don ' t like by simply taking to your nearest high_street store .
positive	i would have no reservations_about recommending shopping online with them
positive	i recently_purchased the simcity 0000 serial_number online .
positive	i had never bought a game online like this before and was unsure if it was a good idea , i thought maybe i should just go into_town and buy it from a shop like the good old days .
positive	my friend_recommended cjs to me via a link on facebook .
positive	he told me that he buys all his games direct from cjs as they process orders automatically and you get your serial_number straight_away unlike_other_sites that can leave you waiting days sometimes even weeks to reply with a working serial_number .
positive	i paid via_paypal and was instantly able to view my new simcity serial_number , i entered the code in the origin console under the ' redeem product ' tab and began downloading the full version of the game ...
positive	happy days !
positive	:)
positive	i would recommend cjs to any gamer that does not want to pay full price for a game !
positive	why pay full price when you can go to cjs !

positive	it is cheaper and faster_than any other website .
positive	no booking_fee is the best feature .
positive	we chose nortlander in the first place out of all of the other travel companies because of how cheap the package was .
positive	also because they were literally the only company to focus on what they could give us rather_than what all the other_companies couldn ' t do for us i . e .
positive	they didn ' t bitch about the other_companies and just gave us the best deal they could .
positive	throughout the semester they helped_us with anything we needed promotion - wise .
positive	emails were replied to almost every time with speed .
positive	when we had to expand the trip from 000 to 000 due to massive sign_up numbers , they allowed us to do so within 0 days of finding out we needed more spaces which took a huge_amount of pressure off us as a committee ( a lot of people were very annoyed that they werent in the first 000 ).
positive	during the trip , all of the reps were well liked by everyone .
positive	noise complaints and situations were handled well .
positive	all events in resort were run as planned and relatively on - time .
positive	overall , from my own experience and from speaking to anyone on the trip , nortlander helped make this the best trip to date for dcu snowsports .

positive	from my initial contact with away0 , through to a successful booking , daniel_mednick ' s delivery and approach has been friendly , committed and diligent .
positive	early on in the process daniel was very understanding and we discussed in depth budget , location and duration .
positive	soon after , daniel matched me to a perfect and ideal holiday , he looked after me with great care and offered plenty of guidance on how i could save money .

positive	i found many cheap codes for all the games i like , i would recommend for anyone using digital downloads and the rate of delivery was super_fast i also found the site rather easy to navigate .
positive	when i was first recommended cjs_cd_keys by a colleague , i was highly suspicious of the site being a possible scam .
positive	fortunately after_reading quite a lot of reviews on trustpilot , i decided to take the plunge and purchased a bf0_premium cd_key .
positive	their autokey distribution system is very easy to use once your purchase has been paid for .
positive	the key i was sent activated straight_away on origin and i was getting stuck into to the cq expansion within minutes and enjoying every second of it !
positive	real happy with my purchase !
positive	would not hesitate to buy from again !
positive	ordered a edimax apn from them , which arrived_promptly - though the courier delivered it quite late at around 0pm - kudo ' s to him for not turning around to head for home and leaving it for the next_day .
positive	ive purchased from kikatek on quite a few occasions already , but the other day was the first time ive actually had to contact them after a possible bodged firmware update for the apn i ordered .
positive	their support was very professional and were more then willing to help .
positive	fortunately i had also contacted edimax before emailing kikatek support and had everything sorted out so i didnt require an rma .
positive	so it was a bit of a false alarm .
positive	when these_guys say ' next_day ' delivery - they arent kidding !
positive	!
positive	i opted for the cheaper rm 0st_class delivery option ( 0 - 0days ) but i recieved an_email later in the day telling_me my order had been dispatched and would arrive the very next_day .
positive	this is my first experience with quietpc and it has a been a very satisfactory one based on their delivery speed and the condition my order arrived in .
positive	i will_definitely do more business with them in the future !
positive	!
positive	i had a bespoke wedding_ring made to fit my engagement_ring as it ' s an odd shape .
positive	it took just two days to receive the design for my ring , then 0 week for it to arrive in the shop for me to collect ( home delivery is an option ).
positive	when i went to collect my rings i was surprised to see that my engagement_ring had been cleaned and was looking as good as new again .
positive	the presentation of my wedding_ring was amazing too , a smart box inside a cute presentation_box inside a lovely bag whereas i was just expecting a ring box .
positive	the service i received in store at bluewater was also fantastic .

positive	would definitely use vie company again .
positive	if you are looking for a cheap nightstay but you are not too self confident in terms of your orientation and organisation skills , hostelbooker will help you , it s very comfortable to chose time and place on their page and they will you show wide offer , all presented in convenient form , and setting the matter after your choice takes honestly 0 min . if it seems that something happen and you could call off your travel , you can choose the option of payment protection when you are booking , so that your 00_% paid at booking will turn to another booking . thats a good possibilty , because the planned travel is never 000_% sure , but undoubtly i will_continue my booking with hostelbooker so my money stay there like in bank . and another matter , once my credit_card wasn t valid , they asked the hostel s manager to let me pay all at arriving , that was really nice of them and solved my problem in this case
positive	and they also remind you about the travel , giving details and that helps a lot
positive	i ve used that service many_times and they never let me down
positive	i used currencychange for eurgbp transactions they have always been , safe , reliable and quick .

positive	will use them again and again and again .
positive	a +
positive	da ich beruflich häufiger auf die fähre von und nach england angewiesen bin und mir die ökonomischste verbindung wichtig ist , habe_ich im vergangenen jahr viel zeit damit verbracht den besten anbieter zu finden - bis ich auf aferry gestoßen bin und mein suchen endlich ein ende hatte .
positive	seither buche ich nur noch mit ihnen .

positive	i ' m always a bit_wary buying expensive items online from a company i know nothing about , but i will most definitely use them again when the tyres on our other car need replacing .

positive	i can ' t praise them enough !!

positive	their reminder emails were very helpful and their pricing was fair
positive	nice selection of latest clothes , good delivery time , and also they have a decent sale on almost constantly .
positive	best online shop for contemperary clothing .
positive	ordered a dozen_times and never any_problems .
positive	ordered a few fragrances from this comany , and the prices are best you are going to find in the uk .
positive	shipping takes around 0 - 0 days , but is free so i guess it isn ' t that bad !

positive	easily the best website to search for accomodation .
positive	i don ' t use courier companies outside work but i had to send a package back to a retailer .
positive	i sent it from london , it was picked_up from my house and went to birmingham .
positive	i booked this in on thursday_morning and this was picked_up and delivered by friday .
positive	it was not that expensive and i was shocked at the service .
positive	i can ' t recommend highly_enough .
positive	i had a lady_called claire help within the booking team and she could not have been more helpful .
positive	i requirements changed daily until booking but nothing was to much_trouble .
positive	it was so nice and refreshing to have so much help .
positive	would highly_recommend this company and use it again in the future .
positive	i couldn ' t a shorter booking process anywhere .
positive	the service allowed me to select date , nights and pay for the booking within a couple of clicks .
positive	amazing !!
positive	!
positive	great weekend handled well by chillisauce , didn ' t have any worries ... and the hotel was much too fancy for a bunch of hairy ars * d men on a stag_do !
positive	next_day delivery for a good cost ( only £ 0 . 00 not £ 0 or £ 0 ) and the jacket i bought cheaper_than other_websites .
positive	so far , very good .
positive	it ' s quick to book and review .
positive	... this be a great website !
positive	love the layout , searching for products is easy and love the support they give .
positive	even on the rare_occasion where we ' ve had to chase something up or we ' ve had a problem with an item they ' ve been quick to rectify and offer a fast and friendly service .
positive	i have used thedrinkshop . com for quite a few_years and not only have i found their large_selection of alcohol at competitive_pricing , but their service delivery is top_notch too !
positive	with fast dispatch in quality packaging , i really can ' t fault them .
positive	the best dedicated online games shop on the web - great games , great prices , speedy dispatch , texts / emails / picture updates to let me know that my order has been processed , packed & sent .
positive	if you want pre_- ordered games to arrive on time or even ahead of schedule then shopto is the place to go !
positive	i have been exploring many websites that deal with mobile recycling but i was recommended mazuma by a few friends saying how quick and easy it was as well as great value for money so i thought id take a gamble .
positive	i have to say this is probably one of the most efficient and outstanding websites i have come_across .
positive	not only was it easy to place an order , but the efficiency from when i sent the phones to you to when i received confirmation that the money was transferred to my account was astonishing !
positive	literally about 00_hours it took .
positive	the money i received will now be going towards a few special presents as its my mums 00th coming up as well as my son oscars first birthday coming up .
positive	thank_you to all the staff who work for mazuma , you are all a credit to yourselves and i will be recommending your site to everybody !
positive	!
positive	we have ordered from printer land on a number of occasions and have always received truly excellent service from start to finish .
positive	i cannot rate them highly_enough .
positive	their advice on products is accurate and fair , and the efficiency of the ordering_process could not be better !
positive	first time buyer from them .
positive	they have the lowest_prices i have found and great deals !
positive	who don ' t like free_stuff !
positive	i can definatly recommend this site to anyone_looking to cash in on an old laptop .
positive	i came accross many sites and this one offered me the best price , i was a little_wary at first but there was no need .
positive	i got an_email_saying my laptop had been recieved the following_day after posting and a quote a few_days_later .
positive	my quote after inspection was £_00 lower_than my orignal but for a valid reason and the price was still more_than i expected .
positive	after accepting the re - vised quote i had the money in my payal account in no time !
positive	:)
positive	learn ' t so much .
positive	i was unsure at first , whether to put my tv on the wall , as i had always had it up the corner on a stand .
positive	my lounge isn ' t the biggest in the world , and every time i moved my furniture around i always felt_like the biggest corner in my room was sucked up by my tv .
positive	i rang home av , and spoke to ian , i told him my worries and concerns , he listened and gave me helpful advice .
positive	i didn ' t feel pushed or like he was trying to sell me anything .
positive	i arranged a time for him to come out and show me where he thought would be best for my tv to be mounted , and asked for a quote .
positive	working full time , i didn ' t think he would want to come out on an evening , but he was flexible and fit around me .
positive	happy with the quote , i asked him when he could do it .
positive	just 0 days_later , ian & jamie returned to hang my tv on the wall .
positive	one word describes how it looks - amazing !
positive	!
positive	i am so happy , and they even hoovered up after themselves .
positive	thanks home av , i will_definitely be recommending you !!
positive	all the best for your future .
positive	i really_appreciate to use the dial to save service as it provide me lots of facilities to get in touch with my relatives .
positive	best aerline to go in a holyday trip
positive	is the easiest_way to find your perfect holiday
positive	is the easiest and fastest way to shop
positive	tesco is the best food shop , the best prices end the food is very fresh .
positive	a greate companay , greate mobile deals !
positive	thank to mazuma_mobile , it was a greate experience , mazuma help me u sell my old_phones at a gtreate value . thanks
positive	supplement_warehouse is a great escape from the overpriced stores that offer the same product .
positive	it is very obvious the supplement_warehouse strives to offer you the best price for supreme products because of the amazing feature they have which is comparing a competitor ' s price and if a competitor ' s price is lower , supplement_warehouse will automatically make it less_than that lowest_price .
positive	i am an extremely_satisfied customer .
positive	i highly_recommend this website / service to any individual who plans to delve into purchasing supplements .
positive	i have been using printing . com for about 0 years now and i cannot thank enough for their fast and high_quality service .
positive	i recommend you guys to people all the time !
positive	thanks .
positive	i must_admit i was slightly skeptical ordering from digitalrev , especially because i had never_heard of this site but went_ahead with the purchase of my hs00exr fujifilm camera based on excellent reviews i had read about their services - i was not disappointed !
positive	the product was so carefully_wrapped as to avoid any damage .
positive	i thought there may be some hidden conditions attached due to the cheap pricing of the product , however this was not the case and they guarantee free shipping on their website with covered insurance ( not many sites do this ) and my mind was put at rest .
positive	the camera is absolutely new and perfect and i would definitely be ordering from them again .
positive	they keep you fully informed of delivery through the tracking_number and provide regular email_updates .
positive	perfect site !
positive	000_% would recommend .
positive	i ' ve booked a hen_night through a company before and wasn ' t verly pleased with the outcome of the night so was a little_apprehensive at 0st about booking through a company again but due to the limited time i had to book s ' thing as it was pretty last_minute i decided to investigate a little .
positive	originally when i put my options into the boxes at the beginning i went all out to see what the prices would end up at , it was a little expensive but after_speaking with mike agar (??)
positive	a consultant with hen_heaven who was extremely_helpful , we managed to get it to a price i thought people could afford and would still hopefully be a great night out .
positive	unfortunately our hen who is australian was stuck in oz due to visa problems and some of the guests decided not to come , but 0 of us went along and made the best of it .
positive	so manchester here we came ..... in the afternoon we did a cocktail_making session which was so much fun and we managed to drink enough for everyone that should ' ve been there .
positive	we didn ' t know we were getting nibbles at the end of it which was an added_bonus to soak up some of the alcohol .
positive	the meal and club_entry in the evening was at tiger_tiger which was fab .
positive	tiger_tiger has 0 floors to it so altho we had to be in there before 00pm to get our free entry it didn ' t really matter cos it was already quite busy and we spent most of the evening in the 00 ' s / 00 ' s section .
positive	the hotel was right in the centre of everywhere we needed to be so we saved money on taxi fares and it was very comfortable .
positive	the only_downside to the evening was that in tiger_tiger they questioned us about the 0 complimentary bottles of champagne we were to receive and also about the payment at the end , they accused us of trying to walk out without paying so i had to keep showing them the email from hen_heaven proving that we were to get the bottles and that everything was paid for which was a little embarrassing but overall we had a great night .
positive	like i said before i was a little_apprehensive_about booking through a company again but hen_heaven made things so easy that when the hen eventually gets over here i may well be booking through them again .....
positive	traded in a couple of idevices with no_problems at all .
positive	recieved a decent amount by cheque .
positive	communication was excellent throughout .
positive	will certainly use again .
positive	i rang customer_services at 00 : 00 on 00 / 00 / 00
positive	i had miss placed all my phon numbers and had no way of getting them back i needed one contact asap and i spoke to a guy called michael he was a star !
positive	he found it no problem at all and has made my day .
positive	i cannot_fault anything from this company .
positive	we first bought a sideboard and a telephone table .
positive	then afterwards we went back for a table , mirror and bookcase !!
positive	the quality of the furniture is next to none and the price is even better compared to other oak_furniture i ' ve seen .
positive	everything from service in store to the delivery men where fantastic !!!!
positive	thank_you !!
positive	it makes a change to see excellent customer_service like this !!
positive	!
positive	amazing site !
positive	instant key delivery , very happy what more can you ask for =)
positive	very happy with service .
positive	item dispatch was fast as was delivery .
positive	quality of clothes was high as was printing .
positive	very happy and would definately_recommend .
positive	0 * company :)
positive	there are a number of hostel booking sites , but hostelbookers seems to have more options without charging any fees .
positive	last_week i got last_minute tickets through viagogo to the chelsea flower show which was incredible !
positive	despite the short_notice i got great value tickets , delivered well in time for the show .
positive	i have used them many_times before and never once had a problem with tickets or using the site which i personally find clear and easy to use .
positive	i would strongly_recommend viagogo , especially for when looking for last_minute tickets .
positive	it helps me save money on my supplement_needs :)
positive	last weekend in budapest was fantastic thanks to the guys at chillisauce !
positive	from start to finish everything was well_organised , involved brilliant activities , was great value and saved us heaps of time .
positive	i ' ve actually been on a chillisauce do before , but thought it was all down to the hard work of our mate .
positive	now i know better .
positive	would i use chillisauce again ?
positive	it ' s a no_brainer - yes .
positive	i ' ve never had any_problems with magic_madhouse and i ' ve ordered from them > 0 times now , the cards come within 0 days and the cards arrive in an immaculate_condition .
positive	i can ' t think of any_problems i ' ve had with them and their loyalty service is second to none .
positive	we purchased little life toddler reins in fairy wings style .
positive	my daughter absolutly loves the design as she feels she has her own bag instead of wearing reins .
positive	the zip compartment is just right for a small teddy and a cup of juice .
positive	the strap is strong and not too long .
positive	the delivery was quick and all in all a wonderful service .
positive	we are very happy and will shop with coz mole again .
positive	i ' ve been using this website for around a month now and i can ' t say anything wrong with it , they have good prices and a good collection of games , this paired with a quick delivery system for the cd_keys is just fantastic
positive	the website was well - designed and very friendly to new users , providing helpful information at a glance on the left pane when booking ( e . g .
positive	00h internet / wifi , luggage room ).
positive	love the website !
positive	i ' ve bought two guitars from richtone , and the service has been great both_times .
positive	both arrived exactly when they should have ( which was next_day delivery ), and the two guitars were set_up beautifully .
positive	not sure what more you can ask for really !
positive	there are quite a few different sites on the internet where you can buy cd - keys to games for a discounted price , if , like me , you are not interested in owning the physical media and would rather just download the software .
positive	by experience , i can say that the only site that never tried to cheat me or sold non - working keys is oks , and i tried quite a few .
positive	if there does arise a problem ( which is inevitable with any shopping site ), their support was always quick to answer my questions and helped_me out very fast .
positive	you can also follow them on facebook , where they generally reply very fast to questions about new products or post announcements regarding new games .
positive	overall , i can definitely_recommend buying there .
positive	[_name ] made sending my parcel so easy .
positive	even when i got it wrong , [_name ] fixed my mistake quickly and efficiently .
positive	a credit to your company !
positive	!
positive	great meat , great service !
positive	i will be using weston gourmet again .
positive	i ordered the althena bodycon plunge dress from missguided on the october 0rd , my dress then arrived the next_day with free delivery which i was so excited about !
positive	the dress my gorgeous and looked exactly how it did on the website and it fit even better :) i ' ve ordered from missguided before and have had so many lovely shopping experiences with great customer care , will_continue to buy gorgeous dresses from missguided in future !!
positive	0_stars !!
positive	!
positive	this was a great company they were very quick ( almost scarey ) but never the less pleased with the end_result
positive	thank_you for your great service and knowledge when i made my purchase .
positive	deciding on the correct high - end watch was not an easy decision , but the knowledge and information i received was fantastic .
positive	it is our second family purchase from xupes . com and i am sure there will be many more to come .
positive	i was a back seat passenger in a taxi , en_route home from a night out , i was sleeping in the back of the cab when i woke_up in a cloud of smoke .
positive	turned_out the taxi was driving too fast for the weather_conditions and bounced off 0 cars on either side of the road .
positive	, i took the registration of the cab i was in just in case he wasn ’ t insured , and ended_up getting another cab home , suffice to way this time i was wide awake .
positive	put my case though accident_advice helpline and gave them the only piece of information i had , the registration of the cab , they did all the work for me , tracked down the cab driver , cab company and all the insurance details .
positive	they were very informative from the start and helped_me through the whole_process , which was a lot_easier then i anticipated .
positive	three months later i got a cheque in the post for £ 0000 , could not have asked for a better company to deal with my case , highly_recommended , and would defiantly use them again if i ever get into an accident , hopefully i don ’ t but you never know .
positive	very quick , efficient and reliable company , d
positive	order number :_000000000

positive	will_definitely use again :-)
positive	right product , right price , fast delivery
positive	great service .
positive	helpful on the phone and quick delivery .
positive	i decided to use mazumamobile based on the great reputation they have for customer_service and i wasn ' t dissapointed !
positive	the website was very easy to use and only to a couple of minutes to place an order to send three phones .
positive	the price quoted was up there with the other_websites too .
positive	the pack to send the phones in arrived the next_day and again was easy to use with the forms to submit already completed .
positive	free p_& p too .
positive	i went for the option of a cheque and this arrived two days_later , even in all the postal delays due to the snow .
positive	now i know the system works i ' d probably use the bank_transfer next time .
positive	they emailed confirmation of every_step and you can follow the order online too .

positive	thanks a lot .
positive	it ' s secure .. that makes hostelbrookers a cool and useful_tool to plan any travel ;)

positive	the product was exactly as_described , very reasonable and free delivery was even better .
positive	the service when i phoned up could not have been better .
positive	i was told about the difference in chairs and also what was the best size table for my decking and rattan warehouse were correct in all aspects .
positive	just all put out and i have to say what a lovely set of furniture it looks , the cushions are sooo nice as well ..., not those cheap thin ones i have seen on some sets i have viewed .
positive	a really good website with a back up and sales_team who really know their stuff .... and the delivery driver was also friendly and couldnt do enough to put furniture in the garden , and my garden is 000ft long and the decking is at the back !
positive	!
positive	just a really good website and great ' real_person ' experience !
positive	!”
positive	payed with paypal , got key within 00_hours .
positive	communication was great , questions answered_quickly .
positive	people always try and say key sites are scam .
positive	there are always a few hiccups , but it seems to me int keys has their stuff together .
positive	easy to identify the options available for my acer aspire 0000 laptop .
positive	order dispatched with 00_hours and then delivered the following_day .

positive	ordered a ps0 game for £_00 , arrived very quickly and well_packaged but somehow the case for the game had got smashed ( i ' m blaming royal_mail ) i sent a email to customer_service and got a reply back only 00_mins later saying they would send out a replacement case .
positive	the case arrived the very next_day in perfect_condition .
positive	top service , top prices , i strongly_recommend !
positive	been using viovet for some time now as my pet needs medication on a fairly regular_basis .
positive	viovet always get the medication to my door in super_fast time and i ' ve never had any_problems .
positive	if you are looking for a reliable place to get medication from , or anything pet related for that matter , viovet are really good .
positive	tecc offers the best quality of products in the market at the best prices with great deals throughout the year .
positive	tecc should be everyones first stop when considering replacement products to smoking .
positive	amazing prices with fast delivery !
positive	i have ordered several bouquets from this company .
positive	mainly for my mum but also to other family_members .
positive	i have never ever had any_issues with them .
positive	the bouquets are always beautiful looking and last ages .
positive	i ordered a rose and lily bouquet for my mum and it lasted over 0 weeks .
positive	she had been given some flowers from the supermarket at the same time but they died within a week !
positive	!
positive	customer_service is always really helpful and i would recommend prestige to anyone .
positive	i will never order flowers from anyone_else but prestige_flowers
positive	excellent service , great prices , even better staff .
positive	you will feel at home and well taken care of at official watches / dd jewellers .
positive	brilliant website , fantastic staff to follow_up the easy to use website .
positive	would highly_recommend using this website !
positive	i wouldnt use anywhere_else to find info about a movie than here , it has it all .
positive	the review system could use a bit of work as films are always rated loads of 0s and 00s to try and balance the scores out but if people would just rate them properly then it would be so much_better .
positive	id still give it a 0 out of 0_stars though as everything else just works so well .
positive	google is by_far the best web search_engine around , nobody does things half as good as these .
positive	also i am very happy with the way google android is coming along with each release it is getting better , cant_wait_till they are up there giving microsoft a run for their money in the home os markets .
positive	shopto are in my opinion the place to go for your games , cheapest prices in most_cases , a great reward system in giving you points that equate to cash to use for future_purchases but best of all the superb fast delivery times .
positive	i have ordered items as late as 0pm and received them the day after , never had a late item delivery , in most_cases i have had games a day or 0 before_release_date .
positive	couldnt praise them more and cant really ask for more from a company .

positive	in peopleperhour i found a pool of talented people that were just there when i needed them .
positive	i tried to move my transportation business on the web by creating a simple , yet practical reservation system that increased my traffic .
positive	starting from the technical aspect of setting_up the web_site and continuing with the logo and web_design , firm branding and seo enhancements that would attract more clients to my site , pph freelancers were there for me ; not only to successfully complete the task i was assigning them , but also to give me insights on how to set_up my service more efficiently .
positive	what ' s more important is that when i didn ' t know how to find what i wanted or had questions , their awesome customer support was there to assist me and help me move on .

positive	i witnessed a 00_% increase of traffic in my business via the online reservation system in at about 0 months .
positive	thanks for that pph !

positive	simply_games have always been a reliable online presence for me and with the big names failing in their customer_service obligations lately ( game ' s delivery time is terrible and amazon have whacked their prices up now that hmv and play are gone ) they ' re well placed to take a lot of my custom .
positive	i ordered bioshock_infinite and within a couple of days it had been despatched by first_class post and arrived 0 days before_release .
positive	would ' ve been with me a couple of days earlier even , but for the atrocious postal service in my area .
positive	the icing on the cake was that the game dropped in price by a few_quid after my copy had been despatched and , without having to be asked , simply_games had reduced my invoice to the new lower_price .
positive	a great , and hopefully long_lasting , retailer !
positive	i ordered a playstation 0 , an extra controller and gta v , all works great apart_from the extra controllers left analog is a bit loose so it doesn ' t spring back to the centre - would be nice to have advised that on the page , other than that it works great .
positive	all in all great buy , cannot complain for the price at all , plus the quick delivery .
positive	very good .
positive	i cant_complain one bit not only did i get an amazing price but i also recieved my codes instantly .
positive	payment was quick , simple and fast .
positive	i withhold complete_aquatics with high regards , there customer_service is second to none .
positive	when i got in contact with complete_aquatics when seeking a new aquarium , i wanted someone who could prescribe an aquarium with corresponding accessories specific to my needs .
positive	i spoke to a gentleman named chris who dealt_with my order promptly and efficiently , he had all the time in the world for me ( 00_minutes on the phone !).
positive	as i ’ m quite a novice when it comes to aquariums , he gave me allot of tips , ideas and recommendations for my newly commissioned aquarium which i purchased directly from complete_aquatics .
positive	advice varied from landscaping ideas to livestock and the initial setup process for the aquariums ( very helpful indeed !
positive	).
positive	the order and delivery was seamless ; delivered within three working_days from date of purchase .
positive	prior to delivery , chris gave me a courtesy_call to give me a confirmed date and time for the delivery .
positive	as i had ordered an array of accessories to compliment my aquarium , they threw in some extra premium freebies to supplement my order which was rather generous .
positive	everything i needed to get me started .

positive	they provide excellent customer_service , professional advice and a brilliant aftercare service – i shall be purchasing my supplies from these_guys in the future .
positive	the best hostel site .
positive	i would recommend to you cheryl to buy tickets from double0tickets . com , as it has the best and cheapest tickets from sold - out events .

positive	hostelbookers is cheaper_than the competition and at worst as reliable and at best far more reliable .
positive	earlier this year our company began contracting out proof reading of marketing to grammar genie as a trial due to the high costs of proof reading and copy editing we were paying to our print management company .
positive	the member of staff we dealt_with was sharon .
positive	the service from her was very quick and efficient and and attention to detail was unprecedented .
positive	we sent off numerous marketing campains to her to be checked , and thought they were grammatically perfect .
positive	we were somewhat mistaken to say the least .
positive	in 0 days sharon had uncovered dozens of errors , and edited the documents for us giving a list of all the changes she had made .
positive	not only that , she changed and reworded many sentences to make everything flow better .
positive	sharon has since worked on our company website , legal letters , employment contracts and all our marketing .
positive	i cannot reccomend the services of grammar genie enough .
positive	very reasonably_priced , and worth every_penny .
positive	i would happily_recommend to others , great experience dealing_with this company .
positive	super_fast delivery , i placed my order just after 0pm , it arrived the morning next_day !
positive	packaging was also very good ... fantastic service , would definitely_recommend
positive	have bought from the whisky_exchange several_times now and am always impressed with their selection .
positive	recently i bought a bottle of knob creek for my brother on a saturday evening and it arrived on tuesday ( standard delivery ).
positive	very acceptable .
positive	bottles ordered arrive well_packaged .
positive	i ' m yet to have anything break en_route .
positive	would recommend twe to a friend , and in fact it was recommended to me by a friend in the first place .
positive	got a tub of retro sweets as a present for a friend ' s four children .
positive	hopefully they ' ll love it .
positive	one of the review says that the tub was not nearly as full as the picture implies : i would have to disagree .
positive	i bought a few extra bits to add to the tub so that there were four of each of the more popular items ( popping candy , for example ) and had difficulty fitting any more in there !
positive	i signed_up after trialling the product for a week and was amazed at how simple everything was .
positive	they certainly picked a good name for the product !
positive	i ' ve found that the software can do an awful lot , but the way in which it ' s presented makes all the difference .
positive	i was all setup and emailing candidates within minutes .
positive	i ’ ve found their technical_support to be very good and they are always updating the product with customer suggestions .
positive	such a breath of fresh_air from my previous software which shall remain anonymous :-)
positive	tracking_number and communication through email let ' s you know where your product is and when it will arrive which is well decent .
positive	the site itself has got really wide_range of clothes , definitely should be able to find the brand you like and it ' s got a mint sale section , well worth a browse around , you ' ll find something you like easy .
positive	i bought a new laptop and wanted to sell my old .
positive	i searched the net and found the best price here !!!
positive	i filled in the form within_seconds i recurred an_email .

positive	i ' m very happy :)
positive	super_quick deliver and with cash back deal - the cheapest on the market .
positive	i ' ve been using hostelbookers for quite a while , since i traveled in europe three years_ago .
positive	i ' ve always found trustworthy , inexpensive places to stay through them ( and their prices really are the cheapest among the other hostel sites ...
positive	i ' ve checked !).
positive	never had a problem confirming my reservation through them or checking in with my reservation at hostel locations across the world !
positive	highly_recommended for students and young people looking to travel on a budget !
positive	as always with the whiskey_exchange the parcel was extremely well_protected and was delivery next_day via parcel_force .
positive	the prices you can ’ t beat and the descriptions of the taste , smell etc is usually spot on .
positive	i would recommend this company to anybody who_wants top quality drink at extremely competitive_prices .
positive	cult_pens could not have provided a better service if they had tried .
positive	i asked if they would price_match another offer i had received which they had no issues with at all which saved me a great chunk of money and even included next_day special delivery at no extra_cost .
positive	email communication was absolutely impeccable and i received replies within minutes .
positive	i deal with three different people via_email but each was extremely_helpful and willing and seemed like they were working as a team .
positive	the same was experienced when i rang up to place the order ; very pleasant and courteous .
positive	the item was delivery on the exact date i asked for and was in immaculate_condition with superior packaging ; i did change the delivery destination and postal date after_placing the order but there were no issues at all in doing this so again another great positive point .
positive	overall , a brilliant service and i will_definitely use again as and when i need .
positive	i mean there is not much i can say accept the fact that the prices are low and the time in which i received the key was under 0 min .
positive	no reason not to give 0_stars .
positive	always have what you want , or they do their best to get from another store .
positive	very competitive_pricing and easy to choose online or in store .
positive	like their new system instore .
positive	always helpful , changing anything you return or refunds .
positive	never had a bad_word_against them .
positive	we have always been with o0 found them to be very reliable company , good choice of phones and very reasonable with their deals and rates .
positive	we found superfoods website to be very informative and that is why we ordered from them .
positive	we have to wait three months before we can leave a feedback relating to the effects of what we ordered .

positive	i am an ebay buyer and had refused a parcel from a seller i purchased for as i no_longer required the item .
positive	since i told the seller this i have had problems with the seller who had been telling_me that i was responsible for the liability of the parcel if it did not arrive with them or was damaged .
positive	i spoke to emma through the live help and she was excellent !
positive	and i have now penned a dispute against the client - very concise and clear and made me feel more confident about my predicament - thank_you !
positive	!
positive	ordered a couple of bits for a computer i was building from ebuyer . com .
positive	the prices were cheaper_than amazon and i didn ' t have to worry_about that cowboy courier company ' yodel ' damaging my parcel like usual , especially because one of the items was a hdd .
positive	the items arrived a week after ordering , which was not quick but it was just before_christmas , so they were busy and i forgive them .
positive	the items were very well_packaged especially the hdd .
positive	will be buying a new monitor from them soon .
positive	thanks
positive	well i was supposed to have a reunion of sorts with my rebel girl gang from college and was not sure what to buy as it was summer .
positive	my problem was that i was supposed to meet on the weekend and was really caught up at work .
positive	so during a chit chat with a colleague at my work she suggested to buy a dress online .
positive	she in the same breath suggested to check out miss rebel .
positive	being summer i wanted something flowery and vibrant .
positive	in the evening when i logged_into missrebel . co . uk it was in for a surprise for the share range and cost at which they sold .
positive	unbelievable !
positive	gosh , it was a crisis of plenty !
positive	trust me it was tough to decide what not to buy !
positive	the summer collection was so beautiful .
positive	and it took me 00_minutes to decide on a long summer dress with flower patterns .
positive	not easy for a girl huh !
positive	but most who i had heard from about internet shopping came with a warning about the problems in delivery .
positive	but due to work constraint i gave it a shot !
positive	this was wednesday_evening and i was set to meet my four friends on saturday .
positive	guess_what miss rebel delivered the dress at my home soon after i came back from work on friday .
positive	and that really made my day !
positive	so when i went for the reunion , i received compliments from everyone .
positive	i would strongly_recommend missrebel !!!
positive	keep rebeling gals !
positive	!
positive	they were able to answer the questions i had about my course in a clear and helpful manner
positive	quick and easy .
positive	money transferred to my account same day they received my phone .
positive	should also say i received full_amount unlike some other similar companies who knock off money for small defects / marks / small scratches to the phone .
positive	have used mazuma a number of times in the past and will_definitely use again in the future .
positive	spoke to reshmee who was extremely professional , brilliant and courteous over the phone and not to forget her super efficiency for sorting_out our complicated flight pattern and being extremely patient when we had changed out minds on a hotel that we had booked .
positive	extremely knowledgeable and knew_exactly_what we would be looking for .
positive	will always continue to use reshmee to book our away holidays and will always recommend to friends and family !
positive	always a good selection , competitive_prices and first_class service .
positive	i ordered rad new vans that i couldn ' t find on the high_st , cheaper_than other_websites i found them on .

positive	eagle saver is great and fast !
positive	from getting your dvd ' s put in their system for a quote to getting the check in the mail it was all so easy and effortless !
positive	they did an outstanding job with keeping me up to date with what was going on and i got my check really fast too !
positive	way to go eagle saver i would recommend them to anyone in need of selling dvd ' s !
positive	i was very pleased with my order that was a gift !

positive	she loved it and i loved it !
positive	this autocentres is the best i have ever visited , i had a flat back tyre so having limited options i called the aa for road side assistance , having more knowledge into the flat tyre , it was just a slow puncture .
positive	the aa man suggested , to go the local garriage which was only 000 yards from were i was stationed .
positive	my son had come_across this eden tyres & servicing from an app called near me , which located this garage ( by chance ) because it was the closest in my area .
positive	the loverly polite staff took a look at the tyre described that it was a slow puncture , so they offered to examine the tyre , so the polite staff , took care by placing a sheet over the driver ' s seat to stop it getting dirty and examined my car for free .
positive	this was a total shock to me , it was such a reliable examination , no exaggeration , it was also a fast examination , only sitting in the waiting room for only 0 minutes .
positive	to my surprise they had repaired the puncture free of charge what a survive .
positive	they did not try to sell any tyres , but told us the truth .
positive	i asked how much they charge for a replacement , and to my amazement they told me that it only cost , £_00 and where i normally go in chesterfield it cost £_00 , what a saving .
positive	so to conclude i will_definately be visiting again , and if you are in the local area of 0 & 0 pentrich road ( opposite screwfix ), giltbrook industrial park , giltbrook , nottinghamshire ng00 0uz ., near the ikea , please give them a visit because they have amazing services at great prices and such a polite and willing service , which everyone will warm to .
positive	please give them a ring at : 00000_000000
positive	so far so good .
positive	the prices can ' t be beat .
positive	good customer_service if you ever have to speak with them on the phone .
positive	i have been using ebuyer for my pc builds for well over 0 years now , and i can_honestly say i have never had an issue with the service they provide .
positive	their free delivery is a blessing , and their charged shipping is at a reasonable_price for those times when i ' ve needed things through next_day .
positive	all items are well_packaged , with plenty of " stuffing " to keep components safe during_transit .
positive	they stock a wide_variety of products ; from value for when you ' ve not got the cash to shop for big name brands , to said big name brands .
positive	though it should be said whether you shop for either they are all of a high_quality .
positive	defaults in products happen , and that isn ' t the fault of the company shipping the product to you ( unless they make it of course !
positive	); so on the one or two occasions that i ' ve been delivered a faulty product , i was very pleased that i had absolutely no issue with the returns service ebuyer provide .
positive	their response to my issue was quick , and i got my replacement quickly .
positive	i know this review sounds_like a massive advertising campaign for ebuyer , but given the many years i ' ve been using them and how well i ' ve been treated as a customer i think it ' s well_deserved .
positive	i look_forward to many more years of great deals , and happy shopping !
positive	fantastic service and quick delivery .
positive	product arrived in excellent condition and with adequate packaging .
positive	will_definitely be using again .

positive	i sent a parcel with them in january and had no_problems , then received emails from them with offers so i logged on to send another .

positive	i have to say the everything was brilliant :) i had a few queries when sending my parcel and wih my account so was in contact via the live_chat a couple of times and the team ( charlie , sammie , stephanie ) were very helpful and attended to my every need .
positive	it is a very simple and easy process and i would recommend parcels0go to everyone .
positive	the collection was made on the scheduled day ( by city_link ) at 0pm and was delivery was made to the recipient 0pm the following_day .

positive	got a cheap last_minute deal with these people .
positive	the rep was great , the hotel fab and the skiing great .
positive	would go again , but doubt i will ever get that price again , £_000 for the week !
positive	bought two or three times and always the advise of the women on the phones is excellent .
positive	everything fits and if there is ever an issue they always sort out there and then .
positive	good prices and a vast_range of skiwear .
positive	one of the best on the internet .
positive	the instrument to everywhere .
positive	the gateway to shopping paradise .
positive	how would we work , play or pis $ without them ?
positive	fantastic range , amazing service and fast delivery .
positive	all that , everyone has .
positive	these people have this plus they have the best price on the internet .
positive	they should be the biggest and best for outdoor , camping and skiwear anywhere in the uk .
positive	no doubt they will be .
positive	i have used overclockers . co . uk a lot over the past_year , every time the service has been excellent .
positive	i ' ve had problems with most of the other online pc component retailers in the uk , but not a single_issue with overclockers .
positive	i highly_recommend them as first choice .
positive	i occasionally buy from tesco online and the delivery is always very fast regardless of whatever postage i choose .
positive	i bought mobile phone last_year off them for roughly £_00 delivered .
positive	took about 0 days to arrive but strangely i ended_up getting a postage refund , tesco said it was delayed : s , so the phone only cost £_00 delivered :)
positive	great service every time :)
positive	so many people down - voting carphone_warehouse because of yodel .
positive	yes yodel are terrible , and they shouldn ' t legally be allowed to call themselves a delivery company .
positive	and yes , carphone_warehouse shouldn ' t be using them .
positive	there is an obvious and simple way to get around this though .
positive	select the " deliver to store " option .
positive	i read all these reviews and decided to give this a try .
positive	it worked beautifully !
positive	the phone i ' ve been wanting for a while ( nexus 0 ) on the contract i wanted ( cheap as chips ) when i wanted it ( next_day ) with no_fuss whatsoever !
positive	avoid yodel at all costs - but don ' t miss out on a good deal because of it .
positive	maybe carphone_warehouse will pull their finger out and give these_idiots the boot eventually ... but until then you can still use them , get good service and a great deal too .
positive	most painless mobile i ' ve ever got .
positive	txtnation provides a 0st_class service in internet & mobile solutions , txtnation is not a company to keep up with the times the goal is to be an industry leader & present new innovative products to the client .
positive	ordered more_than a few items from deep_blue now and always receive items in a timeous fashion .
positive	when i ' ve called into the shop for some info prior to ordering the staff have always been very friendly and knowledgable .
positive	bottom_line is if you need any training gear then give them a try , you wont be let_down on service and you just might save a few bob .
positive	nothing to complain_about with this company .
positive	competitive_prices and promptly posted a packe to send my phones off in .
positive	the following_day i got an_email to say my cheque had been posted and lo and behold there it was the following_day !!
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	after royal_mail increased their prices i have been looking for a good quality service with good pricing .
positive	i decided to give transglobal express a go , the item was collected promptly and arrived in great condition the next_day .
positive	i would recommend transglobal to anyone , their prices are much_better_than going direct with some of the companies which is a big plus for me .
positive	i will be using them again in the future without a doubt .
positive	not having a clue about domains and servers etc , petru was a fantastic help to me , and was able to sort this as i couldnt with any instructions as i have no knowledge , you have a great team and i have been using 000 reg for almost a year now and i have never had any_problems so thank_you
positive	ordered on thursday had envelope on friday , recieved phones on monday had money through same day by card payment overall no_problems unlike_other services who changed the price once sent phone back , very good customer_service
positive	i ' m very happy with my shop on line , the delivery was fast ...
positive	i will buy much more ...
positive	i have to sat the slot games are big strength of kerching - there are obvious titles like ghostbusters and da vinci diamonds but lots of others to enjoy too and i have had some good wins to boot !
positive	:) having said that , i really_enjoyed roulette too .
positive	customer_service is good and i have never had any_issues with payouts / withdrawals etc .
positive	so i ordered call of duty : ghost key from cjs_cdkeys i didn ' t have to wait even a minute and i got my hands on the product very fast processing and very reliable !
positive	i will use this company on my future_purchases , thanks cjs !
positive	well first when i saw these prices i thought " what the hell , these games can ' t be that cheap " and so then i came here and read about this site which made me conviced it was a real deal !
positive	so i ordered few games and it took like about 0 hours , which didn ' t bother me aaand the keys worked !
positive	:) only thing that there were weird was that they wanted my photo and name , but i was okay with it .
positive	im going to keep using this site from here on :)
positive	have only directly purchased two games through this site - sid meier ' s civilization v and dragon age : origins - ultimate edition , but my direct group of friends has collectively ordered over 00 games and the results are almost always the same - cheap prices , almost immediate delivery of the cd_key .
positive	i did have to wait a bit for the dragon age key , but the effort from the team to keep on top of things through customer interaction was brilliant .
positive	definitely sticking with this company for my game purchases .
positive	also the extra step of having an xfire for live_chat goes above and beyond any of the other_companies around .
positive	00 / 00 - 0_stars .
positive	definitely_recommend to anyone_wanting to buy cd_keys ( or even replacement disc / box / manuals !)
positive	they have the biggest_selection and they even still carry jack0d and oxy elite pro !
positive	their prices are beyond fair and even give you a better deal if you find a better price else where .
positive	seriously there is no other reason to go anywhere_else .
positive	my first experience of cex has been very smooth , indeed .
positive	i wanted to trade - in the game , rayman legends for wii_u . cex had the best trade - in price for cash , so i signed_up and went through the process .
positive	one of the highlights would have to be the mailing label being absolutely free .
positive	excellent !
positive	then , it was as simple as packaging up the game and posting it through the nearest postbox .
positive	within 00 or so days , they had received it , processed it and sent the cash via bank_transfer .
positive	simple .
positive	not the fastest way , sure .
positive	but via post , not bad at all .
positive	being so simple , i am sure to use them again in the future .
positive	i have often heard of cex , but had never used them before .
positive	so , it was a nice surprise to find that their service was very straight - forward and smooth .
positive	i highly_recommend them !
positive	earlier this year , i needed a replacement power_supply for my computer .
positive	scouring the internet like i normally do , i found that ccl had the best deal and good stock_levels .
positive	and with a few simple clicks , i created the order and awaited the despatch email .
positive	it arrived in good time and everything was in order .
positive	simple as that .
positive	on a side note , i don ' t understand the bad_reviews on trustpilot .
positive	i ' ve been using ccl since 0000 when i bought a laptop from them and have never had any_issues with orders , then or now .
positive	and because of that , i look_forward to ordering from them again very soon .
positive	i hadn ' t heard of hifix before , but they were the cheapest when i was looking for some qav speakers , so i tried them out .
positive	not only did i get the cheapest price and free delivery , i also got fast next_day delivery !
positive	i ' d definitely use them again and it ' s comforting to know there are other shops online that cater so well for hi -_fi items .
positive	great service , would happily buy stuff from them again !
positive	i came_across 0000rpm when looking for some writeable dvds on ebay .
positive	they were shipped very fast and had the best prices i could find on the internet here in the uk .
positive	the next time i needed discs i just searched for 0000rpm on google and came_across their website .
positive	prices were slightly lower_than on ebay , but you do have to pay for delivery :(
positive	the range is better on their website , but like i said , you pay for delivery .
positive	personally , i ' d prefer it if prices were a little_bit cheaper but still with free delivery ( since they don ' t have to pay ebay fees ) but you can ' t have everything .
positive	still , highly_recommended if you want blank discs in the uk
positive	the perks are amazing , and they have a ton of stuff to choose from .
positive	i am very impressed with the discounts on the close to expired stuff that saves us a ton of money for quality supplements .
positive	i would recommend liberty_flights to anyone that smokes e_- cigs .
positive	the have great value products and they are good .
positive	also lots of variety .
positive	i bought the 0cm topper to replace my 0cm egg shaped topper from argos and man what a difference !
positive	the one from memory_foam warehouse is by_far a superior quality then the argos and was almost the same price .
positive	therefore the argos one was returned after 0 night .
positive	will_deffo be back here if i need more .
positive	instant rns alert .
positive	it ' s exactly_what every investor needs .
positive	keep it up
positive	very quick delivery product as expected and even cheaper then the manufacturer ' s website .
positive	plus free next_day delivery
positive	used printing . com in exeter to have booklets printed , the service was great and the staff all to happy to help with any_queries i had .
positive	everything was delivered on schedule and the printed booklets looked fantastic .
positive	i love this webstore - the navigation is silky smooth and the site very easy to read and the prices for the watches i was looking at are lower_than most other_sites out there .
positive	fast delivery too .
positive	thanks
positive	very prompt service .

positive	schedule .
positive	i like them so much .
positive	best 0 star website
positive	simply excellent service all_round .
positive	would highly_recomend to anyone .
positive	i was very impressed that they double_checked with me that i wanted the item shipped to a different address .
positive	there was a technical fault and my item wasn ' t shipped , but when i emailed to enquire what was happening , the lady who dealt_with my email was very helpful , sorted the issue out straight_away and refunded the postage_costs .
