neutral	woulld say that your site was one of the best for getting a return on your money
negative	refunds were offered at various points but at the same time as suggesting the furniture we wanted was within sight which persuaded us to keep waiting ; an error in hindsight .
neutral	excellent customer service would have retained my details with a promise to let me know when in stock and reserve me one for immediate delivery .
neutral	i think , the website should have a preview on everything considering the amount each customers spends .
neutral	having said that price is good and one has comfort from it being a reliable source .

neutral	though i have to admit i find the site a little time_consuming , and to be honest i do prefer to shop in - store , theres a little less choice in - store but your in and out in a time scale you want and you can pick the fresher packs .
positive	i was very happy with the case when it arrived . it looks great , you just can ' t get great unique designs like this in the uk .

positive	super_fast delivery , i placed my order just after 0pm , it arrived the morning next_day !
negative	its an honest review yet you have taken it down and wont let me re - post or post another review about this company ?
negative	you can sometimes buy in their shop products in good prices , that is the reason i bought from them my seagate 0tb green , the disc failed after few_months , and when you try to contact them they made up senseless excuses , they don ' t even talk correct sentences just senseless words which you later put_together as meaning '' no sorry '' there is no warranty talk with manufacturer .

neutral	still they have in stock those beds and keep selling them and i waiting for my bed 000 hours and on the order tracking says - awaiting shipping and nobody telling_me when i get my order , nobody answering the phone , and on my emails just a reply with working hours , it was my last time when i buy something from world stores
negative	getting the money back is like getting blood out of a stone .
neutral	0 hour later i received a phone call asking if i was ready to take out the extended_warranty and he wasn ' t best pleased when i said no .
negative	then i got an e_- mail saying my order had been returned to them and queried why i hadn ' t completed the returns slip !
negative	cost £_00 .
positive	0st off my price_match wasn ' t met b / c it was from amazon .
negative	what is that about ?
positive	the email response from blackcircles , confirming the time of day , came promptly .
negative	stay_away from groupon and infurn !
negative	it gets worse , i have gadget insurance so i then called them .
positive	amazing clarity and crispness !
negative	i am still_waiting for my deposit , to be returned , in the meantime i have contacted my credit_card company , who will act for me and tried to contact cartrawler through their complaints website , which allows you to upload your written complaint , but not supporting information , although it states the info , has_been successfully updated !
negative	i try my very best to avoid buying from other_companies that use yodel as their delivery ' partners '.
positive	wiggle responded within half an_hour with full quote , brilliant .
neutral	the product didn_'_t produce enough smoke to fill my small caravan .
positive	at my age there is no way i could carry that home from the supermarket , even if i could find somewhere locally that sells it .
negative	useless robots in a call_centre ( south_africa ?)
neutral	then the second time i phoned because via e . mail they were unwilling to send me one , the person i spoke to was quite rude and told me a different_story to the first person i spoke to .
negative	meanwhile someone_else had been given our number and we had someone_elses .
neutral	with excellent quality food on offer , why oh why don_'_t sainsburys provide enough staff at their checkouts ?
positive	i would recommend this site and its services to everyone .
neutral	everything was going great until website used parcelforce for postage . same thing again parcelforce left a signed for parcel with someone who is not a neighbour and had to wait 0 more days until i managed to find person who had signed for it , i thought signed for was for personal only ?
negative	oliver 0 hour
negative	the phone line was down ( including internet_connection and the card payment machine ) for three_weeks in the run - up to christmas .
neutral	its just amazing !
negative	as an update i have now been contacted by [_name ] by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
positive	000_% would recommend .
neutral	i must_say that i have used about a third of them and so far only two have been broken .
neutral	i can '_t recommend this product but the company were quick to respond .
neutral	i had to change the dates i was going on holiday ( an easyjet package ).
positive	even_tho their prices and the cheapest on the net .
neutral	i have used this company many_times since i found out about usn ' s 0hr protein as they seem to be the only company that sell it .
positive	overall , a brilliant service and i will_definitely use again as and when i need .
positive	i would advise_anyone to use dialtosave .
negative	i have emailed loads of times and just get fobbed_off with " i will look into why the delay ". but no one ever does .
positive	response was quick .
positive	would ceraintly use chillisauce again .
negative	i paid for next_day delivery on a product which apparently couldn ' t be delivered when required .
neutral	all in all , i found that the course was worth - while , although - for me personally - not as learning as a face - to - face course where the tone is more informal and questions are easier to ask in person .
negative	now the only thing that i ' ll order from them is flowers !!!!
neutral	paypal takes a lot too .
positive	highly_recommend the company and it ' s watches
negative	now my current package is in limbo .
negative	very offhanded .
positive	price was excellent especially to say they were fitted by a national company that would have charged 00 per_cent more direct through their website .
positive	super skype - my best tool - never take it away it is a great piece of technology - 0_stars
neutral	in garage , but failing that what you save in price you lose on having it fitted .
neutral	here is my letter to hammonds sent 0 weeks_ago - still no reply or even acknowledgement , also no allen key which was apparently posted 0 weeks_ago as the senior fitter refused to give it to me !!
positive	simply_games have always been a reliable online presence for me and with the big names failing in their customer_service obligations lately ( game ' s delivery time is terrible and amazon have whacked their prices up now that hmv and play are gone ) they ' re well placed to take a lot of my custom .
neutral	it was neatly packed though . yup .
neutral	good points : woolworths seems to attract you in as if there is something you think you may need or you may have actully thought it never had it
positive	noise complaints and situations were handled well .
neutral	yet i get a reasonably good deal and when someone calls me , my phone rings - which is what i want from a mobile provider .
negative	orange said they would cancel the switch immediately .
positive	would use this company as often as possible , great service .
positive	email acknowledgements and delivery details all arrived promptly and i was able to track the package .
positive	yep , pleased to use aferry . always a good price .
neutral	the reason , why i could not get money , was the paypal registration country .
negative	at the end i decided to cancel my account after few weeks and its been three months i am still_waiting for my advance line_rental payment to be refunded . just talked to them now and was advised it could take another two more months to process it . unbelievable !
negative	as they were no help i took the salad into the store to deal with it .
negative	having spent over a hundred pound i am very disappointed with the service .
neutral	thanks lowcost !
positive	i have used their internet service for a while now and have never had a bad_experience .
neutral	the actual product and delivery were good and on time but i had problems placing my order .
positive	had to call because i made a mistake when ordering was rectified_immediately .
positive	wide_range of products and food . a one stop shop . great customer service and really quick delivery
neutral	this experience won_'_t put me off as in most_cases described in these reviews everything_went well .
neutral	:-)
negative	ordered an item on the 00rd jan , on a three day delivery , told it was instock , did a track on this item on 00th_jan only to find that the delivery date was now up to the 00 feb . no email from littlewoods informing_me of this delay or why .
positive	stephanie was i great help ( thanks )
negative	they really are utterly rubbish and incompetent .
positive	tive problema apenas uma vez , quando meu cartão não foi aceito , não sei por qual razão .
positive	this to me really showed he was looking after the customer .
neutral	have tried other search_engines but google is deffo the best imo !
negative	now they have lost my parcel and i am out of pocket , lost a good customer got bad feedback spent 0 days so far trying to sort_out .
negative	hate it when clothes companies use this courier service is it cheap to use or something ?.
neutral	the worst experience regarding delivery services !
neutral	delivery excellent , do not expect as much when returning items .
negative	the only good thing .
positive	dedicated smokers / vapers will know how imporant that is .
negative	bought my battery on the 00rd jan , when i rang on the 00st i was told by a very rude girl that they had trouble with their courier and my battery was not dispatched until 00th .
negative	if that doesn_'_t work i will go through the energy ombudsman to see if they can resolve the issues .
negative	the next_day he continually rang eflorist but could never get through when selecting the option that he was calling about an " existing order ".
neutral	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
positive	what this is basically is you go to a different website where its listed for cheaper , supplement_warehouse doesn ' t just match the price , it gives you it for much less .
negative	i arranged for city_link to collect a wheel / tyre in london on the 0th_december_0000 .
negative	in december_0000 we purchased 0 leather recliners from this company , also purchasing an extended 0 year_warranty , for several months we have been experiencing back pain when using them which is obviously here the stuffing / padding is breaking down .
neutral	this annoyed me as it would be " good practice " for this feedback request to go out to customers at a time when they are likely to have actually received the goods and had the proper time to appraise etc .
positive	he reservado muchos hoteles con esta empresa y nunca he tenido problemas , recomendable 000_%.
negative	shocking .
positive	fortunately i had also contacted edimax before emailing kikatek support and had everything sorted out so i didnt require an rma .
positive	thank_you sammie and i hope to deal with you again .
negative	the stock_levels are hopelessly untrue or not kept up to date .
neutral	had to pay vat and duty this was not explained during checkout nor was it explained that the goods were coming from abroad .
negative	the missus opened the box to find 00 roses , 0 of which were broken and one which didn ' t have a head and nor was the head in the box meaning that the rose must have been headless when they put them in there !
positive	i am so happy , and they even hoovered up after themselves .
positive	very competitive on pricing and rapid delivery .
neutral	( hence three stars not two .)
negative	!
negative	well common_sense should have told me to walk_away , but this being murcia airport , with few facilities , i was intimidated into accepting the situation or walking .
negative	!
neutral	secondly , the quality of the products varies so much !
negative	waisted whole day at home on advice of delivery that never showed . not great .
neutral	she also seemed very against the idea of changing the address to that on my hotel so that i would definitely have the tickets in time , as this may have caused more hassle for her .
positive	the quality of the goods and service are second to none , would highly_recommend this company to everyone i know .
neutral	and it arrived broken again
neutral	it was a very quick service and it was waiting for me when we came home though i thought i had to sign for as it came by the tracker post
positive	last_week i got last_minute tickets through viagogo to the chelsea flower show which was incredible !
negative	i ordered a asus x00ca of this company , which i was assured that it would be delivered today 00 / 00 /_0000 anytime up to 0pm .
positive	particularly valued the free home_trial service which i used twice because none of the first set i selected suited me .
neutral	quite noisy on top speed but it '_s cheap !
neutral	. but they don_'_t deliver to bfpo .
positive	we would definately_use again , don_'_t hesitate they are great value for money .
positive	!
negative	appalling .
neutral	it got sent back - eventually - took days to get this arranged
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to [_private data ] in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning [_private data ] this may cost 00p_per_minute .
neutral	tyres , good make , great road holding but very very noisey , ten times worse_than the michelins they replaced , so would not recommend them
neutral	yes she said , that will be fine .
negative	terrible , terrible service .
negative	buyers get protection .
neutral	the service was some what rushed and we got the feeling that we an inconvenience to the cabin_crew , they would have been happier if the business class cabin would have been empty .
neutral	i called viagogo back less_than 0 minutes after we had hanged_up and was told that they had a zero refund policy and the gentleman i talked to would have to make a " judgement call ".
negative	when i arrived to pick it up the next_day guess_what i received ?
negative	i got on the phone to o0 - talked to a human - they had me sorted with a new account in 00_hours which has_been sweet ever_since and costs about the same !
negative	i then got home to unpack my shopping to be disapointed once again these are the reasons_why ?.
negative	shocking !
positive	:)
neutral	i ring again .
positive	also the extra step of having an xfire for live_chat goes above and beyond any of the other_companies around .
neutral	might use collect_+ again , but i am not necessarily impressed .
positive	thanks a lot !
positive	such a breath of fresh_air from my previous software which shall remain anonymous :-)
neutral	give the customer a cheaper royal_mail option .
neutral	free upgrade
neutral	i stopped using this company a few_years_ago after a very poor experience trying to send back a faulty motherboard .
positive	since then , even for local travel , i use hostels too , as it '_s so easy to use their website and there '_s so much info in the reviews , maps , directions , that you feel you know places when you arrive .
negative	!
negative	avoid this company .
neutral	not a good start but hey no_problems with my last car !
neutral	!
negative	the worst thing you ever did was to sell out to bt .
positive	when i needed caravan tyres i decided to see if they could help i received first_class advice and next_day service from event .
negative	used them ( not out of choice ) about 0 times and it ' s been the same every time .
negative	said the man .
negative	if its out of stock or low stock when you order it tell us don_'_t leave us expecting delivery when it its not going to turn_up when you expected it .
positive	items arrived securely_packaged within two days of the order being_processed .
positive	good communication when you order on the net .
positive	thanks again sky tour !
negative	asked to speak to a manager who eventually explained that talk_talk could not provide me with the service , something to do with my local exchange .
negative	i contacted them again for a full_refund we were arguing back and forth for ages until they agreed to a partial_refund , it just wasn_'_t good enough !
positive	slightly pricier than some other services , but for the quality and lack of hassle i thought it was worth it .
negative	do not use
positive	they collected the parcel from me within the hour , gave me a tracking_number , so i saw that it was delivered and signed for the next_day .
positive	their advice on products is accurate and fair , and the efficiency of the ordering_process could not be better !
neutral	the stool was quite poorly finished with sharp corners , in fact my wife cut her foot on one of the corners .
neutral	the booking process was quicker this time but as i was booking the car for over 0 days i had to pay for a tank of diesel - luckily i used the whole tank otherwise they wouldve made money out of this .
negative	!
neutral	having spoken to a number of advisor ' s as a result of these quotes coming through the post i was assured my lower_price would be charged .
neutral	i ' d buy a lot more from boden if they kept their stock up a good deal more .
neutral	whatever way , inconsistency in providing information to a customer can make a wonder !
positive	spoke to the staff in edinborough shop & they checked the item as i asked any questions .
neutral	any help appreciated
negative	why do we have to sit and listen to all the drivel and hype and be spoon fed opinions from talentless know it all judges .
negative	left a message on their fb_page , they said to send them a private message , which i did , and then received no response .
positive	furniture is stunning , have already ordered more furniture , quality is superb .
neutral	as the tickets didn ' t arrive , i contacted viagogo who were fast to tell us the seller could not be contacted .
negative	i took them several days before i got a reply asking for an account number .
neutral	initial estimate of £_00 seemed very good indeed compared to other 0rd_party companies , however i then received an_email to say that it had ' less_than 0 scratches on the front ' and decreased the value to £_00 . 00 , although still a fair price i accepted , but i know for a sure that the equipment was in pristine_condition when it left , so i would like to know where the ' scratches ' appeared from .
positive	was also impressed with the security as i used a different email in sign_up to my paypal addy .
neutral	not enough variety .
positive	you kept me aware of the order progress , despatch , and even a reminder on the day of delivery .
negative	i did complain directly to them about this , for which they apologised .
neutral	maybe you should add paypal to your payment_options or once a successful purchase has_been made log the details so that there is no need for security check everytime .
negative	they have admitted to seining out fake solicitors letters and charged their customers for them .
positive	i would recommend transglobal to anyone , their prices are much_better_than going direct with some of the companies which is a big plus for me .
negative	facebook are putting up public statements that our sit is not safe !
neutral	so in this aspect 0 / 0_stars .
positive	our second order was for tee_shirts featuring our company name and logo to wear at a trade show .
negative	i was told that someone would get back to me asap .
negative	however entered my tracking_number online i noticed that my delivery was in the york delivery depot to be delivered tomorrow .
negative	the description said it would not only work with iphones , but any that had the correct plug size .
positive	the main and most_important thing on their website is the competition pricing .
positive	the sales room is very secure and you are made to feel very welcome .
positive	i would highly_recommend them
positive	driver stopped off on the way so we could get some breakfast as we had arrived very early morning .
negative	the delivery was always next_day , but on my last order the courier did not follow_instructions to leave it with my neighbour next door - i had to inconvenience someone across the road whom i did not know .
positive	transaction was fast & easy & i have great value tyres that will be fitted at my convenience .
neutral	almost a month to complete an order is ridiculous .
neutral	i phoned up to enquire_about my delivery , and the company did find out where my parcel was being held , but didn ' t seem bothered about the trouble i ' d had or offer to arrange an_alternative delivery .
negative	i have ordered a game from them and they just send it a fake game by using fake plastic shrink wrap . i was so upset for that . unfortunately i havent chosen different shipping address , otherwise i was going send someone fake gift .
neutral	update # 0 :
positive	the fitting was done quickly and efficiently , he even took away my old tyres !
negative	i know how difficult it '_s going to be to get the package to be re - delivered .
positive	after paying almost £_00 for connection i thought they would have turned the doors around on fridge /_freezer !!!!
negative	my reply > to alpharooms reply below
negative	bbc documentaries like the attenborough series ' are far_superior to anything made by this ' broadcaster '.
negative	amazon '_s response is to wash their hands of the whole business .
negative	we both wrongly assumed that eflorist would be apologetic and give us a full_refund but as they refused we intend to spread the word to our friends , family and beyond that they shouldn ' t use eflorist .
negative	avoid this company like the plague .
negative	i went and bought the sunglasses from a opticians that sell them !
negative	guess how much it is now ?
positive	communication was excellent and they also went the extra_mile by offering help and advice .
positive	!
negative	they are only after your money , don ' t care about the clients .
negative	then wait for your main course .
positive	excellent service , product delivered and installed efficiently .
neutral	have been panicking all day , phoned viagogo twice .
negative	0 .
positive	tesco is the best food shop , the best prices end the food is very fresh .
neutral	the search feature is next to useless .
negative	the phone is still under_warranty and i now have to return it to the manufacturer myself and deal with them .
neutral	0 ) their lack of customer_service ( in my case anyway ).
positive	couple days for it to be delivered .
negative	talktalk is hands_down the most difficult company i ’ ve ever had the displeasure of dealing_with .
negative	every year , for the past eleven years , i have paid my water bill over a few_months .
positive	would recommend 000_%.
positive	i cannot recommend too highly , the whole journey each way with jet0 was friendly , comfortable ( plenty of leg_room , and i have long legs ) and efficient .
positive	ordered a gorenje retro fridge_freezer , it was delivered within 0 days and within the 0 hour time_slot which was advised the previous evening to the delivery .
negative	having paid up , stating i was not happy , an employee then took me to the car and in a whirlwind after making me sign an inspection form , made his exit .
neutral	i ordered 0 items online on 00nd march .
neutral	as i harassed viagogo on all their phone_lines ( the main one would no_longer give me the option to talk to anyone - how nice !
positive	roger
positive	i received an excellent car_hire service from holiday_autos , at a keen price , which exceeded my expectations .
neutral	i do think this service is getting poor , i remeber you could get your first bid within 00min it was excepted , not now the bids are ridiclous its laughable , my wife used the same courier , s if she can , courier , s come and go . my wife as used this service for 0yrs , it was great , courier were reliable , you got a good service all_round , i used this service because its straigt forward but you do wait a long time for a good bid offer
neutral	please make it easier for customers to post reviews and then maybe i would be happy to sign_up for additonal services .
negative	fake accounts that are used to promote websites ?
positive	i would buy from this company again a first_class service and delivery was quick my daughter was very pleased with her wedding invatations
positive	the one hour delivery time_slot is particularly useful as it saves having to wait around all day .
neutral	the clay shooting was good especially .
positive	product arrived as order .
negative	hello
positive	all the free products made it that more enjoyable and allows me to try things i would have never thought of trying .
negative	the pizza was so thin and burnt round the edges and it cost me a fortune !
negative	i am sure they have changed their name as i
neutral	there was no staff around to ask how breakfast works & another guest showed me where to get tea and coffee from .
negative	i and my boss ordered two mobile_phones , my boss ' order went through ok whereas mine was blocked .
neutral	i said to put it on back order .
positive	everything is a winner .
negative	i ordered them as soon as i could .
positive	excellent price , timely delivery and great quality product .
neutral	one of the reasons i am giving asos 0_stars is because of the unfortunate problem that they still use myhermes .
negative	having bought and paid for items . still have not received them .
negative	so a repair of a screen ( which retails at £_00 by the way ) has cost us £_000 .
negative	groupon won ' t take any responsibility for not checking the availability for what they have advertised .
negative	got a £ 0 , 000 computer from them for gaming and it is shit can only just play bf0 / mw0 on low setting
positive	even on the rare_occasion where we ' ve had to chase something up or we ' ve had a problem with an item they ' ve been quick to rectify and offer a fast and friendly service .
neutral	the biggest disappointment was that the face_value of the tickets was £_00 and we paid almost three_times that much for each ticket .
neutral	maybe i should have learnt that so long as you dont have to deal with the service department then alls good but if you do then i think its god help you .
negative	in summary . worse £ 0 . 00 plus p_& p ever !
neutral	so lots of wasted time and irritation - plus a loss of confidence in what autoglass had advised me .
neutral	the website is great and extremely easy to use and navigate with any winnings paid directly into your account , no having to claim in store .
negative	!
negative	groupon would not take any responsibility for this .
negative	will close my account and look for a bank who aren_'_t afraid of advertising their tel no .
neutral	£_00 for a room , looks very good but parking and internet add £_00 per night so in reality it was £_00 per night , again not bad but this should be the advertized price
neutral	positive_note : it was a better quality than the original supplied one , so there was much less noise and rumble at the amp .
positive	000 had the best on - line price and delivery option for this washing_machine and with their " guaranteed " 0hr delivery slot was the best i could find .
neutral	good range of clothing , and an ok customer_service .
negative	i am out of pocket and have no product .
neutral	i had thought that by making an online booking i would have been fitted in straight_away without the wait .
neutral	i will be writing to viagogo in the hope of getting a refund of the price difference .
positive	the reviews also helped to inform my decision on my purchases - just a shame p_& p wasnt included in the price .
negative	a long time past and i had no updates at all about my repair , i thought i would have had an update when they received it then when it went in to be repaired and so on .
neutral	in no way am i blaming gak for the time it took for the refund to come through , i know there is multiple factors that can contribute to a few_days delay in refund , but the fact is this delay could have been avoided had gak not falsely advertised a product on their site .
negative	i have used city_link regularly over the years , but never again after this experience .
positive	no matter how large or small the job is , it is delivered on time and to the same high_quality finish .
negative	i was given some piss - poor_excuse about the request not going through , or technical_difficulties or some such rubbish .
negative	use some logic man , i pay £_00 . 00 a month , i ’ ve had 0 weeks of no service , how you can offer me £ 0 . 00 ?
positive	we were initially concerned as there was no tech phone support , we need not have worried as most of the tickets we raise are answered in a few_minutes .
negative	ups are so bad it is barely comprehensible .
neutral	on the whole , they tend to be the cheapest , although they ' re not always the fastest and their packaging does leave a lot to be desired .
neutral	starting to think this might not be a site i can trust .
negative	important to note : as of april_0000 jexaa limited was dissolved .
positive	the website was very easy to use and only to a couple of minutes to place an order to send three phones .
neutral	such as india and even some european countries .
neutral	that was more than 000 of the total hire charge which included insurance .
positive	thankyou for making life so much_easier
negative	i ordered dog boots and dog blankets for over £_00 .
positive	i think it depends on which carrier is chosen when making the booking .
positive	i ' ve been using hostelbookers for quite a while , since i traveled in europe three years_ago .
negative	i am running down the single flight of stairs to the front_door of my block of flats so fast it freaks my girlfriend out .
neutral	it ' s ridiculous , sometimes you have to wait 0 - 0 weeks for an order .
neutral	found bravofly after searching with kayak who directed me there .
neutral	i said there was nothing about this on the site and i had paid the non - mainland postage .
negative	ok maybe my phone is special - oh well .
negative	i contacted the live feed for the company but after my initial reply to my complaint the live feed suddenly went off line after i asked for a full_refund .
neutral	ordered a tv from them and was told it would take 0 weeks to deliver even_though their site and tv ads say next_day delivery .
neutral	but now gone .
negative	i have contacted customer_service twice and they tell me it can take up to 00 days for delivery to ireland , seriously its not the moon .
neutral	i think on the whole this is a place i can be happy ordering from . when things go right , but when they do not . you are up some sorta creek with no paddle .
negative	secondly , i decided to upgrade to a medium - sized version of bouquet i had sent before .
negative	also had a major problem with getting payment as they took down the wrong details and then had the phone put down on me by their customer_services team when all i wanted was to sort out my details so i could get paid .
negative	on this occasion i had decided that it would be easier to rent a car and not rely_on trains etc .
positive	keep_up the good work andrea know im in good hands if i have other problems
neutral	we got your money now sod off !!
negative	you have a major floor within your company which should never have happened and it certainly should have never happened to me and my family .
negative	needs no star
negative	also pestered me with emails not to leave .
neutral	if you cantravel with just hand_luggage you do generally work out cheaper , but it ' s never as convenient and the airport is generally quite far away from its description
positive	ordered some moisturiser and night serum on 00th_feb , received it on 00st , can '_t fault the service and the quality of goods .
neutral	i would like to thank_you again for time and custom .
positive	we were in need of 0 new tyres and found this site after they emailed us with a price compare option .
negative	hermes /_herpes allow or want contact from their victims as they don_'_t care and their victims don_'_t matter to them .
positive	i have used this site several_times and have never been disappointed .
positive	especially as my husband is recovering from surgery after a new heart valve only a few_weeks_ago !!!
negative	another customer was sitting down and conversed with me regarding her own experience that morning .
positive	having had a bad_experience with an on = line agent in the past i was a little_apprehensive , but the way in which the first viewing was handled . via text just worked_brilliantly .
neutral	just a little disappointed that they are struggling and are closing most of there stores down .
positive	used anyvan twice and wouldn ' t hesitate for a third time .
negative	couldn ' t use the voucher as the telephone_number provided for the saloon was not answered for days until the voucher expired .
negative	i checked my bank_account and my money had dissapeared !
positive	first time buyer from them .
positive	ordered a highly demanded tent recently and had the normal free delivery on it .
negative	the best way i can describe hukd ' s moderators are like traffic wardens who wait for your paid parking ticket to expire and 0 minute later you have a ticket , or for being slightly outside a box junction , or being on a kerb .
negative	customer_services they told me i should expect it by the 00th_december .
neutral	the follow - up emails that i received with a little sense of humor were a nice_touch even when there are so many of them .
positive	company called after delivery to check all was well .
neutral	ordered 00th , supposed delivery 00th , then told by parcelforce 00th , contacted both company and parcelforce ( parcelforce 0 times today by phone , twice by email , westin '_s line had switched to an answer phone by 0pm ), order finally delivered sat am , not to the right house ( yes we were in ), but 00 is close enough !
positive	she sorted_out my issue really efficiently , way0go emily :))
negative	another 00mins past and one of the mechanics walked in , started eating his sandwich and then approached me and reached for my car key , which was in my hand , without even a friendly gesture or even asking for my car key .
negative	do not use the company unless you want to be stranded at an airport and waste your money !!
negative	i booked a collection with yodel00 ( 00 . 00_hours . this is a joke believe me ) for monday .
positive	not parcel0go ' s fault would be a nice addition in my opinion to their website .
neutral	the package arrived at the promised day .
positive	thanks for senidng me my items so quickly .
neutral	which meant i cannot mix them with my left over ’_s .
negative	this was then fine i said and made my way to husband where he and a member off teso staff were putting in the back of my mums car .

neutral	i assumed i would pay the rest via the site also , and had to quickly run out for the final cash , a bit_annoying that this wasn ' t pointed_out in the ' how it works ' ( makes me think keeping it to three steps was more important than the usefulness , more marketing than anything ).

neutral	the garage did ' phone in the afternoon to say it had been fixed a i rescheduled for the following_day .
neutral	the service was great , all the phone_calls were answered quickly and the cso '_s were extremely friendly and polite .

neutral	i have ordered a few things from this site now and have always been pleased with my purchases .
negative	they don ' t understand your request at all , don ' t even care , and just repeat again and again talktalk policy .
negative	when you enter they then direct you , dependent on the specific " hut " either upstairs or downstairs , where you then wait in a queue for a table .
negative	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
neutral	i ' m not quite sure how to describe them .
positive	also storing the different addressees is handy when time is tight online .

neutral	i would not recommend this type of car_hire .

negative	needed new inks for my hp photosmart c0000 printer , ordered two a colour and black one , thought i would give them a try as nothing ventured nothing gained , after ages i got the printer to accept the coloured one as for the black after two days of trying the printer would not accept it , maybe i was unlucky i dont know as i am not a printer mechanic , but without me saying it you can guess where i will be getting my printer_inks in future , and if they ask me to return it as i am_disabled there is no way , i buy many different things using my computer , i will put it down to experience , as the saying goes you get what you pay for .
negative	strange how we only received this admission from them after we complained and said we could prove no delivery had been made .
positive	took just four days from order to delivery .
negative	as soon as i got home i got a call from my partner saying that the delivery man had been and gone .

negative	doesn ' t deserve a star .
positive	quick collection and easy door to door tracking available .
neutral	order from gameseek all the time but this game never arrived to day after launch on the friday wasn ' t sent to the thursday very late in my opinion . everywhere_else order from the game arrives between 0 and 0 days before launch . if you don ' t mind waiting a extra day for your game i recommend gameseek if you like it on time or a little early order elsewhere .

positive	can not fault the service we recieved from bobby at dial a flight . despite having to change travel_arrangements twice , bobby was only too happy to help .
negative	the drivers for this company don ' t have collection tickets , even if you ask for their signature .
negative	orange said they would pay the outstanding balance to the other company in order for me to move to orange .
neutral	used these a few_times , prices are ok but service seems to have slipped a bit recently .
neutral	this shouldn_'_t be necessary at all if i click on an invitation to review email .
neutral	i wasn ' t happy so they did agree to make a new one and post it to me when it was ready , free of charge .
negative	firms you deal with are rubbish ; as is your ordering system .

positive	so it was a bit of a false alarm .
positive	fantastic company to do_business with - they are high recommended - will be using them again .
neutral	i ' m sure the coach service they offer is very good , just be mindful to use a disposable email address when enquiring or booking via their website as " sophie " from national express will spam you relentlessly with " offers ".
neutral	also makes it almost_impossible to move for mowing the grass .
negative	!
negative	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .

negative	it was funny to listen these_guys especially_considering fact that tmobile costumer_service located in india and philippines .
positive	one very happy customer .
neutral	this means from day of ordering to delivery took 0 days which i think is too slow .
neutral	they could try to reduce the price of their products .
neutral	it is simply not worth the hassle .
positive	does it fit flush against the wall ?)

positive	always arrive quickly and in good condition with extended sell by date , great prices .
negative	one representative told me that delivery takes between 0 - 0 working_days , another told me it is next_day delivery and sim should be with me shourtly .
neutral	0rd lie : how can you give your consent to a concert without being told what the concert is ?
neutral	the website was a little tough to use .
neutral	i definitely do not like the way how they scare you with insurance .
negative	i tried it on my phone ( sony xperia ) as soon as i received it .
negative	i am_appalled that they are refusing to refund me my money when this situation is not my fault !
neutral	it took a long time to get my order refunded
neutral	we would not have wanted the switch moved as this would have ruined the decorating already undertaken .
neutral	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
negative	anyway . 0 weeks_later we have recieved the tv box ( that we didnt really want ) but the router ( that we needed ) is still not here .
positive	easy to navigate website .
positive	excellent excellent excellent and very good value
neutral	the online system is brilliant and certainly saves you rushing around when youi can reserve and collect !
negative	tyreshoppers deals with problems by silence and ignoring the customer .

negative	there is a tiny cosmetic mark on the front and when i rang customer_services i was told that this classes the phone as faulty .
neutral	the order processing took a little longer_than_expected which is fair as the deal must be very popular .
neutral	not sure what the story would be if we had missed our flight .
negative	i '_ve now decided never to use collectplus again after having 0 parcels smash , another thrown over the gate and left in front_garden ( clothing ) and 0 parcel had been tampered with - customer claimed that parcel ( mail bag - clothing ) had been slashed opened with something sharp .
negative	they are conniving , horrible people .

positive	very professional and thoughtful about our needs .
neutral	well_organised , user_friendly and reasonably_priced will be taking a look at other courses on offer staff always available to help .
positive	very grateful .
neutral	the selling fees can be very expensive when you sell an item over £_000 so this can discourage users from selling expensive items on ebay .
positive	the range is better on their website , but like i said , you pay for delivery .
neutral	another arrived , again it took far too long
negative	do report them and make_sure you get your money back !
neutral	yo udo not have enough info about your products on the site .

negative	then when that deadline expired , in another couple of days , then , when that deadline expired , another week .
negative	the account had been open less_than a day and i had paid for a full year - so it cost me over £_000 for less_than a day ' s hosting .
neutral	watch out for the mandatory full purchase thing - not sure if this a new scheme but we had to pay in_advance for a full_tank of fuel in_advance which was set at the car_rental price ( perhaps 00_% more_than you would pay if you filled up your self ) you are then supposed to return the car empty but seeing as we had an ultra efficient 0 ltr car we barely used half a talk in 0 days so in effect we gifted the car_rental company half a tank of fuel .
neutral	plus having that many snacks in house at once was just a massive temptation .
neutral	the company issued an invalid price comparison and canceled my order .
positive	and a great tv that was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
neutral	i have had a few_times where i have reserved an item and got to shop to find that they are out of stock which is annoying .
negative	neively originally booking a cheap trip to ibiza in 0000 where alpharooms placed us in a room with two single beds ( after requesting a double ).
neutral	beware of promises !
negative	i called again and they said nothing can be done unless i pay £_00 to make changes !!!!
negative	avoid this company !
neutral	selected the store to which i wanted it to be sent and popped_into the nearest centra to send it .
neutral	all that seems to good to be true usually is too good to be true .
negative	please avoid them and go for a more recognised and trusted company , they are just not worth the hassle .
positive	the cj ' s service itself was well reviewed , straight_forward and more_importantly legit / secure .
positive	i get stopped every time - at the supermarket , at the rta , at the bank , on the street .
neutral	i was also given no tracking_number with my delivery confirmation_email , simple things can mean the difference_between repeat_custom and looking for better service elsewhere .
neutral	they have very few select items that are 00plus therefore i now have to go elsewhere and spend extra money al because they don ' t cater for the bigger lady .
neutral	a double whammy hit on the benefits from using a tesco credit_card .
positive	i thought there may be some hidden conditions attached due to the cheap pricing of the product , however this was not the case and they guarantee free shipping on their website with covered insurance ( not many sites do this ) and my mind was put at rest .
positive	furniture really we '_ll packaged .
neutral	part exchanged my 0 year_old ford ka which i bought brand_new from this garage , after 000 , 000 trouble_free miles . this time i bought a 0 year_old ka with 0 , 000_miles on the clock .
negative	i then spent the next two hours either on hold or finally talking to people who did not have the seniority to help me .
positive	they worked so hard i had to pay more as i thought they were worth every_penny .
positive	one happy customer .
neutral	but a lot of their deals ( on physical items especially ) are just over - hyped .
neutral	then a few weeks before launch ( when to late to pre order from anywhere_else ) was then advised that to be able to get order i would havd to change to a package including an extra controller which he would never use for extra £_00 .
negative	they don_'_t give a sh0t about their customers .
negative	every time i asked about this i was told that this was in case i left the car empty of fuel and that it was a holding payment .
neutral	they really didn ' t seem to care that i was annoyed with their service either .
neutral	the truth is , that i have not refused anything ( maybe paypal had , not me ).
negative	after i cancelled my service , they called me at_least three_times a day and pestered me to come back .
positive	purple is my favourite colour and delivery was when it was expected .
neutral	however , play did refund me and communication was good , albeit quite a wait to have to process a refund .
positive	i ordered two lengths of oak board which arrived on the date i chose with a call from the courier to say how soon they would arrive .
positive	they arrived really quickly and fitted_perfectly .
negative	i thought maybe it was standard procedure to check the reviews .
neutral	as we are cruising - we need big bags !
negative	it s in the review trust_pilot !
positive	brilliant customer service .
positive	alot better build_quality !
negative	i ordered a brand_new flash yn - 000 from ebay , it was sealed and under_warranty .
positive	i bought an exercise_bike - after researching i found the best deal on sweatband .
neutral	thought there was no booking_fees ?
positive	the person loved it and the fact that it was personalized because she can never find anything with her name on it !
neutral	if it can ' t be delivered by then a refund for the paid amount is sufficient .
positive	then the delivery crew rang on the day further to confirm a 0 - hour_slot .
positive	we ordered doors in several sizes as we had created a dressing room in our small bedroom .
neutral	tune up is one of the finest product . no it ' s the one and the only one i might use and trust to tuneup my pc and that unquestionable fact for me .
neutral	so they offered my a similar model which i accepted .
neutral	add to this constant issues with account numbers changing and it '_s just not the same as it was before the takeover .
neutral	also not getting rewards on sale items and other things is not fair on the person running the catalogue .
positive	the dehumidifier is much_better_than i expected .
negative	i am staggered that i received no letters or emails from the company of apology or explanation .
neutral	sadly this soured an otherwise pleasant_experience .
positive	excellent service , very competative prices , fast efficient next_day delivery , helpful staff .
positive	they even did a second run and turned_up with more men than i asked for .
negative	either that or to buy myself out of the contract ….
negative	steer_clear save_yourself a load of hassle .
negative	the girlfriend gets back at 0 : 00 so i taxi back to work for the afternoon ( another £ 0 ).
neutral	are there some special tips to make it thicker ( apart_from halving the water content !!!)
neutral	from a point of view of customer experience they are better_than the co - op ( where do they get their staff ?)
neutral	the whole point of an independent review site is that a customer can score what they believe to be a fair representation of the company .
neutral	roses were well_packed and delivered on time but it was a very small and pretty shabby bunch for £_00 . 00 .
neutral	the game was cheap but the communication was rubbish - if they had just said upfront that i would get it a few hours before_release i would be happy and have ordered , instead they give the impression before you order you will get it ' instantly ' in reality it was 0 days_later .
neutral	work location has poor reception so personal mobile is pointless during most of the working week
neutral	poor service , wrong customer service advice - shame about the phone .
neutral	the delivery is usually fast and efficient , easy check out service , great range of the latest music software etc , overall 0 out of 0 for the reasons stated above .
positive	phoned up friday got freepost bag saturday posted monday got money on wednesday now that '_s what i call service well_done mazoma
positive	the item was delivery on the exact date i asked for and was in immaculate_condition with superior packaging ; i did change the delivery destination and postal date after_placing the order but there were no issues at all in doing this so again another great positive point .
neutral	these tickets have been released ages_ago .
negative	in principle , hukd is great , find great deals , buy / sell old items , freebies , competitions .
neutral	the battery worked well this march holiday
neutral	whilst holidayautos booking process works really well it is important to fully understand the contract with the car_hire company .
neutral	check the reviews before you order , there are some really dodgy takeaways on my site
positive	this was a great company they were very quick ( almost scarey ) but never the less pleased with the end_result
positive	wish i had known about it before , it would have helped take some of the stress out of my previous_experiences with booking sites .
negative	i had to sign into my account and cancel it manually , where i was faced with the most outrageous and miserable cancellation process i ' ve seen in my entire life - involving ticking several check boxes etc .
positive	so any one out there who is not sure , at_least give it a try .
positive	i use it to promote my business as well as being_able to maintain a private profile to keep up with friends !
neutral	so if you are looking for something last_minute , do not buy from lastminute . com .
positive	well finally , i plucked up the courage and found mr_memory '_s website ( among others ).
positive	and the item purchased was £ 0 cheaper_than other_retailers in the high_street !
negative	i was willing to wait as not urgent .
neutral	sure pricing is ok but just so they save the vat they split orders into amounts that are less_than £_00 or something .
positive	she actually sold me on the idea when i found your site .
positive	everything was delivered on schedule and the printed booklets looked fantastic .
neutral	unfortunatly they were the wrong ones whoch looked completely_different to what i had ordered .
neutral	i had 0 texts in 0 days that were no reply type messages telling my problem was being worked on when i had already had the problem sorted_out .
negative	0 star is too nice !
positive	they drove through all the bad march snow to deliver and were really nice to communicate with .
positive	love tesco :)
positive	i will_definitely be using their service again !
negative	!
positive	their customer_service is always very prompt and helpful .
negative	terrible to non - existant service .
negative	i am staggered that i received only one phone_call from them yet made 00 .
negative	ditto .
negative	trying not to pre judge the situation , i put my paranoia behind me and showed my cartrawler pre_- paid voucher .
positive	pleased with the overall service and quality of the products .
neutral	sort it out hungryhouse !
negative	the ' safe and secure ' payment website is a nightmare and kept saying payment failed .
neutral	as i said though the staff are very different in store and can ' t do enough to help you .
positive	i ordered ny new accurist mb000b at 0000hrs on friday and it was delivered the following_morning ( in north yorkshire ) at 0000_hrs - fantastic .
positive	this humble shop is a small paradise for hobbyists who collect blind boxed quirky figures / charms / etc .
neutral	despite_being ready to receive wally at 0am , he had not arrived by 0 . 00am .
negative	she said if i wanted to i could bring it in for investigation but they usually don ' t do anything about salad .
neutral	it arrrived broken , processor moved in transit
neutral	a week ( and several_times around with the vacuum ) later and i ' m still finding them .
neutral	i called twice to change the contact phone number , and add an additional mobile number , neither of which were added to the delivery instructions .
positive	:) only thing that there were weird was that they wanted my photo and name , but i was okay with it .
positive	i bought an outside led christmas_tree .
neutral	not any higher than 0_stars because when it came to paying out there are a number of administrative obstacles to overcome - i ' d say they use some sort of breakage model to retain the commission longer_than is necessary .
neutral	make_sure the damage inventory is complete and accurate .
positive	ordered on thursday had envelope on friday , recieved phones on monday had money through same day by card payment overall no_problems unlike_other services who changed the price once sent phone back , very good customer_service
positive	they give convenient time slots , and more_importantly , call half an_hour before the engineer arrives to avoid you having to wait in all day .
neutral	they finally emailed my code after about 00_hours , not what i was expecting at all .
neutral	i am waiting for the exchange item to arrive .
neutral	game . co . uk is just ok .
negative	no star_rating !!
negative	they ' re available monday - friday 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 and saturday 0000 - 00 : 00 .
negative	i am even more appalled at infurns level of customer_service , how_dare they go after their customer honest_opinions , if they don ’ t want bad_reviews maybe they should get their act_together .
negative	arrived fairly quickly ( 0 weeks ).
neutral	mwahhhh .
neutral	some nitrite - free beef jerky would definitely make me a customer for life :)
positive	jestem przekonana , że jeszcze skorzystam z usług arredatutto . com .
negative	i don ' t know how this company is still in business .
neutral	the sales_rep was ridiculously pushy , constantly trying to push us to a more_expensive washer despite telling them our budget .
positive	thank_you taunton_leisure .
positive	the staff on board more than helpful . and if my breakfast is a little too cool , it normally is ( must be saving on heating ).
neutral	so , if a collection is not made , you can ’ t get hold of the company until the next_day !
neutral	the second time the girl took my details and said she would ring me back in a few_minutes but never did . that was on the 00th of april . my phone arrived on the afternoon of the 0st of may but i remain seriously unimpressed by aramex . it was really well_packaged and when i unboxed it , all was as it should be .
neutral	which they have sent immediately .
negative	i will certainly be avoiding this garage and all other national auto centre ' s in the future . my friends will be receiving the same advice .
negative	of those , three were delivered to the wrong_address and three of them were not delivered at all and one took three_weeks to be delivered .
positive	when i get through all 00 vanilla pods , i shall certainly be re - ordering
neutral	i have just been depositing money so i dont see the point on going on iam just losing money so i am not playing anymore .
negative	despite the product only costing_£_00 i wasn_'_t given an option of paying a premium delivery charge for a scheduled day to prevent me from imprisoning myself at home for a few_days until it arrived .
negative	really !?!
neutral	probably yes .
positive	fantastic as so good with staff available 00 / 0 who do a wonderfull job . first_class in every_respect .
positive	i '_ve even got a couple of pounds back into my account for next time .
neutral	0nd order , first was brilliant - bulk anti - hystamine .
positive	this is my second purchase with procook and again another great puchase .
positive	thanks very much :-)

positive	propert rented with one month of advertising .
positive	them again
positive	communication was great , questions answered_quickly .
neutral	as luck would have it i was at home and my parcel was collected without_any problem .
neutral	i found the software a little troublesome , with it crashing on me twice .

neutral	i avoid this social network .
negative	i contacted gumtree support who sent a standard email back .
negative	i recently_bought 0 season of friends and 0 season of lost on dvd from here - never again .

neutral	prices are not that competitive compared to buying off a more reliable website like amazon .
positive	excellent service .
negative	as soon as i got the first card through the door i phoned the delivery person as instructed on the card and asked when they would be re - delivered .
neutral	- having to hunt through the faq to find how to pay the courier an_hour before they arrived .
neutral	i ordered a nook which i was expecting within a day or two .
positive	the icing on the cake was that the game dropped in price by a few_quid after my copy had been despatched and , without having to be asked , simply_games had reduced my invoice to the new lower_price .
neutral	i ordered about 000_pounds worth of product .
neutral	good website , selection and prices , but appalling delivery service .
negative	i was one of the unlucky ones who got caught in a website outtage so my recurring goodybag did not recur .
positive	up suba diving last_year which now he passed all of his exams and tests and really loves diving so things were on his xmas list .
positive	the ride was about an_hour and a half but the views were amazing so we had no_problems .
positive	tried to get tickets for me and 0 friends to see taylor swift in concert at the o0 .
negative	unless you want nothing but hassle and problems !
positive	i was delighted with the sunglasses i ordered .
negative	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd .
neutral	she then checked the gps and it was confirmed that the driver had been nowhere_near my place .
positive	excellent prices , excellent customer service , next_day delivery even on free delivery orders !
positive	when the watch arrived it was spot on , all complete and i was over the moon .
neutral	all in all a mixed experience , just unlucky with the mistakes and having to wait 0 weeks for what usually would be 0 - 0 days .
positive	!
neutral	this has happened on two occasions .
negative	i ordered a pair of shoes from ebay .
neutral	drove home a bit happier :-)
positive	not easy for a girl huh !
neutral	i guess they are okay for british market ( as they appear to have lower prices then their rivals ).
negative	sorry pixmania but the world has to know how you treat some of your customers .
negative	my wife '_s seller status with amazon was downgraded as a result of hermes /_herpes shabby action .
positive	good prices and prompt delivery .
negative	if i do not get a refund , i will contact trading_standards about this company .
neutral	so bad communication , bad record keeping , bad order progressing .
positive	0_stars !!
negative	updated : just wonder wowcher , you are able to reply this post within 00min , but you have mentioned that 0days mails to be checked ??????
neutral	been using them for years , loved the price_match guarantee , but on my last purchase they didn ' t accept the price_match and decided to charge me more .
positive	amazing !!
negative	the company said it was not their responsibility and washed their hands of it .
neutral	+ ve - speed of delivery was fantastic
positive	the package comes with full certification and stickers for him to prove his ' lordship ' and as well as being a fun gift , the mony does actually help a very good cause
negative	the cheeeeeeapest plastic decor you could imagine on cheap plastic handles .
positive	ordered a tv online , they rang up shortly and said very sorry but its out of stock , but would we like the next model up for a huge discount .
positive	it was very easy to order and paid through paypal , easy and secure , and my order came very quickly .
neutral	in fairness the customer service were every helpful , waiving the early_termination fees .
neutral	however as there is no list of ingredients i phoned aldi to ask whether there is added sugar or honey .
neutral	when i contacted cheap_smells they refused to honour gift .
positive	great outcome a ++++
neutral	i could have chosen less expensive frames but didn ' t want to be stuck with frames i didn ' t like .
neutral	i ' m just here to share my impression .
neutral	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn ' t think too much about it .
negative	the reply was that under their terms and conditions they had 00 days from date of cancellation to refund .
neutral	the only problems seems to be lack of stock and chosen stores so sometimes when ordering a few items you cannot get them all from same store which is not good as they only hold reserved items until end of the next_day and if you have to wait for another item to come back into stock it means going back to collect !
positive	good prices and delivered quickly will order from them again .
neutral	we therefore had to pay for our own food and were stuck standing in a corner with a pillar in the way of the stage so we could not see .
positive	sheila bull
positive	bring on the gig !!!!
positive	a couple of disappointments :
negative	the 000kw project was suposed to be finished by christmas 0000 .
negative	my order 00000000 was for instore collection .
neutral	i don ' t begrudge paying over the odds for an event of a lifetime but the stress of thinking we ' re not going to get to go is awful .
positive	great service , delivered next_day .
neutral	!
negative	don_'_t bother , they '_ll just send boilerplate responses !
positive	i was very skeptical when my friend told me about this website and all the great deals .
positive	i recently relocated to the us and had to transfer a larger amount .
positive	just keep_up the fab work !
neutral	to many emails and offers to take in
positive	the treatment only took a few mins , and almost straight_away i could see the difference .
positive	great business .
neutral	credit_card bill comes and is £ 0 more_expensive involving time_consuming calls to credit_card company .
positive	ordered the necklace on sunday and it arrived on the tuesday_morning !
positive	plus free next_day delivery
negative	he walked out .
positive	i stumbled_across elitekeys the website looks professional and not all buy gold buy gold cheap price ect like the other_sites i was looking for game keys from , i came to here also and read the reviews before purchasing and everything seemed legit .
neutral	the wording in my confirmation wasn_'_t absolutely clear and gold_car would not allow me to take the car full and return it full .
negative	in addition , neither [_name ], trading_depot director , nor [_name ] of dpd have replied to my email of 00th_october , complaining_about their poor service
negative	what a great customer_relations policy .
negative	check your reciepts with care !!
negative	if they ' d shown the same level of organisation dealing_with my order maybe we could have done business .

negative	if you are thinking about buying anything from this company . forget it terrible company sent me a faulty pair of headphones tried to contact them several_times . no one ever picks_up the phone . i did get a reply email but nothing was done about it . i has been 0 weeks and several_attempts to get a replacement or refund with no joy .
neutral	however , recently sold them an iphone for £_000 and i asked them how they made money on that to be told they sold them to developing countries .
positive	hostelbookers is the one gave me all of information about hostel .
neutral	no instructions , but finally , after three_weeks , the shower did arrive .
positive	!
positive	since i told the seller this i have had problems with the seller who had been telling_me that i was responsible for the liability of the parcel if it did not arrive with them or was damaged .
negative	i ordered a camera 00 days before i needed it for my holiday as it was meant to be 00_hours delivery .
neutral	i managed to write about five reviews the first time without a problem . there is nothing wrong with my computer but ever_since i click on the review button for various companies it just states done . the response to my emails to support endlessly states ` can you copy and paste the urls in to an_email and send it to us ?
negative	i ' ve lost_count how many issues i ' ve had with city_link .
neutral	anyway so i soaked it in disinfectant and bunged it in the wash . it ’_s the reason for 0_stars otherwise it would have been 0 .
negative	their web - site claims ' lambdatek started in 0000 ' although the company was established in 0000 - this is easy to check at companies house , and i did so .
negative	will go_elsewhere next time .
negative	i asked for the phone back many_times but they are charging me ten_pounds .
negative	then to add more embarrassment the roses were past the fully opened stage .
positive	highly_recommended !
negative	yes within 0 days was there reply .
positive	i have bought my iams dog_food from gjw_titmuss countless times and i would say that 00_% of the time they are the cheapest and 000_% of the time they deliver within 0 working_days , that is why i shop with them every couple of months .
positive	they have the biggest_selection and they even still carry jack0d and oxy elite pro !
neutral	however , my second experience with them turned_out rather good .
negative	will not be using workwear ( not ) express again .
neutral	i had one salesman continuously try to sell me additional sim_card which would save me some money - but i had to repeat that i did not want this and wanted the mobile_broadband only .
negative	at first they put the complaint on the wrong account , they lied at one point , they did not read correspondence properly and they did not take a probable data_protection breach seriously .
neutral	at the checkout he tried for 00_minutes to get us to take out extended_warranty - in the end i said i would think about it so we could leave !
neutral	this time i have been sent the wrong glasses .
positive	excellent company !
negative	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn ' t even been collected yet , it ' s been a tracking error ".
negative	!
neutral	what would have killed me first the carbon monoxide or the failing brakes ?
negative	return_journey .
negative	paid in good faith but no goods received !
neutral	the variofocals and fit are not as good as last time i ordered them .
neutral	as an artist , i am constantly attempting to make the images larger , only to be told they are still not " good quality ".

positive	thank_you very much for such a professional service .
neutral	i ordered my pc on 0th_january_0000 via the website and it arrived on 00 january_0000 so just outside the 0 week lead time mentioned on their website so not too bad , it came with all the correct components , the oem windows 0 disk and the graphics_card box + drivers so no_problems there !
neutral	it was like this all day .
neutral	time_consuming , especially when you think you are almost done and then its try , try again until hey_presto you can actually book some semblance of the tick you were after , great idea , but needs streamlining and if a ticket is not available it should not show up as available .
negative	first got battery changed 0 years_ago - watch came back scratched and stop - watch function didn_'_t work .
negative	after another two days i phoned again .
neutral	however , i don_'_t want anything posted on my fb page or anything notified to friends which you try and sneak through .
neutral	our current package is tivo , 0 virgin hd boxes ( tivo in front room , hd box in the 0 bedrooms ) and 000mbit broadband ( that is connected via sockets to every room in the house , including 0 offices ).
positive	a credit to your company !
positive	always have what you want , or they do their best to get from another store .
negative	when i did move in with my partner , we wanted to get set_up with our existing services for our new home .
neutral	wish they had kept me posted on the despatch / delivery .
positive	em menos de 00 horas estava com o telefone desbloqueado sem ter que instalar porra nenhuma !
positive	easy to navigate and informative website .
positive	best price around for cortaflex ha with a very simple re - ordering facility .
positive	i saw a fantastic ring , a great price was negotiated , but i had to be sure that it was the ' one ', and we hadn_'_t looked anywhere_else .
negative	now been advised that the beanbag won ' t be in til march thats 0 months for a beanbag to arrive !!!
negative	i was so bowled_over by the fantastic deal on offer that i should have thought logically , if something seems too good to be true it ' s because it is .
positive	will check this company out when i need other items first .
negative	i ' m looking into it and i '_ll let you know asap
negative	no further calls from the company no pick_up from the company at 0000 hours and as such a local taxi picked us up at 0000 hours and deposited us at the airport at 0000 without_any hassle .
negative	one pc had a plastic_bag of screws loose inside the box .
positive	thank_you beautycow for your excellent price and service . i finally have straight hair again !
positive	very pleased and good purchase .
negative	the way they go about their business must be illegal !
negative	the man on the desk seemed stern but all i wanted to do was show my passport and licence details and get on the motorway .
negative	imagine a delivery company that turns up in your postcode , doesn ' t ring your buzzer , doesn ' t knock on your door , and then leaves without letting you know they were there .
neutral	staff seem helpful , and have offered to resend back my whole order , but the internal email system on the website is extremely slow , took 0 days to complete my complaint and get told they would send out the order .
negative	the website does not give a phone number or email address for the company .
neutral	traveling friday .
negative	they describe this on their website as award winning customer service - i beg to differ .
negative	the advisor told me that they sell the phone on so they can ' t accept cosmetic damages !
negative	i call it a flamingo syndrome - similar to a cock - up but just a lot bigger
neutral	the only good thing is that it `_s cheap .
positive	i cant_complain one bit not only did i get an amazing price but i also recieved my codes instantly .
positive	i have only ever bought knives from here but my first set have been excellent and all my visitors to my kitchen comment on them .
positive	and all for a third of the price quoted by royal_mail !
negative	so we continued with the home move , all should be well and good ?!
neutral	the actual service has been good so far but getting there was a pain to say the least .
positive	i received a text at 0am advising me of the estimated time of delivery and a link to check during the day .
neutral	i ' m happy with this site
positive	item was revived within 0 buisness days of ordering .
neutral	the good :

positive	i '_ve bought their ts000 - p wireless lapel and headband microphone kit .
neutral	please reply me if you see this review .
negative	just an_automated_response requesting my order number and another time / date to rearrange the courier for .
neutral	products are okay but then service needs to be more professional .
positive	other than it taking 00_hours , everything else was great !
neutral	then my next order was fine but the one after that which was my most_recent order there was another mix_up and this time the parcel had not arrived as intended .
negative	so i brought a new shirt in the sale on 00 / 00 / 00
negative	although our butler in the buff ( christian ) arrived and cheered everyone up from the shock of the shed / barn he was wonderful i ' d say best part of the hen_weekend .
negative	ordered a pair of rayban new wayfarers in maroon with prescription_lenses as a gift almost a month_ago .
positive	prior to delivery , chris gave me a courtesy_call to give me a confirmed date and time for the delivery .
positive	the delivery was quick and all in all a wonderful service .
neutral	shop around , you may find cheaper rates on the same travel dates , at approximately 00 weeks ahead .
negative	each time i called i told them i was losing credit_card sales in the shop .
negative	( this was true ).
negative	i rang pixmania to ask them to cancel it but they said they couldn_'_t - the card would give me cheaper postage for the next year !
positive	i ordered some additional memory and key ring phone chargers using standard delivery .
negative	however i still thought my tickets would come and they did come 0 days before the game but i was shocked to see that i got tickets with the home fans in an absolutely horrible place where a pillar blocked my entire view .

negative	in a panic i contacted my bank to confirm that .
neutral	no call back .

neutral	from a usability perspective our full width sofa bed is great and it came at an unmatchable price .
positive	having ordered shoes and finding them to be both comfy and durable i wanted more .
positive	wonderful service - delivery has never been easier to me .
negative	where '_s the no stars please !
negative	will do a further update when project is actually near a satisfactory completion !
positive	after years with mcafee i am converted to bullguard . it is easy to use ( with the on line help ) and you feel in control .
neutral	steve
neutral	i always prefer to book a hotel with a shared or private kitchen but there isn ’ t a search option for this .
positive	can '_t ask for more than that .
negative	average value
positive	everything fine .
negative	two days_later i phoned regenersis to find out what was happening .
negative	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
neutral	overall , i lost 0 . 0 % from offer through accept / reject to payment .
neutral	lots of communication with chillisauce , they facilitated the payments etc which saved me , the best man , a lot of hassle .
positive	really fast , simple and easy !
neutral	then i discovered that all my calls re problems , returns and resiting cost quite a lot - which was annoying given it was not my fault .
neutral	the only_downside through them is their aftersales email service .
negative	the next card i got through the door stated that they tried to deliver it at 00 and that they couldn ' t leave it with a neighbour , then again at lunch times during the week .
positive	second pair of fitflops from shoetique easy to order fast free delivery
neutral	basically , use it as a shop by all means , where you go to it knowing what you want .
positive	instant key delivery , very happy what more can you ask for =)
positive	i ordered a playstation 0 , an extra controller and gta v , all works great apart_from the extra controllers left analog is a bit loose so it doesn ' t spring back to the centre - would be nice to have advised that on the page , other than that it works great .
positive	my experience with ultralase was excellent from start to finish .
negative	goodbye bt .
negative	this year will be no different .
negative	trust is gone .
negative	thank_you tmobile costumer_service that i have spent 0 week without phone and already have paid £_00 for nothing .
negative	the next_day i received a phone call from mattressnextday telling_me that the mattress i had ordered was now out of stock ( even_though it did not say this on the website ).
neutral	i purchased this last_night and i still have not received any emails saying it was successful ??
negative	they gave me a test_drive on data which was why i got the phone , but despite_repeated calls to vodafone , it never worked .
negative	i have a proof that j walker received the cash payment and my credit_card is also been charge at the same day .
negative	i got lulled into a false sense of security .
negative	each week they advised a shipment was due but then apologised because it didn_'_t arrive !
neutral	fell foul of cut_off point for next_day delivery .
negative	told girl that this was not acceptable .
negative	!
negative	almost 0 months over still not they are not transferred to bank .
negative	the money we paid for this shambles is shocking deffo not worth the money never using chillisauce again and safe to say i don ' t think the other girls will either .
neutral	therefore it hasn_'_t yet arrived
neutral	something that really needs to improve especially if they insist on being expensive !
positive	i managed to save some money compared to viovet and a couple of other_suppliers plus the medicin arrived in very good time .
negative	anyway i have dug my heels in and demanded that i have my refund paid back to my debit_card , and was told by tt on the 0 september that someone from the ceo dept will contact me within five working_days .
positive	i ' ve been using heartinternet for a while now .
positive	i doubt any company could equal let_alone better the service i received from hurst and sons
positive	best site for buying any supplements . i just search all websites for cheapest place and they match them and give an extra 0 %_off . alot of the time supplementwarehouse has the cheapest prices too ,, i buy 0 or 0 times a yr from them
negative	good thing i ordered with paypal .
negative	useless !
positive	0 .
neutral	finally having had enough of the poor quality of routers being provided , i contacted them and explained that they needed to get their act_together .
negative	i have never_experienced worst delivery company in my life .
neutral	another convenient store that repeatedly fails on stock_levels , partly because the way they store stuff means if they say they have 00 in stock , 00 are probably broken / missing / on a pallet somewhere_else .
neutral	i ' ve noticed quite a few bad_reviews where people have not received their tickets !
negative	since i last ordered online , toolstation have switched from royal_mail to comedians yodel .
positive	just need someone to put it all away now !
neutral	however the customer service that followed was good , but was unable to give any reason for the delay
positive	well_done to everyone at ao for making shopping a pleasure again
positive	needed some bankruptcy advice after my debt management plan failed and found them to be very helpful and sorted my bankruptcy application out for me
positive	i have ordered several bouquets from this company .
neutral	this is just an unneccessary irritation to genuine customers . real scammers will try to change the delivery address retrospectively by telephone .
negative	after sending out another 0 emails - and a 00 hour wait for a reply appears to be the minimum waiting period for a reply , i telephoned and was asked to send the photo again directly to the person i was speaking to .
positive	she loved it and i loved it !
neutral	but then it suddenly occurred to me , that now i needed to wait for my refund to come through before i could buy a replacement .
negative	big_mistake . i thought that they were all seperate and run as a franchise service .
positive	would deffo_use cjs again
negative	you know this is not possible , how can i get someone_else miles from where i live to write on and sign a piece of paper for me to then send to you ?
negative	marcos
neutral	if i am charged for anything_else i will be expecting a refund .
negative	except 0 weeks after the ‘ go live ’ date , we still had no service .
negative	have now cancelled order and asked vredit card company to take action to recover money .
positive	if whiskey is your choice , but mainstream is not . look here 0st . delivery very prompt . all_round excellent .
negative	then wait and wait for the bill .
negative	we ordered some goods on the 00 th april a . m having established online that they were available .
positive	i always buy my clothes online with the good value clothes that i love .
neutral	facebook says keys will come out at 0000hrs on 0th_nov - not true
positive	one of the best on the internet .
neutral	will look_elsewhere for similar products , and i advise you to do the same .
negative	best regards ,
neutral	no urgency though as most of the services are next_day and you really need to book before 00am to guarantee same day pick_up .
positive	chris b ( staffordshire )
neutral	but , it is only since i have moved to another provided that the cheapness of their routers has_become increasingly apparent .
neutral	on the plus side , their instore delivery is prompt , though it is a shame you can return via simply food .
neutral	on hunting through the small_print on bitesizedeals website it states that they may substitute another countries version of the product you order .
negative	when it wasn_'_t my fault .
negative	the couriers and staff at the hub really need to take more care and until they can get that sorted i will switch to myhermes .
negative	i first contacted them around the 0th of august wanting answers as to when my glasses would be delivered i received no reassurance all i got was something completely_different that didn ' t answer any_questions !
neutral	by choice i ' ll never use them again .
neutral	in short it was an acceptable experience and i ' d consider_using them again .
negative	they are a shadow of their former self and are trading on their name .
positive	thanks more official_unlock team
positive	my first order arrived within a couple of days .
positive	robert fyfe , runway theatre company , glasgow .
positive	will_definitely use again .
positive	replacement card arrived by registered post as promised .
neutral	they had not contacted me to advise me of this delay , and would presumably have just let me arrive home tonight to find my dog without food .
neutral	although i have used animed_direct for ages and delivery has always been a bit slower_than other_suppliers , i allow for this when ordering .
negative	!
positive	you ' re in great hands when dealing_with ziip and if anything was ever to go_wrong , you know they ' d do their best to correct it quickly , efficiently and intelligently - without the usual and hideously commonplace shady business attitude .
negative	after paying £_00 for two bunches of flowers to recieve one bunch of poxy looking tulips is a complete rip_off .
positive	thank_you dpd .
negative	it is not up to me to sort_out problems you have created !
neutral	chilli_sauce did not have to do any of the leg work as we told them what we wanted , thye priced it up and we went with it .
neutral	i have updated the review to three stars .
negative	i ordered a bunch of 00 roses to be delivered on valentines_day for the missus .
negative	the product must be of very poor quality to break after 0 days of normal use , unless the split was already there .
negative	dreams , aware of the fact they are leaving a 0 month pregnant women to sleep on the floor , have been no help whatsoever , have not made any attempt to explain the reason for the cancelled delivery ( without forceful prompting from me ), or to explain_why we have had to wait nearly half a year for a delivery .
negative	however , i have never received a refund for my returns , sent by royal_mail recorded delivery .
negative	as advised i checked the garden shed whilst on the phone and found it soaking_wet ( was suppose to be signature needed and no card was left at my door ).
neutral	their underwear , men '_s socks etc still seem ok , but this is hardly enough to keep them going .
positive	boohoo from the start of my order were fantastic , great communication_throughout and all their products were a great price .
neutral	the website has also now started to sell designer fashion wear which are at the top end price bracket rather_than promote the smaller low key streetwear brands which offer good value and something unique , i guess the unique element has gone_missing somewhere and it feels no different to any other menswear site online , which is not exactly a bad thing but is the reason_why i don ' t really shop at this store anymore .
negative	talktalk is not a reliable company .
negative	00days and still no news on my phone .
positive	the service when i phoned up could not have been better .
negative	this site started off with very well meaning intentions but as time has_gone i feel this site is of little value now .
neutral	i bought some shoes and they ' re good quality but again unfortunately had a few random marks .
positive	sempre utilizo o site para fazer minhas reservas .
negative	i had to wait 0week for reimbursement to be able to order them again from somewhere_else .
neutral	they don_'_t seem to be able to decide where to pitch themselves and with shoes for example they offer cheap synthetic heels then jump to decent leather courts at £_000 !
neutral	it is easy to make reservation and they give me voucher soon .
negative	no christmas spirit from them .
negative	we disagreed with the manager '_s assertion and subsequent messages to the store . experience have vanished into the ether .
positive	i have added londonmagicstore to my list of favourite sellers , and would recommend them to anyone .
positive	ordered on sunday_evening , delivered ontuesday .
negative	jordan was the rep from just eat no compensation was given very rude service .
neutral	there are jobs pages aswell .
negative	had very bad_experience with these_people and when , yes when ( because they will ) they lose your parcel they don_'_t make much of an effort to find it and instead just pretend that the tracking_number the they supplied does not exist ??????????
positive	i have to say the everything was brilliant :) i had a few queries when sending my parcel and wih my account so was in contact via the live_chat a couple of times and the team ( charlie , sammie , stephanie ) were very helpful and attended to my every need .
neutral	i think the return_policy should be longer .
neutral	doesn_'_t mean we won_'_t use it again but prefer the [_external_reference_] people although they don_'_t use the car_parks .
negative	they now want the landlord to call them directly ( i ' m sure that is possible when he ' s based in uae ?!!!!)
negative	however today they did not turn_up , no calling_card , nothing .
neutral	according to parcelhero staff , fedex does not carry knives and my parcel could have been impounded in uk by the authorities .
positive	this site is awesome !
positive	i was emailed to advise .
neutral	a 00 min walk from the bus_stop .
positive	will_definitely purchase again should the need_arise .
positive	very quick and easy with andrea help would recomend p0g to frends and have befor now
neutral	this is the only reason i gave this review 0_stars .
neutral	the ring is beautiful but i think everytime i look at it i ' ll feel that twang of disappointment .
negative	!
negative	need my money back .
positive	it won_'_t be a problem as long as specky can solve it .
positive	0 * customer_service
negative	the next move was theirs .
negative	lets have a talent show for judges and see how far these four go .
positive	great company .
negative	i have done this today .
negative	when i contacted just eat they did appologise and told me that the money requested from my bank_account for the meal would be put back within 00 days and any concerns should be taken up with the take away .
positive	i ' m very happy :)
positive	their reminder emails were very helpful and their pricing was fair
positive	and i think that included delievery .
neutral	denne virker dog kun i 0 mdr ., hvorefter det_er meningen den skal på betalingsservice - det sker dog ikke , og_jeg modtager nu rykkere ( kan jeg se på mit telenor ) - dog ikke med posten .
neutral	the delivery due date came and went and when i contacted the seller they told me it had been lost in the post and that they would refund me !
negative	sim still_hasn ' t been delivered .
positive	i spoke to emma through the live help and she was excellent !
negative	i placed my order for a samsung_galaxy mini on 00 / 0 / 00 and they have still not even dispatched the item .
negative	the other bunch was christmas tulips with thistles .
negative	called the helpline at 0000 to be told by a robotic and non - compassionate advisor that the garage had closed for the day and my car is in the locked compound .
positive	i bought a shirt as a gift last christmas and the service i received from the staff at uk soccer shop was excellent .
negative	driver did all he could but clearly no thought when loaded such a large item on a small lorry .
negative	i '_ve used dpd in the past and have had nothing but first_class service .
neutral	i found the case , wasnt put_together 000_% properly .
negative	we were waiting for a delivery that should have arrived two days ago .
positive	!”
neutral	i ordered a trophy which i heard via_email ( a few_days after ordering ) wasn ' t available ( despite still being shown as for sale online ).
positive	all events in resort were run as planned and relatively on - time .
positive	the webiste is pretty clear and easy to use .
positive	so i had no_hesitation in buying once i had seen their prices .
neutral	urgent stuff from friday still not collected !!
negative	paid the item on 0 / 0 , 0 days_later asked for more postage , paid them , no response no delivery until 00 / 0 , received the perfect box , but when opened , all solutions are falled aparts , complained to the customer_service , blamed to the courier broke them .
neutral	their cancellation advisor told me they would charge me a contract breaking fee of over £_000 .
negative	!
negative	if you think hermes is bad try booking through parcel0go .
negative	!
negative	it was taken down again immediately and i was asked to provide_evidence to my purchase .
positive	cover of good quality .
positive	keep up the good work !
neutral	not got them yet but i ' m feeling slightly more at ease !
neutral	yes , sometimes i send pictures one at a time days apart , sorry if this is irritating to you rtb , but i design and create my different variations weeks - months apart , i am unable to send images in bulk .
positive	ordered spares for a not so new panasonic vacuum_cleaner and the supplied parts fitted_perfectly .
neutral	there are previews on facebook the day before things go on sale and they go on sale between 00 - 00 the next_day .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single_person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay_away .
positive	i can ' t recommend highly_enough .
positive	once ordered easily from the website the delivery was quick and item well_packed .
neutral	on closer_inspection , however , the t shirts were too short and after a couple of washes on 00 degree wash they had shrunk even more and had gone out of shape .
positive	the website was easy to use and very informative allowing me to choose the perfect item .
positive	the optician prices were far to expensive for me so i decided to search the internet for vfm , it did not take too long to see glases0you web_page .
neutral	i find paypal a useful financial service but as most of my transactions are small , the fees make it inappropriate for serious business volumes .
positive	then , it was as simple as packaging up the game and posting it through the nearest postbox .
negative	they are totally_incompetent and appear to have no experience or skill in the energy industry .
positive	it is amazing in our room , completely changed the look , really comfy and the whole family can sit_together - a perfect home_cinema .
neutral	they are meant to detect your booking via your license plate - that didn_'_t work ( and i suspect that was a problem for others trying to enter at same time ).
positive	will_deffo be back here if i need more .
neutral	my wife continues to berate me for letting the app upgrade occur ( 0 month now ) the previous maybe 0000 app was easy to use and presented products in clear simple vibrant colours .
neutral	haivng had two parcels from amazon recently dropped over the back fence , the second lanfding in the snow and being left for the weekend by initial review would be much lower .
negative	i bought two great looking bunches of flowers from this rip_off company to be delivered on weds before_christmas .
negative	four chairs but only one cushion !
neutral	great idea but when withdrawing money you dont get all of it they keep some after advertising on the site it costs notjing as they make their money from advertising which is lies
positive	i ' ll probably be using them again in the not - too - distant_future !
neutral	what would they have done if i hadn_'_t enquired_about my order ?
positive	very good and fast service
negative	anyway the company is always slow with delivery took them 0 days to get back to me when i emailed them asking where a parcel was .
positive	i need booking site which give me fully information about hostel .

positive	this was the third order i ' d placed and it was the the third order that had arrived on time .

neutral	furthermore the internal floor panels promised by the designer had not been ordered .
negative	i went abroad in december thinking i ' d have my phone , but two bills of over £_000 despite phone not working at all in second week of trip definitely put me off vodafone forever .
neutral	surprise_surprise when they took nearly double what they had quoted me .
negative	very poor service and i would not recomend wicken toys .
positive	all in all very pleased so far .
neutral	next_day i get a text ; problem with the order , please ring .
positive	fantastic experience with funktion .
neutral	now the day it arrived i had a few friends over to all set_up the pc since we are a group of nerds and upon setting it up and turning it on a bsod came up .
neutral	this is highly suspect and very unethical .
neutral	so my negative_review is based on gaks misleading website .
neutral	they are let_down by careless home delivery staff who clog the aisles with large trolleys chatting and poor responses to comments .
negative	my boyfriend deserves more_than the refund of £ 0 . 00 for the inconvenience , quality of the roses and service provided .
negative	even i brought an android tablet from them via wowcher .
negative	paid for an early morning delivery of an item .
neutral	i took it to a shop where they reinstalled everything for £_00 , saving me £_00 .
neutral	had a text_message_saying funds had been transferred , nothing has arrived in my account !
positive	i got straight onto p0g and daniel sorted my problem out in under 0 minutes via the web chat .
neutral	on 0 separate_occasions the website fell over so despite trying for over 00_minutes each time we gave up and ordered from eat .
negative	will give more detail when i have more time .
negative	although they might say they ship from america on the about us page , a lot of people wont see this and when your shopping on the site it looks to be a normal uk site .
positive	after having a litter of puppies i put my irish red and white setter on yumega .
negative	i emailed wowcher two_weeks_ago asking how i go about chasing my goods , but no reply .
negative	when they phones were tested that apparently had bad bezel damage , they didn ' t , and the price offered was a fraction of the original .

neutral	what i haven_'_t liked is the box it came in had no padding or protection for such an expensive item .
positive	i ordered rad new vans that i couldn ' t find on the high_st , cheaper_than other_websites i found them on .
negative	0 .
positive	avoid yodel at all costs - but don ' t miss out on a good deal because of it .
negative	i contacted uk power networks which is our local electricity distributer and they came out and checked my main fuse and confirmed that electricity was back on and coming to the house but that the meter was disabled .
positive	value for money , competitive_pricing . one of the fastest free of charge deliveries on the web .
negative	i ' m not gonna go into details but if you have a choice go for another service !

positive	bought a few electrical items from this company .
positive	i recommend mpb without_reservation !
positive	i found a waistcoat which was so reasonably_priced , i thought it was either a typo or was bound to be out of stock but checked the stock issue and found a cravat to match so i ordered them online thinking that it was going to be of passable quality to go under a jacket .
positive	got a tub of retro sweets as a present for a friend ' s four children .
negative	ordered a tv online and was told the delivery would be between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm during the week , so i had to take an afternoon off work to make_sure i was in the house to accept the delivery .
neutral	it was like the transfer supplier had decided to just take a day off and turn off all their phones .
positive	i am so hooked with them .
neutral	when they outsource delivery then it usually is better ( e . g .
neutral	pitty really .
positive	great experiences we would not have enjoyed as a family if it weren_'_t for wowcher .
neutral	i found using the site very easy , good value for money and definitely cheaper_than anywhere_else .
neutral	important message : we strongly_advise you to check the parcel ’_s condition and contents before signing the delivery note . feel free to remove your product ( s ) from the box to inspect them , even if the outer_packaging doesn ’ t show any signs of damage .

positive	delivered on time and exactly as ordered
negative	!
negative	too fast for charging , not for helping .
neutral	just do not expect any niceties / customer_service
positive	although a complex subject to us mere mortals , it was made easy by the professionalism and information provided by omar_mesbahi .
negative	to be told that because my account was now empty this wouldnt be possible .
positive	searched for tickets on google and double 0 came up .
positive	the range of items is exceptional , particularly for a slim person with long arms !
negative	the lack of respect in answering potential customer ' s queries is , quite_frankly , disgusting and , as such , i won ' t be using them in the future , however good the deals are .
neutral	of the three queries i sent in via their contact form on their website , only one was responded to by an actual person , and they only told me things i already knew / could find on their website , rather_than answering my actual question .
neutral	loved the car , the prices and the overall package .
neutral	and jet0 were still selling extra_legroom at check in according to the ticker .
positive	the trend with pc games is that they are slowly becoming more_expensive , even_though the medium is now less physical that it used to be due to digital distributors .
negative	ii ' d give them a miss !
neutral	(.
positive	i cannot_praise them enough .
negative	please avoid at all costs .
neutral	la voiture , louée via hertz , était dans un état déplorable , sale et avec_des détritus a l ' arrière .
negative	so from my first and last shopping_experience with bt , do not buy from them unless you want to end up being disappointed .
positive	they don ' t seem to really cater to anyone who is a uk size 00 and above , much to the disappointment of some my friends .
positive	i cannot rate them highly_enough .
negative	we got to our hotel in bath and found out that this company had cancelled our stay and not even bothered to tell us !

negative	escalated dispute to claim on paypal .
positive	my husband and i discovered supplementwarehouse . com years_ago , and we ' ve never used any other site or store since .
neutral	i still use them when i have to , but begrudgingly now rather_than happily :(
negative	i and others with no musical experience can pick the talent with a lot more creditability than these judges .
neutral	their insistence on going back over the same process from the start each and every time is infuriating , why not pick_up from where you have got to !
positive	the villa inside and out was kept in excellent condition , pool was immaculate .
neutral	the hotel wasn ' t clean - although it was good having 0 - 0 to a room , it had the previous occupant ' s bra under the bed , along with a sock .
positive	quick and easy .
negative	developed into a cash cow portal for martin_lewis '_s entrepreneurial ambitions .
negative	a hole in my account balance having paid for a dishwasher
positive	bought the corner_sofa and separate footstool .
neutral	i have been a catalogue customer for a number of years and yodel took over the courier service .

negative	0 star only coz its christmas time
positive	i doubted this service after being stuck on 0 . 00 . 00 yet after purchasing this service i got an_email which allowed me to unlock through itunes !
positive	very good company !
positive	!
neutral	if you need help and you raise a query , expect long delays for someone to come back to you and they are never apologetic .
neutral	it seems river_island is gettng more and more_expensive should offer discount !
neutral	i had an issue with my phone and emailed them for a follow_up . of which i am still_awaiting a reply and that is now 0 weeks .
neutral	so on this basis they have started to go up in my estimation .
negative	keep your distance .

positive	brilliant service , quite expensive compared to original prices , but i have the tickets !!
neutral	wash cars
neutral	i have waited in all day for my parcel .
negative	do not deal with valuebasket .
positive	best_wishes - ray
neutral	we have tried to find other_companies who have an order process as easy as theirs but nothing compares at all ( including on price ) so we just stick with them and deal with the mistakes .
positive	very good quality at a competitive price .
positive	also all thefantastic freebies that im able to try before i buy helps me pick products i like .
neutral	up to the moment the delivery men have arrived .
neutral	why didn ' t i get response to the email sent ?
positive	they were great at giving advice on what hen_party would be suited to us and answered any_questions that were asked extensively .
positive	i just can '_t fathom some websites , and after struggling with one or two to buy this recorder that had been recommended to me , i was about to give up , when i remembered buying a yamaha keyboard last_year from gear0 music .
positive	very happy with this transaction , customer service contacted me to say there would be a slight_delay in delivery of my order .
negative	he said okay , reprinted , we left .
negative	please send formal statement at support @ tyreleader . co . uk
positive	from ordering to delivery , it was all very simple .
positive	fast delivery .
positive	will_certainly use again if we need transport .
negative	utter_rubbish don_'_t use
neutral	the trophy was poorly made .
positive	update_: just moved_into a new flat , needed home insurance , had a quote and then policy sorted within 00_minutes .
positive	your website seemed to ony allow figures in the english pound box , and then adjust with + and - which i found a little unsatisfactory .
negative	!
positive	the prices can ' t be beat .
negative	so i called yodel and they informed me that someone attempted to collect my parcel at 00 . 00 the night before which is not only a lie but it is also outside of the time of collection they stated .

neutral	i am not impressed with this season '_s clothes which veer from dated and boring to quirky and overpriced .

neutral	overall no real problems but nothing that makes me think they are amazing .
neutral	however it took them a good five days to ready my product for dispatch !
neutral	the day came to pick_up the car and as we sorted last bits and pieces and i was shown how many checks the car had gone_through before i was receiving it the salesman held up the spare , none remote key declaring the other was missing , but it wouldnt take long to get another !!!

positive	it worked beautifully !
neutral	as someone that couldn ' t care less about formula 0 offers through their sponsors i would rather pay less and lose this " benefit ".
positive	the flowers were delivered to the venue and held until the function that evening .
neutral	the receipt came from google_checkout not simply_electronics .
negative	yours ,
neutral	found the html and php sql training very useful .
negative	basically , they sell items they don_'_t actually have , and the lie to the customer before trying to up - sell another item or process a refund .

positive	i ordered my copies of the game and after 00_minutes i got an_email with attached photo ' s of my game codes which is a more satisfactory idea as you know they are more then likely to be legit and someone hasn ' t just copied the code into an_email and maybe got to code wrong .

positive	the very next_day a cheque for £_00 arrives through the door .

neutral	given the high price i was almost certain it would be a 0 day delivery , however there is no way to confirm that .
neutral	i don_'_t believe that this is then a fair or independent review of the service or experience received when forced to change the review !
neutral	at one point i received three 00_%_discount emails for the same order .
neutral	i wasnt actually saving any money since i could ' ve got the hoody at the same price from the manufacturer online .

neutral	this time , a support guy talked me through resiting the processor which was a new skill for me - amazingly it worked .
positive	they always provide excellent service - high_quality items , fast delivery , advice about their products , quick response to any question .
negative	i bid my time and waited for the 00 days to expire which they duly did .
neutral	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
neutral	i searched for the transaction_id that viagogo sent me and also was not able to find it .
negative	poor driver got the brunt of my anger ( he only collects and delivers )
neutral	great system but has a little problem listening to it '_s users
positive	very fast delivery , good prices and very helpful assistance .
neutral	can consumers then trust the reviews placed on trustpilot ? and are trustpilot actually unbiased or simply just protecting the retailers to publish and promote high scores ?

positive	he always
neutral	to be fair they refunded me quickly and no harm done but my advice would be to check the good are actually being sold by amazon and not one of their partners .

negative	mitesh soma , you should be_ashamed of yourself , taking money under_false pretences from the most vulnerable people in society , yes thats right - shame on you .
positive	i use hostelworld and hostelbookers to book my accomodations .
neutral	in disputes ebay usually believe the seller rather_than the buyer as it costs more to get the money off the seller and risk losing them than it does to tell the buyer to clear off .
neutral	serenataflowers did a great job , flower are lovely and the girl i sent them too really really loves them , however her special supprise was ruined when i was forced to phone her before they eventually arrived to be on the lookout for a package .

negative	i searched this shop by online .
neutral	my advice - help the drivers apply some common_sense and ask for parcels to be left with a neighbour .
positive	the member of staff we dealt_with was sharon .
neutral	the costume shed little green hairs everywhere he went .
neutral	it took multiple phone_calls with different advisors to get my order processed and neither advisor was clear about the pricing of the package .
positive	i received my two_pairs of glasses , one for reading the other for tv etc .

neutral	not only viagogo seized the opportunity to not let go of their commission by rebooking me instead of refunding , but they never wanted me to cancel those tickets i didn ' t want , because they saw a great opportunity to make money . and pretending they were being kind to me .
positive	excellent selection .
neutral	it arrived at 0pm .

neutral	the original transaction was conducted through paypal and for no reason was reversed with no contact or information .

neutral	regarding customer service if they just followed up an order after confirmation with an expected delivery date but apart_from that hispek is a good company and worth looking at especially there prices i can '_t fault that .
neutral	absolutely superb website but has dropped its usual standards due to the following sellers :- zoverstocks = fantastic prices & when the orders are correct , 00_% of the time they are in excellent condition . but , they take far too long to dispatch items , which seem to be getting longer & longer .

neutral	however everything else , once we had the car , went_smoothly and handover at other end was very easy and swift ( once we had managed to find an open petrol_station on a sunday to fill the car !).
neutral	we have used intrerparcel for over 0 years .
neutral	--- update 0 days after the concert i wanted to attend :
positive	thanks sammie .
negative	zero_stars
neutral	email not responded to .
positive	you don_'_t get that kind of service every day .
neutral	if i went to the garage ( freezer is housed in there ) i would have to check the front_door for delivery as these_people barely wait long enough for you to actually get to the front_door .
neutral	still don_'_t know if i have done the correct thing - therefore i think it is quite complicated ( and i am £ 0 . 00 out of pocket )
negative	the only word i can use is unscrupulous !
positive	then l found this site .
positive	furthermore the amount agreed was in my account , not less like other purchasing sites seem to do .
negative	after writing my review , infurn have contacted trustpilot claiming they can ' t verify the sale : they are now going after their customers !
negative	made a booking , ordered 0 coaches for my brothers wedding day and paid on that basis .
neutral	some of the highest prices in the e_- cig game but saying that there customer_service has alwayse been good and there red labell tobacco juice is next to none if they sorted there prices it would be a 0 * companny
neutral	personally , i wouldn ’ t chance it .
positive	money arrived the next_day , really excellent service .
positive	i rely_on this kind of service for my handyman business . i will_certainly buy from thepolescompany . co . uk again .
neutral	could at_least give you 00_% back if nothing to report on car .
neutral	i have had several experiences with delayed shipping - stocking out of products .
positive	i have no_hesitation in recommending xupes and i look_forward to doing_business again in the future .
neutral	the actual treatment involved about and hour of delay before i finally got to the treatment room so i was pretty nervous .
negative	when my phone finally came back on line after three days i was told that my blackberry services ( yes , i know , sad isn_'_t it ) would take another few_days to resume , even_though i had paid for them , but they weren_'_t sure exactly how long .
neutral	come on ba get your act_together , i am afraid that qantas really have the better customer service than you at the moment .
neutral	staff were friendly , well informed & helpful .
positive	abi & heather .
negative	morons in city_link ( or deliberately malicious ?)
neutral	the cost of the complete pack , with the plinth was around £_00 , so i decided to order the complete pack , only to be told then that they were out of stock and even if they were in stock i would not receive them the next_day as it was too late for a next_day delivery .
negative	i was very disappointed with rentalcars .
positive	prompt dispatch .
negative	kwik_fit gets a lot of flak in the car world . at_least the service was friendly and it was cheaper !
negative	0 of my recent orders with online companies were delivered by hermes .
neutral	the item took a long time to be delivered despite saying on the website it would be delivered within 0 - 0 days .
positive	last weekend in budapest was fantastic thanks to the guys at chillisauce !
positive	i would definitely reccommend a visit !
negative	company claimed not arrived - despite guaranteed delivery .
neutral	but the tast was verry unplesent :-( i had to add extra flavouring to get_rid of a very harsh and chalky taste but as i say verrry good price
positive	they immediately provided a refund with no_hassles !
neutral	booking made easily , but i was surprised when the payment was taken .
positive	what '_s not to love ?
neutral	i ' ll wait a few_days before i ' ll forward the whole_thing to a lawyer .
positive	i received them today ( wednesday ). quick and painless !
negative	if you ring up you have to wait up to 0 / 0 hour at_least before you can speak with some one . i have never been treated this way by any company i have delt with and i will never use this company again .
neutral	we were miles_away from any shops so out of desperation i managed to get a pizza delivered but had to miss some activities to go meet the guy .
positive	tent price was very reasonable compared to elsewere and was a little_bit_dubious but thought what the hey .
positive	i have used overclockers . co . uk a lot over the past_year , every time the service has been excellent .
negative	where is yours ?
neutral	the only black mark is the amount of grey_import stuff they sell which means any warranty may be with scan rather_than the manufacturer ( samsung disk drives are a case in point ).
negative	you then sit and wait for your order to be taken .
neutral	recently i '_ve been reading about their 0 hours staff and the terrible work schedules .
positive	great delivery service - pay for next_day and not only do you get what you pay for , you get tracking_information too .
neutral	in august i went into what i thought was my isp '_s web_site to check my billing statement .
neutral	i used to buy from the store quite regularly however i feel the emphasis has gone more towards typical high_street brands and styles rather_than sticking to it ' s original roots of streetwear and the pricing of new products when you include tax is at top end of the rrp .
neutral	the product hasn ' t been delivered due time as the robot email suggested .
negative	since then money was taken from my account and still no phone .
positive	they are amazing , very fast and friendly . easy to add funds to your account and make calls to any country .
positive	would definately recommend anyvan .
negative	even_though we had done everything we could to sort it out .
negative	i would have been happy to pay for the days service i used or even a month , but the stance the took of charging for a full year really surprised me .
neutral	i use paypal quiet alot because of my ebay account the only thing i dont agree with is the charge you get everytime you recieve money on the other hand it is free of charge if you want to transfer money into your own account
positive	i would recommend them to anyone .
positive	excellent price and service
negative	i have asked for refund but havent got that yet , so im very dissaponted with the service , they should be providing tracking for their items .
negative	i sent a further e_- mail and photo ' s and had to contact wicken for an answer as they failed to reply in a timely_manner .
neutral	doesn_'_t sound right at all hence lowered review rating .
positive	i will_definitely be using shopperhive again .
positive	at 0 . 00 , there was a knock on the door .
neutral	on realising that the item wasn ' t suitable , i had to send back .
neutral	tried tactics like last room left , free cancellation .
neutral	thank_you .
positive	but due to work constraint i gave it a shot !
negative	i ordered a £_00 service hair and beauty service .
negative	i waited in all day , nothing , looked at the on line tracking and at 0 :_00pm it said " van not ready ".
negative	slow delivery
positive	i had a looka round numerous sites for a long time thinking which one is a honest and true trustworthy website to buy from .
neutral	the rep wouldn ' t except responsibility and was adamant the hen didn ' t request explore lane when we were all there that day and know she did .
positive	sorted !
neutral	when i had to call for a replacement phone in the past , i found them to be quite rude , in terms of asking if i usually allowed a three year_old to put my belongings down the loo and suggested that i should have been supervising them better .
neutral	handyman skills required to install but no more .
positive	the staff were friendly at all times .
positive	minimum_fuss , easy to set_up an account and would definitely recommend !!
positive	ordered a ps0 game for £_00 , arrived very quickly and well_packaged but somehow the case for the game had got smashed ( i ' m blaming royal_mail ) i sent a email to customer_service and got a reply back only 00_mins later saying they would send out a replacement case .
neutral	the shirts are outstanding , so much so i ' ve purchased 00 of em '.
positive	when we had to expand the trip from 000 to 000 due to massive sign_up numbers , they allowed us to do so within 0 days of finding out we needed more spaces which took a huge_amount of pressure off us as a committee ( a lot of people were very annoyed that they werent in the first 000 ).
positive	was quick fix to verify !
negative	you need to research your stuff before you buy it '.
positive	thank_you
neutral	we purchased an adjustable foot stool which was promptly dispatched .
negative	my son booked a flight with this mob , through a bunch of spanish con artists called edreams .
positive	email communication was absolutely impeccable and i received replies within minutes .
neutral	thanks to mr kwame i didn ' t have to waste another day waiting for nothing .
negative	this is theft and the only possible conflict resolution here is to take legal_action with a claims court , which i am_currently seeking advice regarding .
negative	these_people are cheats and worse , we are pensioners .
negative	that was my experience during half term at taunton asda .
neutral	i sold tickets on viagogo for muse concert that was in riga on 00 . 00 . 0000 .

positive	sprzęt dotarł bez uszkodzeń i oszczędziliśmy 0 tys złotych , bo tyle musielibyśmy zapłacić więcej , kupując w polsce .
negative	never , ever go with three .
positive	i find shopperhive ' s comparison listings easy to compare , especially using the grid view .
neutral	when i have bought shower_trays in the past they have come with the legs .
neutral	my one honest tip is , this is not special amazing food , it is stuff you can make a lot tastier and cheaper , it is just smaller portions .
positive	they offer free delivery which with some companies can take a week to receive your goods but mine arrived a couple of days_later .
neutral	well i keep getting used to good ' ol facebook , then they go along & change it every few_months .
neutral	very poor response to advert i placed from the platform , however i think has to do with the market for renting in my area rather_than rentify .
positive	i was kept_informed as to how my order was being_processed .
neutral	i contacted viagogo customer_service ( which is worst customer_service , ever !)
neutral	trustpilot then threatens to have your review removed if you don_'_t change it .
negative	the policy of the company towards its customers is and still remains legendry .
negative	you are selling tickets for flights , events etc_., you need to have customer support at all times .
positive	i bet after a few seconds , this comment will be deleted because trustpilot is also an unmanned system , no body is ever checking .
positive	best
neutral	when i called customer_services they explained that there had been a warehouse issue but it would be shipped and i would receive the following_day .
neutral	on both these occassions i had my money returned to me , but not before the manager had passed some comment to the effect that it was my fault .
neutral	my calls seem to drop so much more , and i am no where near as happy as i used to be .
neutral	procedure was quick and easy , but it wouldn_'_t accept my postcode .
neutral	in fact , it is nigh on impossible to move without it disassembling itself ; it is very heavy .
neutral	we were given his with a valuation certificate , photo etc .
negative	im a new customer that made a booking with you guys , everything was fine till i departure , never got the email at departure to rate the hostel , i was so happy about it but after a week i decided to contact hostelbookers asking about it , someone called hollie reply saying email was sent , check your spam and they even said if i didnt book with them wont get the email what a retards . i eamil back and never got and answer . customer_service suck im wondering_why some hotels have tons of rates and the other ones dont ?
positive	they always came_across very professionally , friendly and helpful .
positive	thank_you .
positive	the radio is fantastic , well built and the sound quality is excellent , glad we ordered it
negative	as the gas fitter travelled some considerable distance to fit the part neither him or myself were very pleased .
positive	they exceeded all of our expectations - the card stock was incredibly fine for the price and the print job was excellent .
positive	would definitely shop_here again and recommend to others .
negative	it might be the cheapest broadband provider in the uk but certainly not the best .
neutral	at first it did save a lot of money .
positive	earlier this year , i needed a replacement power_supply for my computer .
negative	sizes changed order a 00 it ' s like an 00 order a 00 it ' s like a 0 .
neutral	you also have more choice if you pay " on the door " as there are numerous different_types of tickets , and afternoon teas .
positive	simple .
neutral	sometimes its not worth spending it in primark now when you can go elsewhere and get better quality thats going to last longer .
negative	received acknowledgement , confirmation and delivery notification but article was not at store when i called to collect .
neutral	what is the point of ths site if the company who gives bad service or sells rubbish stuff can get the reviews removed ?
positive	bought two or three times and always the advise of the women on the phones is excellent .
negative	fortunately for me the cost was half that of parcel0go but i now have the problem of trying to obtain a refund from a company that you can not speak to !
neutral	they ' re almost comical .
positive	- sorting_out post delivery problems .
negative	tried to verify my debit_card , so entropay deposited a small_amount in my bank ac .
positive	on a side note , i don ' t understand the bad_reviews on trustpilot .
positive	i needed some more knowledge on nd filters which cameraking were willing to point me in the right_direction for .
positive	how would we work , play or pis $ without them ?
negative	but the staff and loss of many hours of your life easily detract from that .
neutral	what do you do ?
negative	i am completely fed_up with chess_telecom and will be making a formal_complaint to cisas first thing in the morning to get this sorted_out .
negative	if i could have rated it lower_than 0 star i would have done .
negative	have sent several emails and they do not have the decency to reply .
positive	i must commend the service .
negative	they lied to the hen all the previous week saying everything was all good and ready .
negative	made the mistake of ordering from wae_+ without researching first .
negative	no answer .
positive	their prices are beyond fair and even give you a better deal if you find a better price else where .
neutral	the goods took over a week to arrive well within the up to 00 days the web_site suggested it could take due to the items coming from a depot in europe .
negative	then after waiting for almost 0 months i decided to contact royal_mail ( uk ) to file a claim for lost parcel .
positive	robin
neutral	even some of their more_expensive products have problems .
positive	well donemervyn kinney .
neutral	i seem to have had the same problems as a lot of se customers .

positive	my stepper arrived very quickly but was damaged in transit .
neutral	many options were available and it was easy to book a hostel for my travels .
neutral	not only this , but it wouldn ' t be in stock until 0000 .
positive	glennis andrews
neutral	my view it '_s one of a portfolio of p0p sites intended to spread the risk .
positive	i had an order turn_up with a product missing ( the top of the package had been sliced , i assume at the courier depot ) and i was refunded straight_away as a replacement could not be sent .
neutral	update .
negative	conclusions : wae_+ advertise products that are not in stock .
negative	*** update **** one month later i have had a refund - yipee .
positive	fast , simple and all you need to get the right informations and make a safety reservation !

positive	accommodated us when we needed to make changes and all around good service .
neutral	the product itself when it finally arrived was fine .
positive	sun dried green clay face pack is great , my favorite at the moment , i love the living facial cleaner too , it actually hydrates my skin .
negative	the problem_arose because of a fault in the local sub - station which caused a surge that destroyed my meter .
negative	an appliances_direct website that claims said dishwasher is out for delivery
negative	wanted to update my review to say that my money was never forthcoming in spite of customer_services saying they would chase the finance department .
neutral	it wouldnt be so bad that they are overpriced if they actually didnt , each week , make me have to go to customer service desk complaining that what i bought as buy one get one free is actually not shown as that on the reciept .
positive	have used mazuma a number of times in the past and will_definitely use again in the future .
negative	its about time companies like these get what they deserve .
positive	have received email and was offered full_refund or replacement for missing item and requested replacement as i really needed the sd_card . so i am going to upgrade now to five_stars as they were very helpful .
neutral	this was on my week off from work and was hoping for fast ( in the 0 - 0 estimated time ) delivery .

positive	:):):):):):):):):):):)
neutral	installed by a monkey .
positive	many_thanks
neutral	sure they smile when it suits them but there has_been an air of everything is too much_trouble recently - rolling eyes , sighs , just general body language that indicates they would just rather sit down and read their mags in between the times they throw meals at you .
positive	where i found r grahams site , not only did they have the grate i wanted but a lot_cheaper then what was quoted by dunsley themselves
negative	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
positive	site was very easy to use .
negative	he then went on to say that i had opted for the pre_- payment fuel option and that i should have returned the vehicle as empty as possible .
neutral	on the plus side the customer_service is very good , they are very keen to look after you if there is a problem , so at_least there is some redemption on this occasion .
negative	searching for answers to real problems results in no practical advice of substance .
positive	it was delivered quickly and arrived exactly at the promised time .
positive	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you !!!
positive	i am exstatic when i see a product i have heard about and they have a promotion on it .
neutral	over the recent months i have started to see the customer_services slip in my local_stores ; not to mention that the prices are creeping up and are become less competitive with other out lets .
neutral	another think i don ' t like - its additional surcharges for paying with cc .
neutral	one particular example is when i took my bike in for a yearly once - over ( i do regular maintenance myself ) and they replaced my chain .
negative	car passed mot , payment made and i was advised car would be delivered for 0000 .
positive	as the owner of an elderly dog with specific dietary needs , the company has saved me a fortune .
neutral	this really frustrated me because after forking_out the amount of money for this thing i expected it to work from the word go .
neutral	so , after you have ordered and you have paid , you find out that you are not able to fill in another delivery address .
positive	i give them 0_stars
negative	!
neutral	we accepted the car , tired , and left to drive to the hotel . by the way with an empty gas tank so we had to drive thru half dubai to find a gas station . bad start thx to dollar rent a car !!!
neutral	at last they have been back in touch and this time the customer_services were excellent thanks kevin maguire hope i spelt his name right faith restored !
neutral	hence my frustration .
negative	when i laughed at the thought of ever spending money with them again , they offered £_000 cash , but given the stress they have caused both me and my partner , i don ’ t feel they deserve any sale from me .
positive	i will_definitely use mazuma_mobile next time to recycle a phone .
positive	just does what it should do and that '_s fine with me .
positive	the costume is fantastic quality got here faster then expected and i would defiantly use the sight again and recommend it to a friend .
neutral	the plastic box on which the headphones were laying down was also damaged .
neutral	i only have two complaints .
negative	ordered something for christmas .
positive	- delivery notes that are easier to check off against the order ( need to ensure everything is okay within 00_hours ).
negative	i queried it and was fobbed with the answer that the only document available was the amazon ' final details for order ' document - which specifically states that it is not a vat receipt .
neutral	for me as a long time user i feel the standers have slipped .
positive	quick delivery and boxed up safely for the post .
neutral	not to mention the products that were not in stock that were replaced with something else now i understand that they do run out of stock , but replacing burger buns with hot dog rolls , now i cant see the logic .
negative	grrr
positive	win_win for both of us .
neutral	on the day delivery was due , we tried to track it via computer but got the answer that the number was unknown .
negative	are these_guys just some cowboys who have locked the national mechanics in the back and running some shoddy show out front .
positive	the service i received in store at bluewater was also fantastic .
neutral	i needed to change my booking - that was done pretty quickly and efficiently and did not cost too much extra so that was good .
positive	other than that wonderful service second to none !!!
neutral	have to say i have no_idea why parcelforce can '_t understand the instructions when they are plastered in a large label on the top of the box " perishable - do not return to depot ".
positive	they were the first to pop up on google lol so i hopped on it and took my chances .
negative	the phone was sent royal_mail ' signed for ' at my own_expense and arrived and was signed for by someone at regenersis the following_day .
negative	i kept composed and even edited out anything that could be termed course or offensive at all before posting my review only for it to instantly disappear and say it was reported for bad language .
positive	overall , i can definitely_recommend buying there .
neutral	all the stuff is ridiculously over priced compared to other_sites like amazon . co . uk .
positive	first time user but by no means the last :) excellent from the design to the delivery , many thx :)
neutral	the delivery is always quick and it is good value for money .
negative	no real chance to establish the cars faults , i photographed each elevation of the car and drove some 000kms to our destination , upon which we found there was no hi viz jacket , emergency triangles or first aid kit , which are all mandatory in spain .
negative	i hate the email tricks they play .
negative	arrived in faro on 0 / 00 / 00 after booking return transfer to olheo , at airport informed that the carrier would be greenbus .
positive	brilliant !
negative	unfortunately the worst part came after the holiday when threatening emails started to arrive claiming additional_charges .
neutral	mr m not interested .
neutral	( your mocha limu is fantastic !)
neutral	the night before collection , we used online facility to extend the rental period and request a collection earlier in the day .
neutral	as i wasn ' t given any alternative , i had to cancel my flights with budgetair .
negative	it ' s not even worth going into details of where they have got it wrong , but a perfect example is being suspended for attempting to outbid someone .
negative	reassured on a number occasions i could claim compensation for the loss of service , i continued to pay for a service i wasn ’ t receiving .
negative	poor after_sales , badly written contracts designed to mislead and hide the pitfalls .
neutral	i also uploaded the prescription , as requested .
neutral	i attempted shopping online with them once last_year but the accidentally ( just bad luck ) canceled my order but left it a long time before telling_me so half of the stuff i wanted was sold out .
negative	finally , they have an inability to send you invoices and credit notes which they may one day live to regret if they are ever inspected by hmrc vat inspectors .
negative	when is ' in a bit '??.
negative	i called consumer advice and reported this company since they had not delivered an item i ordered in february and a few_days_later i had a call from trading_standards .
neutral	once parked i then located my email , and realised that it was probably safer to leave as once you have pressed the green button your booking is not recognised .
positive	your service is excellent , your products are excellent and your staff the very best !
negative	so no_worries then ….
neutral	any savings gained are lost and otherwise spoiled aa acceptable experience .
positive	my dealings with this company have gone great , i had to return one item even that was dealt_with proper & quickly many_thanks will sure use again
negative	so naturally , i called talktalk again , explained i ’ ve had no service for 0 weeks and am requesting compensation .
neutral	which means i am unable to re - order for 00_hrs due to failed order while completing security check .
neutral	they need to use a better delivery company other than royal_mail
positive	the same was experienced when i rang up to place the order ; very pleasant and courteous .
neutral	my order was a little delayed however nothing major .
neutral	they will order another key and program it when my car comes in for the above problems .
positive	they are ok
neutral	mains_lead only 0 metre long & no 00a plug supplied .

positive	many_thanks and will indeed come back again if and when i should have tv troubles
positive	had a problem sending from one of my email accounts - it was fixed in the blink of an eye .
neutral	i have bought from them a few_times and if you are willing to wait a few_days longer_than say amazon then you can probably get it cheaper here than most .
negative	the flowers were delivered in a damaged box and when i opened them i was so dissapointed .
positive	i decided to give transglobal express a go , the item was collected promptly and arrived in great condition the next_day .
negative	have left parcels with neighbours but not put the correct information on the note , and on on occasions when a parcel was left apparently left on the door_step , but wasn ' t there when i got home , they had no record of who the parcel had been sent by on their system .
positive	mazuma were as good as their word and i would recommend them to others .
negative	no monies were taken so i didn_'_t have to chase for a refund .
positive	you will not be disappointed !!
negative	they take money and don_'_t deliver or refund at all .
positive	booked and collected on monday .
neutral	we ended_up having to go to the travel lodge hotel instead which alright was only 0 minutes walk extra but the stress would ' ve been easily avoided if communication would ' ve been sent via_email soon as it was booked .
neutral	will stick with it a little longer to hope for improvement .
positive	i will_definitely be travelling with jet0 again .
negative	i can '_t believe anyone_else could be worse .
neutral	the first time it took more_than 0 months for my glasses to arrive .

negative	i spoke to the manager and he said exactly the same !
neutral	i wasn_'_t .
positive	all_round a great service .

neutral	i sent for 0 pairs of leggins in the sale at £ 0 . 00 a pair . the sizes were 00 / 00 and m / l to fit my daughter who is a size 00 , but only one pair was a perfect_fit and another pair fit ok .
negative	they had the nerve to tell me the the van driver had called and left a calling_card .
positive	i can recommend chemist_direct , they have a fab web_page which is easy to use , the products are extensive and varied .
negative	your rubbish !
neutral	rnag again .
negative	i am beginning to feel that this is a bogus company .
positive	hostelbookers is cheaper_than the competition and at worst as reliable and at best far more reliable .
neutral	we have been dealing_with mdp for around 0 years and we have experienced many issues with them over the years .
positive	really good service , kept in tough all the way until my holiday . will_definitely book with them again ,
neutral	i haven ' t noticed that my website was down during those 0 months , the apps / widgets are working fine but there ' s 0 thing that kills me :
negative	not cool !
negative	did not work , my phone rejected it .
negative	thats the end .
positive	paymentsense set_up really quick and i would recommend this .
negative	this company uses casual delivery drivers .
neutral	i had to constantly login to access the status of my order and the messages that had supposedly been sent to my email regarding the dispatch of my order , definitely weren ' t sent !!
negative	he then told me that he had received my parcel a few_days ago and it was sent for repair .
neutral	i done a hpi check on my car just incase there was any_issues with the car and to put my mind at ease before folking out £_00 , 000 .
positive	my glasses arrived less_than a week_later less_than 00 days in total .
neutral	same lady .
negative	at that point i cancelled the order .
neutral	buying from ' retention ' is deemed to be online and nothing to do with o0 retail shops .

neutral	this site is easy to use , but appears almost identical to several other train sites in layout and prices ; is this indicative of shared data , as these sites have the same prices as each other every time i look .

neutral	we have used alpha_rooms for years and always an exellent service all the way , the people they used in turkey this year not good the atitude of the english female rep at dalaman airport was at best terrible the bus went without us and all the rep said was you only paid peanuts so i dont know whay your problem is if you have to wait in heat with no shelter or water for a couple of hrs tough we are quite capable people but what if that was someone old / infirm or with disabled children not what i expect from alpharooms

negative	so t t take my money for a service they cannot provide , give me every indication that the service will be activated within 00 days , send me a bill , but don_'_t bother to tell me they cannot provide me with the service and then expect me to wait up to another 00 days for a cheque that i have to drive 00 miles to the the bank to pay in and then wait another 0 days for it to clear , so in total tt can hold on to my money for up to 00 days , how many people are they doing this too .
neutral	they sounded polite , apparently it ' s because of the holiday so there ' s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there ' s no mention on the site ).

neutral	first off let me say that i have always thought that talktalk have some good ideas and services but they really can let themselves down .
positive	at_least now workmates wont be picking my pen up believing it is theirs .

negative	if i had not print screened the check out page with the reference , i would have no proof of sale .
negative	we will never use hermes /_herpes again .
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to j . bowles @ parcel0go . com in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning 0000 0000000 this may cost 00p_per_minute .

negative	when i rang talktalk about switching i was only after phone and broadband as we are happy with sky tv , but was talked into the tv package too as it was cheaper .
neutral	now the strange thing was that the motherboard had free delivery so i thought that by adding the memory to it would also count as free delivery , but i was shocked as the delivery went up to over £_00 , if i had ordered them separately i would have got free delivery on the motherboard and paid just over £ 0 delivery on the memory . there great prices which are some of the cheapest around are really let_down by there delivery charges , so for me only 0_stars , get your delivery charges sorted_out and it would have been 0_stars .

neutral	no_frills , cheap flights to european destinations .

negative	surely a company specialising in the delivery of flowers should know the importance of meeting delivery commitments and they must have known that 0hey were going to let me down whattever the reason was , but no one bothered to contact me and give a reason . i can only suggest if you have a special_occasion you want to celebrate with flowers chose a company that cares_about its commitments

neutral	i made the change less_than 00hrs since paying and the brochure price for the new holiday was over £_000 cheaper yet they gave me £_00 back , it would have been cheaper to go to the travel_agents , they tell me there would have been no charge for this , but how do you fight your corner properly at the end of a phone ( which by the way cost me over £ 0 )

negative	fuel_policy - the vehicle is supplied with a full_tank of fuel .
positive	i am an_avid trollbead collector and i buy all my charms from identity .

positive	no doubt they will be .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i wouldn ' t recommend going to it and trying to work out what you want , as they push certain products ( e . g .
neutral	the products they sell speak for themselves , the postal prices are too much and the free option is way too slow , not even posted on day of order when ordered before lunchtime , and still no tracking_info 0 days on .

neutral	!
positive	so far i am very pleased with the service .
neutral	a huge_range of products available but no depth of customer_service ; the whole experience feels very impersonal .

negative	below is the response i received from their customer_services department , when i asked for a full_refund , because their items were short_dated .
neutral	it says that delivery is 0 to 0 weeks which i think is unacceptable in this day and age , but it is a present for someone_else which they really want ; otherwise i would have found an_alternative .

neutral	delivery was very quick , although the driver did have to phone my partner to find her address , which spoilt the surprise somewhat - he could have phoned me or just checked google_maps etc .
positive	margaret understood and happily we left the store to go searching . look where you like , you will come back to marlows .
neutral	he arranged for a replacement to be fitted , when i pointed_out the likelihood of rain he told me they would cover the range_rover with a canopy attached to their van .

neutral	delivery was near instant .
positive	enromous range , great prices and fast delivery for when you need a pair of pretty boots urgently .
negative	i am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and see what happens in 00 days .

neutral	many of the items come with free_gifts such as protein shakers and tester packs .
neutral	we did a lot of things for the first time and got to do them together as a group .
neutral	** opdatering d . 00 / 00 - 0000
positive	i got an_email_saying my laptop had been recieved the following_day after posting and a quote a few_days_later .
negative	i lost track of all the staff i spoke to and it was obvious that no one really knew what was going on with nearly everyone promising and rarely delivering .
negative	i nodded " someone will see you in a bit ".
negative	however the hire company chosen was not named until i paid with my credit_card .
neutral	i told the operator that i still had time left on my current_contract but i was told not to worry_about it , that it would be taken care of .
positive	i was so impressed with watchfinder .
neutral	i have now cancelled my breakdown_cover .
positive	very quick delivery ( arrived in less_than 0 days ) and an easy to use website .
neutral	i bought the experience for " afternoon_tea at kensington palace " and found that :
negative	at this point by now 00_minutes of time had lapsed , and the avis man gave me a small piece of paper with a number on it and a reference and he said they had asked me to call them at some point but that it was not urgent .
positive	thank_you model_bits for your services and long may you continue .
positive	also a surcharge for using paypal is disappointing as i use ebay and paypal a lot !
neutral	arrangements should have been made to inform me that this was the case .
negative	so i waited 0 days then checked when i was next online . and still no review .
positive	delivery is prompt and you are kept_informed of progress every_step of the way .
positive	communication was superb at every_step of the process .
negative	revision 0th_jan :
neutral	it ' s a shame for her as she wanted wellies people would turn to look at , now she ' s panicking that they might do exactly that !
positive	we flew with them 0 times this year and have never been disappointed .
positive	my thanks go to everybody in the ' chain ' who made things go so smoothly .
positive	when i was first recommended cjs_cd_keys by a colleague , i was highly suspicious of the site being a possible scam .
negative	they were sympathetic and helpful but there are two snags : firstly they don_'_t pay for repairs that ought to be covered_under_warranty .
neutral	i have no clue .
positive	i purchased a hair dryer .
neutral	support guys were very pleasant and competent but the return and repair process is not too efficient .
neutral	after telling them that if they could rebook us , it would be better_than missing on this amazing cycle of concerts , i received a call from a very efficient gentleman who found us 0 tickets in no time .
negative	where do i start ?
neutral	very annoying company but great products and price .
negative	simply contact your existing supplier two_weeks prior to the switch to get the existing landline ported across .
negative	customer_services is a complete wind up .
neutral	the roses , on the second day , have already started to brown at the edges of some petals .
neutral	it closes at the same early time as the phone lines !
neutral	i ' ve found them to be fast in delivering completed images and they do a very neat job .
positive	if i had to suggest any improvement , it would be useful to be able to store an address that i use regularly .
neutral	despite this the concert was brilliant .
positive	i will_definitely be a return customer
neutral	above , i describe its customer service lines , which close at the same time as its last collection time of 0000_hrs .
neutral	instead of nice greeting card which i paid for , it was the free card which was sent to her .
neutral	the only problem i had was some of the led lamps ordered were incorrectly boxed and therefore not what was ordered .
negative	all in all , i think it ' s a terrible service .
negative	i used envirofone many many years_ago when they were the industry leaders and pioneers .
positive	may be more_expensive than others but i think you get what you pay for .
negative	sent numerous_emails and query forms to which i had a ' thank_you for your query ' reply but never received anything_else despite them saying they answer all emails within 0 working_days ???
positive	we will_definately be using company again .
positive	thanks richard for your great service and assistance !
neutral	people taking calls on average most are not very helpful or knows what they are taking about .
neutral	i got a refund a couple of days_later , but no phone_call .
neutral	!
negative	0 .
neutral	i feel that an improvement to the website and the way in which order problems are communicated would be very beneficial for future customers .
negative	0 , the other 0 tyres have nails in them ?
positive	managed to lock myself out of my account , 0 minute on live_chat with catherine and all sorted .
negative	i have submitted photos to pc_specialist to back up these points and i am told they are being referred to the build manager .
neutral	even worse , they deposit was refunded only as store credit .
positive	don ' t get me wrong i do train very hard and also eat good balanced meals !
positive	you are an angel
neutral	other than that holiday is a fair price
neutral	luckily i do have a fb account or i '; d have been stuck .
negative	this was not advised by edreams at time of purchase of the ticket , nor in the e_- mail they sent out .
neutral	customer_service is good , they get back to you quite quickly , although they offered no apology for the lateness of the delivery even when i said i wasn ' t exactly happy .
negative	will never be shopping here again , and warning all my friends against them .
neutral	i sent the suit back and had to chase for the refund and communication was poor although i thankfully have been refunded .
negative	it sounded alright on the phone and asked to be emailed the details in writing so i could have a look and then decide .
negative	i think that ' s appauling customer_service .
neutral	i ordered a gopro from proviation however , due to lack of shipments from gopro i ultimately cancelled the order and requested a refund .
neutral	order came 0 mins early - everything there .
positive	i tried a number of different tyre_fitting web_sites and tyre_shopper always provided the largest and best value range of tyres .
positive	above all , the advice and service provided by jamie and his colleagues was the key to my wife and i being_able to choose the speakers best suited to our listening style .
neutral	i wouldn ' t use serenata_flowers again .
neutral	the introductory meat pack , 0kgs of tilapia , and 0 cartons of egg_whites .
positive	all the best for your future .
positive	thanks daniel , next year i am booking my honeymoon .
positive	have used hostelbookers in the past and stayed in some good quality hostels .
positive	very quick , efficient and reliable company , d
neutral	sorry for the mix_up .
neutral	prices are fair , i order a pair of cycling bib and went by their sizing chart but the fit was not accurate .
positive	i ordered over £_000 worth of new cooking utensils from procook for our new induction_hob but unfortunately one on the items was slightly damaged in transit .
neutral	be more clear next time .
negative	enough is enough !
negative	they replied later the next_day saying no one was home , so the parcel was left in the shed .
negative	!
positive	so i contacted parcl0go via there web chat and sarah amended the details and emailed a new label , also because yodel failed to pick_up a parcel the day before she changed the courier to tnt for pick_up today .
positive	brilliant as always , have been using parcel0go many_times within 0 years now .
negative	0000 came and went , no car .
negative	a delivery company telling_me that the dishwasher never arrived with them in the first place
neutral	i made up the porridge according to the pack instructions , and was surprised to find a hot milky drink with a few bits in !!
neutral	i wish i hadnt .
neutral	following my review , after a phone_call from the driver , he insisted that they had knocked and received no answer .
neutral	rinning customer_services proved useless but my issue was dealt_with once i emailed .
negative	spent nearly £_00 for the same day delivery option .
positive	i have used your services several_times when organising transfers for groups of 0 and 00 resepectively and we have been met by courteous and friendly drivers at the airport arrivals as we exit the customs so no hassle or stress searching for our transport while keeping the group together .
positive	i use it everywhere i go and it saves me a fortune over the year ( last_year over £_00 just over a weeks shopping ) sainsbury ' s has an easy layout of products allowing you to just pop in and grab or spend an_hour doing the weekly_shop , i do find i spend time wandering around the home section though spending more money than i needed to and buying items that i don ' t actually need , its very clever the way the layout is in sainsbury ' s !
positive	we '_ve never been in a villa where the cleaners have come in and changed towels so often .
negative	they lied and told me they had tried to contact me the day i placed the order .
negative	speedtester works ok , but when tweeting results , the url link to the results takes you to a page not found and the not results page .
positive	i have nothing but praise for this company !
positive	cheers
negative	getting home at 00 : 00 , i breathe a sigh of relief as the tracking_info stays the same , there ' s no card , so i sit_down to wait .
positive	really fast reliable from beginning to to end .
neutral	product quality was ok but fixing screws missing from one box so not checked before dispatch . luckily i had some plugs and screws that i could use but could have been most annoying if i had to go and buy some .
neutral	having been with this site for couple of years , when making a sale ( which is few and far between i might_add ), i am constantly informed after making a sale that the quality of the image is not good enough !
neutral	items generally turn_up when expected , sometimes a bit bashed though and their own delivery drives can be a bit moody .
positive	la la love these_guys , would diffidently order again and again .
negative	ordered two_pairs of shoes from boohoo totaling almost £_00 .
positive	how refreshing to find the transport waiting for us on arrival at kefalonia airport .
negative	this company is out of credibility .
negative	i am literally just ringing a landline .
neutral	she bought almost exclusively on design ( pattern ) rather_than functionality or price but we were pleasantly_surprised at the price of those she chose in the end .
negative	our house removal is still listed on shiply '_s website as succesful , but it was definitely not succesful for us
negative	called austrian airlines in the uk and got a call_centre in ukraine .
neutral	and their new website is ok .
positive	will be purchasing more to improve the look of the conservatory in the near_future , and would recommend to friends .
negative	overall value and service . abysmal .
negative	the 0 of us travelling to turkey had an awful experience with travelup .
neutral	this policy is not totally unreasonable but could be more considerate to customers .
negative	after a thorough search of the garden , bins , patio we could not find anything .
positive	our production units will be using these magnets .
positive	great stuff !
positive	0 * company :)
neutral	had qualified for a free gift , it was in my basket , however somehow lost it on checkout .
negative	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
neutral	i was pleased with the artwork and initially with the t shirts we had ordered .
negative	!
negative	come sunday and hiway calls again , " sorry sir , no delivery today as appliancesdirect didn_'_t actually send us your dishwasher , so it '_s not on the van ."
neutral	by this time it was too late to contact my husband who had the thursday booked as leave , a complete_waste of a day ’_s holiday .
positive	i have been using this website for over a year now , and i have saved over $_000 on my supplements !
positive	could have got slightly more for my 0 phones at other_sites but their feedback / reviews were very negative so i used mazuma .
negative	never again will i use this company they could have helped_me by ensuring my order was dispatched quickly with all the contact i have made but they just didn_'_t care !!!
neutral	i am however increasing my rating on the assumption that he is not a liar .
neutral	well firstly , this was meant to be a supprise , but the delivery failed as no access to the building , i questioned this , as the building is fully staffed from 0am - 0 :_00pm and had a reception with directions to deliver , i was told that the package was mis_- scanned and the driver came back and delivered the parcel within an_hour of my complaint .
negative	the staff were polite , but the best staff in the world can ' t save you from being chewed up and spat out by horrible business_practices .
positive	so i had to stay in hostel .
neutral	the game description says instant delivery of the key - not true .
positive	so far the experience has been great . the website is very helpful and informative yet convinient and i am fully_satisfied uptill now .
negative	!
negative	and self - righteous gobbledegook would have been fine .
negative	how dare they interfere with my brain .
positive	these_folks are on the ball - orders are filled quickly and shipping is super_fast .
positive	the driver was waiting for us at arrivals at dalaman with a name board .
positive	lovin the skirt .
negative	the flowers didn_'_t arrive .
positive	loved the emails made me laugh and the flowers were amazing as always
negative	get immediate_confirmation of order but then hear nothing .
positive	however when one tyre unexpectedly split after a couple of months their service was fantastic .
negative	they called me next_day to inform me that the product is out of stock and that they will receive new stock on monday .
positive	we ordered a comfort pocket 0000 memory mattress and are delighted with our choice .
neutral	very frustrating when website says in stock only for an_email to come later saying the product is actually on order .
positive	akram
positive	this is my first experience with quietpc and it has a been a very satisfactory one based on their delivery speed and the condition my order arrived in .
negative	this left me in a ridiculous situation because utility_warehouse doesn ’ t have an out of hours service and so i couldn ’ t reach anyone to arrange for the meter to be replaced .
neutral	besides ; me sending it back won ’ t be worth it as the item is £ 0 . 00 ( including tax ) and p_& p ( postage and packaging ) is near enough £ 0 . 00 and me sending it back would be about the same and you people probably won ' t refund return_postage so i ' ll be left with £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i then noticed the different name ( time talk ).
neutral	if you create a truthful and honest review about an experience you have had with an online supplier who use trustpilot and should you dare to publish a poor service , the retailer then objects if you give them a low score .
negative	no way would austrian refund the ticket .
negative	awful !!!
neutral	when we picked it we were under the impression it would be the normal windows .
neutral	the product supplied was a manufacturer '_s original replacement , and the price charged was competitive with other_suppliers .
neutral	low qualiy rubbish if it was their own_brand stuff especially tools
negative	i placed an order for a remedy for chickenpox .
positive	die buchung geht schnell , das system ist einfach zu durchschauen und bietet mir stets die günstigste verbindung an .
positive	a reliable online vet meds supplier that i have used before and will use again .
neutral	the sooner the govt reduces the vat threshold so that companies like play can '_t take_advantage of it the better .
positive	( or i have no self control lol ) staff are always friendly and helpful and seem to have gone_through a reasonable level of training .
positive	the only_downside to the evening was that in tiger_tiger they questioned us about the 0 complimentary bottles of champagne we were to receive and also about the payment at the end , they accused us of trying to walk out without paying so i had to keep showing them the email from hen_heaven proving that we were to get the bottles and that everything was paid for which was a little embarrassing but overall we had a great night .
negative	avoid if you want a hassle_free booking .
negative	they don_'_t have the courtesy to inform you if they can '_t fulfill an order .
neutral	anyhow , parcel got there on thursday which makes this a 0 day delivery in the holiday season and from northern_ireland which is actually better_than royal_mail ' s delivery times ( my 0 day deliveries from amazon show up after 0 days ) at this time of the year .
positive	ordered dishwasher also for family .
neutral	we booked through rentalcars . com as it was cheapest .
negative	but to whom and when ?.
negative	who do the judges think they are .
negative	seems like they just took my money and have no_intention of shipping anything .
neutral	they are good for games but not for pre ordering as you don ' t get the key in time which is frustrating for youtuber like me
positive	they didn ' t bitch about the other_companies and just gave us the best deal they could .
negative	i ' ve actually had a full blown argument with one of their self_employed couriers before after he threatened and swore at me on the phone .
neutral	so still_waiting for refund but kinda gave up now .
positive	grantham ford dealership have been brilliant .
positive	i ' ve never had an order arrive late , badly packaged or missing items .
positive	should have bought it ages_ago , it makes all the difference to the look of the caravan .
negative	will let you know what happens .
negative	they insist you should first approach the vendor through amazon , which i did .
negative	after agreeing to an installation date , bt phoned us and cancelled , rearranging a date for a week_later !
neutral	. no .
positive	the clothes are very attractive and there is a really big selection of styles .
neutral	delivery was great and on time by a good guy .
neutral	we paid for guest_list entry on the friday_night and found that we weren ' t on the list in some places which frustrated us and had an affect on the fun we were having that night .
neutral	interparcel should drop hermes as soon as possible before it tarnishes their reputation !
negative	best regards ,
negative	i have just had to suffer 00_hours without electricity due to utility_warehouse ’_s non - existent out of hours support .
neutral	whats disturbing here is it seemed that between the time i ordered the phone and when i followed up with an_email a week_later to see where it was that my order was in limbo .
positive	i purchased a nikon_d0000 ( with a battery and charger ) in so called ' mint -' condition , from mpb_photographic for £_000 . 00 , but was a bit_nervous as this was the first 0nd_hand item i had bought .
neutral	they replied and said they would look_into the issue .
negative	?
negative	£_00 headlamps too low £_00 to re set them .
negative	i told her how can she check people ' s id but she did not have her own .
negative	!
negative	he said that they no_longer accept returns as they cannot do anything with it and blamed it all on the network_provider !????
positive	plus having the tracking on my parcel made it easier .
positive	even the part number sticks in my head . ftd000 traditional pattern knob - i ended_up with 00 of the little tinkers and very happy i was too .
positive	probably the quickest delivery i '_ve ever had from any internet company .
positive	it ' s exactly_what every investor needs .
negative	never again will i use any halfords
positive	well earned .
negative	instead due to your lack of duty of care i had to suffer 00_hours with no electricity and significant discomfort , hardship and stress .
negative	and i also think the thousands of your customers that put you in the position you are in are made fully_aware that if their meter goes_wrong ( as mine did through no fault of mine ) that they will have to ensure it is between the hours of 0am and 0 . 00pm .
negative	this so obviously how they keep their profits up .
negative	then wait for your drinks .
negative	one other piece of advice is that while there are very few uk reviews for them , there are a lot of reviews from germany ( where they are based ) and generally the reviews are very poor .
negative	in the middle of all this , i was trying to tell them that this product wasn ' t described properly and that they should change it .
positive	prompt delivery as well .
positive	great service .
negative	i bought 0 silver necklaces for my daughters .
neutral	another time order accepted , no product arrived and on phoning them , they said my card_details were incorrect , even_though they stored them on their system from previous orders and i have used them again since .
neutral	printer was ordered at 00 : 00 on wednesday_morning , showed in stock and the money was taken straight_away so i hoped to get the stated " usually shipped same day if ordered before 00 : 00 " deal .
positive	i ordered a grade a phone for my dad .
negative	did not want to accept_responsibility or have returned for repair .
negative	i wish i ' d of paid the extra £_00 with amazon now .
negative	after_reading complaints here and on cpw '_s own website i am not even going to bother pursuing this complaint with this bunch of incompetent untrained , couldn_'_t care_less idiots .
positive	excellent service .
negative	this is really unacceptable and unprofessional !
neutral	overall , a complicated experience but viagogo has taken the right decision refunding me and i appreciate it .
neutral	( oops , i think that was a complaint !)
negative	no one had been in touch by phone or email at that point .
neutral	the agent was very helpful .
neutral	the account management tool on the website is very poor and i was forced to create a new account again to place the order .
negative	i ordered a bed 0 - 0 delivery no actual date specified waited in and it didn_'_t arrive , emailed , no response .
negative	will be using mazuma next time .
positive	helpful pre_- sales technical info by phone .
negative	i got a nokia lumnia with vodafone in may 0000 .
neutral	at 0 . 00 , after being on hold she finally manage to get thru to the depot and came up with a ridiculous story saying the driver had gone to the wrong_address and the person at that address had said they ' d already got their item .
positive	000000
positive	my item arrived very quickly and i was kept_informed with email_updates along the way .
negative	stay_away !
negative	this was the final_straw .
neutral	buy same product from my local pizza house for a third of the price
negative	stay_away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
positive	easy to order and received within a week .
positive	great prices , excellent delivery times , love being sble to choose time and date to suit me .
neutral	the look and the feel of the 0 items that i ' ve purchased felt cheap .
positive	no_problems at all .
positive	om carriers were friendly , reliable , helpful , professional and could not do enough .
neutral	).
negative	took so long to resolve as plusnet admitted they raised an incorrect fault as they didn ' t know what else to do !
positive	the truth is that service makes any good deal all the sweeter and mr big tops are no exception .
positive	sammie was very helpful and handled my problem with ease .
negative	after trying to make a complaint i was told it was my computer .
negative	from the very rude person in an orange shop to being told that my problem will be sorted_out , what they didn_'_t say was ' when they will be bothered to help resolve this problem '.
negative	distressed , i used the order tracker online to track my order and was told that the details i had used were flagged up in the system and needed further verification .
neutral	some stuffs can be really cheap
positive	unlocked my at & t iphone 0 version 0 . 0 . 0 modem firmware 00 . 00 . 00 .
positive	suntransfers were waiting for us as we walked through the airport to take us to our hotel , they text the day before our departure to confirm our return pickup and arrived 0 minutes ahead of schedule .
negative	i spent 0 hours this morning trying to file a complaint and was told there were no managers i could speak to , however after getting rather angry with the caller , she suddenly said that there was a manager i could speak to .
positive	uk_pianos offered a rate at par with internet and other stores in london but also included 0 years warranty and a decent stool in the package .
negative	currently , my consignment has this status 00 oct 0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 0 :_00pm to 0 :_00pm .

positive	i ordered 0 gifts yesterday , and received them today .
positive	i wanted to trade - in the game , rayman legends for wii_u . cex had the best trade - in price for cash , so i signed_up and went through the process .
positive	i ' m very satisfied with the ordering system , easy and fast !
negative	avoid at all costs !!!!!
negative	i phoned and emailed them regarding this but they insist the tickets are of the same value , even_though if you try to book on their website the block i have now been allocated is £_00 . 00 cheaper_than what i originally paid !
positive	and they always have the best value .
positive	stu white
neutral	disappointingly 0 months after treatment i have suffered some regression and will have to have the procedure repeated as i now require glasses again for driving .
neutral	i ordered home mobile_broadband with the 00day rolling_contract but the process was far from smooth .
positive	would definitely recommend easygates to friends !
positive	have used mazuma previously and can only say good things about their seamless service - many_thanks .
positive	excellent company fast cheap delivery and when i needed to return an item this was dealt_with very efficiently .
positive	i contacted specky to ask if they could send me a nose pad and screw .
negative	the parcel was packed and awaiting_collection and my daughter waited in all day .
neutral	the longspan bench is a new item , and there are as yet no assembly_instructions for it ; but i was sent instructions for bulk longspan racking , which was close enough .
negative	i think they are now trading on that reputation and joining the band wagon of rising supermarket prices which are catching people out because we seem to just accept that prices have gone up everywhere .
positive	got a cheap last_minute deal with these people .
positive	envirofone were incredibly efficient with regard to sending me my packaging along with sending me the money for my old phone .
negative	they said they would unlock it for a charge of £_00 . 00 which i reluctantly agreed .
neutral	after paying £ 0 . 00 for " express delivery ", i assumed i would be receiving the tickets by this friday at the latest .
negative	when a parcel is lost there is limited help and phone number is a premium_rate number .
positive	!
negative	halfords in slough mill street
negative	its such a shame that a relatively reliable company should be let_down by the antics of cartrawler and its car_hire partners .
neutral	i wanted to know why but parcelhero ’_s customer service lines had closed .
positive	i have always wanted a proper tuxedo and now feel with your prices it is within my reach .
neutral	i am due to go on holiday in july and thought this would be great for some cheap and cheerful clothes , how wrong was i ?
negative	i have written to them and phoned them , but i get nowhere .
neutral	the seats on the plains sometimes smell .
negative	for starters the food is usually mispriced .
negative	i have used them a great deal in the past but now a parcel is lost when i need their help they just are not interested in contacting you with updates .
positive	the scan feature was brilliant and recommended exactly the items i needed .
neutral	this company must be cheap , the only reason any one uses them had a washer deliverd by them arrived damaged , pointed_out damage to delivery driver he said you can unpack it and use it .
negative	as it states on their website that you have two_weeks to collect ( if delivered by royal_mail ).
negative	we have suibmmitted a request for advice on this issue and are still in talks to resolve it .
neutral	i used to love vodafone as a network and think no one compared , however , since they released ' sure signal ' they seem to have lessened the signal_strength .
neutral	for cd ’_s , dvd ’_s & games , as long as there is a barcode , the disks are all there and the album artwork is perfect mm will accept and pay .
negative	be careful with that company .
neutral	the next e_- mail i received was completely unexpected , it was telling_me that , even_though the product was listed on the site , even_though they ' d let me place my order , even_though there was no indication that the product was out of stock , it was in fact , out of stock .
positive	i wasn ' t the organiser of our group but from my point of view everything went very well and i had a class time , so no_complaints from me .
negative	world whether bought in store or on line , don_'_t , don_'_t , don_'_t , if you value you sanity
negative	have bought a couple of hotel breaks , when i have tried to book them , there have not been any suitable dates ( if any ) left .
neutral	we tried every other number that funnily_enough stopped_working , even_though it was fine the day before when we used it to confirm our pickup times .
negative	!
positive	she advised the hotel it was our_honeymoon and also my husbands_00th_birthday and we had a bottle of champagne chilling in our room when we arrived .
positive	i must_admit i was slightly skeptical ordering from digitalrev , especially because i had never_heard of this site but went_ahead with the purchase of my hs00exr fujifilm camera based on excellent reviews i had read about their services - i was not disappointed !
positive	web_site clear and precise .
neutral	to add to my review , i '_ve just received my cooker at the time specified and by the most helpful driver you could want .
negative	thank_you .
positive	every time i wear an item i '_ve purchased online from jules_b i get so many comments .
positive	would highly_recommend this company and use it again in the future .
negative	so we contacted the company from which we bought the item .
positive	as far as issues with orders or products , this is where they shine .
positive	tested the batteries and found them to be fresh and fully_charged .
positive	i decided to use mazumamobile based on the great reputation they have for customer_service and i wasn ' t dissapointed !
negative	i can '_t be helping you pc not working , i said again . look i work in customer service if i write things down that are confidential it can be shredded . why can you not write something , do you have a pen , i can '_t be answering that question . end of call arrrghhh . call 00 . 00am this morning and talk_talk like i said on the phone i am busy have things to do , if i have to call you again i will charge my admin_fee of £_00 . 00 per call
neutral	so i ' m still_waiting for resolution of my problem till tomorrow , then i ' m going to contact viagogo management directly .
neutral	i got a message on a web_page ( i don_'_t know how i ended_up on that page ) to say there was a problem with my account and gave an 0000 number to ring .
neutral	i got mildly suspicious about the speed of delivery of the second ( free order ), this time arriving the very next_day of the purchase , despite the customer care team told me they didn ' t have one of the product on the stock , and therefor i would have to wait 0 additional days .
neutral	my local_store hardly has anything i need , and even when they do its overpriced .
negative	no one to talk to at cheaptickets .
positive	excellent service
neutral	i really am not impressed with this experience , and will almost certainly use a local supplier from now on .
negative	i am far from happy with littlewoods way of handling this fraudulet event .
neutral	i hope it is not usual .
positive	may soon be ordering again .
negative	no replies whatsoever from wowcher and the saloon ( exquisite hair and beauty ) say that wowcher needs to refund me .
negative	the star_rating system does not allow for that distinction .
neutral	booked a webmaster package for £_00 to help set_up and run my own business .

neutral	recently_purchased a charging dock and a car dock for a samsung_galaxy_s0 , the price was very competative .
positive	bought a new filter but a part was broken in transit .
negative	after a complaint about the 0 missing gifts fancy . com stated that the ' revised ' delivery date for the two gifts was 00th of january .
negative	some of the staff seem quite rude ( both checkout and the shelf stackers ); i '_ve lost_count how many_times i '_ve been given dirty looks ( whilst minding my own business ), and being stared at .
negative	0 years with the same router and only now do they tell me this might be the issue !
neutral	it took two_weeks to get money back to be able to order again .
neutral	( slow delivery though )
negative	so i decided to give him the cash and call dhl office that i paid him in cash and i need a refund for the card transaction i did few hours before he arrived .
positive	i ordered twice , and both_times the products arrived the next_day , which is remarkable given the small postage charge .
negative	no way !!
negative	we went for a sight seeing weekend with our two children .
neutral	it should be automatically refunded if the items don_'_t arrive on time , there is nothing to think about .
neutral	the paintballing was outdoor rather_than indoor with 00_euros extra costs each for an overall and enough paintballs to last everyone the games .
neutral	it goes well .
positive	will_definitely use again :-)
neutral	( i had only requested standard delivery ) i am giving tackleuk the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they were going on information from the manufacturer and that the the delays and missinformation originated with the manufacturer , although i do not know that for a fact and may be being unfair to the manufacturer .
negative	don_'_t !!!!!
negative	i ordered a necklace for my granddaughters bday .
neutral	i can not understand how it seems to take so long for the tickets to be dispatched .
positive	perfect site !
neutral	they delivered my order to an entirely random address where i don ' t live .
negative	i even got an_email from my retailer confirming today '_s date .
neutral	many of the reviews are written in different languages and there is no translation facility - this is frustrating as you have to copy and paste into google translate .
positive	never had a problem with supplement_warehouse !
neutral	also prepare yourself to count to 00 each time you ' re asked the most basic of questions about things you " could try " to resolve it .
negative	hello ,
positive	there was 00 of us and we stayed in two gorgeous apartments in central edinburgh , these had everything we needed and were very secure and were large enough to accommodate hen_night games etc .
neutral	i should start by saying that the laptop i ordered , was itself fantastic and in perfect working order .
neutral	i love the speed in which you can order things from next .
positive	!
negative	obviously they must have that many annoyed customers on call .
positive	the email me to tell me what stage they are up to with the order and it is easy to pay .
neutral	the guitar didnt arrive next_day .
neutral	the mainly pictorial instructions were abysmal .
negative	i find it unbelievable that there isn ’ t an_emergency contact point within utility_warehouse when something like this happens – the fitter who was eventually sent to replace the meter yesterday lunchtime said that he was available and on call the night before as lowie beck were aware of the situation with the substation fire .
negative	this company is rubbish .
negative	bitterly disapointed .
neutral	i have noticed that yodel are no_longer an option with interparcel so it seems that they must of had a lot of complaints for interparcel not to be using them any more which is a good thing .
positive	everything was organised , even the appointment for the photographer to come and take my pictures .
neutral	this was resolved quickly but i felt as if i was being difficult in what i was requesting .
positive	very happy to recommend hifi gear to anyone who will listen !
positive	the product was so carefully_wrapped as to avoid any damage .
neutral	customer_service was okay however they agreed to give me a money off code because of the issue yet i never received this until i had to email them once again asking for it .
neutral	in this day and age with technology the way it is . it really is unacceptable to make people wait all day for a delivery .
positive	very easy ti use and very fast payment !
positive	ordering through the website is easy and updates on progress of each order are recieved regularly .
neutral	that '_s my guess anyway .
negative	reluctantly i persuaded him to call the card people , and after what seemed like a lifetime they eventually spoke to me , asked me a few security questions and authorised the payment .
negative	i am still_waiting .
negative	i as the bidder was suspended .
neutral	on the one hand , they have all the bike parts i ' ll ever need and the staff are always helpful and willing to part with a little advice on bike maintenance .
positive	we had a couple of doors missing .
neutral	the team behind e_- careers were helpful and accessible at all times by chat and e_- mail .
positive	was looking for a chiminea to finish our new pagoda patio off , but it needed to fit in with the stone benches & circle , so started looking via_google .
positive	not the best price for my phone , but reliable & quick .
positive	not having a clue about domains and servers etc , petru was a fantastic help to me , and was able to sort this as i couldnt with any instructions as i have no knowledge , you have a great team and i have been using 000 reg for almost a year now and i have never had any_problems so thank_you
negative	i understand they are an internet company with lots of orders but there will be so many unhappy ladies today if their flowers were sent out monday and arrived in this state aswell !
positive	the other thing is that the site is simple to use and you don_'_t get bombarded with adds and heaps of other off putting info when you ' re trying to stay focused on just getting what you typed in to get !
positive	excellent service .
negative	this is a present for my wife .
neutral	minor niggle is that i only placed the order because the website said it was in stock .
negative	keep away if you value your watch .
neutral	i had to delete one bad review towards aliexpress , because they refunded my monies to my account .
negative	addressed this immediately on my return with both expedia and the car_hire company appointed both would not accept the facts given and took months to even get that far ; with frequent opening and closing of my complaint / s procedure which in itself is set_up to buy them more time to make it look like the targets on addressing complaints has_been achieved .
neutral	long waiting times despite nearly empty schedules and the work is too often of questionable quality .
positive	is the easiest and fastest way to shop
neutral	i think that viagogo could find the reason of the problem when contacting with paypal , but didn ' t .
negative	i have left orange after 00 years as a customer .
negative	then i got a email from leslie grant asking to email her a photo copy of the card i used to order the goods , a utility_bill , my driving_licence , and my passport .
neutral	my friends are staggered that i pay over £_00 pm and only receive free texts and my handset isn ' t all that either ( which i ' m stuck with for 00 mths !
negative	two_weeks_later get email_telling_me my fitting date was 00thfeb .
neutral	i purchased a few products one which was a fake tan mit and i did not realise it was only a face one as it didnt state it clearly and it was around 0 / 0 pounds and they are only € 0 to buy in shops for the big ones , i wasn ' t happy with thatc
negative	- good for their cashflow .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	i would also like to point out in this review that i have a disabled relative who also uses sainsbury ' s in a number of stores across the country ( mainly as i live in essex and she is in shropshire ) we have never had an issue borrowing any form of wheelchair or acquiring goods from the top shelf at any of the 0 stores we regularly use , they also have ramps for the cash machines and a lower machine for wheelchair access .
negative	after the last card i contacted yodel to explain what had happened and they said i could pick it up from the local_depot .
positive	!
neutral	the price is good .
negative	the website has a tracking facility which at present is telling_me that my item hasn ' t left the depot yet , but is also saying that my delivery was signed for at 0am this morning .
positive	i ' m yet to have anything break en_route .
positive	cant_fault paddocks but i would like to see less britpart products .
neutral	now up and running we have now come to the disappointment of the windows we paid for being an online server ?
neutral	update
negative	if you order something online and know that this company will be the courier , i urge you do not place the order !
neutral	i don ' t even know where my nearest store is anymore
positive	thank_you parcel 0 go .
positive	it is very obvious the supplement_warehouse strives to offer you the best price for supreme products because of the amazing feature they have which is comparing a competitor ' s price and if a competitor ' s price is lower , supplement_warehouse will automatically make it less_than that lowest_price .
positive	i collected yesterday and was amazed at the condition of the 00 year_old watch .
neutral	we had paid extra for a bigger car because there were 0 of us and 0 cases to go in the boot .
positive	i would definitely recommend this company to family and friends . so thank_you mr peter_chandler i couldn_'_t fault your courier service mrs l woodhouse . wigan .
negative	after numerous_emails i was able to get an authorisation number and return the pair of glasses that i did receive .
neutral	currys , you need to improve .
neutral	the same accessories are much much cheaper elsewhere .
negative	we ended_up hiring a van and doing the job ourselves , but shiply will not refund our money .
neutral	recently went in to comet to purchase a new washing_machine .
neutral	fridges etc )
neutral	we made the call and where told between 00 . 00 am and 0 . 00pm , with the driver calling half an_hour before delivery .
neutral	0st lie : the email to say the tickets had been sent came a few hours after i said i had no interest in them and was promised to be call back
neutral	very informated to us
negative	there are companies out there who are a pleasure to deal with and deliver what they say they will .
neutral	i ' m not sure of the legality of changing an aircraft '_s configuration after selling extra_legroom which now doesn_'_t exist but as far as i ' m concerned it '_s an_absolute disgrace .
positive	these_guys do the opening and identifying for you , so you know what exactly_what you ' re paying for , instead of dishing wads of cash on blind boxes in an vain attempt to finish your collection ( not speaking from personal experience -- honest !).
negative	who don ' t even have a contact number just a pre_- recorded_message which just irritates me even more !
negative	myhermes said " our courier posted the packet through your letterbox ."
negative	!
negative	told by sam not to relabel as citylink would do it .
negative	i received an_email from them on the 00st oct just at 00 : 00 saying they ' ve dispatched my goods , but it didn ' t mention which courier .
neutral	i ' m a little disappointed to be honest , but , my mother was very happy .
neutral	hey , he even recommended the £_00 one over the £_00 one , i ' ve gained a lot of trust for my local maplin now .
positive	will always continue to use reshmee to book our away holidays and will always recommend to friends and family !
positive	i like them so much .
neutral	very well_packaged and ready for me to use straight_away .
positive	huge_range of shower parts & seals easily identified by through sensible online categories , close - up photos and detailed diagrams . often with measurements which are invaluable for identifying parts for my handyman business .
neutral	i e_- mailed them at their new and their old addresses , not expecting a response .
positive	more than happy with chocolates now .
negative	yhey are one company that i will never use again .
negative	i arrived at home just after 00 . 00 .
neutral	but up until recently i have had no_problems with their service with parcels arrived as intended on time with no damages .
negative	as someone commented earlier avoid_avoid_avoid at all costs .
positive	with no time to run out and buy flowers and worry_about getting parked etc this was a godsend .
positive	just had a great customer experience with emily via chat .
neutral	well on arrival to destination waited for 0 / 0 hour for pick_up . the fiteen minute journey we were told took nearly 0 / 0 hour . on return arrived at pick_up point for time they asked . bus was 00_minutes late . driver missed one client and had to do a return to pick_up point . from there almost at airport when driver apologised and returned to resort and did a further 0 or 0 pick_up before eventually heading bak to airport . as you can imagine was not very pleased . may think again about using resort_hoppa .
positive	she is delighted with the appearance & quality of the product .
negative	), i find it astonishing that my boyfriend was told all he would get refunded was the delivery charge of about £ 0 . 00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i had been home all day !
positive	the garage gave excellent advice , and without prompting , ordered new wheel_nuts for me , and without_any fuss , rescheduled my appointment for 0 days_later .
positive	the site itself has got really wide_range of clothes , definitely should be able to find the brand you like and it ' s got a mint sale section , well worth a browse around , you ' ll find something you like easy .
positive	so lets get busy and start using it
positive	shopping on line is easy once you ' ve done your first order .
negative	we are both disabled and cant lug bags and bags of washing to a launderette .
positive	catherine_corless is a very kind and efficient member of your staff , i highly_recomend this service to anyone .
neutral	this was , however , stated beforehand , but people need to be very aware of this when buying the course out of own pockets .
negative	is the company still trading ?
neutral	0 ) many items such as older games and action figures are out of stock all the time .
positive	there are always a few hiccups , but it seems to me int keys has their stuff together .
negative	no contact telephone_number for customer_services listed and when you do call asking for legal department , management or cheif executives office you get nothing only someone will be in touch and a point_blank refusal to help !
positive	they did not try to sell any tyres , but told us the truth .
negative	this company is a complete scam , the office address they are using to claim they have a uk office is infact my property .
positive	i ' m very happy and will buy from them again .
negative	this company and there dodgy third_party companies have cost me a further £_000 in repair costs not to mention £_000 on a new painting for my parents wedding_anniversary .
negative	not only did it take more_than several phone_calls and emails to alpharooms to actually establish our travelling vouchers and baggage_allowance ( we were told two bags for the hold and then just one , then two again .) encountering a range of ' customer sales representatives ( 0 out of 0 were english ), the rest were foreign who could barely understand , nor speak_english fluently themselves ( great idea for customer_service placements ).
neutral	finally , on the 00th of april , it said my order had been shipped and gave me a tracking_number with a courier company called aramex .
neutral	whilst not a big deal it was annoying .
negative	impressed ?
negative	buyers pay none .
neutral	like most people i work for a living and the courier will only deliver mon - fri free of charge , if you want delivery on a saturday it is apparently £ 0 extra which would negate the saving i make on my pets food .
negative	the staff are horrible and don ' t give a damn about you .
neutral	we are planning to leave for the event on thursday but when should we actually expect the tickets ?
neutral	i found that i couldn ' t save items to my basket which was so annoying when i wanted to order something later , also i believe they don ' t have a paypal option which causes hassle and made me feel unsafe .
positive	i find amazon have an excellent variety and range of products plus prices are generally cheap .
negative	i ordered the big_boy xxl beanbag , via groupon , 0 weeks before_christmas ; waited 0 weeks for it to arrive and it never did so i logon to the website and the delivery date was very vague : week 00 , which to me means the week before_christmas .
positive	product quality is over my expectation as well !
positive	order number_000000000
neutral	i have used this site so many time for the information about latest fashion products i have also buy so many items from this site , and our product is really awesome .
negative	very unsure these will last very long .
neutral	the service was efficient and quick .
neutral	i find preloved easy to use , with a nice format .
negative	maybe knock a little louder as i was 00ft from the door and a card appears i didnt hear ?.
neutral	the prices are not wonderfully competative so its worth seeking price matches if possible although their vat free events make prices far more desirable .
positive	customer_services were brilliant helping me find the right one and i will most definitely be going back there for any further bags !
neutral	it is essentially a 0d jigsaw puzzle which has to be built piece by piece from good quality mdf ( heavy ), sponge and fabric ; the last items to be fitted are the arms ( which are pre_- constructed ) so it is not possible , as with most sofas , to lift it by the arms to move it .
negative	it ' s honestly not worth it .
negative	ebay delivers from china in 0 days !
negative	i bought a samsung_galaxy 0 through amazon_marketplace at end february_0000 .
negative	the funny thing is the original price i bought it for was £_00 right , i checked before i drove to the store , as i left the store i checked again to compare it ' s price to the one off amazon .
neutral	just allow a few extra days for delivery and hope that you ordered a good flavour :)
neutral	what was i supposed to do ?
neutral	it didn_'_t take long to assemble the 00ft trampolin the main problem was keeping the legs up .
neutral	now thinking cashgenie will still try and take the repayment even_though i didn ' t recieve the loan .
negative	i ' ll throw it trash can because i buy same one at *********.
neutral	when booking a hotel for several days it would be useful to see the daily as well as the total price .
neutral	the only one and huge problem is the product itself .
negative	they ended_up pretty_much ruining two holidays , don ' t make the same mistake we did !
positive	i purchased a memory_foam mattress for my teenage_son from the ebay shop maintained by memory_foam warehouse .
neutral	it '_s a shame as i keep seeing links to gear on their site at very tempting prices .
negative	please contact our customer_services .
positive	i '_ve been using this site for a few_years and they ' re always reliable .
neutral	he could not explain_why if that was the case , there was no note left through the door .
positive	just as if i ' d had the thought about it , and then the products magically arrived .
negative	the price was reasonable , the ratings were high and they were my dream pair .
negative	we rang an_emergency number for gullivers but they were pretty unhelpful and refused to speak to my boyfriend who made the booking .
negative	i cannot do that i am not allowed to , i said ok let me speak to your supervisor , i can only do that if there is a problem .
positive	fortunately after_reading quite a lot of reviews on trustpilot , i decided to take the plunge and purchased a bf0_premium cd_key .
neutral	than i contacted viagogo again several_times , via_email and via phone and every time answer was " there ' s some issue , will try to find out what ' s the problem ".
negative	i have absolutely no confidence this will arrive and my girlfriend has resigned herself to waiting in all day because we cannot trust this company .
negative	buyer_beware
negative	first attempt in my view ) so we shall see .
neutral	the real bugbear though is when you have a problem with the line , all starts off well and i can imagine that if they get it sorted first time the process would be pretty slick , the difficulties arise when the problem does not get fixed first time around .
neutral	different departments .
neutral	no emails - so i called .
negative	after saying they haven ' t received my phone for 0 days ( when intact the tracker showed they had ) i contacted them and amazingly the next_day they had not only received the phone , but had tested it and found it was damaged .
positive	the latest dell precision was needed very urgently and despite the pc only coming into stock in the afternoon , it was shipped that night so that i could have it ready for my new employee the nex day .
neutral	everything was confirmed , we had the pickup time of 00 . 00 .
positive	probikeshop is a good market !
positive	i ordered some memory for my laptop because i was a bit_slow but now wow and it was very fast delivery , so happy .
neutral	shopto are great for fast delivery ( usually next_day if you order before 0 . 00pm ), however their prices are getting worse imo .
positive	once you ' ve found the product you desire you simply checkout and pay .
positive	and the product came in mint_condition < 0 super excited and happy with my expierience .
positive	we were further impressed by the offer of a £_00 discount to remove our old mattress .
positive	the products i ' ve ordered is good quality and exactly_what i was looking for .
neutral	however on asking for a refund so as to hire elsewhere they said it was rentalcars who had his money , not them . so he asked rentalcars for a refund and they refused . after a tense conversation with a manager there my friend managed to get £_00 . 00 back . money for old rope and a nasty rip_off , so beware good rental prices but , with a nasty sting in the tail !!
negative	i then tried the tracking_number which told me the parcel which was still in my hall awaiting_collection had been delivered to glasgow !
negative	the customer_service is non - existent .
positive	and probably some instruments too when i need them !
neutral	phonenumber did not work from of the netherlands .
positive	i would recommend abraham because he provided a really good service from the beginning to the end .
positive	originally when i put my options into the boxes at the beginning i went all out to see what the prices would end up at , it was a little expensive but after_speaking with mike agar (??)
negative	after all of these ups and downs with this package the absolute worse thing was that the switch was broken on delivery so totally un - switchable !
positive	deliveries come fast , returns and refunds are handled without_fuss .
positive	having great fun .
neutral	food wine and electrical bargains brilliant and cheap cheap cheap but they buck pass if a fault develops , so a bit iffy for computers , cameras etc , might need to regard as a write off if they go_wrong .
positive	brilliant seo company , higly recommend .
positive	extremely knowledgeable and knew_exactly_what we would be looking for .
neutral	i '_ve since attempted to get a re - scheduled collection date and hopefully things will go well but my first impression of music_magpie isn_'_t very good .
positive	i love how easy to use the site is .
negative	received a card from moon pig the other day and thought to myself how impersonal it is having a typed message .
neutral	been buying online games for years from many websites then came_across this website the other day and bought a few games , received codes in minutes and was a great service .
negative	if you order from this company you will know that you are not permitted to inspect your goods on delivery .
negative	we were meant to have free competitive companies but this company have successfully killed of the opposition .
positive	if your thinking of buying a new helmet , don_'_t bother looking at anything_else .
positive	it is a very simple and easy process and i would recommend parcels0go to everyone .
positive	in 0 days sharon had uncovered dozens of errors , and edited the documents for us giving a list of all the changes she had made .
positive	thank_you so much sky tour !
positive	i ordered this product for a friend who hates shopping online .
positive	i found that they lived_up to their promises and delivered excellent results .
negative	i ordered a switch actuator for a kenwood kettle on 00th_feb_0000 and it promptly arrived a mere 0 months later on the 00th of august_0000 !
negative	buying any product that takes 00 days for delivery without prior warning is unacceptable but at christmas its is just outright bad customer_service .
neutral	the site itself is substandard and shows results for totally random items .
positive	keep rebeling gals !
negative	by contrast , dpd have been keeping me appraised of another delivery of audio_equipment i ordered through amazon , just like they always do , and should be arriving today between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , and i am sure they will - they usually call me 00_minutes before they are popping round .
neutral	oh fantastic .
neutral	i have been using shop - to . net for over 0 - 0 years now and have a great knowledge understanding on how they work .
neutral	what if i had not had such evidence , and yet still would have paid nonetheless ?
neutral	the first time they were going to send me a copy for free .
neutral	some allow blatantly sexual banter while one female host in particular drags people off chat for the slightest reason , particularly where she does not agree with their jokes !
negative	the latest one has just arrived , for £_000 !
neutral	very dissapointing when you pay for something and you get it three_months later due to being out of stock .
negative	change the format before you kill simon cowels golden goose .
positive	!
positive	there is an obvious and simple way to get around this though .
positive	great service , great prices , would highly_recommend !
positive	will use again for future events .
positive	my delivery came as expected in a special insulated box with ice packs .
negative	this uncaring , shabby , third rate , pathetic excuse for a delivery company don_'_t want to hear from their victims .
positive	i have to sat the slot games are big strength of kerching - there are obvious titles like ghostbusters and da vinci diamonds but lots of others to enjoy too and i have had some good wins to boot !
neutral	but over all not to bad .
positive	after trying to find this type of light on other_sites , this site , easy to find , easy to sort , local people which was a benefit , but ordered and delivered , love the lights , very happy indeed x very well_packed - went to different supplier in n / cle - much more_expensive even_though they promised to price match - happy with my lights from this supplier .
positive	engraving seems a little_steep compared to pen cost , but it is so worth it .
neutral	collect_+ tracking shows up the delays built into the mm system .
negative	signed_up with talk_talk over the internet for broadband and telephone on the 00 august and paid £_000 . 00 line_rental up front by debit_card .
positive	i was telephoned to explain that my first order had to be directed to my credit_card address , which was not great for me but it is a policy for first orders so i was happy to respect that .
neutral	we try and avoid them from now on .
positive	a brilliant company , a pleasure to do_business with , knowledgeable_staff and super_fast delivery / service
neutral	i wish she didn ’ t repeat it so often because before this conversation i had no_intention of writing this review .
negative	likewise the take away told me to take the matter up with just eat .
neutral	!
negative	paid my money , got my voucher , uploaded the photo and feel i got stung on the pp , but a month later , no goods .
neutral	autoglass really messed me around with the booking to fit a replacement screen after they were unable to repair my windscreen ( a small " star " crack in my windscreen caused by a stone ).
positive	i bought an iphone repair then realised due to repair time would not be able to send package due to holiday .
positive	definitely shopping here again !
neutral	my last order was about the sixth pallet of tiles i have had from this company .
neutral	turned engine off , definate knock .
positive	thank_you margaret for your expert_advice and friendly service .

negative	at the last_minute my wife decided to work from home on valetines and of course i had arranged for the flowers to be delivered to her office .
neutral	the manager at the local maplin is unknowledgable and rude .
positive	great , customer service !
negative	i never received a confirmation_email , and when i contacted ramada to check on my booking , i was told that there was no booking in my name .
negative	its awful !
neutral	i would use again but maybe not use the same garage for fitting .
neutral	oh , and care less what your peers think .
negative	still_waiting for a solution from them !
negative	when i opened the package i found out they forgot to send the diffuser and the flash still had the same problem .
positive	there are a number of companies i have dealt_with in the past who would have been put to shame by such welcome and responsive customer_services offered by procook .
positive	fully deserving of 0 star_rating .
positive	the quality of the products is the highest you will find .
negative	he tried to put the card_details through but it didn ’ t seem to work .

negative	please send it back , i '_ve already wasted £_00 on a contract i haven_'_t been able to use .
negative	my first impression was already one of distrust but it was the only place i could find with a saturday slot for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	despite the shortage of time to decorate the room in readiness for the installation , we complied and were ready for the fitter , lee falconer to commence work when he arrived at 0am .
