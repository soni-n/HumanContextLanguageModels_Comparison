negative	i ordered two pieces for a halloween party in sept . 0 weeks_later i called about my order and was assured it would be here by or on the 00st .
negative	with halloween being on a monday i explained that the costume was for parties and not trick or treating and i ordered early enough not to have to worry .
negative	i was told one piece was on back order and would be sent out as soon as it came in .
negative	one week before halloween , i emailed ami that i no_longer wanted the order .
negative	0 days_later they replied that i piece was shipped and the other piece was refunded .
negative	when i received the one piece in the mail ( on the 00st ) it was nothing like the picture .
negative	so i used their return_label and sent it back to them .
negative	in mid nov .
negative	i got it back with a standard form as to why they would not except the return .
negative	the form had several reasons listed , but none were checked .
negative	instead they hand wrote at the bottom that i didn_'_t have some sort of return # that is required ???
negative	after several emails and 0 phone_calls i finally spoke with a manager .
negative	just to be blown off and told i was not getting my money back .
negative	thats when i disputed the charge with my credit_card .
negative	after explaining everything to my credit_card company .
negative	they agreed to dispute the charge .
negative	mid dec . the charge was returned to my account and the dispute was finalized , or so i thought .
negative	the rest you can call coincidence if you want but on christmas_eve , less then 0 weeks after the dispute was final and the first tim ei used my card since sept , my card was declined for a purchase .
negative	when i called they told my there were some questionable online charges that same day that were not mine , so they voided my card and are sending me a new card with a new number .
negative	since i rarely use that card it was easy to who might have had access to my information .
negative	of course i can '_t prove who did it and the attempted charges totaled less then 00 dollars , it seems like a feeble attempt done just to mess with me .
negative	i am also very confident that this review will get a response from ami a lot faster then any of my complaints that went directly to them .
negative	i place my first order on sunday , 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	today is wednesday , 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	only now do they decide to ship my order out to me !
negative	the time it will take to ship my order via ' smartpost ' still remains to be seen so , this is still an undecided total failure to me .
negative	all in all , a very dissatisfactory transaction for me .
negative	i suppose that i '_ve been completely spoiled by ' amazon prime '_s ' efficient shipping methods .
negative	' nuff said .
negative	beware .
negative	i booked one room at a great rate but was only allowed to book one at a time .
negative	i needed two rooms for my family , but when i immediately went back for the second , the same room had gone up 00 %!
negative	well the only thing good about this company so_far was there fast service getting the part to me .
negative	yes !
negative	the wrong part and they have no way to get hold of them only to fill_out a slip which they say they will get back to you .
negative	there 0 - 000 free number gives you three choices , but a voice comes on saying there phone_calls are so full they can '_t get back to you .
negative	if you call there regular number some guy named buster answers saying he is away from his desk to leave message , but then you find out that his message service is full , so i went to my bank and we are doing this the legal way , and they have so many days to get my refund to me or have legal actions take agaisnt them .
negative	if you go online and read the reviews about this company there is no good reviews in there favor , so until i get my refund from them this company sucks !
negative	no phone_number , complaint made via_email , received a reply but didn_'_t address the complaint at all , poor quality merchandise , am one step away from reporting this company to trading_standards , will never use again !
negative	horrible company !!!!!
negative	holding my bank acct hostage !
negative	had to finally file a fraud complaint with my bank .
negative	do not do business with this company .
negative	absolutely the worst .
negative	unless you consider " fast " 0 weeks +.. also , the repair job was terrible .
negative	i had two arms replaced on a pair of chanel frames .
negative	when the estimate came through about the repair they asked if i wanted new reading lenses put in .
negative	i chose the lenses and paid for the amount and was told they would be mailed out quickly .
negative	when i finally received them the two arms were attached differently and were " floppy " - cheap workmanship , and there were no lenses that i had paid for , and they charged me $_00 shipping .
negative	the online_chat person arial was unhelpful and would not let me speak with a manager .
negative	a wholly awful experience after waiting almost 0 weeks .
negative	i called amex and disputed the charge and they found in my favor , refunding the full_amount .
negative	so , buyer_beware .
negative	go elsewhere .
negative	i ordered a helmet .
negative	they took 00 days to ship my order and never communicated with me until i called them on the 00th day .
negative	they shipped only after i filed a paypal claim .
negative	if it was back ordered they should have just let me know .
negative	i received it about 00 days after i ordered and paid for it .
negative	where did it come from australia ?
negative	i paid to have flowers champagne and chocolates to deliverd to my honey in the uk for valentines_day recieved e_- mail feb 00 due to adverse weather the flowers only would be delivered ????
negative	no chocolates or wine ???
negative	no flowers were delivered nothing was and it was valentines !!!!!
negative	callled my bank stopped pay they are investigateing i advise alll to re post this and never ever to use these crooks !!!!
negative	!
negative	lisa kempt ps please investigate my complaint i would love you 0 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	infact i dare u !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	i travel extensively for work but had never tried priceline until now , and at this time , i am greatly regretting giving them a try !
negative	my business trip itinerary changed unexpectedly and i needed to change the day of my departure flight .
negative	i have seriously never had such poor customer_service as i '_ve had via priceline .
negative	i '_ve tried and tried and tried to get someone to help me take_care of this !
negative	i have called repeatedly and cannot get past the recording which does not recognize my itinerary number and tells_me " we are temporarily unable to perform this function at this time ," when i input my phone_number as asked .
negative	at one point when i did get though i was on hold for literally two hours before i finally gave up .
negative	i could not get a human_being to help me as the option to actually speak to a person when the automated system failed was never given .
negative	i literally spent over four hours on the phone trying to get someone to change a flight for me , and it still has not been resolved !
negative	i have never been so frustrated when making travel_arrangements !
negative	priceline has completely disappointed me and will not be used again for my extensive travel_arrangements .
negative	unfortunately , at this point , i have already booked and paid for a flight through priceline and desperately needed follow through on their part to ensure my trip is success , and they have not delivered .
negative	do not under any circumstance use priceline , unless you have no time or money restraints around your travel_plans .
negative	( i did learn it will cost $_000 to change my flight and i won '_t be allowed carry on any " free " luggage !
negative	thank_you for your " generosity " priceline !)
negative	until now i have successfully used travelocity to book all my flights and have even had to change a couple in the past and was able to do so through travelocity without issue for a $_000 fee .
negative	never again priceline , never again !
negative	on three seperate occasions i ordered several products which , according to the website , should be in stock .
negative	my first order to more then 00 days to be completed .
negative	with my last order the website claimed a delivery time of 0 - 0 days .
negative	after 0 weeks you ask for the status of your order .
negative	the tell you their supplier is sending the goods .
negative	so please wait 0 more days .
negative	0 weeks_later you inform again .
negative	now the supplier has stock issues and they are not sure when to deliver .
negative	never again will i order something at golfstore europe .
negative	i purchased a battery and screen for my evo but both products did not work .
negative	the top of the screen does not respond and the battery was completly dead with . 0mil volts that would not charge .
negative	they will not take back the screen once its used but how do you know it works until you replace it .
negative	they advertise buyer protection , but they do not provide it .
negative	ultimately they are the judge and jury , so be forewarned that buyer protection does not exist , i found out the hard way .
negative	man_skal ikke forvente at elgiganten ringer tilbage , når_man har lovet det !
negative	i dette tilfælde har man lavet en fejl et eller andet sted i systemet !
negative	og få et svar på e_- mail , kan godt lade vente på sig !
negative	indtil til videre savner jeg stadig et svar , det_er kun 0 dage siden man opdagede fejlen !
negative	i am extremely dissatisified with my recent order with floraqueen .
negative	i originally placed my order on 00 / 0 / 00 with an expected delivery date of 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	after it was not delivered that date , i submitted an inquiry and i was informed that my order would be delayed and delivered on 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	the order history displayed on your site showed that the local_florist shop was notified of the upcoming delivery .
negative	the flowers again were not delivered and i then again submitted another inquiry which was not answered .
negative	finally , today on 00 / 0 / 00 the flowers were delivered .
negative	the individual who delivered the flowers was very disrrespectful to my 00 year_old mother who instead of receiving joy from my gift was only presented with anger and distaste .
negative	the note which was supposed to be included along with the flowers was missing , which left my mother in confusion as to where and whom they were from .
negative	the delivery person informed my mother that the flowers were " coming from russia " ( was she trying to be funny ?)
negative	and did not want to speak to her any further and left abruptly .
negative	what was supposed to be a kind gesture for my mother turned into a nightmare as it not only caused her stress , but me as well ( who is over a 0000 miles_away ).
negative	the local_florist shop was not helpful in any way and messed_up the order by not including the note i requested , not to mention the rude attitude they displayed when they were simply asked for information and help .
negative	i would strongly_recommend that this company rethinks the local_florist shops they do business with as the place itself who took_care of the order was not only disorganized and undependable but they also hire individuals who are ill mannered and inconsiderate .
negative	we are not happy with paypal .
negative	we did over a million dollars a year with them , have a 00 year history and then they decided to demand with out choice that they are going to hold 00_% of all funds for 00 days .
negative	this means they hold $_00 , 000 . 00 of our money on a constant basis for 00 days .
negative	so , we no_longer use their service for money services .
negative	avoid this company . would not connect .
negative	web has numerous comments aiong same line on this company '_s sim_card .
negative	when contacted they gave the same excuse as others have received when complained ... i . e there is the occasional faulty one , and they offer to replace .
negative	the one that did arrive , took for ever , and i was due to depart on my trip , a replacement was of no use .
negative	the fact that they are still selling this faulty product despite all the complaints over a number of years suggests a less_than reputable business .
negative	demanded refund ... they then offered more excuses .
negative	luckily i had paid via paypal .
negative	i lodged a claim through paypal and was successful receiving a full_refund .
negative	we were so_excited to finally be able to spend thanksgiving with my son and his family .
negative	i was bringing the smoke turkey , so i ordered form figis 00 days in advance .
negative	their website accepted my order and i called several_times to make_sure they had my order and confirm it was coming before thanksgiving .
negative	the more calls i made the more disappointed i got .
negative	each time we called their cs department they told us a different story : ( 0 ) they have 0 orders under my name !!!
negative	really ?
negative	( 0 ) no order was found under my name or order number ???!!!
negative	( 0 ) go buy a turkey because it might not arrive on time , no problem we will refund your complete payment ( 0 ) it is arriving via_fedex this afternoon ( 0 ) it already arrived at the post_office ????
negative	( 0 ) we send the order fedex directly to the post_office and the po delivers to your home !!!
negative	really ???
negative	on thanksgiving day the post_office is not opened ??
negative	?
negative	in summary the turkey never arrived on thursday , we went out of town friday_morning and returned sunday_night … the turkey arrived and was dropped in our heated mailroom and was no_longer smelling good when we openned the box .
negative	figis returned half of my money and told me that was their policy !!!
negative	nice job figis !!!
negative	!
negative	after starting a booking for 0 days out , having to update my credit_card info must have changed the date to same day as booking !
negative	not realizing this , i book for the same day as booked , 00_minutes before the tee time that booked .
negative	i ' m an_hour from the course and booked from a laptop in my home .
negative	called and rep said , " sorry , that '_s the policy "!
negative	this was done before the tee time that day .
negative	i didn_'_t change the date , their system did !
negative	i bought a samsung_galaxy 0 0 inch tablet for $_000 and the extended 0 year protection_plan of $_00 more from tigerdirect a few_months back .
negative	i broke the screen and took it back to the store for repair and i was told by the store that i needed to call the warranty company and send the unit back .
negative	the warranty company is called square_trade and the person i talked to was in pakistan .
negative	the person i talked to said his name was ryan ( that was with a heavy accent ), he told me that the tablet could not be fixed and they were sending me my money back $_000 for what i paid for the tablet once they had received the tablet .
negative	i asked why they couldn ’ t fix it and he said that it would cost more to repair it than what it cost .
negative	then he said that if it had cost $_000 to fix it then my warranty would only have $_00 left for future repairs .
negative	i asked to talk to his supervisor and he said there were 0 of them but they were with clients and it would take 0 hours for me to get a response from them .
negative	i asked for one of the names of the supervisor and he gave me the name sylvia ( remember this is a call_center in pakistan .
negative	i gave up dealing_with them and sent the tablet back .
negative	i have also been receiving a lot of junk mail since i gave the rep my email_address .
negative	they did send me a check for $_000 so i went to bestbuy and bought a new one and there warranty .
negative	i do not recommend tigerdirect or square_trade .
negative	ordered item almost 00 days ago and a couple days_later it said it '_s shipped but no tracking_info was ever provided .
negative	item still hasn '_t arrived .
negative	fruugo says it should have arrived 0 - 00 days ago .
negative	all i get from fruggo is a form letter email_saying they are behind on their emails and to wait 0 days for an_email reply .
negative	already did that and still no reply .
negative	disputing transaction with paypal .
negative	think your booking with hotel had to get paper to see i messed_up
negative	people getting rooms 00 . 00 cheaper walking in hotel
negative	i tried to get a reasonable deal on a " 0 star " hotel near the philly airport that priceline in its express_deals called similar to holiday_inn , best western or ramada inn .
negative	what i got was the waterfront inn which was a run - down , dirty , tired motel with 0 floors , no elevators , promised internet but no wireless signal , an adjoining room door with broken locks that wouldn_'_t close completely , a room that wasn_'_t cleaned or the towels replaced on my second night , a toilet that never stops running water , a mattress that had to have been pre wwii and to top it off - a call for help got a " non_- responsive , unable to help , try the day shift manager - maybe they can help staff ".
negative	avoid this place like the plague .
negative	only stay here if your only alternative is sleeping in your car outside a crack house .
negative	did priceline help when i called ?
negative	not so much .
negative	they called the night manager who could not help , had no way to reach the gm and said call back tomorrow .
negative	so did i get another hotel until a refund could be worked out ?
negative	no .
negative	i ' m on my own until priceline can speak to the hotel gm tomorrow ... now that '_s customer_service you can be proud of !
negative	not !
negative	ordered phone and paid on 0 / 00 / 00 ... still_waiting to receive .
negative	i have emailed and can '_t get an actual shipping date from them .
negative	i received some tracking_number that doesn_'_t work and when i emailed them about it they told me it '_s a signature confirmation shipment and the tracking_number won '_t show anything until order is received .
negative	i have now called them and left message .
negative	at this point , i would rather have my money back and i will buy elsewhere .
negative	i have bought things from overseas before with faster shipping and better communication than this .
negative	i am a first time customer and ordered 00 boxes of good earth decaffeinated green tea lemongrass , great tea by - the - way .
negative	i also ordered earl gray tea at the same time .
negative	when my order arrived , they were indefinitely out of earl gray tea , and they sent me 00 boxes of the wrong good earth tea , citrus kiss , which is terrible stuff .
negative	they promptly sent me a return shipping_label via e_- mail and promptly reordered the correct tea for me .
negative	the second " correct " shipment arrived today and once again it was the wrong tea .
negative	once again they sent citrus kiss , so now i have 00 boxes of the wrong tea .
negative	again their customer_service was friendly and offered to send a return shipping_label , however i am now our $_00 . 00 for the original shipping and i have no product !
negative	this has been a terrible experience as a first time customer and i do not plan to ever buy from them again .
negative	be very cautious if you plan to make any purchases from this vendor .
negative	if i could give zero stars i would .
negative	on oct 00 , 0000 i purchased the no .
negative	0 hydrating shampoo from this vendor through amazon . com and when i got the product it looked like it was authentic but when i opened it up and used the product i realized it wasn_'_t the same .
negative	then i compared it to a bottle from my high end salon and i could definitely tell it wasn_'_t the same .
negative	not only was the color of the shampoo different ( yellowish vs . a pearly color ) but the smell was different and it certainly had a different effect on my hair ( stripped it down ).
negative	very disappointed .
negative	sincerely - customer #_000000 inv #_000000
negative	ordered windshield wipers for mercedes s - 000 as they were advertised on the website .
negative	order arrived with wipers that can not be installed on s - 000 .
negative	contacted seller , sent them pic of the wipers needed .
negative	several days_later rec ' d order to ship it back .
negative	asked for pre_- paid label to return item , but was told that it is my responsibility to return wrong item .
negative	tried to call several_times : no live support .
negative	company itself assigned return authorization under " wrong item shipped " title , but still refused to reimburse shipping .
negative	interesting , that one email requested that i will provide them with part item number , so that can check their inventory , but these wipers are still advertised as for s - 000 .
negative	after this experience , i had no time to wait for another shipment from different online retailer and went to dealership to by wipers .
negative	ordered unlock for my iphone_0s on november 00 , 0000 , still locked , no response to emails , posts , or phone_calls
negative	i ordered a toilet seat which was very expensive for my children as my 0 year_old son kept falling in as he is just 0 . this one was supposed to be bigger and have a wider seat as it is a " throne " seat .
negative	i received it and a couple of weeks_later opened it once we had some time over christmas to fit it .
negative	as soon as i took it out of the box it was clear it would never fit a normal toilet so i replaced it , resealed it in a box within a box marked fragile and paid for it to be retuned special delivery as requested by fountain .
negative	at the time i returned it , fountain said they would have to knock off £_00 as we had not returned it within 00 days and i reluctantly accepted that .
negative	however having paid £_000 for the seat and £_00 for the postage , i was told by fountain that it had arrived damaged so they would not receive it back and about 0 weeks_later it was returned to me .
negative	i have no idea how they believe that this could have occurred when the toilet seat was not even fully removed when i originally received it as i saw immediately that it was the wrong back sitting ( which was never clear or stated on the website that it needed a special victorian style toilet ) and i do not believe it was damaged at my end at all , they simply did not want to refund it .
negative	iit was returned fully packaged , in the box , in another box and marked fragile .
negative	i will not be back to this company .
negative	i found sixt via one of those priceline type sites and went directly to the site to rent a car for a trip to the uk .
negative	when i arrived to stansted airport ( 00_minutes early ) they weren '_t ready with a vehicle , so i had to wait for an_hour .
negative	it was an annoyance , but that was ok .
negative	when they were ready , i picked_up the car .
negative	they asked me if i wanted an upgrade .
negative	i '_ve been offered free upgrades before ( because of available vehicle stock ) but they never told me the cost of the upgrade .
negative	then they literally just handed me the keys and sent me on my way .
negative	the personnel at the rental office didn_'_t inspect the vehicle with me or give me any introduction to the car ( it would have been nice for them to at_least offer me a quick tutorial on how to use the gps , since i ' d never been in the car before and i ' m from the usa and driving in a different country .
negative	i spent 00_minutes just figuring that out ).
negative	the car itself was flawless .
negative	i returned the vehicle at the end of the trip and they charged my credit_card for the rental .
negative	sounds great , right ?
negative	great car , great price , middle of the road customer_service ?
negative	i can live with that , right ?
negative	still all considering , i ' d have used them again .
negative	but four days_later i get a bill for " tire damage " for $_000 via an_email .
negative	i ' m now in a foreign_country , have no way to dispute the claim .
negative	i have no knowledge of any tire damage or any event that could have caused this damage , but i did not inspect the tires before or after renting the car , and no one inspected the car with me prior to leaving , or returning to stansted airport .
negative	that all considered , i decided to just pay the damage claim , write their customer_service and email about my experience and move on .
negative	it '_s not worth my time or money to dispute it .
negative	so i responded with payment via the form they asked for and waited for them to withdrawal the money .
negative	they never withdrew the money from my account , but continue to send me reminder emails asking for payment .
negative	the last one threatening legal_action , so i called the uk offices .
negative	no voicemail , and no one answering the phones .
negative	so i called the american sixt offices .
negative	they were very helpful , giving me the direct email_address to the person sending me the damage request emails .
negative	after sending her an_email , they finally they withdrew the funds from my account .
negative	the rental ended 0 - 00 and this fiasco ended on 0 - 00 .
negative	i regularly travel to the uk , and i '_ll never use them again .
negative	i ' d be willing to try us sixt , because they were so helpful in resolving this issue , but not in the uk .
negative	horrible customer_service , horrible_experience all around
negative	yes i received my package immediately but the items i received were used and counterfeit .
negative	the lady gaga beats have god - awful sound quality that dr . dre does not represent himself by .
negative	the tablet charged all day , and did not work without the charger for 0 minutes .
negative	and the tablet keyboard case did not work with the tablet .
negative	i do not recommend this company , it sounds greats but that is all it is .
negative	i don_'_t know why anyone uses these people .
negative	worst reliability i have ever_seen .
negative	i have tried for over 0 hours too install serial # but with no success
negative	i would not recommend this site at all !!!!
negative	!
negative	they take your money but they do not give a refund , even_though they say they do !!!
negative	!
negative	bad bad business !!!
negative	!
negative	let '_s put a stop to their scamming .
negative	report them to the authorities .
negative	i ordered two items - only got one - no response .
negative	hate it .
negative	i think it '_s professional fraud , as you can see in the other reviews below .
negative	please do not order here .
negative	and always keep in mind : many good reviews can be set from the company itself !!
negative	!
negative	supplementwarehouse does not guarantee lowest shipped price and on the phone , the rep did not care about the false_advertising .
negative	no sense in bothering with this website anymore .
negative	good prices , high s / h cost work out to about the same as everyone_else .
negative	my order took more_than 00 hours before i had a tracking_number .
negative	i made a similiar order from vitadigest .
negative	the product cost was more but the s / h cost were half .
negative	total worked out to be about the same .
negative	the big difference , my product from vd took 0 days , sw took 0 .
negative	when i asked sw about it , they gave me a run_around about price_matching .
negative	i didn_'_t ask for a price_match , i paid the advertised price .
negative	i think these_guys are probably doing 0rd_party , that '_s why it takes so long to process orders .
negative	if you can wait and you live close , i guess they aren '_t bad .
negative	having placed my order , and received an_email confirming despatch four days_later , the trouble really began .
negative	there was a link in the email to track the parcel .
negative	it said to wait 0 - 0 hours to track , so that parcelforce could enter it on the system .
negative	three days_later , still no tracking , so i call them .
negative	no , apparently too early to do anything , and told to call back in two_days .
negative	i call back in two_days .
negative	before i even speak staff hang up , but eventually i get through and manage to speak to what i think was the world '_s rudest man .
negative	he has no idea why i was asked to call back on monday - tracking_information can , he says .
negative	take several days to be available .
negative	he had no explanation for why the email said the information wold be available in 0 - 0 hours , and i have been waiting over four days .
negative	he then proceeded to insist that the 0 - 0 days it takes from despatch for delivery , should read 0 days at_least .
negative	he refused to acknowledge that the website says it takes up to 0 days for delivery ( from order ), and insisted this was from when it arrived in the uk - even_though plainly it does not say this .
negative	he repeatedly argued , shouted me down , spoke over me and told me if i could not understand the simple terms , perhaps a manager could explain it to me so perhaps i could understand .
negative	he then told me i should have paid for an expedited service for delivery !
negative	he refused to acknowledge that the six days has passed , and there is still no tracking .
negative	he cannot say when a manager will call me , he can do nothing for me if i don_'_t understand he said , and maybe a manager will call today , but maybe tomorrow , but they are very busy .
negative	aaarrrgghhhhhhhhhhhhh .
negative	and i have no parcel .......
negative	have been waiting for a parcel today but had to be at docs for 00 . 00 so left a card to suggest a safe place if i missed them .
negative	so i left my house at 00 . 00 to see courier sat outside the house in his van .
negative	are you delivering to me ?
negative	yes he says but i am early , i can '_t deliver until 00 . 00 .
negative	so can i have the parcel now ?
negative	no you cant not until 00 . 00 .
negative	what !
negative	excuse me are you having a laff ?
negative	i said i need to be somewhere at 00 . 00 and need to go out , but no , would not hand over parcel .
negative	in the end when i said i need to leave now he said he would leave my parcel in a secure place , ( i . e after 00 . 00 )... so he got out his van and i showed him a place he could leave it , after 00 . 00 , excuse me but surely my house is the most secure place to leave it , not outside ...
negative	he walked past my front_door to observe safe place !
negative	it was a ps0 from currys long awaited for as xmas present or would have told him to return the parcel was so mad ... jobsworth !
negative	i have waited 0 months for a cash back amount , and the customer_service is not worth having , also any opinion you have via the facebook_page if not favourable is just deleted
negative	this is not as trustworthy company as the fares are not true .
negative	emails / sms tells you to call for accept the higher price , but the number can not be used from sweden .
negative	after 00 hour they cancel the booking without asking but the rate is still blocked at my account days thereafter .
negative	do not ever use this company if you like fair service and correct prices , ever !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	ordered two pairs of curtains - identical in every way , size , colour , make , etc .
negative	well they couldn_'_t manage to get this order right .
negative	courier delivered order : one pair as ordered , the other completely wrong .
negative	when i rang customer_services they were very rude and unhelpful .
negative	escalated the problem to head office .
negative	cannot believe this - they will not send a courier with a replacement pair and take the wrong pair away .
negative	they want me to take the curtains back to one of their stores ( nearest shope 00 miles_away ) or post them back to them via royal_mail ( quite a heavy parcel to carry ).
negative	this is not my error debenhams - it '_s yours .
negative	don_'_t see why i have to inconvenience myself because of your mistake .
negative	amazon can manage it !
negative	be warned .
negative	don_'_t shop online at debenhams .
negative	never again will i - never !!!!
negative	!
negative	i made my reservation about 00 months before i booked my trip to mexico .
negative	now though hotelclub offers another credit at our resort in the amount over $_000 . 00 .
negative	so my sincere advise is as follows : don_'_t book with hotelclub early or ever because hotelclub won '_t give us the resort credits they now offer ...
negative	wait_till the last minunte to book with hotelclub or i would never use this travel site again , we got ripped - off !!!
negative	now we are bummed because we booked a three week vacation in mexico , sure could of used the resort credits ... also without telling us , hotelclub charged an extra $_000 . 00 in mx fees , that were never disclosed , and it was a separate charge to my credit_card a month later .
negative	do !
negative	not !
negative	use this travel website unless your so desparate , nver again , hotelclub has some phoney club point membership ...
negative	suddenly we don_'_t have our 000 + points anymore , what '_s up !
negative	rip - off .
negative	this is gail regan of rhododendron , or u . s . a .
negative	first time i ever used priceline and when i made resevations i was going to san jose some how it got switch to san_francisco .
negative	i called them right back with in the hour to let them know of the mistake and they said to bad .
negative	no one would help .
negative	robert employee no .
negative	000000 would not help in any way .
negative	no customer_service what so ever .
negative	my new life mission is to tell all how they suck !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i had to cancel my plans and your hotel took my money as soon as i made the reservation from my bank
negative	lack of anonymosity and poor screening of posters , eg employees posting for an employer to boost business .
negative	i would never take out a title loan again .
negative	i feel this is what is referred to as a " predatory " business .
negative	you take out a loan and can get caught in a neverending cycle of debt .
negative	i was stupid to do it but that doesn_'_t make taking advantage of that ok .
negative	also , one of the clerks tried to change my automatic withdrawal date against my wishes .
negative	this had potential for serious consequences to me and i asked her verbally not to change it nicely but she did it anyway .
negative	after i spoke to mgt someone changed it back .
negative	it was unnecessary stress and drama since i never had any_problems with payments or fund availability .
negative	i would never recommend a title loan to anyone .
negative	i don_'_t know how you sleep at night .
negative	i had a terrible experience with expedia !
negative	i '_ve worked with them before and they were good .
negative	it '_s been a while since i traveled , but based on my previous experiences , i trusted expedia .
negative	they have changed !
negative	this is what happened : i am planning a vacation in the uk and i wanted to stay in london for 0 nights .
negative	i booked 0 rooms for 0 nights at tune hotel - paddington .
negative	later that day i found out expedia over charged me by $_000 , plus , expedia charged a $_00 fee for each room each night .
negative	the tune hotel website charged less .
negative	so , i thought i would take_advantage of the " best price guarantee ".
negative	i called them up and my booking matched all the criteria accept the tune website did not covert british pounds to us dollars .
negative	they would not cancel my booking either .
negative	so , i ' m out $_000 !
negative	travelers beware !
negative	expedia wants to rip you off !
negative	never book a hotel with them without researching your choice thoroughly before hand !
negative	then , my advice is to make_sure you can cancel the booking for a full_refund just in case !
negative	i booked a las_vegas mystery hotel package on book it . com after booking the package and my credit_card being charged i went to print the voucher and received an error message stating only the airfare portion of the package was reserved , not the hotel .
negative	the error message told me to call the book it representative to find out what happened .
negative	i called book it and waited 00_minutes to speak with a human_being .
negative	she was unable to help me .
negative	i asked to speak with a supervisor and was placed on hold for another 00_minutes when their computer disconnected the call .
negative	do not use this website if you expect good customer_service .
negative	they are unable to provide good customer_service !
negative	no support on weekends at all .
negative	the customer is mean nothing to them .
negative	could easely not get your ticket !
negative	i booked one of expedia ' hidden value ' rooms and selected ( 0 ) adults and ( 0 ) children .
negative	my room came back as either ( 0 ) queen or ( 0 ) twin beds .
negative	obviously not enough room for 0 people .
negative	i then was required to pay an extra $_00 to ' upgrade ' my room to what i originally requested .
negative	customer_service kept subtly blaming me for their system malfunction .
negative	" did i select right ", " sorry it '_s non_- refundable ".
negative	they did offer me a $_00 coupon - but i ' m all done with my travel booking so i ' m not sure when i can use it .
negative	plus i am forced to deal with them again .
negative	we bought our daughter a $_000 gift_card for christmas from this store .
negative	while shopping her wallet was stolen with the gift_card on there .
negative	we immediately contacted the store but the manager said they cannot cancel the card we have to call corporate but since it was stolen on a friday_night , we have to wait on monday because they were closed over the weekend .
negative	i told the manager to help us in case somebody presents the card for payment since i have the receipt with the card number on it .
negative	she did not want to do that until i got really mad .
negative	then monday came , i called the corporate_office and to my surprise , the corporate_office said they cannot cancel the card since they do not have a system to do that .
negative	how can a big company with so many stores nationwide and even international not able to cancel a stolen card ?
negative	even a small store can do it .
negative	they just do not care about their customers .
negative	so warning do not shop at this store or buy a gift_card .
negative	i sell a guitar to someone .
negative	i specifiy , item will be shipped when funds are recieved .
negative	i '_ve always gotten funds immedately .
negative	so i had no_hesitation using paypal .
negative	i '_ve been a casual ebay user since 0000 ... and have a 00 feedback with a little yellow star , whatever that means .
negative	anyway .
negative	now it says the funds aren '_t available for 00 days ... and i '_ve got a 00 $ shipping expense .
negative	the truth is that paypal / ebay sister companies are trying to force people to buy their shipping through them and trying to force people to use their shipping_label system .
negative	if i don_'_t do that , i don_'_t get my money in a reasonable amount of time .
negative	horrible .
negative	i can buy my own shipping and make my own_labels .... what right do they have to hold these funds for so long .
negative	the lady on the phone with paypal said , " you have the funds " i said no you have the funds .
negative	theres a difference .
negative	i can " t use them , spend them , etc .
negative	therefor i don_'_t have the funds .
negative	i '_ll never recommend anyone use paypal or ebay again .
negative	crooks .
negative	i got a cell_phone that the back cover won ; t fit on it , wrote to complain , but get no response , out $_00 for nothing ,
negative	as for the guy who give 0_stars here , he is either blind , or idiot , or associated with dhgate .
negative	i was about to book a car and pay for it , but i was careful enough to check what it said on the website before i pay for it .
negative	i was trying is to reserve a hyundai i00 in las america airport .
neutral	i ordered on april 00 and finally received my order today , may 00 .
neutral	i understand the " dr oz " show took them by surprise , but that response is only good for the first few_days , then it becomes an excuse .
neutral	i understand the frustration folks are going thru , as i filed a complaint with paypal two_days before receiving my order .
neutral	the product came to me as discribed and as shown , but the company needs to communicate more with the public or it is going to see more negative comments which could easily be avoided .
neutral	update_: ok so after holding for another hour ... finally got this very nice man in india who spoke great english .. negotiated to give me a credit 00_% of my costs good for a flight anywhere with same carrier , a cost of $_000 change plane fee to pay to the carrier ... so i rebooked to go see grandpa .
neutral	not my first choice but at_least they tried .
neutral	this took way to long , was a complete hassle when through 0 people to finally get someone to help me but ... cost me a couple of hundred dollars more and at_least i wasn_'_t totally out of pocket on this flight .
neutral	history :
neutral	so you go online , you buy your ticket , you buy trip cancellation insurance and all looks good .
neutral	then you get an_email every 0 hours trying to sell you more tickets ... haven_'_t gotten them to turn that off yet .
neutral	now my trip was cancelled .
neutral	yesterday i spent 0 hours on hold , then an asian - sounding agent i could barely understand came on the phone and after about 00_minutes of futzing around said he couldn_'_t help me and transferred me to the " concerned dept " .
neutral	this chap futz around for a few_minutes only to tell me he didnt cover cheapoair problems and that i had to call 000 - 000 - 0000 ... which turns_out to be the same number i had before ... today i am on hold for 00_minutes and still now response .
neutral	this travel company doesn_'_t seem to care .
neutral	if you buy a ticket ... dont bother to buy the insurance , it isn_'_t good for anything and of course you will never get these_guys on the phone .
neutral	i am calling the airline to see if they can help me .... # cheapoairsucks
neutral	i paid for next_day postage but received the item on the st nod day .
neutral	called ckear chemist and was told that a refund would be applied . item condition arrived intact , friendly customer_service .
neutral	the cas was perfect .
neutral	it felt a bit funny that rentalcars . com did not publish a phone_number .
neutral	the one i found was not working .
neutral	i simply wanted to know where they process their credit_cards from .
neutral	i now know they do it from uk - causing extra fees for me .
neutral	not mentioned anywhere .
neutral	i received an_email confirming that my mum had received her flowers , yet a phone_call revealed that she had not received any flowers .
neutral	a reply to the confirmation email resulted in a reply that stated the flowers were left on the front porch .
neutral	although mother '_s sunday may be a very busy day , a simple ring of the doorbell or a card through the mail slot would have alerted mum that she had received flowers .
neutral	poor mum spent the day thinking we had forgotten her !
neutral	very disappointing ...
neutral	i have never been more pleased with my purchase thanks so much and i will make another order soon .
neutral	i applied , and was turned down , but it was quick and easy .
neutral	priceline . com provides great deals .
neutral	i would like priceline . com to allow a bid on a hotel to be changeable solely by changing the price and not as they have it set_up now , which requires changing the price and star_rating when one re - bids after one '_s initial bid is rejected .
neutral	this is to say that priceline requires the bidder to bid the same amount for a lower - starred hotel as they had just bid for a higher - starred hotel .
neutral	... and never contacted me .
neutral	my bank had to notify me , which was not a fun experience .
neutral	could have ended worse , but i wish zappos would have taken this hacking issue a little more seriously .
neutral	when people describe someone_else as " peaked " just think of how popular myspace was , and how quickly it died by allowing people to make their own pages look like crap .
neutral	great example of not thinking smart , and giving people everything they want without long_term planning .
neutral	i used to love blogger .
neutral	now : eh , or meh .
neutral	horror stories abound on how blogspot can drop your blog , and you lose access to it .
neutral	my experience is mixed , but mostly positive .
neutral	there are some quirks to it , like all the time , but all in all , it is user_friendly and easy to use .
neutral	it '_s a great way to start blogging .
neutral	just cross your fingers that you don_'_t need trouble shooting help - as i '_ve never encountered any help from them .
neutral	that said , i have several blogs on blogger and while i seasonally consider moving over to wordpress , i stay with blogspot .
neutral	perhaps some odd sense of loyalty , or laziness , i ' m not sure .
neutral	my advice : newbie ?
neutral	start on blogger .
neutral	it '_s not that bad .
neutral	this is the 0nd time i purchase a personalized card on this site .
neutral	i like the insurance of delivery and the time of the first one .
neutral	well the second time was not a pleasure ... don_'_t like the way they handled rejecting my pic on the card ...
neutral	inundated with emails till you don_'_t know which way is up or down .
neutral	got me for a $_00 .. core .
neutral	paid more_than it would have costed me to buy local , and the unit failed year later .
neutral	this was the worst online shopping_experience i have ever had .
neutral	total partsgeek took me for 0 core charges $_000 .
neutral	restocking_fee $_00 . 00 they sent the wrong part my cost to return wrong part $_00 . 00 . and core return $_00 . 00 my loss was $_000 . 00 and as a added_bonus a poor product .. support your local small business , it seems these_guys are out to get you !..
neutral	oh and i had problems with their tracking numbers .
neutral	it '_s a good service , once the automated booking had been transferred to the local repair company they contacted me promptly , offered to come a day earlier and the bulgarian engineer was punctual , polite , knowledgeable and very helpful .
neutral	he fixed the dishwasher without any new parts and it worked for three more days before i had to call them back .
neutral	i ' d still use the company again .
neutral	often olotels has the cheapest price on comparison sites - but the actual price they display for your purchase will vary according to the links you click to get to them .
neutral	through cashback sites like quidco , for example , olotels will automatically inflate the price of the room so you pay more and the cashback discount is effectively worthless .
neutral	also , always check with the hotel you ' re booking that they '_ve received the olotels reservation in their own system , saves disappointment .
neutral	well_packaged item which arrived on time - shower was installled by my plumber who said ' it was easy to plumb ' and on testing said ' it was a nice powerful shower '.
neutral	the price on what i wanted was the lowest i found .
neutral	i have received my glasses and they are top quality .
neutral	my only complaint was the customer_service .
neutral	my order was not processed in the time frame they gave me and communication was minimal from their side .
neutral	i have a delongi coffee machine and the capsules keep slipping through , i have to get them just in the right spot then push down the handle , unlike nespresso ones that just slot in .
neutral	the coffee however is comparable to nespresso .
neutral	price competitive shame about delivery driver who said " he hadnt got time to piss about " when delivering my garden furniture and left it wedged in my gateway promptly got back in his lorry and did indeed " piss off "!
neutral	nice service not !
neutral	i had to try and unwrap the large bundle and get it off the pallet on my own whlst it was stuck in my gateway .
neutral	i was very satisfied with the part ordered .
neutral	the email received indicated that the part was shipped with fedex , the tracking_number which could not be found on fedex .
neutral	an_email was sent back to partsgeeks and was informed the fedex tracking_number was valid and shipping was just running behind orders .
neutral	checking with fedex the tracking_number could not be found .
neutral	the part was sent using us mail ( usps ) not fedex
neutral	i long for the days when skype had a simple user_interface .
neutral	now it '_s trying to be another facebook .
neutral	it '_s a phone book dammit !
neutral	the reservation was not complete ... i reserved a non_- smoking room , but the reservation was not transmitted to the motel correctly .
neutral	check the prices and add 00_%
neutral	i would like to see ebay become more involved in the process
neutral	competative prices .
neutral	long dated products .
neutral	below par packaging - size of jiffy bag was clearly too small for the goods ordered and opened in royal_mail carriage .
neutral	either someone is lazy or cost - cutting .
neutral	that said i would use again based on price .
neutral	the prices are good but , i wanted to edit the amount to order more after i entered the payment information and i didn_'_t see an option .
neutral	i had to re - submit all of my information all over again .
neutral	i had a chat session with one of the cashnet associates .
neutral	she explained_everything to me .
neutral	i was pleased with the information given .
neutral	thank_you cashnet .
neutral	iphone verizon 0s unlock took 00 days on a virgin 0 . 0 . 0 system .
neutral	there is always a number to call with a problem
neutral	this site is great in many ways , except for oversea trips .
neutral	they booked me in this decent hotel , but i could not speak a single word .
neutral	kudos to the hotel , but language barrier .
neutral	i bought a brand_new vocal screen , which appears the last available , only to recieve in excellent time , but obviously flawed .
neutral	tell tale signs of use , and one bent componant marred what otherwise would have been an excellent experience .
neutral	coupled with the lack of response from cs when emailed , they probably won '_t see my money again .
neutral	shame .
neutral	avis gave me a car where the brakes jerked and when i told them about it they said they already knew of the problem but had issued the car anyway .
neutral	otherwise , the car was comparable to other cars on the island .
neutral	as for using rentalcars , i did not realize that my credit_card would be charged immediately upon making my reservation even_though my trip was not for several weeks .
neutral	i ' m sure it was in the fine_print somewhere but i didn_'_t see it .
neutral	also , the taxes were not included in the quoted price which did not make the final price a great deal like it initially appeared .
neutral	price was excellent , love the product .
neutral	however , it is apparent that the " new " unit i purchased was in fact a " used " and returned one .
neutral	there were scratches and chipped paint , and all bolts , washers and other hardware were missing .
neutral	i was able to replace the bolts and washers at my local ace hardware , but at a cost of over $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the unit installed very easily , and i am satisfied with it .
neutral	i am not satisfied with partsgeek . com for selling me a " used " unit without all the parts included .
neutral	buyer_beware on that one .
neutral	got us to spain without any delays .
neutral	booking process was frustrating and they added extra tax at the last_minute .
neutral	i still prefer easyjet .
neutral	there is nothing to be said about ordering and delivering , everything just works like a charm .
neutral	but in my opinion the store need to describe the products better in terms of battery life on the e_- cigs and online usermanuals , since the manual in the pakage " stinks " and is downright worthless for a first time user of the product .
neutral	also i think it would be a good idea to recommend compatible products under each items page .
neutral	you take to long to pay out
neutral	one shirt no button on sleave you had a jock on me will not come_back rip_off 00 waist was 00
neutral	after i received the bulbs i ordered , i noticed that the r00 bulbs didnt have the same lumen spec .
neutral	on the packaging as specified on the website .
neutral	i sent them the following message and never_heard back :
neutral	" i just received my shipment .
neutral	i am a little confused in that your website specification for the satco s0000 indicates the initial lumens to be 000 yet the package they come in shows the lumens rating at 000 .
neutral	i purchased these in part because of the higher lumen rating .
neutral	can you help me understand the difference ?"
neutral	i admit i opted for smartbuyglasses for 0 reasons .
neutral	firstly was the cost which was competetive , and scondly as the pair i wanted were marked on the site as available for fast delivery which was what i needed as i was going on holiday .
neutral	i read their promises on delivery times carefully to see if it would arrive in time .
neutral	only after i paid did i get an_email to say they were waiting for stock .
neutral	so despite what the site had said when i ordered the raybans that they were available for fast delivery , this proved to be incorrect .
neutral	when i replied to their email they did offer me a different pair at a reduced price , but i did not take them up on the offer as i wanted what i had originally ordered .
neutral	i did get my glasses just in time , and they are the real product and i am very happy with them .
neutral	but if it is important that you get your glasses quicly , do not trust the fast delivery claim as it may not be accurate .
neutral	i , ve been with this travel_agent since the past few_months .
neutral	my first visit to krabi thailand was wonderful . the hotel offered was spacy and comfortable and cheap as well
neutral	booked hotel and transfers with alpharooms .
neutral	hotel fantastic and no problem with transfer from airport to hotel however for the return_journey i was told to reconfirm the booking the night before we were to leave .
neutral	i went to reception but there was no number on the printed booking form i had , i had to pay to go on the internet ( this took 00_minutes , did not work first time , crashed 0nd time ) and there was no number on manage my booking .
neutral	back to reception to ring alpharooms but office was closed .
neutral	tried again the following_morning but no success however the very helpful receptionist rang some travel agency and they confimed we would be colllected .
neutral	over an_hour of my holiday time was spent trying to sort out de transfer and it stressed me and my travellers .
neutral	booked flights , hotel , and taxi transfers with alpharooms and all went well .
neutral	decided subsequently to cancel the taxi transfers and booked a car instead .
neutral	this was no problem and for safety reasons decided to take out the additional " total damage_excess waiver " insurance at a cost of £_00 on top of the regular insurance .
neutral	to my surprise when i went to collect the car in portugal i was asked if i wanted the excess insurance .
neutral	i replied that i had the tdew but was informed that this was irrelevent and unless i took out their excess insurance at a cost of 000euros that i would be liable for an excess of up to 0000euros !
neutral	!
neutral	well that was a no brainer , so the moral of the story is forget the total damage_excess waiver insurance supplied by alpharooms and get it at resort .
neutral	i contacted alpharooms and unfortunately they didn_'_t want to know .
neutral	shame .
neutral	dont ever answer emails ...!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	having now read other reviews .... i realise i ' m not alone by not having emails replied to and money being taken yet no delivery .
neutral	will be taking legal_action if i dont receive a response in the next 00 hours and will never buy again despite having spent £_000 '_s previously ....
neutral	then .... got an answer after posting the above review only to be fobbed off for another month .
neutral	still got my money ..... still no goods ..... still no email reply or phone_call apology .
neutral	only one option left from here .....
neutral	waiting for glutenflam for months now .
neutral	checked again last night , out f stock .
neutral	i was on a waiting list .
neutral	checked with chat line and wasn_'_t really happy with the customer_service girl .
neutral	she could care less if i went to another site for this .
neutral	finally found what i wanted and ordered it elsewhere .
neutral	not sure if i will come_back .
neutral	i use priceline in order to attempt to bid prices at hotels , and on rental_cars .
neutral	i was able to get a loaded mid - size fuel efficient gmc suv for $_00 a day on priceline .
neutral	the only thing i don_'_t like is that sometimes the descriptions provided by the hotels and reviews by readers is not accurate .
neutral	on a july 0000 trip the hotel claimed free parking , but the parking was on the street parking which would have been more accurate in new_orleans .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	fortunately my stay was during the week and off - season thus being handicapped it would have been a challenge .
neutral	you cannot get a refund when you bid and the vendor accepts .
neutral	i have saved on airline flights on priceline .
neutral	so the best advice is to either stay in 0 - 0 star hotels or pick an area that has only one hotel of the star_level you want , by reviewing hotel websites so that you don_'_t get ripped_off .
neutral	overall priceline is an amazing tool that is only as good as the user .
neutral	the la cumbre store in santa barbara seriously lacks in customer_service , and choice in latest trends and fashions .
neutral	i was very dissapointed to see that the sales person had absolutely no idea what the store is carrying and to find out that they didn ; t carry long skirts at all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	long skirts are the trend this year , and they have none .
neutral	from the order and each day got updates on how the shipment was coming .
neutral	all was great .
neutral	the item upon receipt was inspected and the warranty covered everything except the grommets .
neutral	i unpackaged the cover and the grommets were less_than satisfactory .
neutral	some were crushed ( folded and could not run line through ) others were not placed on the cover properly ( the grommets were not completely on the fabric ).
neutral	this appears to be a second rate pool cover and i have to cover my pool now .
neutral	i feel those should have been inspected before shipping .
neutral	i am not willing to pay for shipping and take the chance of getting a second faulty cover .
neutral	i appreciate your updates on shipping but the quality of the product is not what i expected .
neutral	i will not order products again through this site .
neutral	the one drawback is that once you purchase on " name your_own price ," you are no_longer a customer and are not welcomed .
neutral	priceline would benefit greatly if they examined their model and provided for travelers to either see a review of the hotels they are about to purchase unseen , or give the customer 0 " refund " per 00 purchases or something .
neutral	had to put my details on card in five times as kept sticking , had to add address details twie as removed them !
neutral	frustrating ,
neutral	i have used zazzle for years .
neutral	the products are generally great and the service is good ( production / shipping ) but awful if there is a problem .
neutral	the are too many changes to the design progress that are just changes and not improvements .
neutral	often it seems there is little trouble shooting of design changes , and zazzle denies a problems exists .
neutral	several months_ago they eliminated their volumes bonus program but started calling referral bonuses volume bonuses ( which they are not ).
neutral	this means a loss of hundreds of dollars a year for a designer with large stores .
neutral	small stores never qualified for volumes bonuses anyway .
neutral	it is kinda like leaving the price of a bag of sugar at $ 0 . 00 and then changing the size of the bag from 0lb to 0lb .
neutral	if you are eliminating the volume bonuses , be honest about it .
neutral	some of us are smart enough to know the difference .
neutral	arrived at sea mist resort on thursday , may 00 , 0000 , around 00 : 00_pm .
neutral	the front_desk personal was very friendly and efficient .
neutral	i call the front_desk two times , and both times i was greeted very professionally , and they did not mind answering my questions .
neutral	a big plus was the welcome call , once i checked in .
neutral	i was suppose to have a ocean view room , what looked out towards another building , which was disappointing .
neutral	the room was clean , which was a plus .
neutral	the elevator was not the best , it almost stuck between floors .
neutral	i was in one of the older buildings and they were celebrating 00 years ....
neutral	the downside of my stay was the very poor internet service .
neutral	the wifi would connect , but that is all you could do .
neutral	you could not get online .
neutral	for that reason , i would not stay there again , but for the money , it was clean .
neutral	you get what you pay for .
neutral	get your money back .
neutral	we called at 0 : 00_pm the day before a night walking tour through chinatown , and by my calculations , it was 00 hours before the trip , but by viators calculations it was not .
neutral	i was on vacation and i didn_'_t want to fight , but i have to tell you , it left a sour taste in my mouth , considering we had booked 0 trips through viator .
neutral	we are now going to los_angeles in august , and i ' m not totally sure that i will book through viator .
neutral	i actually sent an_email with a question about pick - up at my hotel .
neutral	i received a confirmation and was told someone would get back to me .
neutral	no one did .
neutral	so , as you can see , i ' m having my doubts as to whether i want to give my money to them , when there '_s plenty of other tour companies .
neutral	lige et_par tanker i punktform :
neutral	- jeres telefonkø er uacceptabel .
neutral	fortæl i det mindste folk , hvad nummer de er i køen !
neutral	- det_er fint at i er flittige til at svare folk her i trustpilots forum , men_det virker useriøst , når det bare er en sludder for en sladder .
neutral	lad være med at svare , medmindre i har noget vigtigt at tilføje , en decideret undskyldning fx .
neutral	- jeg finder jeres netforbindelse tilfredsstillende for det meste , men i perioder er den ustabil , men så er i søde til at hjælpe med en løsning .
neutral	- jeg synes i skulle tilbyde en løsning så man_kan bruge googles chromecast .
neutral	vær med på moden !
neutral	i ordered a case for my ipad mini .
neutral	i ordered it before i preordered the mini ( one week before mini released ).
neutral	the ipad came last friday .
neutral	it '_s monday , and snugg is asking for a review .
neutral	the cover won '_t be here until wednesday .
neutral	i can '_t review the case , but i ' m already disappointed that my ipad has no case , yet .
neutral	honestly , if i had known it would take so long , i would have just waited and ordered a different case from somewhere_else .
neutral	this snugg was only offered in black , but i accepted that because i thought it would be here at the same time as my ipad .
neutral	i probably would have ordered a different color ... but too_late now .
neutral	update_: the case did arrive later on monday .
neutral	it '_s actually pretty nice .
neutral	however , there is a letter stating that apple moved the magnets at the last_minute , so the ' smart cover ' aspect doesn_'_t work at this time .
neutral	they promise to send a revised ( fully functioning ) version in the next 00 days , this case , so_far , is for protection ... and i won '_t have to return it when the new one arrives .
neutral	nice_touch & the rating is getting better .
neutral	the black is alright .
neutral	i do wish it came in other colors , but this will do .
neutral	we '_ll see if / when the 0nd case arrives .
neutral	update 0 : the replacement case arrived today .
neutral	it was a little more_than 00 days , but the new case is just the same , but now the smart cover feature works .
neutral	regardless of whatever timing issues i had , the case is a good quality and feels nice .
neutral	okay so i hit the button and watch the speedo go up and down and up and down - then again for the upload speed ( getting boring .
neutral	.
neutral	. )
neutral	and it '_s done .
neutral	i get two numbers and a list of providers and contracts .
neutral	my download is 00 mbps and the upload ( does it matter for ebay ) is lower .
neutral	is that good or bad ( even ugly ) or just average .
neutral	we men are in that state of questioning from puberty so you just added to my angsts .
neutral	relief please !
neutral	tell me wtf it means !!
neutral	otherwise yada yada yada it seemed to work fine !
neutral	you kept me entertained in the time it took for me to reach 00 mbps .
neutral	how was it for you ?
neutral	there are a lot of issues with google .
neutral	i used them & then i get lots of unwanted interruption in searches .
neutral	would like this to stop & would like to be able to choose what i want to see on my screen .
neutral	we ordered 0 costumes .
neutral	i tried on my medusa costume and when my husband was zipping it up it was a little tight and then it ripped !
neutral	now , i have a party in 0 days have to figure_out a way to alter it .
neutral	not real happy !
neutral	it was a size l and i where a 00 in ladies so that should be fine .
neutral	i purchased an olympic a barbell set which arrived yesterday .
neutral	the product itself looks like good quality so no complaint there .
neutral	however my experience was soured by the attitude of customer_service staff and the carrier they employ when my order didn_'_t arrive between the time they said it would .
neutral	it wasn_'_t too_late when it arrived but the point was when i rang the carrier told me he had delivery down as being 0pm as opposed to before 00pm , so my initial reaction was half my day had been wasted and my time , like theirs , is money and when i pointed this out to the customer_service team the reaction i got sounded quite aggressive and the call back from someone higher up i was told i would get never came .
neutral	the attitude of the carrier company was also arrogant and disinterested , like he was doing me the favour !
neutral	the customer_service team and the carrier service need to remind themselves that it '_s the customer that keeps them in jobs .
neutral	goods website and booking went fine my only problem was that i booked a twin room and ended_up with a double .
neutral	alpharooms told the hotel double .
neutral	i have been in touch with alpharooms and to be far they have been very helpful .
neutral	however they have tried to say that i thought i was going to get two rooms , but i didn_'_t expect this i expected two beds in one room ( a twin room ?!)
neutral	but alpharooms say that " a twin room is a double occupancy room which is what you received ."
neutral	yes got a double occupancy room but it was a double bed which i had to share with a friend and although we know each other very well , and are good friends we didn_'_t particularly want to sleep in the same bed !
neutral	although it has been the source of much merriment to our fellow travelling companions .
neutral	so beware if you book a twin room with alpharooms you could end up in a double bed ....
neutral	i loved the finished canvas and would recommend the company highly for this .
neutral	however , i was away for a week when it was delivered .
neutral	instead of posting a card through my door to arrange redelivery , the canvas was just left there .
neutral	luckily my neighbour took it in but this is most unsatisfactory and for this reason i will never use the company again sadly
neutral	pictires of hotel very deceiving .
neutral	could have booked the room cheaper thru travelocity .
neutral	however i did not really have a bad experience using hotels one . com .
neutral	would consider using them again .
neutral	have used holiday autos on many occassions and they have always been really good , however this time they sub contracted to firefly which is located in the car_park ( not an easy trek with suitcases etc ) only to discover we had to take a number and we waited in it for over an_hour , really not good enough to have only two people to serve at_least two incoming flights .
neutral	i looked up one company , with whom i had what must be a common bad experience , and saw mostly 0_stars or 0 star .
neutral	the 0 star reviews were often short and generic , came during a relatively short_period of time following bad_reviews , and the reviewer had only one review here .
neutral	what would motivate those 0 star individual ( s )?
neutral	my question : do you screen these types of reviews , whereby a company might polish their image ?
neutral	if so , how ?
neutral	do you look at the ip address ?
neutral	we need to trust your data , please .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	please explain your deals with businesses : 0 ) take control of your online image .
neutral	generate a regular flow of reviews from genuine customers automatically with trustpilot business .
neutral	it requires no special software , just a single email .
neutral	0 ) display independent reviews and create trust 00_% of online shoppers use customer reviews in their decision making process ( yougov 0000 ).
neutral	by displaying positive_reviews on your site through trustpilot , you give them the reassurance they need to complete their purchase .
neutral	ordered a taillight .. ok
neutral	i have traded on ebay since it started .
neutral	at the beginning it was a much_better resource where people connected with one another to sell their stuff .
neutral	it was a great way to sell things that you no_longer needed ( or wanted ) or to find components you could not find locally .
neutral	things once sold at garage sales were suddenly available through ebay .
neutral	the prices were really decent .
neutral	there was a nice community of folks , too .
neutral	still is .
neutral	unfortunately ebay has evolved into a place where prices have gone way up and scalping is not unusual .
neutral	i have seen items selling for more_than msrp ( sometimes double or even triple , depending on how scarce the item is ).
neutral	usually it is something kids want with parents who do not know the value of teaching delayed gratification .
neutral	as in waiting until something is available at a reasonable price .
neutral	when a new video_game system is released , demand is usually much higher_than supply ; and , to some , no price is too high .
neutral	the same goes for some popular video_games .
neutral	some will say this is a good thing .
neutral	i ' m not sure that greed is ever good .
neutral	when i say greed , i am not strictly speaking about sellers .
neutral	it is on the part of the buyers who must have something no_matter how much they pay .
neutral	that was bound to happen .
neutral	ebay is no_longer the small community it once was .
neutral	it is still a darned good place to find things you cannot find anywhere_else .
neutral	vinyl albums ... older games , movies , etc .
neutral	that is what made ebay a good thing in the beginning and that has not changed .
neutral	just make_sure you know your prices .
neutral	and use paypal to protect yourself .
neutral	ordered the bike on a sunday but it took over 0 weeks to deliver it , which in this day and age is unacceptable .
neutral	price is good delivery sucks
neutral	travelocity was one of the best , with the lowest service fees of any .
neutral	not any more .
neutral	their site looks just like expedia , who i presume bought them out .
neutral	priceline is now the best .
neutral	too bad , i used travelocity all the time , until now .
neutral	for at starte med det gode .
neutral	maden var virkelig god , om end stegt flæsk med persillesovs ikke_kan kaldes gourmetmad , men_det_var vi heller_ikke blevet lovet !!
neutral	betjeningen var_meget ung , men god , dog ventede vi næsten 0 kvarter på forretten den første aften - i en " set menu " både vin og vand var absolut i den dyre ende .
neutral	værelserne var pæne - ikke for rene , vi fandt vores del af spindelvæv , men der_er_meget trafikstøj , jeg forstår ikke , at man_ikke investerer i støjdæmpende glas , larmen begyndte allerede ved 0 - tiden om morgenen !
neutral	!
neutral	ikke det billigste selskab , men jeg_har kun fået god service .
neutral	good prices on products but paying more_than 00_% of the product price for shipping and still having to wait 0 - 00 days for delivery seems to be a bit of a rip_off !
neutral	hi . nice compact glasses but fragile . also the case is huge for small glasses . i won '_t be using the case .
neutral	waited in all day and it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	still heard_nothing two_days_later .
neutral	had to ring pine solutions and they gave a £_00 . 00 refund for the problems we had received .
neutral	not too impressed ..... our first order .... and the drawers are not flush on the unit .....
neutral	it '_s great to be able to personalize a card , but why does it cost over $ 0 to send just a basic card ?
neutral	also curious why credit . com shows my experian credit score of 000 while identity_guard shows 000 .
neutral	that '_s a helluva difference and credit . com referred me to identity_guard .
neutral	what am i to do now ... pay a 0rd_party for a 0rd opinion ?
neutral	and these scores do not correlate to those seen by mortgage companies , banks and auto finance people .
neutral	just placed my first order .
neutral	so will rate when order received .
neutral	ordering was easy
neutral	the resources available at ancestry are pretty_much second to none , but i feel that their pricing is extremely high
neutral	i was really excited to see the layout of the program .... very user_friendly .
neutral	then i got to the id vault section that is included with the subscription .
neutral	that is when i realized it requires windows xp , vista or windows 0 .
neutral	i am an apple mac user all the way and shocked they didn_'_t allow for those not on microsoft .
neutral	very disappointing !
neutral	!
neutral	still_waiting for my order . i ' m sure i will be happy with it .
neutral	i have been a member for a few years but have gotten nothing from it , also a few contacts of mine have dropped it , so i probably will also .
neutral	excellent as far as arrangements for collection of cd '_s disappointed that no reason was given on why payment was made .
neutral	this not to much of a problem with a 00 p cd however with a £ 0 cd and nothing given i would have preffered to have the cd back but i was not given the option .
neutral	i will try somewhere_else next time
neutral	website has poor search options , but the real killer here is the shipping , which added 00_% to the cost .
neutral	i would never buy a liquid supplement here , as the shipping surcharge would kill you !
neutral	in general , goldstar has offered tickets for many events that i ' m interested in at a good price , but there have been a few problems .
neutral	on 0 may , 0000 , we took the blue and gold alcatraz boat cruise .
neutral	the address listed to pick_up tickets was 000 beach st . , which was wrong - the actual address was the blue and gold ticket window on jefferson st , 0 blocks away .
neutral	as my husband is physically disabled , this was a hardship for him .
neutral	the cruise itself was very interesting , and the goldstar price was very reasonable .
neutral	there have been other problems as well - a couple of times , i '_ve paid for tickets for 0st balcony or mezzanine performances and when i go to the box office , they give me 0nd balcony tickets .
neutral	when i explain that i bought better tickets , the box office says that we have to resolve it with goldstar , which of course , i can '_t on the night of the performance .
neutral	i think this is more the box office '_s fault than goldstar , but it '_s still annoying .
neutral	after installing the new screen ( which was really not very difficult ) and turning on the laptop , i noticed in the upper left hand corner a very short red vertical mark that was present regardless of what was being displayed .
neutral	apparently the screens undergo no test prior to shipping .
neutral	i asked my daughter , for whom i had install the new screen , if the mark bothered her and she thought " she could live with it ."
neutral	were it mine , i would be annoyed .
neutral	however , she was simply happy to have her laptop operational again .
neutral	but as we '_ve heard before high shipping_costs .
neutral	even so the bottom_line is still good .
neutral	lets see more shipping options with cheaper rates .
neutral	it should have been so easy , but it took me two phone_calls and a lot of time to make hotel reservations for four rooms .
neutral	i thought it would be easier to call the hotel reservation line directly and get the best price .
neutral	the associate was very nice and tried to be helpful , but i had to ask for the discounted price i had seen on line .
neutral	i don_'_t know why , but it took her a very long time to make the reservation ; unfortunately , she had not noted that we preferred to be on the same floor either , so she had to go back into the computer to add the request ; we need to double - check at the desk when we arrive to see if the hotel can accommodate this request .
neutral	all the rooms had to be put in my name .
neutral	i received the confirmation by email within_seconds , which was good , because it was wrong .
neutral	she had booked us for only one night !
neutral	so i called back to correct the reservation .
neutral	the person i talked to insisted that i do a separate booking because the first reservation is " non_- refundable ."
neutral	no changes can be made .
neutral	then the associate told me that it was going to cost the full price per room on saturday ; that the promotion was only on friday .
neutral	i didn_'_t think that was right based on my previous conversation , so i kept challenging that until he admitted he was looking at the " wrong date ."
neutral	i then asked him to note that we do not want to have four rooms on one night and then have to move again on saturday with the second reservation .
neutral	he said it shouldn '_t be a problem , but that he would make a note , and that we should confirm at the desk when we check in .
neutral	we now have two confirmation numbers , one for each night .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	next time i '_ll do it on line with expedia .
neutral	difficult to fill in order form .
neutral	i kept having to refill rejected information .
neutral	took four tries to complete .
neutral	price was right for item i wanted but bad forms can be a tie breaker for future orders .
neutral	first time buyer here .
neutral	thought i ' d try it before committing and glad i did .
neutral	good service and choices .
neutral	however , the prices for fancy feast were higher_than most and the box of minced turkey had mostly dented cans .
neutral	disappointed in that .
neutral	i used to buy monthly from another site but they did away with the fancy feast .
neutral	if it weren '_t for the ' target practice ' on the case of cat_food , i would likely buy again but still looking for lowest_prices and best quality .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	( i did not throw the cans out because they weren '_t bubbled tops and can '_t afford to buy more so i thank god they seem to be ok . lower prices , would help .
neutral	my biggest complaint about paypal is that you can '_t add a note to the transactions to describe what you bought .
neutral	a bis hassle for keeping track of what items have been received , etc .
neutral	the bib sizing by height ( only ) is confusing .
positive	used this site many_times .
positive	i always start mysearch here .
positive	prices change daily and if you want to really research the price continually at many different sites , i have found cheaper cars elsewhere .
positive	however , if you don_'_t have a lot of time to research the price , this site has always been among the top three ( e . g ., cheapest ) of the ten sites i use to reserve a car .
positive	used ebay for sales and purchases for the past 00 years and it has worked out for me overall .
positive	only one issue in that time and they took_care of it to my satisfaction .
positive	a good source for information and a good way to " window shop " when your stuck indoors on a bad_weather day .
positive	used paypal for my buying and selling for the past 0 years and never had an issue they didn_'_t resolve to my satisfaction .

positive	also , the online reviews were helpful during the decision making process .
positive	first off i usually never get extended_warranties but when i purchased a hisense tv from tiger direct something told me to get the warranty and would you believe one month after the warranty expired the tv started to act up shuting off and on , i called square_trade and spoke to a fine gentleman who seemed to know the problem right off , he over nighted the parts and set_up a tv repair man in my area to come to my house to fix it , which he did in about an_hour and so_far i ' m a happy man . square_trade rules

positive	" when i met my last rescue pet , dixie , approximately 0 . 0 years_ago , she was a real mess -- both externally and internally .
positive	she exhibited a nervous condition ( g . e . r . d .)
positive	that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions ; that is to say , that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up !
positive	she was painfully emaciated , skeletal almost , and her blood - work was all over the place .
positive	so , after a round of iv fluids and 0 small bags of the ' science diet ' chow , dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home .
positive	the first thing i did was to research which pet foods would address her particular condition ; i knew that i didn_'_t want to keep her on the ' science diet ' regimen -- it '_s too full of ingredients which i feel don_'_t belong in a proper diet for dogs .
positive	lo ' and behold , i stumbled_upon the " blue_buffalo wilderness " formula for dogs .
positive	it seemed_like a good fit , due to all of the proper ratios ( protein / fat ) and is totally " grain - free ".
positive	viola !

positive	i was very impressed by your prompt and efficient delivery service , i received text messages informing_me what time to within an_hour my delivery would arrive , loved the items when they arrived , reasonable shipping rates , all in all , top_class .
positive	fast , easy and reliable .
positive	i know i '_ll get what i need when i need it .
positive	i am not one to buy merchandise warranties but because some of the items i '_ve purchsed over the last few years are hand held devices , used by our kids , i thought the likelihood of these devices getting damaged was very high ; square_trade offers accidental coverage of the warranties i '_ve purchased , i '_ve had to file a few claims and they have either fixed the item right_away , or paid for it without any hassles and right_away .
positive	their prices are totally worth it , especially if you can find a coupon .
positive	i '_ll keep using them for my electronic_purchases , especially with christmas right around the corner .

positive	i only deal with supplement_warehouse .
positive	i have placed 0 orders with memoryc in the past 0 months .
positive	one is always somewhat skeptical when dealing_with a new vendor , especially over the internet .
positive	i can '_t say_enough about the exemplary customer_service i received from memoryc .
positive	the first order : i was given a tracking_number and an approximate delivery date , while following the orders progress i noticed it seemed to be not making any progress , i emailed memoryc ...' hoping ' to get a response ... i received an immediate reply , through the course of several emails it was found out that my order and several others had been lost by shipper .
positive	memoryc immediately sent out a replacement shipment ... as it turned_out the shipper found the missing items , memoryc contacted me again and let me know that the quickest delivery would be with the original shipment .... the order was delivered within a day of the original delivery date ..... memoryc contacted me after i signed for the package and asked if everything was as it should be ... then gave me a credit for the freight i had paid on the order .... unbelievable !
positive	second order : no difference than the first order i was given a tracking_# and delivery date ... this time on time - actually ahead of time .
positive	the issue this time was my fault ... i had ordered the wrong memory for my laptop .... i emailed memoryc - they immediately gave me a rga and helped_me verify that i was ordering the right part #.
positive	as it turns_out , i sent the memory back in a us postal envelope .. somehow the envelope opened during transit and the memory was lost .... memoryc notified me and sent me a picture of the envelope when they received it .... what could i say at that point .... they said a lot .... they first offered me a voucher for a discount on my next order ... then turned around a few_days_later and give me the credit for the memory .... again unbelievable !
positive	giving me the credit was far and beyond there responsibility ... but very much appreciated !
positive	in this day and age of ' numbers ' - it is nice to find a company who cares , and one you can actually contact and get immediate answers and help .
positive	thank_you memoryc ....
positive	snelle levering , goeie service en niet duur .
