negative	they charged my fiance ' s credit_card for the same booking twice a week ago !!
negative	he called his bank and had bookit fax over the reservation so he could get a refund asap but his bank said after 0 days when they finally did recieve the fax from bookit there was some third - party company working with bookit who charged his card directly .
negative	so his bank said to call them ... when he did he was on hold another hour & they claimed they didn ' t see the charge so he had to call bookit again and be on hold for another hour just to be told he won ' t see his refund 0 - 00 business days !!
negative	what ??!!
negative	this is their mistake and now my entire family has to pay for it !!!
negative	that was his money and we needed it for our wedding !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i am so upset !!!!!!!!!
negative	never book with them they will scam you any chance they get !!
negative	they bank off interest from money they steal from you and use third_party companies to trip up your bank so you can ' t even get a refund from your bank !!!
negative	crusty business !!!!!
negative	worst ever !
negative	!
negative	we worked hard to send out email invitations for our customers past and present to leave reviews about their experience with us .
negative	trustpilot then called us to sign_up for their paid service and we declined because we used another review company at the present .
negative	0 week_later .. the handful of reviews we had on trustpilot were all taken down .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	this website is a scam !!
negative	bankrupt !!
negative	!
negative	since august 0000 i bought 0 bags for 0 . 000 €, which they never sent !!
negative	i tried to contact them by email , they took so long to reply , and only to tell me they were available and going to send them .
negative	so i waited … after a long while , i decided to cancel my orders and pick some other bags instead .
negative	i did this 0 times from august 0000 to now , mid_- february 0000 , more than 0 months !!!!!!
negative	and i ' m a good client , i spent more than 00 . 000 € in a year and they sent me most of what i ordered , even if it took 0 months for some !
negative	but since august , whenever i sent them emails , when they replied ( half of my messages were never answered ), they gave_me partial answers .
negative	on the 00 / 0000 i asked them to send me the bags or let me choose some others instead .
negative	they told me they cancelled the orders so i could pick something else .
negative	they didn ' t reply until the 00 / 00 to tell me they would check again .
negative	but i got sick of waiting so i asked my boyfriend , who is italian , to have a look , as his father is a police officer and he knows people in italy that could help me , so he called some governmental office to ask them about fashionqueen . net , and guess what ?!
negative	fashionqueen doesn ' t exist !!!
negative	it is not registered , the p . iva it00000000000 doesn ' t exist !
negative	!
negative	my boyfriend wrote an_email to fashionqueen to ask them to send me the bags and reply to the many emails i sent them , otherwise he would sue them in order to get a refund .
negative	and guess again ?!
negative	here is the answer :
negative	" dear customer

negative	good morning , i would know how long it will take yet ?
negative	the data regarding purchases are .
negative	the application number 000000000 and the number of screening gm000000000000000000 .
negative	i have had issues rebooking my flight , actually being_able to speak with someone , and so far have still not gotten it fixed after being transferred to several people .
negative	i will never purchase anything through them ever again .
negative	the only way this is being resolved is by united which has had wonderful support .
negative	i would advise to not support priceline .
negative	jeg_havde bestilt en computer ved proshop med forventet levering inden for 0 - 0 dage .
negative	da de dage er gået ringer jeg til_deres kundeservice der fortæller mig at den kommer om yderligere 0 dage .
negative	jeg_har_nu efter yderligere 0 dage kontaktet , hvor_jeg spørger ind_til problemet og hvorfor jeg er_blevet lovet noget de ikke_kan holde .
negative	medarbejderen beder mig om at lade være med at være flabet og fortæller mig at det har de aldrig sagt .
negative	altså er jeg både flabet og en løgner .
negative	de må åbenbart have kunder nok når de behandler dem på den måde
negative	ja så nu_har de mistet en kunde der eller har handlet ved dem i 00 år som privat og nu skulle have første bestilling som erhverv .
negative	men ak ja det_blev så den sidste og varen er nu også afbestilt
negative	boa noite ,
negative	tive ótimas indicações do site , mas já em minha 0ª compra tive problemas .
negative	efetuei uma compra no dia_00 / 00 / 0000 e até agora 00_dias depois , nenhum sinal do meu_produto no planeta terra , o código de rastreio que eles me deram até agora não aparece nada nos correios mundial .
negative	o código de rastreio é : ln000000000us
negative	pedido : 000000000
negative	fiz uma compra ja faz 00_dias e_nao chegou ainda , ja mandei email e ninguem responde , queria uma resposta , comprei varias vezes e gostaria de comprar muitas ainda , mais a gente nao tem uma resposta , to aguardando .
negative	email : alisson_alves0 @_hotmail . com .
negative	ordem 000000000 .
negative	i ordered items on 0 / 0 that i need to receive by 0 / 00 .
negative	i figured that 00 days was plenty of time to receive the order , even with 0 - 0 days of extra processing required .
negative	i have followed up via_email three times to check on the status of this order with no response .
negative	the only response i did receive was from the facebook_page , which assured me that my order would be in the mail by 0 / 0 or 0 / 0 .
negative	it ' s now 0 / 00 and i have yet to receive any communication about my order , even after following up via facebook .
negative	i have attempted to call but have been on hold for over 00 minutes each time , and my job doesn ' t allow me to sit on the phone on hold all day .
negative	i have emailed to ask for a refund and gotten no response .
negative	i am in my mid_- 00s and have never dealt_with a company like this before .
negative	ami clubwear , i have faith that you will respond and make this right , either with a shipping confirmation or a refund today .
negative	after paying for my order with my credit_card , they needed a scan of my id card before they would send me the code .
negative	customer_service was slow in responding , and after my order i asked if there was a way to avoid this hassle if i order from them again in the future .
negative	they did not even reply , though their customer_service emails said to enquire about how to become a verified customer .
negative	will not be buying from them again .
negative	i ' m sick of paypal limiting my and my friends accounts all the time .
negative	they don ' t do stuff like that in a normal bank , so why so much control for these people !
negative	and have you ever tried to call them ?
negative	don ' t , it costs a fortune .
negative	time someone stopped their rampage !!
negative	!
negative	if you want to know how they really are , just ask someone that have bought_simcity 0000 to them .
negative	they were selling bunches of keys of the game on " pre_- order " months before the release_date , promising they would get the key 0 days before the release .
negative	the keys were hungarian ( not multi_- language ) and " unexpectedly " the majority of people didn ' t want to play in hungarian .
negative	what they basically did on the release_date is to ignore all the pre_- orders and continue selling more expensive multi_- language keys to new customers ( who were going to pay more for it ) while lying the pre_- order customers with empty promises and broken deadlines ( around 00 broken deadlines ) about when were they going to get what they paid for months_ago .
negative	today is the release day , i ' m a pre_- order customer , it ' s 00 : 00 and i don ' t have the key i bought to them long ago and should have arrived 0 days_ago .
negative	there are quite a lot of people like me and no explanations .
negative	well , some of the ones that have got theirs say their keys were already used ( and now have kind of a second problem ).
negative	i just recommend you to run away from their services as far as you can .
negative	took them almost 0 weeks to just to send an in stock battery out and refuse to be fair on returning it .
negative	00 days to get it to my house !
negative	by_far the best prices i have seen , they will even beat out anyone_else with a good deal .
negative	but afetr purchasing several_times from the site i have repeatedly received the wrong order , paying for a 00 serving container and getting a 00 when it arrived , then after contacting them , they told me to send it back and they would issue me what i paid for .... yet again sent the wrong_size for what i paid .
negative	then get put on hold for over an_hour trying to reach customer_service , then told that due to their customer_service office being closed i have to call back during their hours of operation .
negative	good afternoon .
negative	about the order 000000000 of 0 / 00 / 00 , did not get the products .
negative	please check in your system if there was any return of the brazilian postal service ( correios ) to the iherb inc .
negative	what should i do in this case ?
negative	i look_forward to returning soon .
negative	000 days have passed
negative	i ' d_rather pay extra at the competitors and receive human like support and treatment .
negative	i ' ve been waiting for over a week for a full answer on how to get the deluxe content for far_cry 0 .
negative	instead i get pointless answers and links that provide no useful info with broken image for screenshots .
negative	at the end of each reply from your support i get a sentence like " i see you no_longer need our assistance ..." what makes you think so if you ' ve never asked if i need further assistance ?
negative	even ea support is better_than what you provide and that should show you how badly you provide support .
negative	at the end you ask me to write a nice review ... well after over a week .. here i am writing a review .
negative	keep out !
negative	heute wurde irgendwas gekauft über mein paypal , als_ich die email auf meinem handy erhalten habe , habe_ich mich sofort bei paypal versucht einzuloggen und habe den fall reklamiert , anstatt mein geld zurück zu holen oder sonstiges wird nun auf die antwort des verkäufers gewartet , abwohl die adresse die angegeben wurde nicht stimmt bzw verändert wurde .
negative	paypal behält das geld sowohl vom käufer als auch verkäufer ein und bereichert sich so an zinsen .
negative	um probleme zu klären benötigt paypal oft wochen , bis sich endlich was tut .
negative	wenn dieser fall beendet ist , werde ich mein konto bei paypal löschen , hier wird keinerlei sicherheit gewährt .
negative	mit kreditkarte oder bankeinzug kann ich auch anders bezahlen , dafür brauche ich kein paypal mehr , zu mal die sicherheit bei paypal gleich 0 ist !
negative	!
negative	i bought months_ago skyrim box and got it broken , cjs said on facebook i will get a refunde , i ` m still_waiting to get my refunde to purchase another game with that .
negative	as i posted it to facebook they canceld me on it , so i can ` t write anything on the wall .
negative	supporter ( cj poh ) told me that the nw sniper_elite dlc will cost 0 , 00 gbp and i will see my refunde when i buy and pay the item , now the dlc cost 0 , 00 gbp and i still can ` t use or see any refunde !
negative	arcor gibt_es zwar nicht mehr und ist nun vodafone , doch als_ich im jahr 0000 einen arcorvertrag abgeschlossen hatte , war ich ansich relativ zu freden , abgesehen davon dass ich von dsl 0000 nur dsl 0000 empfangen habe und mein nachbar direkt neben mir dsl 0000 hatte , nach einigen jahren hatte_ich dann massive probleme , so dass ich alle 00 - 00 sekunden vom internet flog , dieser fehler wurde nie behoben also reichte ich meine kündigung ein , diese wurde aber nicht akzeptiert womit ich dann per anwalt die kündigung einreichen musste .
negative	0 jahre später hebt eine inkasso firma vo arcor 000 € von meinem konto ab , die ich bis heute nicht zurück bekommen habe .
negative	ich_habe damals ein paket von gmx geschenkt bekommen , das filme , serien usw kostenlos angeboten hatte , leider gibt_es bei maxdome nun neue pakete , wodurch mein paket unnötig geworden ist , da man die filme auch als free - user kostenlos sehen kann , auch der dazu gehörige bereich ist_sehr bedürftig .
negative	in meinem paket sind fast nur filme die erotik beinhalten oder serien , wo man nur 0 oder 0 episoden sehen kann und_das oft in schlechter qualität .
negative	serien die im tv bereits gelaufen sind , sind 0 tag kostenlos zum anschauen dabei , am nächsten tag wird diese wieder in die teuren pakete geschoben , weil angeblich keine lizens ist_für das jeweilige paket .
negative	nur ein tag darf es laufen und dann nicht mehr , schon eigenartig !
negative	ich würde maxdome nicht weiterempfählen , jedenfalls nicht als free user oder user mit einem film paket , der nicht auf erotik filme steht .
negative	zugegeben ich_habe mir erst heute , 00 tage nach reservierung für einen transporter , den ich mitte februar brauche , die reservierungsmail durchgelesen .
negative	beim gespräch vor ort wurde mir unter zeugen ( 0 freunde waren dabei ) gesagt , ich hätte bei einem transporter unbegrenzte kilometer , der sei sogar günstiger als ein 0 - sitzer ( den ich auch nehmen hätte können ).
negative	in der reservierungsbestätigung stehen jetzt 000km !!
negative	" sowas gäbe es seit 00 jahren nicht , ich mache das ja nicht erst seit heute ", da mag der gute mann recht haben , aber dann sollte man darauf achten , dass man kompetente mitarbeiter hat , die zumindest die eigenen angebote lesen und dem kunden erklären können .
negative	freundlich geblieben sind die mitarbeiter alle ( vor ort , also ffm west , in der telefonzentrale , da direkter telefonservice besetzt war , und am telefon von ffm west ) dennoch eine unverschämtheit mir zu unterstellen zu lügen .
negative	wie gesagt zwei freunde , also zeugen waren dabei .
negative	ob es das angebot gibt oder nicht , heute oder vor 00 jahren , ist mir egal .
negative	dann sollen sie es mir aber auch nicht anbieten .
negative	war dann wohl das letzte mal europcar , bei anderen anbietern hatte_ich nie probleme , außerdem sind die meist günstiger .
negative	fiz uma compra dia_00 / 00 / 0000 e_ainda não chegou meu_pedido !
negative	!
negative	order 000000000
negative	i decided to use wepay for a surprise birthday_party that i was planning for my fiance in hawaii to collect all of the funds for the group tickets as hawaii airlines allows one point of contact to purchase the tickets only .
negative	wepay seemed to be the most logical choice as it provided transparency of funds for everyone traveling in the group .
negative	i set_up the account in feb 0000 .
negative	at first it was fine , i was able to speak to a live person and they were generally great .
negative	however during the course of the months apparently their policy has changed where you are able to speak to a live person everything is via_email .
negative	they never sent a notification of this policy change .
negative	so noew the trip purchasing date is approaching and ppl are beginning to pay and i check the account and wepay has added a 00 day hold on all funds two_weeks before i have to buy the tickets !
negative	! 0 never mind that i initially had reserves removed when i was able to speak with a live person back in march , but somehow they were added back to the account without me knowing .
negative	i contact them and they ask for more verifying info fb , address etc and they release the funds .
negative	a few_days_later another person pays and again reserves are placed back on the account !
negative	i contact them and now a new person is telling me they need to verify my ss # and so i give them that and i even uploaded the flight contract from hawaiian airlines so that they could see i am not running some fraud event .
negative	i have heard_nothing from them in 0 days and they still have my friends money on hold that he expects to be applied to his ticket which may not occur due to wepay ' s ineptitude in handling online transactions .
negative	they are not better_than paypal , albeit surprisingly worse .
negative	stay far away from this company if you require expediency , transparency and customer_service that involves talking on the phone to a real_person .
negative	ironically they ask for all of this personal_information but you cant event talk to a person ... reeks of shadiness to me and i have placed fraud alerts on my credit_reports as a result as i do not trust this fly by night company that changes policies without informing customers ... a bank or cc company would never do that as you are dealing_with people ' s funds and transparency and information are paramount !
negative	do not use !
negative	!
negative	här är vad som jag har skrivit på deras sida på engelska :
negative	i have booked a flight via this awful company on feb 0st .
negative	since then my flight has been changed several_times because of a problem that the airline was experiencing and they had nothing to do as a third company .
negative	it sounds quite fair in the way they , as a company put it so .
negative	the final change was done , april 00 .
negative	after struggling long enough while asking for earlier flights , i was forced to accept it ..
negative	however i then realised this causes me a night at the airport because of lack of transportations , i called again and asked for a possible change since this was not what i have booked or wanted .
negative	and just then i got informed by them that there are earlier flights ( all of a sudden ) but i need to pay extra for them .
negative	?
negative	?
negative	paying extra for a flight that i have already booked in the very beginning and it has been changed many_times ?
negative	even if i have mentioned in my complaint that i needed an earlier flight which i have already paid for not to sleep in some crappy airport ?
negative	now i am waiting to be contacted again so that i can know how much i need to pay extra for the flight that i have already planned / booked / paid for in the very beginning .
negative	i find this whole policy ugly , careless and rude .
negative	i feel_like i have been fooled .
negative	one does deserve to be treated as a valuable passenger .
negative	not someone that can be milked by some smart company with a careless policy .
negative	please do not use them unless you want priceless anxiety , irritation and waste of energy !!!!!

negative	about a week ago i bought far_cry 0 deluxe_edition .
negative	i received the key via mail and tried to activate it on u play but , the key was invalid .
negative	so i wrote an e_- mail to them and now a week_later still nothing , no response .
negative	i ' m really pissed of about it and just want my money back .
negative	so to all the poeple : don " t buy games at this store
negative	after being told there are cd_keys for battlefield_0 available in stock a second after i purchased 0 cd_keys i was told that now i need to wait up to 00 hours cause there are none any left .
negative	i am sad to inform you that it ' s been almost 0 days now without_any reason given by the company to this shameless behavior .
negative	i paid a lot of money for what i was expecting would be a quality suit , and received a very poorly fit suit of cheap material .
negative	after contacting their support_ticket staff , my conversation with a man named stefano was unhelpful and at times incoherent .
negative	the company refused to correct their mistake , which would do no harm or extra cost to them , and only take mere minutes of their time .
negative	i was hoping to buy more suits and clothing from them in the future , but i no_longer think that i want to do that !!
negative	!
negative	overall , don ' t throw your money away on a suit with this company !!
negative	!
negative	edit_: finally , when i had to leave for business and was going to be unavailable for a few weeks , somebody decided to take over the situation and help me .
negative	because of my leave ( over which i had no choice ), they closed their offer to help .
negative	very unprofessional company .
negative	will update should any changes occur .
negative	yodel was supposed to deliver a phone to me then apparently " attempted " delivery without leaving a calling card .
negative	i rescheduled , they didn ' t deliver and said there was no log of a rescheduling .
negative	this continued for an entire week before they admitted they didn ' t know where my parcel was .
negative	appalling .
negative	these_guys have messed me around big - time .
negative	despite paying a lot of money for air - freight , they allowed my boxes to sit in the uk ( for dispatch to new_york ) for two_weeks , before they sent me an invoice .
negative	despite this delay they have then failed to give me a delivery day or to hurry things along .
negative	no one at their call centres seems to know what ' s going on and no - one seems to want to help either , i am just promised call backs ( some of which i haven ' t received ).
negative	how difficult can it be to put 0 boxes on a plane to new_york from london .....?
negative	in this case it seems nearly impossible .
negative	ola gostaria de deixar aqui a minha reclamacao , gosto muito de coprar na suppz pelo otimo valor dos produtos e as promocaes que sempre tem .
negative	o meu problema e uma compra do mes de dezembro que ate hoje esta no processo e_nao consta como enviado em minha conta entro em contato com a loja e_nao tenho retorno !
negative	!
negative	depois deste problema continuo comprando mais queria resolver esta pendencia
negative	didn ' t even get past the registration stage ......
negative	added items to my basket - the 0 for 0 on swimwear - said all items were in stock - got to the payment stage and the final amount looked too much , was then informed that one of my items actually wasn ' t in stock so i needed to find something else - ok , did that - but then there was a notification saying that i wasn ' t allowed a mixture of cash account and credit account - i thought i had opened a credit account becuase i wanted to use the £_00 voucher - phoned ther customer services and was told that i needed to call back tomorrow to open a credit account or pay for items over the phone but i couldn ' t use the voucher and she couldn ' t amend my account - and you can ' t use the £_00 voucher if you pay for the goods in full .
negative	if i could give this company 0 out of 0 i probably would ..... won ' t be completing my order with isme .
negative	the flowers were of poor_quality .
negative	my complaint was answered , however i was asked to provide photographs as proof .
negative	unfortunately this wasn ' t an option and i couldn ' t take my complaint any further .
negative	they have always been good for me in the past , but this time i don ' t know what went wrong .
negative	so i ordered with them , they took my money .
negative	the flowers didn ' t arrive at all .
negative	so i placed a second order , the service was really poor and then the replacement arrived dead and there were only a few flowers , i did have lots of grass and dead looking trea .
negative	the people from this business are very bad and they tried to bribe me to remove all of my reviews , by stating that i may and i stress " may " be able to have a second discount .
negative	please avoid this really bad flower shop .
negative	avoid avoid .
negative	i had booked a room that slept 0 people .
negative	at the time of booking it was just 0 adults and 0 child but it then changed to 0 adults and 0 child .
negative	i called customer_service as a courtesy to add the 0rd adult .
negative	this would in no way change the type of room i had originally booked which slept 0 people .
negative	the customer_service rep wanted to charge me more stating that when i booked the room i paid a lesser price then what the room currently went for .
negative	why am i being charged like its a new reservation i ' m simply adding a 0rd person to a room that sleeps 0 ?
negative	if we had been adding more people then the room slept then obviously i ' d expect an up charge at the current rate to completely change the room .
negative	not to mention that i had checked the rates just prior to calling and they were actually less_than what i had originally paid .
negative	the rep continued to argue with me about the price so i had her cancel the reservation in which i have to wait for a refund .
negative	i had to re - book my reservation myself in which i ultimately paid less_than when i originally booked but remember the rep was trying to charge me more .
negative	this is all around terrible customer_service that instead of just assisting me and adding a name to the book she caused more of a headache .
negative	i will never use bookit . com again and i will see that others know they will try to screw you over .
negative	don ' t bother calling customer_service instead do their job for them .
negative	booked a trip to disneyworld .
negative	they booked us through delta with a layover in atlanta .
negative	our flight from atlanta to florida was scheduled to leave six minutes after our arrival in atlanta .
negative	thank_god the flight was delayed , otherwise we would have missed our flight to orlando .
negative	the shuttle service desk was closed because we arrived after midnight and the kiosk wouldn ' t scan our vouchers , so we had to pay $_000 to get our family to the hotel , one way .
negative	the agency allowed us to book one bedroom for five people even_though it was against hotel policy .
negative	the hotel had to make an exception in our case because it was already booked .
negative	$_00 a night for a cot .
negative	our itinerary clearly read " 0room 0 beds for 0 people , breakfast included ."
negative	when we tried to redeem our breakfast vouchers the hotel pointed out that they only ever assign two breakfast vouchers per room .
negative	something bookit was completely unaware of .
negative	first day of vacation and i am absolutely livid .
negative	the customer_service representative i spoke with ( after an_hour of transfers and holds ) was completely rude and condescending .
negative	he refused to connect me to his supervisor and would not even repeat his name for me . this agency needs to gather accurate information about the companies they book , present all correct information to their customers , and treat their customers with respect .
negative	do not book with bookitnow .
negative	i will tell all my friends the same thing .
negative	0 days to process order and asked for cancellation ... order sent then !
negative	i only wish i had read these reviews before purchasing from this company , as i can relate to all of the negative_reviews .
negative	i have never , in my entire life , dealt_with a more unprofessional company nor one with worse customer_service !
negative	they clearly just want to take customer ' s money and don ' t care about repeat business .
negative	whatever you do , do not buy from amiclubwear !!

negative	without customers you can go home , you will be an homeless
negative	be very very careful booking from this website .
negative	in my case they advertised one hotel but the reservation confirmation was for another lower profile cheap hotel from the same chain .
negative	firstly the customer_service guy tried to persuade me the hotel listed in the confirmation is the same one i wanted , then after realising they made a mistake on the website blamed me for misreading the advert and refused to refund in full .
negative	next_day the issue on the website was fixed and still they don ' t accept there was an_issue .
negative	can clearly see it on google chached pages though ...
negative	the cancellation_policy said i could cancel by 00 feb when the booking was made on 00th leaving me negative amount of days to cancel ...
negative	rubbish !
negative	still can ' t get my money back !
negative	i ' ve purchased " steamer buddy " from wowcher but wasn ' t satisfied with the product , so decided to return it .
negative	i contacted wowcher customer_service and they came back to me saying they were going to contact the seller .
negative	weeks past but nothing happened , no responce from neither wowcher nor the seller .
negative	i tried to contact them couple more times but all my emails were ignored .
negative	another example of poor service was recently when i couldn ' t book the appointment with the service provider and hence wanted to transfer the money to voucher credit .
negative	no luck contacting wowcher customer services team .
negative	upon return from my flight ( delayed due to weather ) i was a few hours late .
negative	i called to let them know to make_sure i wouldn ' t have to pay for an extra day or overages .
negative	being a frequent traveler , this has happened several_times and previously they have been great .
negative	they said as long as i returned on the same return day on my contract , i was fine .
negative	well upon_arrival , they charged me a full extra day taxes and all .
negative	i was really upset and they refused to let me off property until i paid it .
negative	i have called several_times to speak to a manager and no one has ever called me back .
negative	i will never park here again .
negative	fyi they did this as_well to the 0 other people behind me .
negative	lying thieves .
negative	unacceptable , such a scam .
negative	take me by my word , never ever trust this site !!
negative	they lie and swindle you out of your money .
negative	they take the amount off your card , and when you arrive to the hotel you supposedly booked , there is no reservation to be found .
negative	considering they don ' t have a working phone_number for you to call , you are pretty_much out of luck at that point .
negative	you can email them , but they never get back to you .
negative	so , they have your money and your are left to scrape up extra cash you may not have ( which was the case with my experience ) to attempt to find a reasonable hotel that isn ' t absolutely disgusting , and are left to eat $ 0 pizzas for the weekend .
negative	thank_you olotels for ruining my vacation !
negative	order_#_000000000 from 0 , october 0000 .
negative	never received not a single signal of the item .
negative	fahrer die kein deutsch können , 0 wochen zu spät geliefert obwohl termin stand , angeblich die rechnung nicht beglichen deshalb ständig rechnungen mit mahnkosten , unfreundliche telefontanten , viele streitgespräche in denen der kunde als blöd hingestellt wird , keine ahnung von_dem was sie machen !
negative	total enttäuscht !
negative	leider musste ich ein stern geben um bewerten zu können eigentlich kein stern eher mit minus davor !
negative	at first i was excited to order from parts_geek with all the incentives of fast shipping and great pricing .
negative	once received the part i went to install it and the transmission mount was made incorrectly and caused the bolts to cross thread into my transmission ....
negative	it was a design flaw .... now i not only have the wrong part .... i have to have the threads re - tapped by a machinist .
negative	i sent parts_geek and " customer support_ticket " and a explanation of my situation .
negative	the sent me an ra number with no apology and stated i am responsible for the shipping back .... after trying to contact them by phone ..... " good_luck "!
negative	i would wait 00 min on the phone then the the irv stated i should fill_out a ticket and submit it via internet due to heavy call volume ... hummmm this has been the same response i have received all week .
negative	i would then submit a customer support_ticket .... multiple_times ... no response !
negative	i briefly explained my situation and asked them to please call me in regards .. etc .
negative	and left my contact number .
negative	i have worked for home shopping network customer_service and after having this type of customer_service i will never order from parts_geek again !
negative	i will tell_everyone the same !
negative	horrible horrible horrible customer_service !!!!!!!!!!
negative	for better words .. no customer_service ....
negative	don ' t buy goods from them .
negative	they take_forever to ship .
negative	this is not the first time this has happened .
negative	when you contact them , they give you the same generic response .
negative	this last order is going to take almost 0 weeks to get to me .
negative	it ' s not enough they claim 0 and half weeks .
negative	( which i think is not right ) we ' re a small company of 00 and can manage shipping 0000 orders a day .
negative	добрый день !
negative	покупали на tripsta . ru билеты из иркутска на о . сайпан со стыковкой в сеуле еще в октябре .
negative	через некоторое время авиакомпания сдвинула рейсы на один день и стыковка получилась очень неудобная , т . к .
negative	приходилось оформлять визу в корею .
negative	просили их поменять билет на другое направление , но мне ответили , что авиакомпания , которая выписывала билеты , ничего поменять не может - только вернуть деньги .
negative	поэтому решили отказаться от этой поездки и вернуть полную стоимость .
negative	со мной сразу связалась девушка , сказала что все будет ок , полный возврат сделаем .
negative	00 . 00 . 00 бронь была аннулирована , сказали , что деньги придут в течение 00 дней .
negative	прошло уже 00 дней , а денег я так и не получил - а сумма там совсем не маленькая !!!
negative	по телефону каждый раз говорят , что либо система не работает , либо бухгалтеры разберутся , либо " нужно еще некоторое время , связанное с банковскими операциями "..
negative	по истечении 00 дней связался с авиакомпанией , ответа которой мне достаточно для успешного судебного дела !
negative	в случае отсутствия адекватной реакции со стороны tripsta в ближайшее время , переписка с авиакомпанией будет обнародована и я буду подавать в суд на эту компанию .
negative	так же будут проинформированы все компетентные органы в нашей стране и греции , на территории которой данная компания зарегистрирована .
negative	been promised to have the key before the release_date at max 0 - 0 hours , and as you can see in my opinion , nothing was received and they failed big time , i had to buy it from blizzard store to play it .
negative	i ordered a pair of red shoes in september .
negative	when they arrived , they were pink .
negative	so they said they would correct the issue .
negative	once again , they sent me pink .
negative	so they said they ' d send the correct ones .
negative	now i ' m being told that the red ones are out of stock .
negative	and yet , when you go on their website , i can order those shoes still !!
negative	!
negative	in the mean time , my wedding is in 0 weeks & my dress has been altered for these shoes that they are lying to me & telling me i can ' t have .
negative	i will never order from them again !!
negative	!
negative	bought something .
negative	it did not match the photo on the website .
negative	i asked for a refund and they said i had to send it back to china .
negative	so i paid shipping to send back to china .
negative	they kept the item and refused to refund my money back .
negative	they have not responded to my emails .
negative	no key , no support , no money .
negative	this store should be closed
negative	fatalna obsługa !
negative	zamówiłam sukienkę i okazało się , że jest podarta .
negative	stwierdziłam , że w takiej sytuacji już jej nic chce , wiec ją odesłałam .
negative	do tej pory nie dostałam zwrotu pieniędzy :/
negative	i was sold a invalid battlefield_0 key so i was unable to activate the game to my origin account .
negative	i contacted cjs_cd_keys multiple_times with very little response or help to solve the issue .
negative	so i ` ve got a free domain when they had an offer last_year and now without even suspecting i am forced to pay 00_euros before i can actually cancel my account .
negative	i think they are a money grabber scam hosting " company ".
negative	i don ` t recommend anyone buying from them because the hosting is bad , few options to customise it , and again , very bad and slow as hell .
negative	don ` t get fooled by some promotional offer because you will pay for it whole in the end .
negative	the customer_service cannot do a single thing for you .
negative	they just send your email to some supervisor who apparently responds to one issue a day .
negative	haven ' t been able to use my card in over a week .
negative	customer_service on the phone is full of apologies and no answers .
negative	reporting you guys to the better business buro stop running the company out of your grandmothers basement .
negative	after having tried for two times for my requested refund , i still couldn_’ t get a clear answer .
negative	that ’ s asos for you !
negative	my order for a few shorts and tees were so poorly met , i wondered on what makes them a name in business .
neutral	i wish the website had a decent search feature , and that it didn ' t load all of the pictures one - at - a - time when browsing large categories .
neutral	it was nearly impossible for me to find what i was looking for because the page kept jumping around while the pictures were loading .
neutral	i liked the shopping_experience the last few_times i ' ve_shopped here .
neutral	however , the flats were the only shoes that seemed to not break .
neutral	i got a pair of high heels that broke after the first use .
neutral	i guess as long as you get the flats you ' re good to go .
neutral	synes amazon er en ganske fin hjemmeside , men jeg mener det_er_meget svært_at finde_ud_af hvilke sælgere der sender til dk og hvilke der_ikke gør .
neutral	jeg mener det_er problematisk at jeg først kan se om jeg overhovedet kan få tingene sendt til_mig når_det_er jeg er ved at betale .
neutral	derud over synes_jeg det_er svært_at se hvor afsender kommer fra , dermed er_det svært_at regne ud om man_skal betale told eller ej når tingene kommer til dk

neutral	took a while to receive my key since it was out of stock but in the end i got it after a couple of hours .
neutral	missing items in shipment , website charged me twice , they fixed some issues but it was a frustrating experience .
neutral	will only shop in store from now on , which is great .
neutral	we have many online businesses and refuse to allow any review site to take control of our reputation - if they choose too .
neutral	you are maybe asking for trouble if you sign_up
neutral	*** updated ( after 0 months of usage ) ...
neutral	i ' ve changed our original rating from 0 star to 0_stars .. we ' ve not yet had a negative review and was expecting one or two from known competitors who do this sort of thing .
neutral	if we do receive a fake negative review i am confident now that we can report the review as fake and have it removed without too much aggravation .
neutral	there shipping is to high on some of there stuff
neutral	service is good but abit to slow for me i waited 00 hours before someone replyed at my problem .
neutral	good , but if you comparison shop you can 00 % the time find a better deal be it shipping or more items , amazon is often misleading with the number of items to be sent .
neutral	sipgate ist_für voip ganz gut , allerdings ist die qualität nicht so toll , auch gibt_es immer mal wieder ausfälle oder man hört sich selbst beim telefonieren .
neutral	der preis ist_für 00 . 00_€ für ganz eu ok , allerdings kostet das bei meinem kabel anbieter sogar monatlich nur 0 . 00 €, weshalb ich vermutlich auch kündigen werde .
neutral	das handyapp für android funktioniert fast garnicht , was ich schlecht finde , da man das gut gebrauchen kann unterwegs für festnetzanrufe .
neutral	0 von 0 sternen , weil der preis ok ist und man sipgate überall nutzen kann wenn_man z . b ein laptop hat und_die sipgate telefonsoftware downloadet , unabhängig wo man gerade im urlaub ist .
neutral	( habe es oft in costa_rica , peru und argentinien benutzt und ab einer dsl leitung von 0000 läuft auch die verbindung der gespräche flüssig )
neutral	bei ebay findet man tolle schnäppchen , leider ist ebay nur noch zum kaufen empfählenswert , durch die hohen kosten die ein verkäufer hat lohnt es sich fast nicht mehr etwas anzubieten da man einstellgebühren bezahlt + 0 % vom gewinn abgeben muss , wenn_man als verkäufer paypal anbietet sind es sogar 00 , 0 %+ 00 cent .
neutral	das ebay gebühren von verkäufer nimmt finde ich etwas dreist , der einzige käuferschutz , den man bei ebay wirklich hat ist paypal und durch den hohen betrag bieten immer weniger verkäufer diese option an , so dass bei einem betrug leider nichts mehr helfen kann .
neutral	zwar kann_man bei ebay auf " problem klären " klicken , jedoch bekommt man dann nach einer gewissen zeit die antwort , das ebay nicht helfen kann , weil nicht über paypal bezahlt wurde .
neutral	fazit : da ebay immer teurere gebühren anbietet , werden auch die preise bei ebay teurer von den verkäufern , was schnäppchen nur noch selten macht , aufgrund der hohen paypal kosten , bieten immer weniger verkäufer diese option an und damit ist auch keine sicherheit mehr beim einkauf gegeben .
neutral	daher nur 0 von 0 sternen .
neutral	ich_habe zum ersten mal bei dell was bestellt und_bin recht zufrieden , leider bekommt man kaum treiberupdates für seine geräte und_auch der download ist ziemlich problematisch .
neutral	abwohl ich ein dell pc habe funktioniert der dell downloader nicht , dagegen aber die iso variante oder direktdownload .
neutral	der support ist_sehr hilfsbereit und wenn es wirklich mal eng wird , kann dell sogr auf den pc ( ähnlich wie mit teamviewer ) und so das problem vielleicht beseitigen .
neutral	ich_habe bei dell einen xps 00 mit 0d brille und grafikkarte + bildschirm gekauft , der laptop ist super , die 0d funktion allerdings nicht sehr .
neutral	bestellt hatte_ich ein nvidia 0d kit das den sensor separat dabei hatte , bei dem ansich nämlich auch " duke nukem " kostenlos dabei sein sollte von nvidia , leider bekam ich nur die brille geliefert die für den preis überteuert war , da die brille einzeln nur 00_€ kostet und hingegen das komplette kit 000 €.
neutral	auch scheint die 0d funktion nicht ganz richtig zu sein , wenn_man anvisiert kann_man nie die mitte treffen , man muss mit_dem kurser ziemlich nach links oder rechts gehen .
neutral	ich vergebe dell deshalb nur 0 von 0 sternen .
neutral	man_bekommt bei pearl als kunde sehr oft kostenlose angebote , leider muss man auch bei geschenken 0 € versand bezahlen , unabhängig vom gewicht .
neutral	oft sind die gratis geschenke minderwertig , gehen schnell kaputt oder funktionieren erst garnicht .
neutral	bei einem gratis geschenk , bekam ich sogar einen virus , weil die treiber vom hersteller verseucht waren und dieser deswegen vom markt genommen wurde , leider habe_ich das zu spät bei google gelesen als_ich nach guten treibern suchte .
neutral	als_ich dies dem support mitteilte , kam keine reaktion .
neutral	auch gibt_es erst bei einer ziemlich hohen summe " kostenlose lieferung ", wo viele ab 00_€ schon kostenlos anbieten .
neutral	der_versand dauert je nach bestellung bis zu 0 - 0 wochen und kommt voll gefüllt mit werbung .
neutral	ordered the parts for next_day delivery via_paypal , no e_- mail acknowledgement from gsf only from paypal , parts didn ' t arrive , phone ' d gsf to be told shipment had gone to the wrong depot and they eventually arrived very late the following_day with no appology , was unable to track the shipment .
neutral	i ordered 0 boxes of protein_bars on december_00th .
neutral	it is now december 00rd and i have yet to receive it ( according to fedex probably another day or 0 ).
neutral	the price was unbeatable ( believe me i checked ) however the shipping is way too slow ( 0 weeks is a long time to wait ).
neutral	overall i ' d probably order from pothek again since the savings outweigh the wait time however i recommend ordering far in_advance of when you plan to run out of your stock at home .
neutral	i have ordered off this site before , everything has been fine but i ordered a battlefield bad company 0 cd_key and sadly its not working :(
neutral	awesome service .
neutral	too many ads though .
neutral	some privacy concerns too .
neutral	i was happy to find a goodlooking wood - look skin for my iphone 0 on carbon fibre skins for a very very good price .
neutral	i got it quickly ( live in belgium ) and in good order .
neutral	however , i was a disappointed to see that the skin was not exactly as shown on the site : there are two extra holes on the front of the phone ( i can see why this is necessairy , but i would ' ve like to see these on the picture , since there are more elegant ways to balance them ) and all the ' grain ' of the wood goes in exactly the opposite direction as on the picture .
neutral	this might seem like a detail , i really_liked the horizontal wood grain on the back and got a vertical one instead .
neutral	for real wood , this would be understandable , but not for a vinyl skin ...
neutral	the quality of the skin and the glue is very good , the woodlook is very well done , and the fit on the back and sides is perfect .
neutral	interface is still inferior to airbnb , however .
neutral	also users in brazil generally have no experience with such sites and are very unreliable .
neutral	i chose this company as they supplied the super king sized mattress we needed , had great reviews and their mattresses used coolmax .
neutral	we were worried that a memory foam mattress would make us hot , so coolmax was important to us .
neutral	the purchase was easy , the mattress arrived quickly and rolled up in a way that made it easy to carry upstairs .
neutral	the only glitch was that we sweated like pigs on this mattress , so much so , we need to get a new one !
neutral	this website was cool and full if information , but it has been offline for a while .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	just improve your comunication , confirmation , and updates to customers , im not sure if ill return , i felt very mistreated as a customer who is spending 000 bucks !
neutral	!
neutral	u guys can be better_than that cheers !!!!!
neutral	!

neutral	obrigado .
neutral	clothes : huge_variety of stuff .
neutral	i like how they have a style for everyone , and the pictures are good for inspiration and getting a feel on how they ' ll look .
neutral	but overall , most of the items ( i mostly shop in the <$ 00 category ) are either sized inconveniently or improperly , made of cheap materials , have not been sewn together properly , or they ' ll totally be different from what i had imaged from the pictures .
neutral	i have even bought items from their higher - up selection and from brands like click and dodostyle , but they have not satisfied me either .
neutral	half of the time , i ' ve returned most or all of my order because they didn ' t fit well ( according to the measurements , they should fit ), bad sewing ( the lines aren ' t always straight and sometimes the thread falls out all over the place ), or it just didn ' t feel good due to material ( i once bought a coat that felt like cardboard even_though it was " cotton ."
neutral	overall : a huge_selection that lacks substance .
neutral	customer_service : suburb !
neutral	they ' re friendly , quick , and i have not had any_issues with returning my items or asking about questions .
neutral	shipping and returns : shipping prices are pretty good , given the fact that they ' re shipping from asia , but i still would like to see better shipping rates and choices .
neutral	i ' ve_gotten used to waiting for 0 - 0 weeks for my stuff , so i wouldn ' t mind a few more days and paying for an economy shipping option that ' s going for $ 0 -$ 0 .
neutral	my biggest_complaint is their inability to give you refunds .
neutral	i don ' t mind using credits for physical stores where i can walk in and try the clothes on , but for an online store , it is really inconvenient .
neutral	after my first purchase here , i was so displeased with my items , that i didn ' t want to continue shopping here .
neutral	but alas , i thought i ' d be happy with everything and ordered even_though i was weary about their return_policy .
neutral	now it ' s my 0th time ordering , and i ' m still trying to use up all my credits because i keep having to return stuff .
neutral	if their return_policy was better , i ' d give it an extra star .
neutral	overall : good shipping , but inconvenient return_policy .
neutral	overall : yesstyle has a lot of variety (+) that varies in quality and fit (-).
neutral	their customer_service is good (+) but their shipping rates and return_policy could be better (-).
neutral	would i recommend this to my friend ?
neutral	maybe , but on the verge of probably not .
neutral	although they have styles i wouldn ' t be able to find in an american mall , i just haven ' t been satisfied with all of my attempts here .
neutral	i needed to contact priceline in order to add another name to my hotel reservation since i had been delayed by weather and the other person was at the hotel but couldn ' t be admitted to the room .
neutral	i called priceline on my cell_phone to make the change and found that i needed to use a touch tone phone rather_than my cell_phone to navigate the menu .
neutral	i was at an airport terminal building and had to locate a touch tone phone in order to complete the call .
neutral	this makes no sense to me .
neutral	i was pressed for time and the use of my cell_phone would have made the transaction much simpler and faster .
neutral	i was also talking to a non - english speaking person_who never did get things right .
neutral	i needed information faxed to circus circus at reno nevada and i think it went to las_vegas since it never reached the reno location .
neutral	its cheap , you shoud go there .
neutral	i ordered top secret nutrition ' s 000_% whey and received a free thing of astravar .
neutral	also there are alot of free_gifts that you can pick_up if you want to which is awesome .
neutral	the only problem is that the shipping was 00 dollars and only got more expensive with the free items you choose .
neutral	if you need the item that is free then the slight increase in shipping is well worth it though .
neutral	overall , i think if you find one of the deals ( like free astravar ) it is well worth it .
neutral	but if the price of the product is only a little_bit cheaper_than another site and they have free shipping then it is probably a better bet .
neutral	i am going to keep my eye out for more of the deals and i can almost guaruntee i will be shopping here again
neutral	vous aurez un vaste choix de produits sur spartoo .
neutral	il met à votre disposition un service client .
neutral	i ordered a deep dish pizza from them along with the new jalapeno / cheese bread .
neutral	well , the deep dish seemed more like a hand tossed pizza and wasn ' t all that great !
neutral	the jalapeno bread was good but wish their pizza was a little better !
neutral	i bought a oakley frogskin , the order was done fine , the delivery within the days provided but the frame on the sunglasses had two scratches one of them being right in front of the frame and quite deep / noticeable .
neutral	im a bit disappointing with the product because i noticed the plastic box where the glasses came didn ' t have any sealed plastic or sticker on it so i presume it has being opened before .
neutral	it took about 0 weeks to get in , broke the first day .
neutral	i am keeping it on for now without the main charm .
neutral	this website is just ok .
neutral	it doesnt always give you the best prices availabe , but its not the worst either .
neutral	i ' ve gotta say , if you ' re looking for rare game products or even old gems from the ps0 era play - asia is the site you wanna visit .
neutral	if it ' s an international order it ' ll be slow like a month approx .
neutral	but otherwise reliable .
neutral	your package will come to you !
neutral	when i got my vpn account with them it was kind of slow , then i try wittopia and the same it was even worst , found [_link_removed_] and so far so good good vpn speed and service .
neutral	best prices on the net for supplements !
neutral	the only kicker is that the shipping tends to be pretty high ...... overall though not bad .
neutral	the fast shipping is the best thing .
neutral	my pugs got very sick from the treats that i ordered .
neutral	petflow didn ' t really do anything to look into the issue .
neutral	i love the charm of the footprints , but i wasn ' t impressed with the bell on the charm or the length of the necklace .
neutral	i ordered one that should have been plenty long , but i couldn ' t even wear it .
neutral	the order process and the length of time for them to send it was good .
neutral	i would definitely_recommend this website to unlock the iphone , but the time needed to unlock it is way off .
neutral	it took them almost like a week for them to do it while they said only 0 day at max to unlock .
neutral	the coincidence is that they unlocked the iphone right after i opened the dispute with paypal .
neutral	i ordered two fancy_dress outfits from here .
neutral	one was a roman tunic that was a good fit with good accessories .
neutral	i also ordered a red riding hood outfit that i was very disappointed in .
neutral	the black corset element was padded with foam making it quite bulky .
neutral	it only extended around the front of the outfit and look terrible on and off .
neutral	the mesh underneath the skirt gave it a lumpy , ill - fitting appearance rather_than adding volume to the skirt .
neutral	delivery was fairly fast but a day later than the stated delivery date .
neutral	the website had a large range of outfits however i would be skeptical about buying future outfits from this site as some products are not as good quality as suggested by the pictures and description
neutral	i am always happy how much you can save on supplements on this site , but it took 0 weeks to even ship out my $_000 order , and i didn ' t receive it for another 0 weeks .
neutral	it is vitally important to ship out apo orders as_soon as possible , because after it ships it takes at_least 0 to 0 weeks more than domestic orders to get to its destination .
neutral	plus , spending that much should qualify for free shipping as_well .
neutral	i was very happy to receive my rab summit jacket from the outdoor shop , but when it arrived it looked grubby / dirty .
neutral	i phoned the shop immediately to inform them and they said that it may be the down feathers showing through the jacket .
neutral	fair_enough , but a little strange that no one noticed before sending it out .
neutral	anyway , arranged to return the item in exchange for a replacement ( different colour ) and was told that this would be a ' goodwill gesture ' and that i would not get a refund on my postage .
neutral	as the jacket was worth £_000 i had to send it special delivery at a cost of £_00 !
neutral	the new jacket has arrived and i am pleased with it , although i have a bit of a sour taste in my mouth that they sent me a substandard item to start with then i had to fork out to send it back and get it changed .
neutral	i know i haven ' t shopped here in a while , but i guess i ' ll just take them out completely and unsubscribe to email .
neutral	my order had everything price reduced to beat out some other_websites and so i placed it .
neutral	received confirmation_email with lowered total and then see the next_day a higher total is taken out from them .
neutral	no email or heads up , so canceled my order .
neutral	from the total i think i ' ll just stick with my previous supplier from the last time i reviewed who also has a flat_rate shipping of $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	they have a huge_selection , and lots of great items to great prices .. but my first impression with them ruined my experience with them a bit !
neutral	i tried to contact customer_service , first by trying their live_chat ..
neutral	i had the chat window open for hours - even left it open when i went to bed , but there was no reply in the morning either !
neutral	i ' ve also tried emailing them , but i still_haven ' t got a reply - weeks after .
neutral	this is not acceptable from a shop that has been around for years .. a friend of mine finally got a reply by sending email , but not until she had to be a bit rude !
neutral	!
neutral	they are slow on sending your items out , the tracking system is a bit weird and clumsy .
neutral	but that doesn ' t change the fact that their items are good .
neutral	i had a better experience with customer_service the last time i ordered something .
neutral	i bought a pair of shorts , and was waiting for them to be shipped , when i got an_email from someone - saying it was out of stock .
neutral	i was bummed out because of this , of course , because it clearly said they had it in stock on the site !
neutral	the cs person_who emailed me told me that they had tried to get more from the manufacturer , but to no luck .
neutral	they offered me my money back , or i could change my order if i wanted .
neutral	j ai commende une mercedes et au bout du compte je me retrouve avec_un golf parceke je_suis en retard

neutral	vi boede i tre nætter på hotellet , og det_var udemærket .
neutral	rent og pænt .
neutral	fin morgenmad .
neutral	der_var til gengæld rigtig koldt og lidt larm fra gaden , og_så var værelset rigtig lille på_trods af at det_var et superior værelse .
neutral	jeg_synes , prisen var høj i forhold_til , hvad vi fik og i forhold_til , hvor det lå .
neutral	man kunne rent_faktisk ikke komme til noget som helst uden at skulle med metro eller bus .
neutral	det lå til gengæld tæt på .
neutral	en_anden gang vil_jeg vælge noget tættere på centrum til en lavere pris .
neutral	however i feel they should aloud customers to use more colors n patters .
neutral	after all youre paying like almost 000 bucks for them in some cases .
neutral	great flowers , my mum loved them .
neutral	however , what i didn ' t love was getting a phone call from my mum when she got home from work saying her flowers hadn ' t arrived ( i ' d already told her they were coming )... in the end they did arrive , at 0pm , as noted on my " delivery receipt " sent to my inbox .
neutral	i dutifully called my mum to see how she liked the flowers and she had no_idea they had arrived .. it was now 0 . 00pm .
neutral	my dad , who had been sitting in the front room when the delivery was supposed to have taken place says he heard_nothing , no knock at the door , and certainly no bell .
neutral	so there they were , my mothers flowers sitting in - 0c on the doorstep for an_hour and a half , or what could have been the entire night had i not noticed the email and rang to see how they were .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	your products are always of a high_quality and delivery is fast and efficient however if an item has to be returned i don ' t feel the customer should have to pay for it .
neutral	i shop online a lot and yours is the only company that asks the customer to pay for returns .
neutral	it means that as a customer you lose money despite getting a refund for your item .
neutral	i would seriously consider rethinking your returns_policy as , despite my love of your products i would think_twice about ordering an item of clothing again in case it has to be returned .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	they provide a variety of services that help with cpc and cse and good customer_service .
neutral	however , i have had some problems with the usability of their services and data collection .
neutral	i can ' t trust the numbers they give me for clicks on cses and i cannot get the ids to be profitable .
neutral	they were big when i was in high_school ( 0 years_ago ) but have really fallen behind .
neutral	they seem to try to do what facebook does , but not as_well .
neutral	i do still have my myspace though , just because there are videos on it that i don ' t have anywhere_else .
neutral	i would say overall i would use their service again but they could improve
neutral	on calling customers back , making the ring within the time they say it will be done and understanding what adjustments you are describing to them in the ring renderings .
neutral	they are very friendly and helpful and the overall product turned_out vary good though .
neutral	and the price is right !
neutral	!
neutral	i was very_pleased at the start , thought being_able to play without discs was so much better .
neutral	then i had to send identification because of fraud ( fair_enough ), past that , got codes .... my last one didnt work !
neutral	contacted support , was very helpful in telling me what they were going to do to fix my problem .
neutral	since then i ' ve had lack of communication !
neutral	emails telling me to do something but not how to do it !
neutral	i was then for some reason sent my old code !
neutral	i dont understand how thats going to fix my problem .... time will tell as the sims0 . com site is down for maintenance at the minute .
neutral	i was instructed to " enter date night key in the sims 0 game loader / sims0 . com website " now that email was in capital letters which normally indicate shouting ( first email was not ) and the one containing my code after i replied expressing my unhappiness as a customer and asking how i get to this point on the website was ignored completely and a repeat of the previous email just with the code added .
neutral	i bought anno_0000 deluxe_edition almost a month_ago i got my cd_key real fast everything installed and worked_perfectly .
neutral	however i still cannot find the two game soundtracks , or the 000 - page art book and the tree of technology poster .
neutral	all the extra in game features are there but nothing more .
neutral	i have emailed them about this with no response .
neutral	i give them 0_stars for customer support and 0_stars for fast delivery .
neutral	pleased with the service , prompt and efficient .
neutral	a couple pound more than my regular supplier , but i ' m sure a 0 %_discount will bring it in line :- p
neutral	i have mixed feeling regarding paypal .
neutral	i comes sometimes handy .
neutral	but some times i get mail from paypal that my account has been limited because of some blah blah stuff .
neutral	printer dont work well it knows it not the right ink that its not epson ink replacement
neutral	i have had some good experience with yesstyle .
neutral	they have had some shipping problems but always follow through with what ever fix they give me over the phone .
neutral	cuando vaya por dinamarca , y este , te lo diré .
neutral	gracias
neutral	i very happy from the purachase .
neutral	bra pris , fick mina grejor och hemsidan funkade fint så mycket mer att säga !
neutral	i always like boohoo dresses , they ' re so pretty but i always have to get a size or two up from what i buy in shops .
neutral	why so skinny boohoo ?
neutral	?
neutral	the item was a good price and delivered quickly .
neutral	however part of the item was damaged , to be fair i got a 00 % refund very promptly once i emailed them , however maybe they could rethink their packaging .
neutral	sizing is slightly incorrect too , i ordered a small which it says on the website is a uk 0 - 00 , however it is slightly too baggy to be an 0 - 00 .
neutral	i gave the site a go today and was really impressed with the beautiful bouquets on offer !
neutral	my only issue was with the checkout_process - i got error codes when trying to pay by paypal , when i was trying to look up the shipping address by postcode , and also really struggled to find the promotional code box as it ' s not part of the checkout_process .
neutral	after manually putting in the address and opting for debit_card vs paypal , i got there eventually !
neutral	i ' m editing my review to reflect what my experience has been since our case was taken up by michael , the president of nsc .
neutral	my fiance and i did have a number of difficulties with our order with this company ( they are listed at the very bottom of this review ), but our opinion has changed drastically since we were able to work with michael .
neutral	our belief is that the vast majority of people_who work with nsc receive a perfect order on the first go around and that when our order had problems , their existing infrastructure was really not adequate to deal with them .
neutral	now , i will say that i hope our rep has learned a lesson about how to treat customers because we were quite understanding and had very simple requests that she chose not to follow_up on ( emailing us when it arrived , calling us once it was time to re - do the ring for the third time , and making sure to look at the ring herself before it was shipped out ).
neutral	that said , our experience with michael has absolutely been perfect .
neutral	not only was he incredibly apologetic over the phone to both my fiance and myself , individually , he also asked us both individually to explain exactly_what had happened from our personal perspectives and really took the time to express to us how much he regretted what our experience had been .
neutral	he offered us a 00 %_discount on our ring in addition to providing a written lifetime guarantee that we could send the ring back to be re - finished for no charge and also guaranteed that if we decided to change the band from platinum to white gold at some point in the future that his company would remake the band and refund us the difference in the costs of the metal .
neutral	we chose not to accept the discount , though we appreciated that it was offered , because we never wanted to pay less for our ring -- we just wanted what we had ordered and we wanted someone at the company to care about us and our ring .
neutral	we wanted to feel_like we were being treated like people by someone_who cared .
neutral	once we got in touch with michael -- which we did on our first try this past monday -- things were taken_care of incredibly quickly .
neutral	in fact , i am wearing my ring right now ( it arrived last_night along with a beautiful pendant necklace that michael sent to apologize ) and it looks perfect .
neutral	i now regret that we spent so much time dealing_with our rep and realize that we should have taken it higher up the chain much sooner .
neutral	in spite of our frustrations , i still support this company because it is a small business and i really believe our experience was a reflection of the fact that it is experiencing growing pains .
neutral	i ' m sure our rep had tons of other orders she was dealing_with and i really think that our experience was a wake_up call for the company that they need to grow their staff in order to take on increasing demand .
neutral	i really hope that no one else will have to deal with what we did , but at the end of the day we now have the ring that we wanted and we have the comfort of knowing that michael is supporting us and is on our side .
neutral	it ' s kind of funny how much it matters for purchases like engagement_rings to be sure that the people you ' re buying from care not just about the money you ' ll be giving them , but about you .
neutral	i ' m leaving the basics of my original review below so that other customers can see what our experience was .
neutral	still , i am greatly comforted in having spoken with michael personally and i am certain that this is a company with strong potential and with beautiful pieces to offer .
neutral	i hope that my review will be an anomaly and that the company can learn and grow from our experience .
neutral	my only advice would be that if other customers begin to face difficulties ( which , again , i don ' t believe many do based on other reviews and also based on michael ' s reaction , calling our experience " his worst nightmare " and expressing his embarrassment ) they should make_sure to elevate their order themselves .
neutral	0 .
neutral	we ordered a ring but they had to ship it undone because it was not completed in time for our engagement .
neutral	we understood and sent it back to be finished an re - sized .
neutral	our rep then sent it back and it was finished , but they did not re - size it .
neutral	frustrated , we sent it back again .
neutral	when we got it back it was re - sized but extremely dirty ( black spots all over ) and misshapen .
neutral	this has led to me having a ring for about 0 weeks of our engagement of over 0 months .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	0 .
neutral	our rep was generally quite dismissive .
neutral	when i would send my precious ring back to their store , i would ask her to inform me when it arrived .
neutral	each time i sent it back ( via 0 - day shipping ) i had to contact her myself ( five days_later ) to ask if the ring had arrived .
neutral	the third time i asked that she call me to speak with me over the phone about my ring .
neutral	she agreed she would .
neutral	she never did .
neutral	she also repeatedly used the excuse that she had many appointments and meetings to justify not calling me .
neutral	* i have learned by talking to michael that their reps do not work on commission so as to avoid situations like ours happening .
neutral	as such , i have deleted what i had previously written about our rep dismissing us perhaps because she had already received her commission .
neutral	its not up to my expected but still trustworthy !
neutral	!
neutral	the website is easy to navigate , and it ' s awesome that the provide measurements for their clothes , especially for international costumers .
neutral	that said , while their selection of clothes is pretty broad , their actual stock is shit .
neutral	i wanted to exchange an item for a smaller size , but it was already sold out , even_though i received it not even a week ago .
neutral	what clothe items i save for later also end up being " no_longer available " within a week or two .
neutral	costumer_service isn ' t the best either .
neutral	i called to ask about returns , but their hours are weird , and all i got was an_automated message with bad audio and broken english .
neutral	i tried e_- mailing them instead , and again , i just got another automated message , a day or two later .
neutral	i was buying battlefield_0 .
neutral	the website said 00 . 00 .
neutral	so i put 00 . 00 on my paypal .
neutral	but it wasn ' t enough .
neutral	when i clicked ideal , i saw that the prize was 00 . 00 .
neutral	but besides that , i guess they are ok . and cheap !
neutral	i like that !
neutral	andafter reading all this reviews i was so scared about my order .
neutral	i just ordered 0 pairs of shoes and to my surprise i got everything i orderd all came in on time and im pretty happy with all of them .
neutral	so i would say give it and see what happens
neutral	always been happy with myprotein ' s service and products .
neutral	however , on my last order i was sent " mega green_tea " instead of " mega cissus ".
neutral	not the end of the world i grant you , however considering i ' ve been a regular customer for many years i was not particularly pleased with the service i received to rectify the situation .
neutral	i could either keep the green_tea ( worth £_00 less_than the cissus ) and get 00 % of my next order
neutral	or return the green_tea and get the cissus sent when my protein receive the green_tea .
neutral	again not ideal ; without trying to sound too arrogant , time is money , i ' m very busy and don ' t want to be going to the post_office to buy a jiffy envelope , printing out my free postage sticker etc .
neutral	it wasn ' t my error , yet i have to make the effort to rectify everything .
neutral	just send me a new cissus !
neutral	you ' ve made thousands off me over the years .
neutral	yes i ' m making a fuss over nothing , however ; as a loyal_customer who needs his supplements asap ( like every meathead worth his weight ) i expected better service .
neutral	a good company , with excellent products but with a universal returns_policy that doesn ' t suit everyone .
neutral	easy to find the product you want , but having to send my personal data ( photo ' s of id ) twice , once in april and now again , after being told that my account was safe ... not very fun .
neutral	i needed a key for a friends birthday_gift and am still_waiting for my email to be answered .
neutral	time is passing , and i am getting mad .
neutral	bonjour on moffre de reservez sans frais pour une periode de semaine ensuite on m appelle et on me dit que_je doit payer immediatement par carte de credit pour que ma reservation soit effective cela ma un_peu surpris merci
neutral	the key i received from them is working .
neutral	the anti_- fraud_check thing is bullshit , such a terrible system .
neutral	i requested a pin to be sent for my phone_number twice and didn ' t receive anything yet the system still claimed that i have successfully received the pin , that ' s not correct however .
neutral	and there is no live support , how is this a successful company without live support - _ - ?
neutral	then i had to wait a full night to receive a reply to get my key .
neutral	i wouldn ' t buy anything else off this website though , prices aren ' t that attractive anyhow .
neutral	i ' ll stick to [_external reference ], more efficient , no fraud bs !
neutral	we had leaned on partsgeek to get a hard to find part .
neutral	after_placing the order , the order was cancelled due to availability .
neutral	i bet the part is still listed as in stock .
neutral	would have been better if they would go the extra_mile to cross the part into another brand or try to outsource .
neutral	i have good and bad_experience with them .
neutral	they ripped me off on shipping once - but the rest like 00 times all good !
neutral	ok , now i cannot complain with cdkeywarehouse ' s prices and doubt anyone could however i had a good amount of trouble buying battelfield 0 : le from them .
neutral	firstly when i bought it i received the key the next_day ( which was brilliant speed however ) but when i put it into origin it accepted that it was bf0 : le but it wouldn ' t accept it because it was used .
neutral	later that day i received a replacement though store_credit only to get a site error .
neutral	an online representative later fixed this and gave_me another key which wouldn ' t work .
neutral	i actually ended_up giving the representative my login due to me never owning anything on origin and he sorted it out .
neutral	great service and prices in all but just had a few hiccups ( which nobody else seemed to have mind you , could have been me ... or origin )
neutral	this is all !
neutral	!
neutral	bom dia !!

neutral	tempos atrás fiz a primeira compra , e de acordo como recomendado o produto chegou no prazo e a mercadoria intacta e com isso peguei confiança no site , então resolvi fazer fazer outro pedido , só que dessa vez não fui tão feliz por isso , já faz um mês que fiz o pedido e até agora a minha encomenda não chegou .
neutral	agora eu fico pensando , será que são atencioso só na primeira compra ? o prazo de 0 a 00_dias úteis é só na primeira compra ?
neutral	gostaria que vocês desse uma olhada em meu_pedido pois até nessa momento eu não recebi meu_pedido , o numero da ordem é #_000000000 , fico no aguardo de uma resposta com uma solução ,

neutral	though yesstyle isn ' t the best in customer_service , they ' re probably one of the better sites out there to order fashion from asia .
neutral	they just need better customer_service and more variety to gain five_stars .
neutral	i personaly really like there clothing but i feel that there deliverary takes_forever even_tho it it express it still take quite some time to ship and process the order cause i ordered a few shirt from there and they still didn ' t process my order yet so yeah .
neutral	i hope everything goes well and i get my clothing soon :_d
neutral	i thought my envelopes would be delivered from ireland and would take 0 - 0 business days but were from the u . k and took 0 business days to deliver .
neutral	the postage and packaging was too pricey for that delivery service .
neutral	but i was very happy with the product and was delighted that they had a great selection to choose from .
neutral	got the item fairly quickly which was a top , it ' s a shame it didn ' t fit me what - so - ever , i called them to return it which was fine and they gave_me a reference number .
neutral	i expected a refund a few_days_later which they gave_me as store_credit ( i guess i should have read the fine_print before i ordered ), i rang them to sort out a refund which they said i ' d get after about 00 minutes of explaining that i couldn ' t fit into any clothes on the site which i actually wanted , 0 weeks_later and still didn ' t receive it .
neutral	in the end i gave up and just bought 0 hats i didn ' t really want just to burn the credit which was now useless to me .
neutral	fast delivery gets a +
neutral	tracking your order is another +
neutral	easy returns was a +
neutral	no refunds and store_credit only was a -
neutral	make_sure anything you ordered will fit you and you ' ll have a pleasant_experience , if you ' re like me though and can ' t fit into the clothes then you ' ll have lost your money .
neutral	well the item i ordered was instock status on website ... five days passed and it hadn ' t shipped out .
neutral	i called customer_service left a message never got a call .
neutral	i called back and the service rep was very rude and made it seem like my call was bothering her ... she_said my order would ship the next_day which was a friday ...
neutral	the order didn ' t ship , i called back monday and the new customer_service rep was amazing .
neutral	she apologized for the whole experienced then over nighted my order .
neutral	without her i would have never used the site again .
neutral	she fixed my issue , but im still a little unsure about ordering again .
neutral	it is true you cant_beat their prices but their shipping is a rape job
neutral	i have seen a number of unique shoes that i would like to purchase but they did not offer large sizes which are standard in the usa .
neutral	i decided to shop with bestbuy . com for cyber monday because they had a few really good deals .
neutral	i opted to do in store pickup because i thought it would be easy .
neutral	the ordering itself was simple .
neutral	however , i did not get a confirmation_email or even a pick_up email .
neutral	i called the store later in the day to find out about the order and i was put on hold for 00 minutes .
neutral	when i got to the store it was nothing but issues and annoyances .
neutral	in the end i got the items at a really great deal ( half the price of amazon which is saying something ) so i guess it wasn ' t a total loss .
neutral	however , i have done site to store with several other stores and never had this many issues .
neutral	hi , if someone ask me to say something good about this website , i ' m going to say that i really love the way they deliver things .
neutral	they have been honest , like if they say they going to make it in five days and that will happen .
neutral	i really_appreciate that .
neutral	they don ' t really have as many thing as i want to buy but at_least i enjoy_shopping here .
neutral	i have been shopping here once but i feel_comfortable to shop here .
neutral	they get a cheap shipping , that is soo great ,,,.
neutral	anyway , they are the best !!
neutral	<_0
neutral	i loved ebay but they keep changing the layout and it is just getting to be to much !
neutral	topcashback has been getting gradually worse over the past_year .
neutral	merchants were failing to track , then they stopped paying out with no means of reversing the decision , then topcashback started making you pay for their service & most recently , they decided to change , in the face of established consumer laws , the terms & conditions on one of their cashback offers .
neutral	at the time of redemption , the offer was tracked , but a day later a message was sent out to all customers saying that the cashback was not valid unless the subscription was carried over into a second month , incurring a cost of £_00 .
neutral	the cashback was for £_00 & as such was of no interest to me .
neutral	topcashback have flaunted advertising law by refusing to honour what they originally advertised & i for one will steer well clear of these crooks now .
neutral	update_: topcashback have done a 000 on this recent gaffe & appear to be honouring the original advertised offer .
neutral	i am cautiously raising my rating back to 0_stars & will see how things progress .
neutral	there has certainly still been a drop_off in service since i originally signed_up for this site but hopefully things are improving .
neutral	jeg_købte 0 charles eames stole og_fik dem leveret som lovet .
neutral	dog er der en fejl på som de har sagt de gerne vil starte en reklamation på .

neutral	ive purchased two tickets for tomorrowland first weekend and receive an_email from you guys saying " in may you will receive an e_- mail containing a pdf file with your ticket to tomorrowland .
neutral	you need to print this ticket and bring it with you to tomorrowland , on the day of the event , you will need to exchange your printed ticket for a wristband at the festival ’ s box office located at tomorrowland ’ s main entrance ."
neutral	this now june , still i have not receive any email nor pdf files at all .
neutral	i am very concern about this , ive also booked my flight and needs some answers .
neutral	ive read some of the answer that you posted on the reviews , you mentioned that the seller are the one who will sent out the tickets to us directly .
neutral	however , in the email you mentioned that we would need to print out the pdf files and exchange it for a wrist band at the festival ' s box office .
neutral	im very much confuse of how this would work .
neutral	wish they had more translated visual novels .
neutral	along with all of the other american flight carriers , delta has gone to hell in a hand - basket in the past decade .
neutral	i purchased an international ticket on delta in april leaving in december .
neutral	they changed my flight details at_least four times between april and december .
neutral	now i was flying through a different city and arriving at a different time .
neutral	i said , " hey , if delta can change my ticket without cost , so can i ."
neutral	i called delta and had them change the details of my ticket - without the usual $_000 charge .
neutral	also , when i bought my ticket , they swore up and down there would be no international transaction fee .
neutral	guess what - i was hit with a $_00 international transaction / currency exchange fee !
neutral	i called delta and received a $_00 credit towards my next flight with them .
neutral	yup ,,,,,, easy and fast ,,, recomended to all booking to holiday ,,,
neutral	en effet il est pas mal fait ce site après dommage qu il n y ai pas de google map ou carte interactive .
neutral	i expected to get a cheaper rate as i was buying online i have just reliesed the prices are just like the ones at tesco and when it is getting delivered the price increase even more .
neutral	but the range of product and the speed of delivery was really good !
neutral	!
neutral	not happy with the price increase as had to go else where now .
neutral	could do with a larger amount of the hurricane evo .
neutral	also would be good if u had a creatine , g - glutamine , tuarine and beta - alanin all in one miss that you could add to ur whey
neutral	they are now selling so many things other than books , via other sellers around the world like ebay , which is not good and causing problems .
neutral	the toy i ordered in the us site , shipped by a seller from the uk , looks different than the photo being shown .
neutral	i am very disappointed .

positive	planning a 0 week honeymoon in various parts of europe was made easy with viator !
positive	large , respected company with many good reviews .

positive	i will have more to say when we return !
positive	great prices !!
positive	and the fact that they will match other_companies is awesome !!
positive	i will never order anywhere_else again !
positive	i ' ve made two purchases on cj ' s for fallout : new vegas and the elder_scrolls v : skyrim .
positive	i have been satisfied by both , being extremely cheaper_than the steam versions .
positive	the autokey_system that cj ' s uses is genius .
positive	i recommend this site to anyone_who is a pc_gamer !
positive	great stuff and great prices
positive	good products , nice sales .
positive	the games come , no_worries , they are reputable .
positive	also , they responded quickly to my queries .
positive	the site has a simple process to book the hotels , i think the other site has some complicated process .
positive	for example , i saw the price $_00 for one room , but when i clicked the booking the price changed to $_000 due to service fee or something ...
positive	i ' m traveler from korea so i ' m not good in english and booking american hotel in online ...
positive	but the hostelbookers . com has a simple process .
positive	if the price is $_00 , that price keep $_00 , does not changed :_d i don ' t need to be confused .
positive	and the hostelbookers . com has the most cheap price as i searched online .
positive	every time i make a purchase i know i will get it on a reliable basis .
positive	very nice very good
positive	seriously coffee and books .. what is not to love ?
positive	the prices vary but are generally fair and so far i have never had a major issue with online or in store purchases .
positive	i really_liked using indeed since it grabs jobs from lots of different places and you can sort by date , positions etc .
positive	my only_gripe was not really their fault , since it ' s a job aggregate if the companies listing online have auto - renewal for listings it will say a job is new when it is actually just a re - posted one ... but again that is not indeed doing it .
positive	so one magical day my friend told me where i can find absolutely adorable clothes without_having to sell my soul to buy them .
positive	i looked yesstyle . com up and fell in love with the quirky fashion .

positive	i cant_wait_till i get my new pullover !
positive	i absolutely_love yesstyle .
positive	everything about this site is pleasing , from the selection and quality of the clothes , to the organized and easy - to - use website .
positive	i can browse for exactly_what i need when i need it and even usually get a great deal or find something on sale that ships super quickly , or i can shop around and find something i absolutely_love for a great price .
positive	i can ' t get enough of this site !
positive	purchased an_engagement_ring in the summer of last_year .

positive	this is why i ' m coming_back to brilliance again this time of year to also get our wedding_rings , because this company and its staff know how to deliver the product and treat their customers .
positive	excellent service , i have only found a cheaper price elsewhere once , and i used there low price guarantee and they beat it !

positive	i bought a few things from the company a while back through yesasia , but never really took the time to visit yesstyle when it opened .
positive	the site does appear on many banner links and ads , so normally i become disinterested in it since things of those nature looks to be spam .
positive	a few_days_ago , i saw a banner ad again , and just went_ahead and checked out the site .
positive	yesstyle has a large_variety of choices for men to cater to different_styles .
positive	i was honestly only browsing , but ended_up purchasing a good amount of items .
positive	website ui was easy to use , ordering process didn ' t take too long ( my complete purchase button did take a little while to finalize the order , although i didn ' t really notice since i was alt tabbed ).
positive	i give yesstyle 0_stars since i could not think of anything bad about any processes dealing_with this site .
positive	i , of course , won ' t mind / probably will shop here again .
positive	apparel deals is one of my favorite vendors .
positive	i have ordered a couple of times from them already and i will_continue to do so .
positive	they do have a smaller selection than some other vendors .
positive	however , almost all of the products i ' ve ordered have been good quality and exactly described and pictured on their site .
positive	even when i have had to return something , it was hassle_free and they were quick to respond .

positive	the painting i ordered for my living_room was delivered today .
positive	though i am not a big_fan of reproductions in general , i decided to go for the dance at bougival ( artist , pierre auguste renoir ) reproduction since i absolutely_love that piece of art .

positive	i will order a graffiti piece for my teenager ’ s room next .
positive	i first came_across some supplements from sports_food on amazon . com while idly browsing for some weight_loss options for myself .
positive	i googled them and sure enough , i found their site .
positive	after a few_minutes into browsing the site , i decided to try out their green_tea since it is one of the safest products available for weight_loss and nowadays everyone seems to be using it .
positive	i was not exactly expecting great results but it worked for me .
positive	not only did i lose 0 . 0 pounds in the first two_weeks , more importantly it made me much more alert and energetic which is a big thing for a mother of 0 young kids .
positive	since the product was moderately priced it was perfect for a trial and when it worked for me , i also introduced my husband to it .
positive	once he had lost a few measly pounds , he took the big plunge and decided he would go head - on into dieting and muscle building so that his flab can once again faintly resemble a stomach .
positive	accordingly , he is planning to order few muscle building supplements once he has lost some more weight and settled into a good gym routine .
positive	we also tried their fat burner which was on a special offer .
positive	though it did not suit me much since my digestive system could not take it , my husband found it to be extremely effective .
positive	me ?
positive	i am happy with the slow and steady green_tea and would recommend sports_food products to anyone_who is looking to lose_weight .
positive	their website is easy to browse and their selection of products just perfect – not too few , yet not so many that you get lost in the details .

positive	i , too , have been a customer of gnc for many years .
positive	i still go there , in case , i need to re - up at the snap of the finger , but supplementwarehouse blows gnc out of the water in comparison .
positive	the retail prices are nearly cut in half , if not more , and i usually get everything within a couple days .

positive	when i first stumbled_upon this site i was browsing the gamespot internet forum ; in this forum a member was asking whether or not this site was to be trusted , other members confirmed that it could indeed be trusted .
positive	i was curious as to why they were asking this , i followed the link to the site , where i was met by ( i hope you don ' t mind me saying ) quite an ugly site .
positive	my immediate reaction was that the site did look a little suspect , as i am used to buying from large companies with flashier websites .
positive	however i decided to look a bit further and discovered that the prices on display seemed too good to be true .
positive	after looking around for a while and debating whether to try purchasing something , i decided to give it a go , after all people have stated it is legitimate .
positive	the serial key i purchased arrived within a minute of payment , and worked_perfectly when entered into steam .
positive	what more can i say .
positive	the price was unmatched and i could not have asked for the serial to arrive any faster !
positive	so what are you waiting for !
positive	this has taught me not to judge a book by its cover !
positive	i have recommended this site to several people_who have all followed up with successful purchases .
positive	i have ordered from supplement_warehouse man times before , and as far as i ' m concerned will_continue to do so .
positive	i always get what i ordered in a timely_fashion , and price is always the best anywhere !
positive	quick and easy !
positive	their website was very easy to navigate , offered lots of selection & had fair prices .
positive	also fun to get freebies with our order .
positive	self explanatory .
positive	i ' ve purchased squaretrade warranties for the last three or four years based on positive_reviews and recommendations , but i ' d never actually had to file a claim .
positive	well in the last 0 weeks or so i ' ve had to file two different claims ( one on a dropped tablet , one for a failing laptop battery ) and both of those experiences could not have gone more smoothly .
positive	they give you all_kinds of options for repairs / resolution , and their phone support during the process is amazing .
positive	i know for a fact that i will_continue to use squaretrade in the future - i just bought two new warranties this week .
positive	never knew much about the company and when i found a motocaddy hybrid bag with £_00 off the rrp and a further £ 0 with sale discount ...
positive	i thought there had to be a catch .
positive	bag came today ( monday ) after only
positive	ordering on friday .
positive	bag is the real_deal and i am very happy .
positive	no_complaints !
positive	used gak to buy a couple of fenders now .
positive	price is very competitive , delivery was prompt and the communication and customer_service and offer and availability for after sales service has been second to none .
positive	they prices are outstanding ..
positive	if you find the same product cheaper they will not only match their price but also beat it by 0_%.
positive	this is my first time but i plan on coming_back for more ..
positive	i already than refered six customers an so far we all are waiting to recieve or products in the mail .. to me there shipping prices are a bit high but when you are recieving the product for a low amount how can you go_wrong with that .
positive	i believe that i will recieve the same progress if i went an spend $_00 . 00 on the same product .
positive	i just ordered from sw for the 0th time , and every time they offer value and quick delivery .
positive	the one time there was an_issue it was fixed and the correct supplement was at my door in less_than 0 days time .
positive	no online venue is 000_% perfect all the time , what sets sw apart was their quick_turnaround in fixing the mistake .
positive	i would definitely order from them again !
positive	im shocked to hear anyone say anything bad about football fanatics !
positive	i love football fanatics been a customer for two years and have never had a problem with them they make returns so simple i really dont ordering from anyone_else !

positive	they offer great deals on their products .

positive	mind you i live in the united_states .
positive	now at first i had some troubles getting my key because it was stuck at processing .
positive	but i hopped on live_chat and my issue was fixed in a mere 00 minutes !
positive	now if i had to say one thing the customer_service is absolutely amazing and the best !
positive	but don ' t believe those reviews that say negativly on the site .
positive	if you want proof of my my success email me : codymcleod @ outlook . com
positive	g0a thank_you !
positive	i have been using supplement_warehouse for several years and continue to return .
positive	on the rare_occasion that i find a product for cheaper_somewhere_else they always beat it and automatically adjust their price .
positive	i haven ' t ever tried to find somethgin i wanted and not been able to find it here .
positive	words cannot describe_how good this website is !!!
positive	i refuse to shop for supplements anywhere_else .
positive	not only are the products priced cheaper_than anywhere_else , but the freebies are the best !!
positive	honestly , their shaker_bottle is the best thing in the world .... i dont even drink out of the cups in my house anymore lol
positive	when i thought i couldn ' t find the part for my 00 mitsubishi diamante .
positive	i found parts_geek .
positive	i not only found my part , but it was cheap and delivered to my door in about 00 hours .
positive	i love this site .
positive	i purchased a key for fifa00 and received it within 0 minutes .
positive	that kind of turn_around service should be the norm these days ....
positive	the big retailers should take a lead from ultimatum .
positive	so , i get my key in an_email , and try to stick it into origin and it won ' t work ....
positive	i tried 0 times to get it to take ... no dice ....
positive	so i am totally flustered so i go to contact customer support ...
positive	i get through within 0 minutes and after chatting with the rep for 00 seconds , i realized i was trying to put both codes in at the same time like a moron .
positive	after laughing it up with the rep , i was on my way to playing ... great first experience , and i will_definitely be back ...
positive	thanks again !
positive	always fast shipping , and very reasonable for the price !
positive	couldn ' t ask for a better site !
positive	i had bought a 0s from a friend .
positive	for some reason , at & t did not have it in their system and after several calls to customer_service , 0 trips to the store , they told me that i would have to wait for 00 months till it was eligible to be unlocked .
positive	i was about to put it on craigslist , but stumbled onto this website .
positive	i was very hesitant to give it a shot , but after extensive checks on the web for indications of a scam , i didn ' t see any .
positive	i was also leery that myimeiunlock was writing their own reviews but in the end , i took a chance and it was exactly as promised .
positive	the directions were simple as_well as quick turn_around .
positive	do it !
positive	truly an amazing option to buy trendy_clothes from anywhere in the world .

positive	comparecards . com does just what it sounds_like it compares cards !

positive	i really recommend lightinthebox !
