negative	each week they advised a shipment was due but then apologised because it didn_'_t arrive !
negative	i arranged to collect my ipad but was told that i would still lose £ 0 . 00 for delivery because that '_s what it says on their website !!!!
negative	still_waiting for a refund - i would definitely check reviews of a company before i use them in the future - this company is using false_advertising my saying they can repair your item within 0 days !!!!!!
negative	do not use them if you want your device repairing quickly - or not repairing as was my case !!!
negative	i am a genuine customer of repairs0 - and have documented emails to prove their inability to repair my ipad .
negative	every year , for the past eleven years , i have paid my water bill over a few_months .
negative	every year united utilities have sent me dozens of threatening_letters and made dozens of threatening phone_calls .
negative	i have written to them and phoned them , but i get nowhere .
negative	this year will be no different .
negative	why can they not communicate ?
negative	why have they no email address ?
negative	why do they waste so much money ?
negative	we bought a camera from pixmania .
negative	we sent it for repair just out of warranty .
negative	this took five months , not helped by emails in ' franglais '.
negative	the ' safe and secure ' payment website is a nightmare and kept saying payment failed .
negative	we tried 0 times and gave up only to find later they had processed the payment of £_000 three_times but can only get one refunded !
negative	so a repair of a screen ( which retails at £_00 by the way ) has cost us £_000 .
negative	be warned - avoid extreme frustration and expense - do not deal with this company .
negative	sorry pixmania but the world has to know how you treat some of your customers .
negative	outrageous price £_000 just to change a name on a ticket , would be better for them to charge a sensible price as on that principle i will not cancel my flight to allow them to get another lot of money for flight
negative	virgin_media helpline - spent 00_minutes with operator who was unable to help and so transferred me to customer service , then 00_minutes on hold before being told that customer service had closed at 0 .
negative	on hold again .
negative	phone has now run out of batteries .
negative	vm used to be ok with their helpdesk - not any more !
negative	ordered an item on the 00rd jan , on a three day delivery , told it was instock , did a track on this item on 00th_jan only to find that the delivery date was now up to the 00 feb . no email from littlewoods informing_me of this delay or why .
negative	when i phoned up to find out what was going on i was told by a uphelpfull disinterested customer service person " thats how it is " more or less take it or leave it .
negative	if its out of stock or low stock when you order it tell us don_'_t leave us expecting delivery when it its not going to turn_up when you expected it .
negative	totally dusgusted with the service .
negative	i '_ve gone elsewere and got a guaranteed delivery for wednesday 00th_jan .
negative	the only reason bt still exists is i suspect based on it monopoly roots .
negative	the services are relatively expensive and not as customer friendly as they would have you believe .
negative	the policy of the company towards its customers is and still remains legendry .
negative	their products outside the foodhalls are however mainly from china and that part of the world .
negative	not even my pants are now made in the uk .
negative	for a flagship british company this is very dissappointing
negative	if there is a gutter in communication , facebook is right there .
negative	for absolute tosh & brain dead excremental communication this is the place to go in 00_% of cases .
negative	i was with the company for nearly 00 years .
negative	for the first 0 it was good although dealing_with overseas call_centres was a bit of a pain .
negative	ii was so pleased that i had several members of my family sign up to talktalk .
negative	after then unfortunately it just got worse & worse culminating in a service promise & contract that they even put in writing yet still manage to get wrong and not fix for over 0 months .
negative	i lost track of all the staff i spoke to and it was obvious that no one really knew what was going on with nearly everyone promising and rarely delivering .
negative	i call it a flamingo syndrome - similar to a cock - up but just a lot bigger
negative	after a confirmed and paid for order , they called 0 days_later to tell me the item had been damaged and they had no other stock .
negative	they lied and told me they had tried to contact me the day i placed the order .
negative	when i tried to complain , they lied again and the person i spoke to claimed he was the sole director of the company and he was the only one i could complain to .
negative	after checking , it turns_out this person is not one of the directors of the company .
negative	it is a criminal offence to impersonate the director of a company .
negative	basically , they sell items they don_'_t actually have , and the lie to the customer before trying to up - sell another item or process a refund .
negative	ordered filing_cabinet that is described as 00 day delivery ( as non standard colour ) 00th_september , preferred delivery any thursday / friday notified at time of purchase .
negative	i was contacted to advise longer lead time and delivery early november .
negative	during a six week period from 00th_september to date this has not changed and has_been advertised online by ofo and still is as 00 days .
negative	i was willing to wait as not urgent .
negative	contacted ofo after 0 weeks , 0th_november .
negative	advised in email should be delivered w_/ c 00th manufacturer will contact you to agree delivery date .
negative	manufacturer not retailer who i have contract with .
negative	we will deliver monday 00th_november , i advised as the customer sorry this is not possible no one available monday .
negative	now dictated to , take delivery on monday 00th as we are in the area or cancel order and pay 00_% cancellation_fee .
negative	i would suggest ambiguity and unreasonable behaviour by supplier ( s ), i do not have a contract with manufacturer but retailer .
negative	i '_ll let you guys think about whether this is the sort of company you want to do_business with , i know i ' m going viral with business contacts , friends and family educating them to the service i am being subjected to .
negative	beware food ordered and paid for did not arrive .
negative	could not use live_chat on just eat as too early in the evening .
negative	drove to the takeaway which was closed .
negative	when i contacted just eat they did appologise and told me that the money requested from my bank_account for the meal would be put back within 00 days and any concerns should be taken up with the take away .
negative	likewise the take away told me to take the matter up with just eat .
negative	unbelievable i will not use again .
negative	have been waiting a month for my glasses although they tell you that they are dispatched within 0 to 00 days .
negative	have sent several emails and they do not have the decency to reply .
negative	not impressed at all , absolutely unacceptable and very bad customer service overall .
negative	we all know these company '_s produce cheap tack but even i was shocked at how cheaply the 0 costumes i ordered on line were made so sent them back .
negative	you have to return them 0st_class recorded delivery and have a tracking_number , this cost me nearly_£ 0 . 00 , why i don_'_t know as you cant speak to anyone regarding returns and they don_'_t respond to enquires through email .
negative	0 weeks_later and still no refund or response and yes we know its halloween and they are busy .......... but its a " costume company " racking in the money at their busiest time off the year which they should be totally geared up for .
negative	go to a local shop for an outfit or make one as this company is run my monkeys and the outfits are rubbish , stinks of cheap labour from manufacturing to sales ..
negative	the only thing ' supa ' about this company is the speed at which they took my money .
negative	i have been defrauded out of £_00 . 00 !
negative	they have refused to send the 0 perfumes that i ordered , stating that they are awaiting dispatch , ( they '_ve been waiting dispatch since 0th_december ) and will not refund the money after three_times of asking .
negative	if anyone is interested in joining me in contacting watchdog about this second - rate , shoddy outfit , please do so .
negative	don_'_t let them get away with this appauling level of ' service '.
negative	under no circumstances should you part with your hard_earned cash with supaperfumes .
negative	update_: the day after this feedback was left at trustpilot , supapefume gave me a full_refund .
negative	this just goes to prove that if you complain loudly enough and publicly enough , your voice will be heard .
negative	thank_you trustpilot for the forum .
negative	other dissatisfied_customers please take_note .
negative	we went for a sight seeing weekend with our two children .
negative	yes it was raining but there was no excuse for health and safety issues , the staff were cramming people onto the bus even_though there were no seats or safe standing areas left , people were allowed to stand on the stairs which left you having to come down on the narrowest of stair area .
negative	prams were put against doors so you could only enlight from the front doors next to driver .
negative	i have written to the company but feel as if i was just dis regarded and have had no reply back off them on my second correspondence to them .
negative	i would never use this company there are other_companies that do exactly the same .
negative	they were not packing the customers on and there were more buses for certain other_companies so if you are considering using the bus service do not use big bus tours .
negative	they take money and don_'_t deliver or refund at all .
negative	ripping off people beware
negative	rebooked with citylink 00 at parcel0go sams ' suggestion after 0 days of failed_collections from yodel .
negative	told by sam not to relabel as citylink would do it .
negative	bad advice .
negative	morons in city_link ( or deliberately malicious ?)
negative	put the wrong labels on the two parcels .
negative	now 0 weeks_later , one has_been returned to me clearly showing mislabelling by citylink and one appears lost .
negative	thanks a bunch parcel0go , 00 years to get 000_% 0000 + feedback and then i suffer this incompetence .
negative	hours spent on 0 chats to different operators and to add_insult to injury , my refund has_been rejected ??
negative	parecl0go need to up their game as opposition is now better .
negative	now using ipost and cut out these middlemen with numerous failed_collections .
negative	i bought 0 pcs together which was very fortunate because it enabled_me to compare them before turning anything on .
negative	there were fundamental errors in the build of both of them .
negative	0 .
negative	usb plugged_into ieee port on the motherboard which would if used have caused damage to the motherboard .
negative	0 .
negative	mini speaker and usb 0 card not fitted to one motherboard just left in the packaging .
negative	0 .
negative	one pc had a plastic_bag of screws loose inside the box .
negative	if that had been left in there and the plastic had melted the metal screws would have fallen all over the internal components and shorted various items out .
negative	items 0 to 0 have now been resolved by the company .
negative	i have submitted photos to pc_specialist to back up these points and i am told they are being referred to the build manager .
negative	the upload photo feature is not working otherwise i would have included them .
negative	0 .
negative	one pc has_been cloned incorrectly such that it thinks that all data should be assigned to the d drive but that is the one assigned to the optical drive .
negative	we have suibmmitted a request for advice on this issue and are still in talks to resolve it .
negative	packaging , despatch and delivery service all of a high_standard .
negative	tesco lakeside is filthy and i often shop late at night to see and smell 0 or 0 members of staff smoking in the doorway at 0am
negative	i had an honest review on scs sofas removed for adding " avoid these_crooks " at the end which is neither offensive or obscene trustpilot seems to kow tow to the companies being reviewed !
negative	they have admitted to seining out fake solicitors letters and charged their customers for them .
negative	shame on wonga !
negative	£ 0000 reclining sofa delivered with a damaged motor .
negative	was told someone would be in touch but nobody contacted me and i had to call their 0000 phone number after 0 weeks of silence to be told nobody would even come out to look at sofa for 0 weeks .
negative	and a month later i ' m still_waiting for scs to respond with an offer of a replacement .
negative	have bought a couple of hotel breaks , when i have tried to book them , there have not been any suitable dates ( if any ) left .
negative	save your time and energy book through a hotel booking site and save_yourself a lot of hassle .
negative	probably the worst online company i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
negative	they don_'_t have the courtesy to inform you if they can '_t fulfill an order .
negative	it '_s virtually_impossible to speak to anyone on the phone and when you ' re asked to leave a message on their answerphone you can '_t because it '_s not working .
negative	finally , they have an inability to send you invoices and credit notes which they may one day live to regret if they are ever inspected by hmrc vat inspectors .
negative	ordered a full set of kit from them ( amp , tuner , picks , lead and a stand ) and eagerly awaited their arrival .
negative	after about 0 months of hearing nothing and when i contacted them being met with confusion over what i ' d ordered what they had received from the supplier and other issues i decided to cancel the order .
negative	this bit they were most efficient at .
negative	if they ' d shown the same level of organisation dealing_with my order maybe we could have done business .
negative	a most unsatisfactory experience and i won_'_t be ( not ) doing_business with them again .
negative	i would like to add that the individual people i spoke to were very nice and were not in any way difficult to deal with .
negative	the star_rating system does not allow for that distinction .
negative	it is rather a blunt instrument which assumes if you '_ve had bad service it was poor customer_relations .
negative	here it was just useless service but the staff were very nice about it !
negative	absolutely the worst internet experience of my life ..... avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	received goods wihtin 0 days .... goods turned_out to be faulty ... i sent it back at my cost ... they re - sent me the same item sprayed up ... which had the same fault as before .... avoid at all costs ... utter_rubbish rip - off merchants
negative	first i had to remind them that i put a order in after a week of waiting , then when my order was sent out it was not pack it was just trong in a box so when i open it there was not packaging just the good and part of the order the snorkel was damage ,
negative	i have not sent the snorkel back yet i will have to just write it off and buy i when at site as i do not have the time to wait for them to sand a replace out before my hols
negative	in december_0000 we purchased 0 leather recliners from this company , also purchasing an extended 0 year_warranty , for several months we have been experiencing back pain when using them which is obviously here the stuffing / padding is breaking down .
negative	as we had the warranty we contacted them , only to be told , not covered , read the small_print .
negative	i would advise people not to go_anywhere_near them , as there products are no good .
negative	we changed to first_utility in november_0000 on the basis that we could submit monthly meter_readings and monitor our usage .
negative	since then we have been unable to submit our electricity readings and have had to send them through via the ' contact us ' facility .
negative	we have been unable to monitor our usage of electricity as they don_'_t enter our readings onto our on - line account and , as a result , we haven_'_t been able to view any bills .
negative	we don_'_t know whether our direct_debit is sufficient to cover the charges and are worried we will receive a huge bill at some point - presuming they ever get to enter our electricity readings onto our account .
negative	we have tried_phoning their premium_rate number but are left_hanging on for over half an_hour and we eventually give up .
negative	the problem seems to be that we have an old ' economy 0 ' meter that gives two readings ( day rate and night rate ) and their website does not appear to be able to handle two readings .
negative	our rates are the same for both readings as we no_longer have ' economy 0 '.
negative	i have suggested by email that i add both readings together and enter them as a single reading but have had no response from them .
negative	they are totally_incompetent and appear to have no experience or skill in the energy industry .
negative	i will have to write a letter of complaint to them as it is the only way i can get through to them .
negative	if that doesn_'_t work i will go through the energy ombudsman to see if they can resolve the issues .
negative	do not go to them unless you are confident your situation is straightforward and they can '_t mess up .
negative	we ordered a semi - integrated dishwasher - the ordering_process was good , but the delivery process is another matter entirely .
negative	we organised delivery for the saturday of the jubilee bank_holiday .
negative	we then had a call from hiway ( the delivery company ) saying the van had broken down and that it would be delivered on sunday instead .
negative	i was frustrated at the breakdown , but impressed with the offer of a sunday delivery .
negative	come sunday and hiway calls again , " sorry sir , no delivery today as appliancesdirect didn_'_t actually send us your dishwasher , so it '_s not on the van ."
negative	i call and am told that customer service will be in at 0 on monday and can help .
negative	i called at 0 and am now told they ' re only there at 00 , does anyone at this company know what '_s happening ?
negative	so right now i have four things
negative	0 .
negative	a hole in my account balance having paid for a dishwasher
negative	0 .
negative	an appliances_direct website that claims said dishwasher is out for delivery
negative	0 .
negative	a delivery company telling_me that the dishwasher never arrived with them in the first place
negative	0 .
negative	a wasted four day break
negative	grrr
negative	in october_0000 , we found ( we thought then ) the furniture that we had been searching for ; reviews of ofl led us to feel that placing an order of £_000 + was worth taking a chance .
negative	a mistake we will not repeat elsewhere and most certainly never again with ofl .
negative	do not buy from this company .
negative	the after_sales care is non - existent .
negative	this is a reusme of what we experienced :
negative	order placed 0st november_0000 ; a delivery time of 0 months was given which we felt was a long time but the furniture was just what we had been looking for so we decided we could be patient a little longer ; after 0 months , we received an_email from ofl saying they had tried to phone us – a stupid lie when our phone displays missed calls and has an answer phone facility ; i called ofl , who advised me of a delay of about a month – no reason given .
negative	a month later , no contact from ofl – i called ofl ; they reported that they had no news on my delivery and would look into it .
negative	no phone_call was received .
negative	i also sent an_email requesting information ; i never received a reply .
negative	i went on to make 00 calls to ofl and was given a variety of excuses about the delay to my furniture , including : ‘ we ’ ve been badly_let_down by our suppliers but we are sourcing another_provider ’; ‘ its been put in the hands of the managers , they will call you ’ ( they never did ); ‘ we ’ ve got the bookcase but not the bureau , we wouldn ’ t deliver a part order ’ ( fair_enough except that in the end , neither item was delivered and i was told the book case had disappeared from the system ); ‘ the order is being shipped from china so it ’_s difficult to give an exact arrival date ’; ‘ the ship ’_s been delayed ’; ’ the warehouse is being relocated so the system isn ’ t showing what stock is available ’; i was even ‘ guaranteed ’ a despatch date at one point by one assistant , a statement which was described as ‘ inexplicable ’ by another assistant as ofl hadn ’ t received the furniture at that point .
negative	refunds were offered at various points but at the same time as suggesting the furniture we wanted was within sight which persuaded us to keep waiting ; an error in hindsight .
negative	we were finally told , 0 months from the original order , that the furniture had not been on the ship from china .
negative	the assistant made a great show of saying this was not the information he had expected and apologised – then had the audacity to ask if there was anything_else we might be interested in from the company .
negative	ofl seemed clueless about the progress of delivery and appeared chaotic in their administration and communication .
negative	i am staggered that i received only one phone_call from them yet made 00 .
negative	i am staggered that i received no letters or emails from the company of apology or explanation .
negative	the casual indifference of the staff made us think this was a frequent occurrence .
negative	the refund slip posted to us attached to an unsigned compliments slip says it all .
negative	they didn ’ t care .
negative	bought a brand_new jag xf ( great car ).
negative	staff at the lye dealership were friendly , smiling , warm and approachable when i was buying .
negative	when i had to sell back to them ( due to personal circumstances ) they were the exact opposite .
negative	cold , unhelpful , rude , and didn_'_t ring back x0 .
negative	instead they advised us to go to " their own " website and putt in the car details and we would be given a price .
negative	on completion and discussion with statstone lye they said " that quote is for an excellent condition car " and went_onto say in a particularly arthur daly fashion " who can say what excellent means ".
negative	needless to say they did not honour the website offer and made an offer far below the website quote .
negative	unfortunately we had to take the offer ( no choice ).
negative	xf good car - stratstone jaguar lye very poor customer loyalty and care - very dodgy website .
negative	beware of stratstone jag lye !!!
negative	!
negative	also contacted pendragon plc - what a surprise - no reply !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve used dpd in the past and have had nothing but first_class service .
negative	but how wrong can you be huh ?
negative	i ordered goods on friday_afternoon expecting it today .
negative	i even got an_email from my retailer confirming today '_s date .
negative	i usually get a text in the morning of delivery from dpd giving me a rough estimate within the hour of when my delivery was going to arrive .
negative	this was the feature that i thought dpd had over the rival courier companies .
negative	however entered my tracking_number online i noticed that my delivery was in the york delivery depot to be delivered tomorrow .
negative	after contacting my retailer about this they informed that my delivery had in fact gone to the wrong depot and that it is out for delivery tomorrow .
negative	dpd couldn_'_t even be bothered to inform me of their error .
negative	if i hadn_'_t contacted the retailer , like a lemon i would have waited indoors all day for a delivery which was never going to materialise .
negative	i cannot_fault the retailer and the after_sales service which they provided was very useful .
negative	just one final note .
negative	unlike_other courier companies , i discovered that i could only contact dpd via their email enquiry form .
negative	there is no contact number to talk to a real life human_being .
negative	in future i will be thinking twice on which courier company i wish to use .
negative	even if i have to pay that little bit more , the service has got to be better_than the problems i '_ve encountered from dpd today .
negative	i recently ordered an internal compact flash card_reader for a computer i ' m building .
negative	i ' d never used bt shop before and was hesitant in my order being successful if it was anything like their telephone service .
negative	at the time i placed the order it was late at night so wasn_'_t expecting the goods to arrive for at_least 0 days .
negative	despite the product only costing_£_00 i wasn_'_t given an option of paying a premium delivery charge for a scheduled day to prevent me from imprisoning myself at home for a few_days until it arrived .
negative	that was the first detail which didn_'_t impress me .
negative	a few_days_later i received an_email to say that the product i ordered had been discontinued and that my order had been cancelled and no funds had come out of my account .
negative	in a panic i contacted my bank to confirm that .
negative	i then contacted bt to ask why i was able to submit my card info to them for an item which had been discontinued .
negative	they said , and i quote , " it was a mistake ".
negative	minutes after i ended that phone conversation i searched on google for an_alternative company to buy this card_reader and who in my search results do i see selling the same product ?
negative	that '_s right .
negative	bt .
negative	they haven_'_t even removed the product from their website .
negative	so from my first and last shopping_experience with bt , do not buy from them unless you want to end up being disappointed .
negative	despite ordering something shown as ' in stock ' on the website and payment being taken immediately , it '_s now been almost two_weeks and still no delivery .
negative	their customer contact is poor - only after i contacted them and they took several days to reply and promised to get goods to me but after another week still_waiting .
negative	have now cancelled order and asked vredit card company to take action to recover money .
negative	do not deal with these shysters .
negative	i orded a new iphone0 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 , waited 0 days for the delivery but nothing arrived .
negative	then i got a email from leslie grant asking to email her a photo copy of the card i used to order the goods , a utility_bill , my driving_licence , and my passport .
negative	i then got a email from her saying she had contacted her dispatch team to handle my order in a priority basis , but still no phone .
negative	since then money was taken from my account and still no phone .
negative	if you ring up you have to wait up to 0 / 0 hour at_least before you can speak with some one . i have never been treated this way by any company i have delt with and i will never use this company again .
negative	the customer is not king at this place and they use your money to finance their compay .
negative	i was introduced from topcash and switched to npower back in november_0000 no cash_back left a ticket for them to reply and they say that npower should send commision over to topcash , npower state they have done this who do i believe just want what they said they would do .
negative	all bills have been paid could someone from cashback please chase this up .
negative	when a parcel is lost there is limited help and phone number is a premium_rate number .
negative	i have used them a great deal in the past but now a parcel is lost when i need their help they just are not interested in contacting you with updates .
negative	in fact i have found they almost avoid contact and then make it very hard to speak to them without it costing you a small_fortune .
negative	if you book with a courier they at_least then have a free number and a person to speak to who will help .
negative	i would avoid parcel 0 go
negative	ordered a 0000l bunded oil tank and after 0 days made contact with bhl to be told there is a delay .
negative	they claim to deliver in a week but mine took 0 weeks to arrive .
negative	then on appointed delivery date guess_what no show !
negative	waisted whole day at home on advice of delivery that never showed ..... not great .
negative	then when arrived came on small lorry that had had the tank loaded on via forklift but the tail lift was too small for tank to be lowered on so precarious balancing act in getting it off lorry .
negative	driver did all he could but clearly no thought when loaded such a large item on a small lorry .
negative	did not buy one single item from argos this christmas as nearly every item seen on the website cannot be reserved for store pick_up as out of stock not good enough and i went elsewhere
negative	i ordered a asus x00ca of this company , which i was assured that it would be delivered today 00 / 00 /_0000 anytime up to 0pm .
negative	after numerous phone_calls to yourselfs and being assured by your telephone operators it will be here by 0pm at the latest today no sign of the said asus_laptop .
negative	i honestly think the laptop was never dispatched or even existed and this company and thier subsidiary companys are completely false and thier nothing but a bunch of shysters .
negative	my advice is forget about buying anything from them and spend your hard earn , t money , with a honest reputable company , mr n . s cheeseman basildon essex
negative	ordered canon_0d body from this god - forsaken band of rip - off merchants on the 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	cancelled on 00 / 00 / 00 due to no effective response to my enquiries and despite automatic email assurances and promises i am still_awaiting a refund .
negative	i have reported them to bbc_watchdog tv programme , trading_standards office , my credit_card company and will also report them to the police .
negative	if they are a legitimate setup then i apologise but please prepare yourself for great stress .
negative	as someone commented earlier avoid_avoid_avoid at all costs .
negative	we ordered from [_link_] in broadgreen liverpool .. our order contained meals and soups .. the food was not hot and the soup had burst open all over the bag ,, i rang to complain and was told more soup was to be delivered .. no apology ... and soup did not arrive .. poorly run business .. i would not recommend it to anyone !
negative	i love just eat but will choose a different take away outlet next time ...
negative	update ... tried a different outlet .. jalalabad in liverpool .. waited nearly 0 hours but delivery man was apologetic and the food was absolutely_gorgeous !
negative	we had set meal for 0 with lamb korma .. massive portions .. couldn_'_t eat it all in one go !
negative	i would definitely recommend the jalalabad !
negative	thank_you justeat as we got 00_%_off via your site :)
negative	needed new inks for my hp photosmart c0000 printer , ordered two a colour and black one , thought i would give them a try as nothing ventured nothing gained , after ages i got the printer to accept the coloured one as for the black after two days of trying the printer would not accept it , maybe i was unlucky i dont know as i am not a printer mechanic , but without me saying it you can guess where i will be getting my printer_inks in future , and if they ask me to return it as i am_disabled there is no way , i buy many different things using my computer , i will put it down to experience , as the saying goes you get what you pay for ...

negative	i bought a fully enclosed shower from them it cost over £ 0000 it had two doors when the plumbers were installing it they found they had sent two left doors i rang them uo and they said we will send you the right door in a couple of days so the plumbers came back a few_days_later to put the right door in and i had to pay them a extra £_000 for the extra visit i contacted b and q and after lots of phone_calls over many days i got £_000 back
negative	spent an_hour argueing that the item i wanted to return was not medication , and i wanted a refund .
negative	they refused , stating it was medication and thats the end of that .
negative	be aware consumers , to check what you order is refundable before you part with your money .
negative	0 days of use and the fabric split .
negative	the company said it was not their responsibility and washed their hands of it .
negative	this is hard to believe when i still have a bean_bag from ikea bought 0 years_ago which is still completely intact !
negative	the product must be of very poor quality to break after 0 days of normal use , unless the split was already there .
negative	either way - i would have hoped for a more appropriate and helpful response from the company .
negative	i would recommend that you look_elsewhere for your beanbag purchase .
negative	unless you prefer spending hours or even days sitting on your bum waiting and wondering , doing the will they / won_'_t they ?
negative	stuff ... don_'_t use these_clowns .
negative	i booked a collection with yodel00 ( 00 .. 00_hours .. this is a joke believe me ) for monday .
negative	i waited in all day , nothing , looked at the on line tracking and at 0 :_00pm it said " van not ready ".
negative	mmmm .. read in to this what you may , i substituted van with yodel .
negative	re - scheduled for tuesday and waited in all day and ditto no - one came .
negative	rescheduled for wednesday and ( awww , you ' re ahead of me aren_'_t you ?)
negative	ditto .
negative	three days sitting around waiting !
negative	cancelled under dsr and booked it with <_external link_removed >, who turned_up promptly at 0000am , spoke english , and collected .
negative	to anyone who has got angry with a supplier who uses yodel , please don_'_t get angry with them .
negative	they , like me thought they were dealing_with a reputable company , and have been mistaken , taken for a ride and lost money on it .
negative	take my advice , don_'_t use yodel ( anything ), they are the one '_s who deserve to go out of business not the people who use them !
negative	ps , it says under here inform yodel about my review .
negative	why ?
negative	do i think they will care ?
negative	the stock_levels are hopelessly untrue or not kept up to date .
negative	in common with a lot of others , i ordered an " in stock " item , only to find out it wasn_'_t a day later , then after a few calls i was told the stock was going to be in , in a couple of days .
negative	then when that deadline expired , in another couple of days , then , when that deadline expired , another week .
negative	at that point i cancelled the order .
negative	if your item actually turns_out to be in stock you might have better luck , but you won_'_t find out till you place your order , then like me , you are stuck with it !!
negative	i wouldn_'_t bother personally with this hassle , there are better on - line retailers , e_- buyer , pixmania etc .
negative	the telephone_number for this company has_been disconnected or discontinued according to the bt message .
negative	they don_'_t respond to emails .
negative	is the company still trading ?
negative	we are still_waiting for an order placed on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the money was taken immediately .
negative	have set a dispute in train with the credit_card company .
negative	try 0000 000 0000 they will answer as gardeners world but it is the smae receptionist for about 00 companies including hip furniture all operating frm the same address , the receptionist can put you through to hip furniture .
negative	the parent company is called huan co uk
negative	i have sent a personal review of a company ( a very good one btw ), but for some mysterious reason , trustpilot published it as if it was written by my company .
negative	the transaction i was reviewing had nothing to do with my business and i have no_idea how trustpilot got so totally wrong about it .
negative	be careful with that company .
negative	we booked many extras for our holidays such as indoor garage at the hotel and return taxi service from the airport .
negative	the garage was not available at the hotel and they never send our reservation to the taxi company .
negative	when we called them we got a message that they would answer us in 00 seconds to be told after waiting on the line that their office was closed .
negative	i place my order on friday for delivery on saturday .
negative	the flowers didn_'_t arrive .
negative	sent email on saturday_evening .
negative	was ignored and sent another on sunday and still_waiting reply .
negative	as my daughters_birthday has passed and i have sent a bank_transfer so she can get her own i no_longer require your services .
negative	refund is the least i expect , she stayed in all day till 00 . 00 waiting .
negative	thanks for making it the day special for her .
negative	what a let_down .. avoid this company at all costs
negative	i bought 0 silver necklaces for my daughters .
negative	one turned_up and was bent !
negative	the silver was so flimsy that the necklace had obviously bent in transit .
negative	i phoned groupon straightaway and was told to email the company , sivercraft design .
negative	i emailed the company ( a uk email address ) and got a response from , i believe , poland .
negative	basically , they would replace but not refund .
negative	i telephoned groupon to explain that my issue was about the quality of the silver and said that a replacement would still be of a poor quality .
negative	groupon informed me that they vetted all suppliers and that no one else had complained !
negative	really !?!
negative	as a token of goodwill they offered me a £ 0 voucher .
negative	i offered to send them the necklaces to look at the quality but they said they were a voucher company and did not wish to see the goods .
negative	so customer service at groupon is pure lip service - they have your money and they do not care about the product .
negative	i am now left with 0 necklaces that i do not believe are fit for purpose .
negative	i will not be giving them to my daughters as i do not believe that they are safe .
negative	i will never do_business with groupon again and say to anyone interested in listening , beware what you buy with this company .
negative	the only word i can use is unscrupulous !
negative	dear_sir / madam
negative	ref_: avis rental_agreement number 000000000
negative	rentalcars 000000000
negative	i am writing with reference to a very serious complaint i have .
negative	i believe that fraud and deceit may have taken place and i will stop at nothing until i have received a letter of apology , my money back , compensation and assurances that such practices will be reviewed and changed where necessary .
negative	i had to make a trip to the uk with my prime purpose to visit my mother who had recently been diagnosed with cancer .
negative	on this occasion i had decided that it would be easier to rent a car and not rely_on trains etc .
negative	i wanted to find a cheap hire_car that was situated close to the south_terminal at gatwick_airport .
negative	my criteria was simply to get the cost as cheap as possible , and for it to be convenient .
negative	i had also asked for air conditioning due to the hot weather .
negative	my usage was going to be fairly minimal as i was travelling to kent and back , that is all , not a great distance mileage wise .
negative	i went online and the best website and price appeared to be through rental_cars .
negative	i called them , and they were very helpful on the phone and said that the best deal was with avis .
negative	i was happy that it was a name i had heard of , and i paid for the car by debit_card over the phone and i paid a little extra to reduce the excess .
negative	i was , at this point happy with the purchase .
negative	i arrived at gatwick and went to the avis desk …. and from then on it ’_s been a nightmare .
negative	the man on the desk seemed stern but all i wanted to do was show my passport and licence details and get on the motorway .
negative	the avis person insisted he needed a few details , he then asked me if i wanted to get the excess reduced by paying extra .
negative	i said i had already paid for this online .
negative	then , suddenly he said he needed £_00 . 00 held on my card .
negative	i asked why and he said this was for fuel in case i didn ’ t return it with fuel inside it .
negative	he then went on to say that this was the maximum amount i would pay if the tank was empty .
negative	i was getting frustrated at this point and i asked why this was not asked for on the phone as i would have paid by card on the phone .
negative	he tried to put the card_details through but it didn ’ t seem to work .
negative	he then said it needed a manual authorisation and did i have another card i could use .
negative	i said no that was the only card i had .
negative	reluctantly i persuaded him to call the card people , and after what seemed like a lifetime they eventually spoke to me , asked me a few security questions and authorised the payment .
negative	at this point by now 00_minutes of time had lapsed , and the avis man gave me a small piece of paper with a number on it and a reference and he said they had asked me to call them at some point but that it was not urgent .
negative	i said to him that i was not going to call them if it was a survey or something as i had already wasted enough time .
negative	( interestingly it was urgent , by the time i got to kent i had several missed calls from the fraud squad wanting to talk to me relating to possible card misuse , and they had put a stop on the card until i could confirm my identity etc_.)
negative	i will of course be speaking to the card company to ask why they didn ’ t talk to me properly when i spoke to them at the airport , however i suspect they may have a recording of what the avis representative said and his “ excuse ” for taking £_00 . 00 .
negative	every time i asked about this i was told that this was in case i left the car empty of fuel and that it was a holding payment .
negative	i was finally given the rental_agreement to sign and i queried the excess amount stated on there and the avis representative said that this was just how the agreement printed out but i would not have to pay the excess .
negative	finally i got in the car and was able to drive away , quite stressed after what seemed an unnecessary delay and rudeness by all involved , not a great first “ hire_car experience ”.
negative	however the car given was a nice citroen , despite not being the car i had paid for and promised .
negative	two days_later i returned the vehicle , well within the time allocation , i had thought there would be a garage close to the airport , but i didn ’ t see one .
negative	i told the guy this when i dropped it off , but said there was still three quarters of a tank left .
negative	he said no problem .
negative	to be honest i expected at some point to see a £_00 /£ 00 charge for fuel on my bank_statement .
negative	on tuesday the 00th_august i noticed £_00 had been taken out of my account by avis .
negative	first of all i must stress that i deem this to be theft and fraud .
negative	i called avis immediately to a man called barry granderson .
negative	barry was not rude but very very unhelpful and useless .
negative	first of all despite me making it clear that i would speak to trading_standards , the fraud squad , your directors and the media ( i work for the media ), he insisted he would not be able to respond for five days .
negative	totally_unacceptable .
negative	he then went on to say that i had opted for the pre_- payment fuel option and that i should have returned the vehicle as empty as possible .
negative	he then said i had signed a contract and i also highlighted that many people signed ppi insurance forms but that didn ’ t prevent them being mis_- sold too !
negative	this is despite my rental_cars agreement stating :-
negative	what you '_ll need to know
negative	fuel_policy - the vehicle is supplied with a full_tank of fuel .
negative	it should be returned full or refuelling charges will be applied .
negative	this being completely contrary to what baryy granderson told me .
negative	seven_days have now passed and i have received no communication from anyone and i have not received any payment .
negative	today i will be taking the following action :-
negative	• writing to your chairman expressing my concern
negative	• alerting various media including rogue_traders and watchdog
negative	• i will be posting this letter and details on the web
negative	• i will be contacting gatwick_airport authorities
negative	• i will be contacting rental_cars
negative	• i will be forwarding details to your trading body
negative	• i will be making trading_standards aware
negative	• i will be contacting the card authorisation company to question what was said to them and advise them what i was told .
negative	i await to hear from you please feel free to email me at mike . huston @ ymail . com or you can call me on 00000_000000 .
negative	furthermore if i have not received a satisfactory_conclusion to this matter by tuesday 0rd september_0000 then i will pass the matter to my legal team and ask them to vigorously pursue action_against you to recover my money , compensation , and all costs .
negative	i hope that you do care about your customer_satisfaction and your brand , my experience so far suggests not .
negative	mike huston
negative	website states ' less_than 00 in stock '; i '_ve been speaking english all my life and this means in stock not out of stock .
negative	i realize that zero is less_than 00 but don_'_t accept that this meets any form of trade description .
negative	dabs used to be a good & reliable retailer but i won_'_t be shopping there again and would not recommend that you do either .
negative	my experience : place order mid_afternoon on friday for in stock item ( less_than 00 ).
negative	get immediate_confirmation of order but then hear nothing .
negative	tuesday check state of order and discover that it '_s out of stock .
negative	check item on site ( still less_than 00 in stock ).
negative	cancel order and buy from amazon - cost £ 0 more ; item delivered friday .
negative	result ( my wife buys a pile of stuff on ebay on the saturday and it all arrives well before my item does ).
negative	really unhappy .
negative	the only good thing .
negative	no monies were taken so i didn_'_t have to chase for a refund .
negative	don_'_t switch to first_utility .....
negative	just read all of the reviews , and then if you still go_ahead and sign up with this appalling outfit you will have no one to blame but yourself . i made that mistake and still nearly five months on my issue is un resolved .
negative	they don_'_t give a sh0t about their customers .
negative	bought an item and had it engraved in same shop after about 0weeks the engraving was becoming illegible so took it back to my home town shop to have it rectified , but the person behind the counter spoke down to me as if i was a child so i sent it off to the head_office on about the 0nd of dec , and complained about the poor service i had received but 0weeks had passed without a reply so i then had to phone them to find out what the delay was and they apologized and said they were very busy but eventually sent me a refund , so from start to finish and from the bottom to the top of this company i have received a very poor and shoddy service , would i recommend or use this company again no !
negative	never !
negative	had very bad_experience with these_people and when , yes when ( because they will ) they lose your parcel they don_'_t make much of an effort to find it and instead just pretend that the tracking_number the they supplied does not exist ??????????
negative	?/
negative	hopeless !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	at the last_minute my wife decided to work from home on valetines and of course i had arranged for the flowers to be delivered to her office .
negative	appreciate that last_minute changes are at my risk but tried to email the morning of the 00th having been unable to get live_chat response .
negative	understand it might have been difficult to make the delivery address change even_though it was with a days notice but would really have appreciated some response , well in fact any response would have been good .
negative	disappointed
negative	ordered some garden trellisses for next_day delivery .
negative	they took the money , all 000_pounds of it but no next_day delivery .
negative	in fact no delivery at all .
negative	no address on their website .
negative	call them and you immediately get put on hold with music on an 0000 number .
negative	no answer .
negative	email them and you get an_automated message promising that a member of their team will contact you .
negative	they never do .
negative	old_fashioned robbery in the grand tradition .
negative	thieves .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	worldstores eventually got back to me yesterday .
negative	i cancelled the order and agreed on a refund .
negative	i have since received a text_message telling_me that the order i no_longer want is being delivered to me anyway .
negative	i am reporting this matter to trading_standards .
negative	our online order for 00 bottles of wine was due to be delivered 00th_december_0000 .
negative	we waited in all day .
negative	we are still_waiting !
negative	!
negative	tesco say their courier delivered it .
negative	but to whom and when ?.
negative	it certainly did not get to us .
negative	this is an ongoing dispute .
negative	at the moment i do not trust tesco !
negative	!
negative	sent my samsung_galaxy_note into regenersis under_warranty .
negative	the phone was sent royal_mail ' signed for ' at my own_expense and arrived and was signed for by someone at regenersis the following_day .
negative	a week_later i phoned regenersis to find out what was happening and they denied receiving it .
negative	investigation by rm parcels indicated that it had indeed been delivered as shown by the parcel tracking .
negative	the following_day regenersis claimed that rm had ' just delivered it '.
negative	royal_mail said no , it had been delivered as indicated the previous week and provided the complete tracking log .
negative	at this point i began to detect the aroma of fresh porcine pastry savouries .
negative	two days_later i phoned regenersis to find out what was happening .
negative	er .... nothing .
negative	it hadn_'_t been seen by their engineers .
negative	after another two days i phoned again .
negative	had my phone been fixed ?
negative	had anyone actually looked at it ?
negative	they were unable to tell me and no manager was available .
negative	then they cut me off .
negative	i must add that for each of these calls i spent 00 - 00_minutes on hold before being_able to speak to someone ; that was when i wasn_'_t cut_off by them .
negative	i think i was polite and composed however it is really beginning to get my goat .
negative	i need my phone for work and it has now been almost two_weeks .
negative	i still have no_idea what is happening .
negative	if someone from regenersis would like to contact me i would appreciate it as you '_ve totally failed to communicate so far .
negative	ironic for a company in the communications industry .
negative	00000000000 .
negative	i have given one star as i class being_lied to as ' rude_conduct '.
negative	total incompetence , poor organisation , poor communication , no structure for investigating problems , no - one taking responsibility and someone telling total porkies .
negative	i needed a second business line at home so contacted chess_telecom .
negative	the sales_guy was very helpful and signed me up no problem .
negative	customer service since then has_been utterly miserable .
negative	promised connection in 00 - 00 working_days .
negative	a month later still not connected and chess advised a minimum wait of three more weeks .
negative	i cancelled the contract and the embarrassed employee promised that the money they had already started taking by direct_debit would be refunded .
negative	since then , no refunds but plenty more bills !
negative	the latest one has just arrived , for £_000 !
negative	i have emailed and sent letters to no_avail .
negative	i am completely fed_up with chess_telecom and will be making a formal_complaint to cisas first thing in the morning to get this sorted_out .
negative	my advice is pay the extra with bt , as they may be more_expensive but they generally do what they say they '_ll do , when they say they '_ll do it .
negative	no one trying to run a small business and paying through the nose for slow broadband should have to deal with amateurs who can '_t pass simple customer status flags from contracts to accounts , and continuously charge for services not rendered due to incompetence / record overpromising .
negative	i bought two great looking bunches of flowers from this rip_off company to be delivered on weds before_christmas .
negative	one bunch has still not arrived on boxing_day .
negative	the other bunch was christmas tulips with thistles .
negative	what actually arrived was two bunches of white tulips that looked like they were on there last legs .
negative	( no thistles ) the tulips started dropping petals the day after delivery so went in the bin .
negative	after paying £_00 for two bunches of flowers to recieve one bunch of poxy looking tulips is a complete rip_off .
negative	i contacted the live feed for the company but after my initial reply to my complaint the live feed suddenly went off line after i asked for a full_refund .
negative	will give more detail when i have more time .
negative	return_journey .
negative	return flight cancelled as they wanted to triple the price after booking .
negative	they then double charged for the outgoing flight ( after refusing to refund me ).
negative	to prove this i had to send them a bank_statement .
negative	they refunded me one of the charges ( out of two ) without bothering to tell me or answer my questions so right now i have no_idea what remains booked and what doesn_'_t complete_joke .
negative	first got battery changed 0 years_ago - watch came back scratched and stop - watch function didn_'_t work .
negative	had it fixed elsewhere .
negative	went back today as i had the " lifetime_guarantee " for the battery .
negative	they were very rude and unhappy to replace the battery under guarantee but had to as i had the paperwork .
negative	cam back even more scratched and they haven_'_t closed the back propoerly - and this on a watch meant to be waterprrof to 00m .
negative	keep away if you value your watch .
negative	parcel was severely damaged in transit , to the extent that some of the contents were broken and had to be replaced , entailing a 000 mile_round_trip by my client , and my replacing the damaged goods .
negative	photo '_s of damage were supplied , but no offer of recompense or refund of charge .
negative	i waited in as given the hour_slot .
negative	usually they turn_up and give a good service .
negative	however today they did not turn_up , no calling_card , nothing .
negative	i read on there tracking site that they had called and i was not in , they had left a calling_card .
negative	i rang them , quite politely informed them that this was not so .
negative	they had the nerve to tell me the the van driver had called and left a calling_card .
negative	they claimed they had proof and had taken a photograph .
negative	i asked for this to be forwarded .
negative	surprise it was a picture of another house , no apology just an expectation that i would be in tomorrow and lose money waiting for them to probably get it wrong again .
negative	in august we purchased a hotpoint dynd0000 washing_machine .
negative	the weekend before_christmas it stopped_working mid cycle .
negative	we contacted " know how " that is a joke , we had to wait 0 days for an engineer to be told " oh we don_'_t carry that module as it rarely goes_wrong .
negative	left with a promise to ring his " mate " who has one on his van and would ring in an_hour . you guessed it , nothing .
negative	my husband spent up to an_hour on monday the day he first visited to get through to this know nothing depsrtment only to be told they would contact him to get him to contact us .
negative	a waste of an_hour and goodness know how much for the 0000 number .
negative	he rang again on the tuesday , waited for 00_minutes to be told that the module had to be ordered and they would contact us with a new appointment date .
negative	we rang this afternoon as we had heard_nothing but after 00_minutes of waiting he put the phone down .
negative	this so obviously how they keep their profits up .
negative	i am tearing my hair out with frustration , it has now been 00 days without the machine and god_knows_how much longer it will be .
negative	i emailed the customer_services ( there is no way you can talk to anyone in that department )
negative	and demanded a full_refund as i was sold an item " not fit for purpose " i am still_waiting .
negative	we are both disabled and cant lug bags and bags of washing to a launderette .
negative	at the moment i want to hit somebody , i am so frustrated and depressed .
negative	no matter how much you will save by buying on line dont !!!
negative	!
negative	any item where you may have to use the " knowhow " customer service line in currys or p . c .
negative	world whether bought in store or on line , don_'_t , don_'_t , don_'_t , if you value you sanity
negative	previous dealing was with the nottingham branch who i found more than helpful so there are a few staff that can do what they can .
negative	talktalk are not interested in customer_satisfaction .
negative	all they want is your money and they know every trick in the book to get you to part with your cash .
negative	their service is the most unreliable broadband service i have ever used .
negative	they make is very difficult to contact them if there is a problem ... especially by email .
negative	my speed never got above 0 mb and i was forever rebooting the router .
negative	their tech_support are just telephone operators reading from a card of instructions .
negative	after i cancelled my service , they called me at_least three_times a day and pestered me to come back .
negative	also pestered me with emails not to leave .
negative	the way they go about their business must be illegal !
negative	the following is a review that debenhams asked for , then rejected :
negative	" i purchased a red retro phone handset .
negative	the description said it would not only work with iphones , but any that had the correct plug size .
negative	i tried it on my phone ( sony xperia ) as soon as i received it .
negative	did not work , my phone rejected it .
negative	ok maybe my phone is special - oh well .
negative	the problem is that i called customer service twice , to return it .
negative	on both_occasions i was put on hold , then someone put the phone down on me !
negative	that '_s not the way to run a " customer service " team .
negative	now i ' m left with a handset i cannot use and the money i purchased it for is gone !
negative	i am totally dissatisfied with debenhams and have told at_least 0 of my friends about it ."
negative	this is what they had to say about my review :
negative	" there was a problem with your review "
negative	" thank_you for taking the time to write a review for red retro phone handset .
negative	your feedback is very important to us and other customers .
negative	unfortunately , your review has_been rejected as it was deemed to be a customer service issue .
negative	please contact our customer_services .
negative	we encourage you to review our guidelines and resubmit your review on red retro phone handset . "
negative	did they notice that i tried_calling customer service twice ?
negative	the next move was theirs .
negative	don_'_t you think they should have at_least apologized ?
negative	offered to contact me ?
negative	this is their standard " customer service ", lousy !!!
negative	the service gets no better in their stores .
negative	they ignore you , are not helpful and are snooty .
negative	it '_s like the staff think their to good to help you .
negative	charlie
negative	where do i start ?
negative	tried to verify my debit_card , so entropay deposited a small_amount in my bank ac .
negative	there was supposed to be a code - but no code showed in the bank a / c .
negative	cue ticket after ticket pointing this out to them .
negative	don_'_t bother , they '_ll just send boilerplate responses !
negative	oh_yeah , my debit_card was blocked by my bank due to ' suspicious activity ' ( due to the small entropay deposit during verification process ).
negative	rather pull teeth out with rusty pliers , than deal with this lot !
negative	a review for the main superstore in thetford , norfolk .
negative	for starters the food is usually mispriced .
negative	so there '_s an offer for a product , only to find out later that it hasn_'_t been applied !
negative	some of the staff seem quite rude ( both checkout and the shelf stackers ); i '_ve lost_count how many_times i '_ve been given dirty looks ( whilst minding my own business ), and being stared at .
negative	don_'_t the staff have to abide_by some kinda conduct when dealing_with paying customers ?
negative	ok . you need to speak to an actual human_being at natwest ?
negative	good luck with that one !
negative	the ' contact us ' page doesn_'_t provide a tel no , it just tells you to go to their useless ' ask a question ' page , which merrily churns out boiler - plate , generic answers ' till the cows come home ( at_least there '_s a picture of a nice young woman , which is assuring ).
negative	will close my account and look for a bank who aren_'_t afraid of advertising their tel no .
negative	this company is an_absolute joke - the sales staff are useless lazy arrogant bunch of shysters who can '_t be bothered answering the phone cos they know your call will eventually go through to a call_centre , i was told by the a person who actually rang me to discuss my complaint that " the sales managers tell staff not to answer the the phone if there are customers in the shop " !!!!!!!!!????????
negative	what a great customer_relations policy .
negative	he promised me a return call from the complaints_dept .- it '_s 00_hours waiting now .
negative	i hope i don_'_t die before i get that call .
negative	after_reading complaints here and on cpw '_s own website i am not even going to bother pursuing this complaint with this bunch of incompetent untrained , couldn_'_t care_less idiots .
negative	so their complaints policy " i couldn_'_t give a s ** t ." works !.
negative	obviously , more incompetent shambles - less pursued complaints !.
negative	steer_clear save_yourself a load of hassle .
negative	i have been ebaying for a few_years and switched to collectplus when rm changed their prices in april_0000 .
negative	i '_ve now decided never to use collectplus again after having 0 parcels smash , another thrown over the gate and left in front_garden ( clothing ) and 0 parcel had been tampered with - customer claimed that parcel ( mail bag - clothing ) had been slashed opened with something sharp .
negative	i have been sending pyrex for years with rm and have never had a breakage .
negative	i bubble_wrap really well , use strong boxes , pad them out and fill all voids ....... can '_t imagine what collectplus do with the parcels .
negative	i '_ve given collectplus too many chances and just can '_t take the risk any more - my ebay feedback is too important to me .
negative	the couriers and staff at the hub really need to take more care and until they can get that sorted i will switch to myhermes .
negative	i signed_up for giffgaff after experiencing double - billing hell with virgin , expecting something better .
negative	what i got was far worse !
negative	i was one of the unlucky ones who got caught in a website outtage so my recurring goodybag did not recur .
negative	there was no notification of this and i did not get some rather important emails i was waiting for .
negative	fair_enough , they do not claim to supply a business - strength service but an_apology rather_than a load of criticism of me ( the customer ffs !)
negative	and self - righteous gobbledegook would have been fine .
negative	not only did my goodybag not recur , but i was unable to top - up in any way on my account - so effectively they managed to brick my phone !
negative	through all of these hassles there is no one to call up and talk to - you are forced to use their stupid forums where idiots who do not know what they are talking_about and have nothing better to do spam you with useless and inane comments so they can get a few_pence off their next bill !!!
negative	or contact their agents who take 00_hours to respond and then give you an equally useless stock response which indicates they have not even read your question .
negative	when they finally do read it you will get a bunch of patronising garbage about how great they are and not much else .
negative	when my phone finally came back on line after three days i was told that my blackberry services ( yes , i know , sad isn_'_t it ) would take another few_days to resume , even_though i had paid for them , but they weren_'_t sure exactly how long ...
negative	i got on the phone to o0 - talked to a human - they had me sorted with a new account in 00_hours which has_been sweet ever_since and costs about the same !
negative	if it were possible to give negative stars i would give them a hundred - do not use them they are total c_** p !
negative	no fewer than five emails promised a delivery date which was not met .
negative	three emails claimed that goods had been sent when they had not been .
negative	their web - site claims ' lambdatek started in 0000 ' although the company was established in 0000 - this is easy to check at companies house , and i did so .
negative	this company provided the absolute worst customer experience which i have seen .

negative	stay_away !
negative	this is the third parcel in a row that '_s taken ages to deliver . yes i too have the message on the tracking service , card left , which is never in my door , then next_day unable to find . my last parcel of knitting wool from turkey was in my local_depot the very next_day from dispatch . and then took 0 working_days to get 00 miles up the road . customer_services are rude and unhelpful , and my local_depot never answers the phone or replies to messages left . i have made formal complaints on their forms but never_heard back . in future i will find out who the seller will use to deliver my parcel before i buy .
negative	i ordered a bed 0 - 0 delivery no actual date specified waited in and it didn_'_t arrive , emailed , no response .
negative	telephoned day 0 , 0 and they couldn_'_t locate .
negative	delivery company phoned to say it was damaged .
negative	i ordered another same schedule .
negative	day 0 phone_call to say could they deliver , but we away from home , day 0 - 0 parts arrived without warning , one missing , phoned and they said one piece lost , phoned next_day , still lost and so i have cancelled the order after 00 days .
negative	now waiting for the parts delivered to be uplifted .
negative	staff don_'_t seem surprised and willing to accept situation , with one exception will , but nobody will pass my calls onto him
negative	bitterly disapointed .
negative	below is a letter i sent to the ceo of the company to which he has replied but not carried_out any of what he said he would do .
negative	dear_mr lindsay
negative	to say that i am disappointed would be a great understatement .
negative	i have just had to suffer 00_hours without electricity due to utility_warehouse ’_s non - existent out of hours support .
negative	this has come at a time when with a family funeral yesterday and having my daughter and 0 month old grandson staying with me ( both with heart conditions ), i was forced to try to find them other accommodation nearby due to the lack of light , heating and hot_water .
negative	the problem_arose because of a fault in the local sub - station which caused a surge that destroyed my meter .
negative	as this was after 0 :_00pm , it was impossible to contact anyone at utility_warehouse to ask for assistance .
negative	i contacted uk power networks which is our local electricity distributer and they came out and checked my main fuse and confirmed that electricity was back on and coming to the house but that the meter was disabled .
negative	my house was the only one in my street and even the whole village that was without power once the sub - station issue was resolved .
negative	uk power networks said that the meter was your responsibility and had to be replaced by utility_warehouse as the supplier .
negative	this left me in a ridiculous situation because utility_warehouse doesn ’ t have an out of hours service and so i couldn ’ t reach anyone to arrange for the meter to be replaced .
negative	i used my neighbour ’_s computer to search your internet and this is what i found .
negative	what should i do if i have no gas and / or electricity ?
negative	“ please call our prepayment team on 0000 000 0000 .
negative	they ' re available monday - friday 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 and saturday 0000 - 00 : 00 .
negative	if you require emergency advice at any other times please contact your local electricity distributor ”
negative	the electrical distributor is uk power networks , so i was back to square one .
negative	i have lost food in 0 freezers that are in the garage – our chest_freezer and one freezer full of burgers for a cub event that i am organising for 0 weeks ’ time and also lost food in my fridge_freezer indoors .
negative	i did show your distributor this last_night .
negative	additionally i have lost £_00 of credit on my key meter and key which has not been transferred to my new meter , and £_00 . 00 for a day i could not go to work , also the cost of 0 letters sent via recorded delivery .
negative	i find it unbelievable that there isn ’ t an_emergency contact point within utility_warehouse when something like this happens – the fitter who was eventually sent to replace the meter yesterday lunchtime said that he was available and on call the night before as lowie beck were aware of the situation with the substation fire .
negative	if i had managed to get hold of someone from uw he would have been able to replace my meter within 0 hours .
negative	instead due to your lack of duty of care i had to suffer 00_hours with no electricity and significant discomfort , hardship and stress .
negative	i think that it is a shameful situation that could so easily have been avoided if your company had only had an_emergency service in place instead of just relying on the other_companies .
negative	as they said it isn ’ t their responsibility !
negative	i telephoned your customer service yesterday at approx .
negative	00 . 00 lunch_time , i spoke to joy in prepayment , i told her of my situation and i asked that a manger call me back within the hour .
negative	it is now 00_hours after that call to your company and i have not received any phone_call whatsoever from your company .
negative	i want to know how i will be compensated for this horrific experience – i was told that the customer service would be excellent with utility_warehouse and my family and i have been scarred by this experience .
negative	i need to feel that somebody there cares_about what has happened .
negative	and i also think the thousands of your customers that put you in the position you are in are made fully_aware that if their meter goes_wrong ( as mine did through no fault of mine ) that they will have to ensure it is between the hours of 0am and 0 . 00pm .
negative	you have a major floor within your company which should never have happened and it certainly should have never happened to me and my family .
negative	my uw distributor was the only person i could get hold of and even he couldn ’ t help me because you had no out of hours contact .
negative	i look_forward to hearing from you .
negative	i have ordered replica chanel embossed crocodile flap bag and have never received .
negative	my friend ordered a replica bag too but received a very cheap children one .
negative	i am sure they have changed their name as i
negative	i cannot open their web_site , probable have few sites .
negative	never trust them untill you are paying by paypal .
negative	i arranged for city_link to collect a wheel / tyre in london on the 0th_december_0000 .
negative	their driver never made any attempt to collect & after being chased by the seller we arranged a further collection date for the 00th_december_0000 .
negative	true to form city_link didn_'_t turn_up on the 00th but did on the 00st_december_0000 .
negative	then the parcel just disappeared & i thought that i would be making a claim .
negative	hopefully the parcel will be delivered tomorrow , just one month after i arranged collection .
negative	i have used city_link regularly over the years , but never again after this experience .
negative	the recent change of ownership seems to have marked a deterioration in their service .
negative	i placed an online order with toolstation yesterday for delivery today .
negative	since i last ordered online , toolstation have switched from royal_mail to comedians yodel .
negative	the order which i required for tomorrow never showed up with yodel today .
negative	i have checked the yodel online tracking which is a joke .
negative	i have emailed toolstation & cancelled my order as i am not prepared to wait_until yodel get around to delivering to me .
negative	i will never again place an online order with toolstation & you out there now also have been_warned .
negative	i ordered a kartell componibili storage_unit from this ' designer living specialist '.
negative	i paid for it , waited for it to come and was very patient when there was a delay in sending it to the uk , where i live .
negative	in short , i have not received the item .
negative	there was ( apparently ) an attempted delivery one day when i was out at work .
negative	since then , i have emailed at_least 0 times a day to try and find out how i can receive it .
negative	they refuse to give me a phone number or contact details for the carrier service , dhl .
negative	when i tried_calling dhl uk myself , they said they were ' acting as a third_party ' and couldn_'_t help me , or give me any other phone number .
negative	ambiente '_s only reply is that i can ' collect the item from my next ( sic ) post_office '.
negative	when i responded asking where that might be , and whether they meant a dhl delivery depot rather_than the royal_mail , there was silence .
negative	since then i have received no reply to any of my communications .
negative	basically , they don_'_t want to know .
negative	they have my money and presumably , in the end , the item will get sent back to them .
negative	i ordered a collection for the monday , late_afternoon they cancelled on me , then re booked for tuesday , i spend an_hour on chat trying to explain i was not in tue and they should make it wed but i will be out after 0pm ( that '_s why i booked mon as i was in all day !)
negative	someone still came at 000pm to collect on tue after me saying we were out !
negative	then again someone came on wed !
negative	they said on monday they would upgrade it to a 00 hour delivery so i didn_'_t lose out !
negative	it took 0 days to get there , i called them asking why it wasn_'_t delivered they said 00 hour means 0 - 0 days ?????
negative	surly the clue is in the title ?
negative	00_hours ???
negative	on the thursday i contacted them again asking where my parcel was they said they don_'_t know but will let me know when they are ready , i said no , i need to know now !
negative	they said we will let you know , i was not happy !!!!!
negative	they never came back and let me know at all !
negative	stay_away from this company !
negative	unless you want nothing but hassle and problems !
negative	i contacted them again for a full_refund we were arguing back and forth for ages until they agreed to a partial_refund , it just wasn_'_t good enough !
negative	i spend 0 days trying to sort this out , over an_hour a day on the phone and on live_chat !
negative	bad service stick with [_external_reference_] go !
negative	chesstelecom were responsible for delaying our office move by fours weeks , even after we had factored in a " worst - case - senario " 0 month provision .
negative	after that we had three_months of invoice errors and have been waiting four weeks while the matter is investigated .
negative	in a nutshell ; calls are never returned , emails seldom replied to , " account managers " who could manage their way out of a paper bag and countless broken_promises .
negative	they describe this on their website as award winning customer service - i beg to differ .
negative	i liked the idea of hiring a long lens for a family safari , but unfortunately chose lenses for hire .
negative	the lens itself was poorly maintained , scratched and rattled and the results were less_than pleasing .
negative	unfortunately the worst part came after the holiday when threatening emails started to arrive claiming additional_charges .
negative	nearly a year on i am still being chased by them highlighting small_print in their t + c '_s and threatening even larger bills .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	bought a phone form them last november and today it wouldn_'_t turn on .
negative	so returned it to my local_store where i purchased it from .
negative	they out right refused to accept it as a faulty return , they gave me a phone number and said i had to return it myself .
negative	i explained to them that the whole reason i purchased it from a high_street store is because i wanted to be able to return it quickly if anything went wrong with it .
negative	he said that they no_longer accept returns as they cannot do anything with it and blamed it all on the network_provider !????
negative	i spoke to the manager and he said exactly the same !
negative	the phone is still under_warranty and i now have to return it to the manufacturer myself and deal with them .
negative	absolutely_disgusted with them and would recommend to anyone to steer_clear !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i booked car_hire which was reasonable price for weekend , arrived at designation was informed by the car_hire firm i did not require my booking info was upgraded and mis_- sold by the appointed .
negative	extra money was taken from my bank_account .
negative	addressed this immediately on my return with both expedia and the car_hire company appointed both would not accept the facts given and took months to even get that far with frequent opening and closing of the complaints_procedure which in itself is set_up to buy them more time to make it look like the targets on addressing complaints has_been achieved .
negative	informed both expedia and budget car_hire i and that of associates would never ever use either organisation again nor that of our associates , which i happy to report from last_year is successfully achieved .
negative	i booked car_hire which was reasonable price for weekend , arrived at designation was informed by the car_hire firm i did not require my booking info got an upgraded and mis_- sold by the appointed car_hire company which was budget car_hire .

negative	informed both expedia and budget car_hire i and that of our associates would never ever use either organisation again which thus_far i happy to report is successfully achieved and only hope it continues to grow in support .
negative	i got a nokia lumnia with vodafone in may 0000 .
negative	they gave me a test_drive on data which was why i got the phone , but despite_repeated calls to vodafone , it never worked .
negative	didn_'_t stop them upping my usage to 0gb though , and they charged me for it !
negative	i went abroad in december thinking i ' d have my phone , but two bills of over £_000 despite phone not working at all in second week of trip definitely put me off vodafone forever .
negative	can '_t wait for my contract to end so i can go_elsewhere !
negative	i can '_t believe anyone_else could be worse .
negative	where '_s the no stars please !
negative	ordered & paid for bathroom on monday 00th_feb , was told on the dispatch date , wed 00th_feb , that delivery company would be in touch within next 0 days .... still_waiting and this is day 0 !!
negative	i have tried telephoning better_bathrooms , was kept waiting with no reply for 00mins , i have emailed better_bathrooms customer_services and had no reply .
negative	had further orders to place such as tiles and accessories inorder to complete the room ... will be going else where .
negative	only reason there is 0 star is because i was impressed with the original advert and price !
negative	!
negative	my order 00000000 was for instore collection .
negative	received acknowledgement , confirmation and delivery notification but article was not at store when i called to collect .
negative	many calls and e_- mails not responded .
negative	still_waiting ten days_later .
negative	no updates .
negative	nothing .
negative	advise go_elsewhere .
negative	this company is on a downward spiral as far as service is concerned .
negative	why does this company not respond to emails and promise 00 hour turnaround when they clearly haven_'_t the capacity to do so ?
negative	i ' m wondering_if the good reviews are posted by friends ?
negative	my ref no ends in 00 - rotten apples .
negative	please send it back , i '_ve already wasted £_00 on a contract i haven_'_t been able to use .
negative	delivery was very slow , i had to contact them to find out about delivery .
negative	i couldn_'_t leave a phone message as the box was full twice .
negative	when item finally arrived it wasn_'_t suitable and they had the audacity to deduct 00_% from my refund .
negative	overall i was dissapointed and wouldn_'_t use them again
negative	we were waiting for a delivery that should have arrived two days ago .
negative	we checked the tracking_info on the hermes , or herpes as we call them , website .
negative	it showed " delivered to porch " two day ago !
negative	we don_'_t have a " porch ".
negative	after a thorough search of the garden , bins , patio we could not find anything .
negative	hermes /_herpes allow or want contact from their victims as they don_'_t care and their victims don_'_t matter to them .
negative	so we contacted the company from which we bought the item .
negative	one email and three phone_calls in n afternoon later we received a call from the shop .
negative	the lame_excuse they had received from hermes /_herpes was that the " regular " driver was off sick .
negative	the stand in driver had " scanned all their deliveries wrong ", whatever that means .
negative	so they had not in fact delivered the package .
negative	strange how we only received this admission from them after we complained and said we could prove no delivery had been made .
negative	we had checked our cctv for the day in question and no one had attempted a delivery !
negative	it has still yet to arrive , we have been assured it will arrive today .
negative	if we ' re lucky !
negative	in august we used hermes /_herpes to send an item we had sold on amazon .
negative	a the customer contacted us later to say they had not received it .
negative	we checked and found that the hermes /_herpes driver had delivered it by throwing it over a garden fence !
negative	my wife '_s seller status with amazon was downgraded as a result of hermes /_herpes shabby action .
negative	even_though we had done everything we could to sort it out .
negative	only after a direct email to jeff bezos , the owner of amazon , was my wifes status returned to it '_s former five_star_rating .
negative	we will never use hermes /_herpes again .
negative	we now ask every online seller we buy from who they use for deliveries .
negative	if they say hermes /_herpes we tell them they have lost a sale as a result and we shop somewhere_else .
negative	this uncaring , shabby , third rate , pathetic excuse for a delivery company don_'_t want to hear from their victims .
negative	their cowardly attitude means there is only one recourse . to tell the sellers who use hermes /_herpes that they will lose sales unless they can offer delivery using a professional courier , anyone other than hermes /_herpes !
negative	if enough people boycott these_cowboys then they will either go out of business or start operating like professional couriers !
negative	we have received terrible service from city_link over and over again .
negative	they seldom deliver next_day and very recently my parcel was just dumped in a farmyard about a mile away from our house .
negative	perishable goods were ruined .
negative	more often than not we have to do a 00 miles round_trip to collect goods which we have been urgently expecting .
negative	they are a total let_down and i would not advise_anyone to seriously_consider_using them for their business or personal requirements .
negative	i found buymobilephones through uswitch . com as a best deal on a samsung_galaxy 0 ,. the offer was for a free mobile_phone on a 00 month_contract but after asking for the phone to be delivered to my works address as i am not at home all day they asked me for £_000 deposit which would be refunded at the end of the contract !
negative	their customer service line took 00_minutes to respond to my call and you cannot contact them by email .
negative	i am sure that some customers are satisfied with their service but personally i would never even think about doing_business with a company like this .
negative	i bought 0 of their platinum collection to give as gifts later on in the year .
negative	when these items arrived in june_0000 , i noticed that they had expiration dates of july_0000 .
negative	so i tried to call them to complain , they have no number listed ( see other_reviewers comments_below ).
negative	when i did find a number online , i left 0 messages and no one returned my calls , so i resorted to emailing them .
negative	below is the response i received from their customer_services department , when i asked for a full_refund , because their items were short_dated .
negative	in fairness , i have no_idea what their chocolate tastes like as i still want to return it and get my money back :
negative	hello ,
negative	thank_you for your enquiry .
negative	i can advise that perishable items such as food stuffs are not covered_under distance_selling regulations .
negative	the only item we allow customers to return are our best of the best introductory selection .
negative	as you have not purchased this particular selection you are unable to return the items to us .
negative	any dispute raised with your card_issuer will be responded to with all evidence of these emails and exceptions to the distant selling regulations provided .
negative	i would also advise that peeta selection has a near 0 month shelf_life and the queenie selection nearly 0 months .
negative	i would not call this a short shelf_life .

negative	i wanted a canvas picture for my oh '_s christmas_present , and wowcher had a promo for just this .
negative	paid my money , got my voucher , uploaded the photo and feel i got stung on the pp , but a month later , no goods .
negative	i emailed wowcher two_weeks_ago asking how i go about chasing my goods , but no reply .
negative	today i have emailed again , but am giving up hope of getting the canvas in time for christmas which is one month away .
negative	i have lost out money i cannot_afford , and learned a lesson .
negative	stick to sites i can trust .
negative	wowcher - disappointed with the poor service from your provider and your customer_services
negative	my teenage_son is addicted to pizza and over the last few_months we have tried several pizzahuts in london '_s west end .
negative	firstly they lull you into_believing there '_s plenty of seats by having the visible part of the restaurant fairly quiet .
negative	when you enter they then direct you , dependent on the specific " hut " either upstairs or downstairs , where you then wait in a queue for a table .
negative	you then sit and wait for your order to be taken .
negative	then wait for your drinks .
negative	then wait for your starters .
negative	then wait for your main course .
negative	then wait and wait for the bill .
negative	these places have nearly made me lose the will to live !
negative	i complained to their head_office and got a voucher to use for another pizzahut " experience "... that one was all about waiting too .
negative	there '_s lots more to complain_about with regards to the staff and the staff attitude ... to be fair , the food is reasonable for this type of place .
negative	but the staff and loss of many hours of your life easily detract from that .
negative	i never received the goods .
negative	no refund and they said it could take 0 months only if goods were returned and then they would deduct the carriage .
negative	it is 0 weeks since i received only part of my order .
negative	i still have not received the refund for the products they didn_'_t have .
negative	mitesh soma , you should be_ashamed of yourself , taking money under_false pretences from the most vulnerable people in society , yes thats right - shame on you ......
negative	after a week when my order did not arrive i contacted medicanimal and was told my order had been delivered , eventually i was told it had been delivered to the wrong_address and it would be collected and redelivered .
negative	this never happened , my partner went to the address it was delivered to and was told it had been collected the same day , i was then told it had gone back to the warehouse as the bag was torn !
negative	i had to but food as i had not got my delivery , when i complained i was told to scan over the receipt which i did but still no sign of my refund .
negative	having spent over a hundred pound i am very disappointed with the service .
negative	i doubt i will use this company again , mistakes_happen but to be told two different stories does not give one confidence in the company .
negative	i did eventually receive my goods .
negative	made the mistake of ordering from wae_+ without researching first .
negative	i needed a particular motherboard to replace a faulty one that would accept my aging components .
negative	this was difficult to source which may have been responsible for my lapse in not googling wae_+ before ordering .
negative	ordered on 00 june for delivery by 00 june that seemed quite reasonable .
negative	the 00 june came and went .
negative	wae_+ website said my order was " awaiting fullfilment ".
negative	it was obvious it wasn_'_t in stock so i cancelled .
negative	wae_+ replied they were expecting delivery within 0 - 0 working_days and would i like to wait .
negative	i confirmed my wish to cancel .
negative	after 0 days i enquired where my refund was .
negative	aftr 00 days i informed wae_+ if i did not receive it within the next 0 days i would be contacting my credit_card company .
negative	the reply was that under their terms and conditions they had 00 days from date of cancellation to refund .
negative	under the distance_selling regulations refunds should be made as soon as possible and no later than 00 days .
negative	funny that .
negative	i bid my time and waited for the 00 days to expire which they duly did .
negative	after 00 days i informed wae_+ that if i did not receive my refund within 0 days i would initiate a chargeback through my credit_card company .
negative	after 00 days i received my refund and a very polite apologetic message giving the impression my difficulties were abnormal .
negative	the forums tell a different_story .
negative	the message included the following sentence : " we really do value our customers and your custom and look_forward to continuing our relationship in the near_future .".
negative	frankly if wae_+ were the last woman on earth i would turn homosexual .
negative	conclusions : wae_+ advertise products that are not in stock .
negative	wae_+ give delivery dates for products that are not in stock .
negative	wae_+ will delay refunding for as long as possible .
negative	i very much suspect that if i had not paid by credit_card i would still be waiting for my refund .
negative	it appears that delaying refunding as long as possible is part of their business plan .
negative	- good for their cashflow .
negative	do you really want to deal with this company ?
negative	i love talent shows .
negative	why do we have to sit and listen to all the drivel and hype and be spoon fed opinions from talentless know it all judges .
negative	i want to listen to the acts they should be heard .
negative	so i don_'_t watch any more .
negative	change the format before you kill simon cowels golden goose .
negative	who do the judges think they are .
negative	do they really think we are stupid enough to believe these judges know what they are talking_about .
negative	i and others with no musical experience can pick the talent with a lot more creditability than these judges .
negative	lets have a talent show for judges and see how far these four go .
negative	if the adverts don_'_t work they won_'_t advertise .
negative	then no more company and no more brainwashing .
negative	how dare they interfere with my brain .
negative	it is a disgrace .
negative	i take great umbridge to being subjected to these awful television adverts that are only there to imprint those numbers into your brain at the exclusion of other good companies that cant_afford the advertising .
negative	we were meant to have free competitive companies but this company have successfully killed of the opposition .
negative	now we pay for an over priced service that should be free .
negative	dreadful company to deal with .
negative	poor after_sales , badly written contracts designed to mislead and hide the pitfalls .
negative	misleading advertising .
negative	dont know anyone who has a good experience .
negative	mine was not a good one and would never use again .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid
negative	i hate the email tricks they play .
negative	sending out offers of free business_cards which turn out not to be free after all .
negative	scammers
negative	disappointed was looking for an_alternative to ebay but this one is worse .
negative	impossible to use the free with with any useful result .
negative	waste of time
negative	throw them in the bin not out of the car window .
negative	foxes and birds get run over and killed trying to eat them .
negative	better still don_'_t buy them .
negative	save your money for something edible .
negative	lousy service lousy food
negative	not worth the bother
negative	yes that '_s what the sign said on new years day at poole branch when i was taking my non working newly purchased laptop back and that is exactly_what my experience of their after_sales service became .
negative	wo for me and wow for them .
negative	playing ping pong with a laptop .
negative	in the end i gave up trying to get them to admit it was faulty and paid for a repair elsewhere .
negative	the last place you should ever shop in .
negative	the laptops might look the same as you buy elsewhere but inside they are built with substandard parts .
negative	beware go_elsewhere
negative	no christmas spirit from them .
negative	no free listings this month .
negative	they now take 00_% of your money .
negative	the poor that sell the poor that pay .
negative	one bad customer and your reputation is ruined .
negative	buyers get protection .
negative	sellers get none .
negative	sellers pay the fee .
negative	buyers pay none .
negative	sellers sell none .
negative	buyers buy none .
negative	ebay gets none .
negative	perhaps then they will review their fee '_s
negative	they used to be cheap and good value .
negative	went there recently intending to fill my shopping_basket with all the items they sold cheaper_than tesco '_s .
negative	not any more though .
negative	came out with only 0 items and then found cheaper equivalent at tesco .
negative	i was amazed as in the past you could fill your basket with gay abandon .
negative	i think they are now trading on that reputation and joining the band wagon of rising supermarket prices which are catching people out because we seem to just accept that prices have gone up everywhere .
negative	well they have gone up a lot at aldi and far more than the others .
negative	i call this sharp_practice and have no confidence to shop there any more .
negative	sainsbury '_s or tesco '_s for me from now on .
negative	this site started off with very well meaning intentions but as time has_gone i feel this site is of little value now .
negative	developed into a cash cow portal for martin_lewis '_s entrepreneurial ambitions .
negative	the content has very little meaningful value and it is not possible to influence this by way of dialogue .
negative	martin is far to busy for that .
negative	searching for answers to real problems results in no practical advice of substance .
negative	fine till they lose a parcel .
negative	then the nightmare begins .
negative	i will never use again 0 days on live_chat getting nothing but appeasement and lies .
negative	they even apologised for lying .
negative	what a cheek .
negative	lost out big time .
negative	never again
negative	as an update i have now been contacted by [_name ] by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
negative	she was very apologetic and i am going to use parcel0go again but definitely not hermes .
negative	[_name ] said parcel0go are carrying out a full investigation and if they find the parcel as well as the refund they will send the parcel back as well .
negative	this would be a good outcome and i will then remove this review and write a new review that reflects an excellent company that acts in an honourable and ethical way .
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to [_private data ] in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning [_private data ] this may cost 00p_per_minute .
negative	used this company many_times without to much bother .
negative	i got lulled into a false sense of security .
negative	now they have lost my parcel and i am out of pocket , lost a good customer got bad feedback spent 0 days so far trying to sort_out .
negative	customer_services is a complete wind up .
negative	if you think hermes is bad try booking through parcel0go .
negative	now that is the biggest wind up i have ever had .
negative	one bad_experience with either of these companies will fill you with enough hatred to last a lifetime .
negative	don_'_t think " it will not happen to me " because it will .
negative	then you also will experience the nightmare and no what i mean .
negative	i wish i had paid the extra and gone elsewhere .
negative	don_'_t get caught_out .
negative	you have been_warned .
negative	as an update i have now been contacted by jenny bowles by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
negative	she was very apologetic and i am going to use parcel0go again but definitely not hermes .
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to j . bowles @ parcel0go . com in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning 0000 0000000 this may cost 00p_per_minute .
negative	never buy anything from merlin_cycles .
negative	i bought new avid brakes and they arrived leaking brake fluid .
negative	merlin_cycles tell me that it ’_s normal , but anyone with half a clue about bikes knows that to be rubbish .
negative	they also told me i ’ d have to pay to send them back , but i found it simpler to buy a service kit from elsewhere that solved the problem .
negative	my order was placed from your website for tyres to be delivered to ****.
negative	having received notification today from dpd the tyres have been delivered i contacted **** to arrange fitting but they confirmed they have not received the tyres .
negative	it transpires the postcode for **** on your website is wrong rm0 @@@ it should be rm0 +++ and my tyres have been delivered to an unknown location !
negative	i am really very annoyed about this , i feel an_immediate_refund should be made to me as i am not about to go hunting for tyres that have been wrongly delivered because the information on your website is wrong .
negative	you can contact me on *******
negative	i have now spoken again with the proprietor of ++++ and he has kindly been out with his satnav to see if he could locate another business the tyres may have been delivered to in the piostcode ???
negative	?, the code relates to private houses !
negative	quite why dpd delivered to a private house when it clarely should be going to a business is beyond me but the postcode came from your website so it is ultimately your problem to address .
negative	i will now have to seek tyres from somewhere more trustworthy , please issue an_immediate_refund and confirm .

negative	best regards ,

negative	thank_you oliver ,
negative	i need to source tyres now from somewhere_else - i haven_'_t received the ones ordered from tyreleader so please issue a full_refund and confirm .
negative	thank_you .
negative	regards
negative	m
negative	the investigation is under way .
negative	please send over a joint statement with the garage that none of you you have received the tyres .

negative	this is preposterous !
negative	i have told you i haven_'_t received the tyres i have also confirmed on here in writing that the fitters have not received the tyres , i can do no more !
negative	i have never dealt_with a more obstructive and unhelpful outfit , this will be put under my comments for all to see .
negative	the way i am being treated by tyreleader is a disgrace !
negative	it is not up to me to sort_out problems you have created !
negative	i repeat - i have not received my tyres , nor has your designated fitter per the ( incorrect ) details taken from your website .
negative	i want an_immediate_refund i am entitled to under the sale of goods_act .

negative	mike ,
negative	if you wanta solution to this problem , please send me over a document as requested .
negative	in pdf form .
negative	best regards ,
negative	you know this is not possible , how can i get someone_else miles from where i live to write on and sign a piece of paper for me to then send to you ?
negative	this is your error , i have paid and you are keeping my money under_false pretences
negative	i will now deal with the matter through my credit_card company
negative	your company and behaviour are an utter disgrace and will be reported - my transript will be available to all .
negative	having been an existing customer of this company i decided to use them for a vet prescription purchase ( to avoid the 000_% mark up at the vets as its long_term medication ) i understand they cannot dispense meds without the hard copy prescription so posted 0st_class on sunday expecting at the very latest tuesday receipt ?
negative	i paid for my order on the sunday and therefore expected my order to be prepared ready for the prescription receipt which was marked urgent complete with order number to avoid any delays in matching it with my already paid for order .
negative	i also emailed daily sometimes twice to ensure vetsuk got the message i needed the medication urgently for my sick pet .
negative	there is no phone contact listed !
negative	they responded to each email_saying they had not received my prescription through the post until thursday ( 0st_class mail ???)
negative	i wish i had got signed for at the post_office but didn_'_t think necessary at the time ?
negative	i received an_email friday to say that my order ( several other items have been ordered ) was due to be dispatched .
negative	i rang them after receipt of the invoice showing a telephone_number .
negative	i complained about the length of time it had taken to dispense and despatch my urgent order and asked them to upgrade to next_day which meant saturday delivery ?
negative	they dont do weekend delivery using dpd !!
negative	i am still_waiting for the delivery and have had to sort interim pain relief .
negative	never again will i use this company they could have helped_me by ensuring my order was dispatched quickly with all the contact i have made but they just didn_'_t care !!!
negative	!
negative	having shopped on the internet for years i got caught_out buying from this supplier after checking their " excellent reviews "????
negative	ordered an ipad on 00 / 00 / 00 showing in stock , 0 / 00 days delivery , credit_card debited immediately !
negative	suffice to say , no goods arrived after several emails of promises , can '_t get through to helpline , always in a queue .
negative	i have finally cancelled the order 00 / 00 /_0000 and would rather pay more and get the goods immediately from a reputable company .
negative	i was offered a screen_protector and upgraded delivery ( laughable if not infuriating ).
negative	am awaiting a refund although i have already contacted my credit_card_provider to put the sale in dispute ...
negative	i will also be looking to report to trading_standards .
negative	asked to cancel coconut chair after delivery was postponed same as everyone_else on this site !
negative	someone called and said i couldn_'_t cancel until the 00 week delivery deadline .
negative	i asked then that someone give me a call back at 00 weeks .
negative	they did call me back and confirmed that yes i could now cancel the item and that i would get my refund within 00 days .
negative	i know , this is probably the same conversation that a lot of people have had with them and no refund is forthcoming .
negative	i am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and see what happens in 00 days .
negative	will review again in 00 days !
negative	wanted to update my review to say that my money was never forthcoming in spite of customer_services saying they would chase the finance department .
negative	got in touch with barclaycard who have refunded me the money and will be pursuing infurn to get their money back .
negative	if you paid on credit_card do get in touch with them as they may be able to help .
negative	how does a company like this stay in business .
negative	they take your money and never deliver the goods .
negative	i placed an order on 0st november .
negative	after a month started to wonder where the canvas was and what was the problem .
negative	called their offices and was told it would be sent in the next few_days .
negative	next phone_call was told it had left their offices and was on its way .
negative	never arrived .
negative	called again and was told will be sent out in few_days .
negative	asked for someone to call me back as i wanted a refund as i didn_'_t believe a word of what they were saying .
negative	of course nobody called back and have had no refund .
negative	if you are considering using this company don_'_t .
negative	there are companies out there who are a pleasure to deal with and deliver what they say they will .
negative	this company is not one of them !
negative	booked top price tickets back in september , 0 month before event informed that my seats are no_longer available and i have been moved to alternative seating which are 0 block further away and also in a different price bracket .
negative	i phoned and emailed them regarding this but they insist the tickets are of the same value , even_though if you try to book on their website the block i have now been allocated is £_00 . 00 cheaper_than what i originally paid !
negative	now with one week to go they say that they are unable to help me further and if i am still not happy to contact the promoters , this is a complete_joke .
negative	i will now wait_until i attend the concert and see if i can sort anything out then , but i will never use this company again , complete_shambles .
negative	may i also point out that this has happened to my friend for a different concert , booked great seats and then moved to just ok ones , i am beginning to think they sell the best seats and then move you so they can sell the good seats again !!
negative	avoid if you want a hassle_free booking .
negative	had used before and was quite pleased with service .
negative	however my recent order to my aunt who has terminal cancer was appalling and embarrassing .
negative	this was a gesture supposed to cheer_her up but firstly , the bunch arrived a day after they were due to be delivered with no apologies .
negative	secondly , i decided to upgrade to a medium - sized version of bouquet i had sent before .
negative	this time , the bunch that arrived was smaller than the standard size sent before , wilting and dying by the next_day .
negative	their site guarantees 000_% customer_satisfaction - don_'_t be_fooled !
negative	customer service was disgraceful !!!!!!
negative	thinking they would be horrified about this delivery and falling over themselves to correct this situation , i emailed their customer service with proof by way of photo my aunt had sent and requesting a replacement .
negative	00_hours_later got a reply which i can only think is automated because it did not address the question of a replacement .
negative	after sending out another 0 emails - and a 00 hour wait for a reply appears to be the minimum waiting period for a reply , i telephoned and was asked to send the photo again directly to the person i was speaking to .
negative	finally was told that having looked at the photo with her supervisor - nothing could be done because as far as they were concerned the flowers were alright .
negative	asked to speak to the supervisor who was conveniently out and left my number for her to contact me .
negative	never did !
negative	!
negative	i have never written a bad review before but really feel i should alert anyone wising to use this service don_'_t !
negative	i wish i could upload picture as proof but suffice to say a bunch from outside a garage would have been better value and less embarrassing .
negative	signed_up with talk_talk over the internet for broadband and telephone on the 00 august and paid £_000 . 00 line_rental up front by debit_card .
negative	received a confirmation_email on the 00 august advising me the my service will be up and running within 00 days , 0 september received my september bill for zero , tried to log onto my account on the 0 september to get an update , could not log on so rang talk_talk and spent 00_minutes trying to explain i could not log on to my account , only to told i had a credit on my account of £_000 . 00 and my account had been deactivated ?
negative	asked to speak to a manager who eventually explained that talk_talk could not provide me with the service , something to do with my local exchange .
negative	ok only 00 days wasted , no email from talk_talk to tell me that they could not provide the service , just please refund my £_000 . 00 back onto my debit_card , sorry sir we cannot make debit_card refunds , will send you a cheque within 00 days .
negative	so t t take my money for a service they cannot provide , give me every indication that the service will be activated within 00 days , send me a bill , but don_'_t bother to tell me they cannot provide me with the service and then expect me to wait up to another 00 days for a cheque that i have to drive 00 miles to the the bank to pay in and then wait another 0 days for it to clear , so in total tt can hold on to my money for up to 00 days , how many people are they doing this too .
negative	to make_matters worse i was told i was not forced to pay the line_rental in advance , then told i could have the service if i paid for a new line , another £_00 . 00 please , i checked the possibility of this with tt sales and was told it was impossible .
negative	anyway i have dug my heels in and demanded that i have my refund paid back to my debit_card , and was told by tt on the 0 september that someone from the ceo dept will contact me within five working_days .
negative	would you believe it september 00 and no contact , so i call tt again put on hold again , only to be told ceo has a bit of a back log someone should be back to you within the next two days .
negative	one could be forgiven for thinking this could be a way to make a little more profit , entice potential_customers with attractive offers and discounts if they pay in advance and then hold on to the money for as long as possible if they cannot provide the service .
negative	i run my own business so am used to dealing occasionally with idiots , and people that try to take_advantage , but what about all the people that get bullied into excepting excuses , and fobbed_off .
negative	i await your reply talk_talk
negative	i organised for a parcel to be collected from my home near southampton to be delivered to cornwall on a next_day service .
negative	the parcel was packed and awaiting_collection and my daughter waited in all day .
negative	by 0 . 00 pm it was still_awaiting_collection .
negative	at this point i tried searching the internet for a customer service telephone_number to find out if the collection was due to happen .
negative	it seems impossible to find a number .
negative	i then tried the tracking_number which told me the parcel which was still in my hall awaiting_collection had been delivered to glasgow !
negative	i then had to drive to the nearest parcelforce depot to send the parcel to arrive the next_day .
negative	fortunately for me the cost was half that of parcel0go but i now have the problem of trying to obtain a refund from a company that you can not speak to !
negative	very poor service
negative	the company ... horrid
negative	ordered an item and never came told to wait 00 days before anything could happen .
negative	i ordered dog boots and dog blankets for over £_00 .
negative	i received a message to say the boots were not in stock ; however , they were debited from my account and in spite of a promise to refund , they were never refunded .
negative	i returned the dog blankets as the sizes were wrong .
negative	however , i have never received a refund for my returns , sent by royal_mail recorded delivery .
negative	the website does not give a phone number or email address for the company .
negative	it can only be contacted by its own contact form .
negative	in short , they make themselves rather unreachable .
negative	i agree with the other reviewer that the website looks very professional but the actual service does not back this up .
negative	i have contacted them again to ask for my money back .
negative	if i do not get a refund , i will contact trading_standards about this company .
negative	i would have liked to review the quality of the flowers but my order never arrived the tracking_system said they were out for delivery and could arrive any time up to 0pm so wheh this all fell through i had no time to find any alternative .
negative	surely a company specialising in the delivery of flowers should know the importance of meeting delivery commitments and they must have known that 0hey were going to let me down whattever the reason was , but no one bothered to contact me and give a reason . i can only suggest if you have a special_occasion you want to celebrate with flowers chose a company that cares_about its commitments
negative	i saw what looked to be a great deal when i was looking to service my mazda for full service and mot .
negative	a quick search on google_search_engine and up popped service stop winners of dragon '_s den !
negative	impressed ?
negative	car was picked_up as arranged would be returned between 0 and 0 pm .
negative	we will contact you if there are any_problems , so far so good .
negative	! 0 : 00_hours phone_call from service stop " we have sent you an_email with a pro forma invoice ", " ok i will have a look ad get back to you ".
negative	to my horror i find that there are a few jobs needed to be done to get it through the mot 0 .
negative	cut in tyre at off side rear cost to repair £_00 . 00 +_vat £_000 .
negative	0 , the other 0 tyres have nails in them ?
negative	£_00 headlamps too low £_00 to re set them .
negative	brake discs worn and pitted £_000 ...... windscreen wiper not clearing windscreen properly the list goes on ..... total_cost £_000 . 00 !!!!!!!!
negative	phoned them back and told them i will get the work done elsewhere and just pay for the service and mot greed £_000 as they wont release the car until you have paid !!
negative	i paid by credit_card and waited for it to be brought back at the agreed time .. 0 to 0pm it got to 00 : 00 no sign of car ring them .
negative	" stuck in traffic " 00 : 00 where is my car ?
negative	" round the corner ."
negative	with you soon .
negative	00 : 00 where are you with my car !
negative	i ' m going to ring police my car has_been stolen !!
negative	oh the drivers just leaving the garage now ' darling ',!
negative	now they are lying and patronising me !
negative	car finally arrives at 00 : 00 i ' m fuming .
negative	poor driver got the brunt of my anger ( he only collects and delivers )
negative	i went to get tyres checked .
negative	0 needed_replacing .
negative	lights were ok as were the brake discs the wiper needed adjusting .
negative	but i got it replaced total_cost for all this ..... £_00 took it myself to the garage service stop had taken it to and it passed .
negative	i told them what i thought and as a gesture of goodwill they cleaned the car ( which should have been included anyway !)
negative	had i been less assertive i could have been conned into getting un necessary work done at an extortionate cost i will_definitely not be using them again i will however be contacting_trading_standards !!
negative	steer_clear
negative	halfords in slough mill street
negative	booked tyres on line and found a good price .
negative	chose halfords auto centre slough for the fitting , not the farnham road one as i had experienced bad service there in the past .
negative	big_mistake . i thought that they were all seperate and run as a franchise service .
negative	yhey are one company that i will never use again .
negative	i was kept waiting even_though i was booked in for the tyres to be fitted .
negative	i could see the tyres stacked in a corner of the depot .
negative	they were not touched as job after job was done before mine .
negative	i complained and was given the usual , they will do it next line .
negative	never again will i use any halfords
negative	have been a loyal_customer of orange for many_years , yet when i have a problem customer_services don_'_t want to know .
negative	i am very seriously_considering moving to another_provider , orange has_gone so far down in my estimation .
negative	from the very rude person in an orange shop to being told that my problem will be sorted_out , what they didn_'_t say was ' when they will be bothered to help resolve this problem '.
negative	very poor battery life , keypad so small you keep hitting the wrong letters on the samsung_galaxy mini , i can '_t even connect to my email address .
negative	bad customer_services , my score would be 0 / 00 .
negative	bifocals ordered .
negative	arrived fairly quickly ( 0 weeks ).
negative	second day glasses fell_apart .
negative	phoned company - no apology .
negative	did not want to accept_responsibility or have returned for repair .
negative	eventually agreed .
negative	posted specs guaranteed delivery .
negative	company claimed not arrived - despite guaranteed delivery .
negative	took a further 0 weeks of constant emails / phone_calls to chase .
negative	company repeatedly told me glasses had not arrived .
negative	after 0 weeks , suddenly they were found !
negative	so they were trying to fob me off .
negative	glasses returned fixed .
negative	no refund for postage .
negative	no apology .
negative	glasses are cheap product .
negative	side pieces keep wobbling about .
negative	very unsure these will last very long .
negative	poor product / terrible attitude to customer service .
negative	avoid this company .
negative	customer base in india dont understand you , value for money 0 star customer 0 star .
negative	i have been waiting for my order to be processes for 00 days now and it still has not been done .
negative	when i link on to website my order is saying in progress .. it never gets any further .
negative	i have emailed loads of times and just get fobbed_off with " i will look into why the delay ".. but no one ever does .
negative	their website says 00_% of orders despatched within 0 days ..
negative	this is one big joke !
negative	i am still_waiting for my order to even get to the quality_control dept .. never mind being shipped .
negative	buyer_beware ...
negative	this company is rubbish .
negative	they take your money and order ..
negative	the leave you waiting .
negative	don_'_t waste your money .. buy elsewhere
negative	speedtester works ok , but when tweeting results , the url link to the results takes you to a page not found and the not results page .
negative	my experience was awful and i will not trust hotel info again !
negative	!
negative	had to pay extra 00 pounds to have pedal redelivered , and poor customer service from guitar_guitar {(
negative	ordered money on internet got confirmation_email went to pick_up and was told they had no money ..
negative	euros !
negative	!
negative	complete_waste of time with a bad attitude thrown in for free .
negative	ps
negative	don_'_t bother going to their customer service as will put you in an online queue for ever and there is no email address either .
negative	00 months_ago i paid £_000 for a phone that is now worthless and does not work .
negative	this is how it happened .
negative	i bought a samsung_galaxy 0 through amazon_marketplace at end february_0000 .
negative	at the time i was surprised that the supplier didn_'_t provide a vat receipt .
negative	i queried it and was fobbed with the answer that the only document available was the amazon ' final details for order ' document - which specifically states that it is not a vat receipt .
negative	amazon customer_services were little help , referring me back to the marketplace supplier every time .
negative	so far so bad , then last saturday , 0st feb_0000 the phone developed a fault with the display .
negative	i took it to my local samsung approved repair_centre to be told that the phone isn_'_t covered by the two - year samsung warranty as i had thought because it was made for the hong_kong market and the samsung centre can only repair eu models under_warranty .
negative	it gets worse , i have gadget insurance so i then called them .
negative	they were sympathetic and helpful but there are two snags : firstly they don_'_t pay for repairs that ought to be covered_under_warranty .
negative	secondly before entering a claim they expect to see a proof of purchase receipt with vat number and imei_number ( neither are quoted on my final details for order ).
negative	i have made a request for special pleading in this case - we shall see what happens .
negative	of course i also went back to amazon .
negative	they insist you should first approach the vendor through amazon , which i did .
negative	i had a very prompt reply to tell me that company is no_longer a marketplace vendor .
negative	so , of course i e_- mailed amazon customer_services pointing_out that they have allowed a vendor onto marketplace which sold me a dodgy product with no warranty and has subsequently disappeared .
negative	amazon '_s response is to wash their hands of the whole business .
negative	buyer_beware
negative	p . s .
negative	the phone itself was fine until it developed the fault with the display .
negative	i have left orange after 00 years as a customer .
negative	i had been without a signal at home for over three_weeks .
negative	i had to use my bt landline to contact them as i had no signal at home .
negative	this increased my bt phone bill by over £_00 .
negative	i have eventually had an acknowledgement of two emails from ceo '_s office whom i contacted after two_weeks .
negative	i had so many promises broken by staff who were supposed to call me back , the signal was always ok at home until they joined with ee and t - mobile .
negative	the staff in india are an_absolute joke and were rude , surly and hung_up on me .
negative	if i could have rated it lower_than 0 star i would have done .
negative	i am now with o0 with great customer service and a functioning phone beside me on my sofa , great signal .
negative	thanks o0 .
negative	orange should be struck off or something !
negative	!
negative	i can only concur with the other reviews on this page .
negative	don_'_t touch talktalk with a bargepole !
negative	great promises , appalling service .
negative	what you see isn_'_t what you get .
negative	i had the most appalling experience for several months when i first signed_up to them six years_ago .. after that it wasn_'_t too bad .
negative	i looked at their youview service and i was told that they had worked very hard at making great improvements in their customer service .
negative	don_'_t believe it .
negative	incorrect billing , promotions offered but not given , loss of service , a wait of two to three_weeks for an engineer , call_centres manned by robots reading scripts who couldn_'_t care_less .
negative	if you love stress you '_ll get plenty of it .
negative	stay well clear .
negative	ordered 0 items ( all marked as in stock ) for the start of the season - 0 weeks_ago .
negative	£_00 odd quid .
negative	after 0 days with no_indication of dispatch i called the 00000 000 000 number and chose option 0 for customer_services - was on hold , in position 0 in the queue for 00_minutes .
negative	when call was answered , the computers were down and person wasn_'_t sure what the status of my order was , said they would call back ( sounding familiar ?).
negative	no call back so after the bank_holiday i called again , was told there was a problem at the warehouse and was promised another call back ( didn_'_t happen ).
negative	called again today and apparently there is a ' problem ' with one of the items , however the other items are due to be picked_up by hermes today ( just received email notification ) saying delivery in 0 - 0 days but could be longer ... was offered an ' upgrade ' on the problem item and said will call back with options ( 0 hours ago ).
negative	on balance - i think this company is best avoided
negative	i have used lastminute on many occasions but never again .
negative	i booked a hotel , received the confirmation_email and turned_up at the hotel only to be told that lastminute had made an error and that there was no room available .
negative	apparently there were five people in a similar situation and i actually met one of them who had been there for three hours trying to get a resolution .
negative	i then spent the next two hours either on hold or finally talking to people who did not have the seniority to help me .
negative	the only alternative i was offered was a hotel around 0 miles_away - i had booked a central_london hotel because i needed to be in central_london , not to end up in wembley !
negative	while i was waiting , i found a number of hotels with rooms available and at around 0 . 00pm decided to book one of them myself as lastminute had failed to find a suitable alternative .
negative	the ultimate insult came when i asked to speak to someone who could authorise paying for the room i booked only to be asked whether it would wait_until the morning !
negative	i am still chasing them for a refund - they are quick enough to take my money but it will take 0 - 00 days to return it - and i am still_waiting for the promised email about how to complain_about their appalling customer service .
negative	arrived in faro on 0 / 00 / 00 after booking return transfer to olheo , at airport informed that the carrier would be greenbus .
negative	one girl dealing_with a number of bemused and impatient travellers , eventually after an_hour we were transferred to our resort .
negative	not to bad you may think , however we were issued with a telephone_number to call 00_hours before departure to arrange pick_up .
negative	after approx 00 calls a girl answered and stated that they were having computer problems and would call back ( didn_'_t happen ).
negative	obviously concerned i called the next_day and again after approx 00 calls i eventually spoke to a girl who said that we would be picked_up at 0000 hours the following_morning ( 0 hours before our flight and some 00_minutes from the airport ! )
negative	told girl that this was not acceptable .
negative	no further calls from the company no pick_up from the company at 0000 hours and as such a local taxi picked us up at 0000 hours and deposited us at the airport at 0000 without_any hassle .
negative	avoid this company like the plague !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a pair of shoes from ebay .
negative	myhermes was the courier service used , the shoes did not arrive .
negative	myhermes said " our courier posted the packet through your letterbox ."
negative	the shoes were packed in a box and would never fit through the letterbox !
negative	this company uses casual delivery drivers .
negative	hiring a ' man with a van ' is how the business is run .
negative	the delivery driver clearly helped himself to my parcel .
negative	unlike_other_reviewers here who have had awful service from myhermes , i am in the fortunate position of running my own pr business , i will be contacting all of the myhermes directors and will then relate my experience on every social_media and forum on the internet .
negative	i also have access to news agencies across the uk .
negative	myhermes have made the biggest mistake of their lives in crossing me .
negative	i will not tolerate such an unacceptable , awful service .
negative	______________________________________________________
negative	update_: i have already contacted two of their directors and their lawyers in west_yorkshire .
negative	i would advise those of you who have received shabby service to go on to the myhermes facebook account and relate your experience .
negative	i have done this today .
negative	i ' m awaiting payment to my account from chess_telecom .
negative	calls to chess ...
negative	march 00th : " you will get a refund at the end of march ."

negative	april 00nd : " we '_ll sort it out for you ."
negative	may 0th : " you will get payment by 00th_may ."
negative	may 00th : " you will be paid in 00_hours ."
negative	june 00th : : well look into it , and you call back " - they didn_'_t !
negative	june 00th : " we promise you '_ll be paid ."
negative	enough is enough !
negative	time to let david pollock ( chief exec ), stephen dracup ( man .
negative	dir .
negative	), barney phillips ( wholesale channel dir ), vanessa errington - beech ( corporate relationship manager ) and andrea murray ( operation manager ) know what '_s going on in their organisation .
negative	i ’ ve just contacted the cheshire business leaders and cheshire community foundation , who were keen to hear about chess_telecom and the way they do_business .
negative	the chess chief_executive , david pollock , is a founder member of these two organisations .
negative	i have had a long conversation with both institutions and i have been given assurances that my complaint will be passed on to david pollock .
negative	if you have a problem with chess that is not being resolved to your satisfaction then contact these two organisations .
negative	believe me , the embarrassment felt by david pollock , will not only ensure that your grievance will be attended to immediately , but will lead to heads rolling at the heyes lane office .
negative	a tip : never speak to the monkey at chess , if you can get through to the organ grinder .
negative	the man at the top of the organisation always gives a damn .
negative	the minions don_’ t .
negative	i am now going to hit every social network site and internet forum to relate my experience with chess .
negative	barney phillips ( chess wholesale channel director ) and stephen dracup ( chess managing_director ) will be contacted via_twitter .
negative	they have , between them , 000 followers .
negative	i have almost 0 , 000 , so i ’ ve got a head start !
negative	__________________________
negative	since i posted this , earlier this month , i have received several enquiries from ' would - be ' customers ' of chess_telecom .
negative	the above experience with chess is only part of the abysmal service i received during the short time i was with them .
negative	the phone line was down ( including internet_connection and the card payment machine ) for three_weeks in the run - up to christmas .
negative	as you will understand , this time of year is always the busiest for retail_outlets .
negative	chess was not the least bit interested in getting me up and running quickly .
negative	i repeatedly made calls from my 0 mobile to the chess head_office .
negative	they promised to call back many_times and never did .
negative	each time i called i told them i was losing credit_card sales in the shop .
negative	they couldn_'_t give a monkey '_s .
negative	i spoke to several people at the office and always the same response - a negative one .
negative	i , like others who have posted complaints here , am very suspicious of the reviews telling us what good service chess give to people .
negative	by losing trade during the busiest time of the year , chess_telecom has ensured that i experienced a very difficult period in my business .
negative	was i compensated by chess ?
negative	of course not .
negative	i would advise_anyone who is thinking of becoming a chess customer to think very carefully .
negative	i doubt very much that my situation was an isolated one .
negative	they are still trying to charge me for a service i have never had with them , they could not solve the problem i had and fed a line with phone and broadband into the wrong room in a shared house instead of my room , and now want to charge me for it i have never had a service from them only bills , customer service was bad very bad rude and kept passing me on to someone_else who passes you on again , rubbish company , i would never use them as long as i live .
negative	always finding a way to charge you more than original price you paid , was recently charged extra for baggage when i ask to see print out of weight on scales they refused so i had to take thier word for this , my bag was the same going with less comming back but charged me more forced to pay i call this exstortion .
negative	purchased a tablet from this company and had to return for repair , so far so good .
negative	it came back and within a week was faulty again .
negative	returned as per their instructions - april_0000 and no word from them since .
negative	no response to support ticket ( which is now dead ) or to numerous_emails .
negative	all negative_comments on facebook were taken off and there is now no means of commenting - a transparent company ?
negative	i think not !
negative	important to note : as of april_0000 jexaa limited was dissolved .
negative	now trading under tablet gear limited - same director , same address .
negative	interesting that i got a marketing email tonight from jexaa limited .
negative	i have gone to watchdog .
negative	the tablet was a christmas 0000 present for my autistic son - shameful .
negative	do not touch this company !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	made booking on line and they charged whole amount of rental advance .
negative	car_rental agency was europcar .
negative	they refused to give a car because the was something in a file .
negative	after waiting for an_hour they still did not give an answer what it even was .
negative	we rented car from the other agency ( in 00min ) and asked for refund for the monies .
negative	they send an_email that they will keep the monies because it was cancelled on same day of the reservation .!!!
negative	no service but they keep over 000_euros !
negative	!
negative	luckily we americans are protected with our banking system and bank disputed the charge .
negative	from now on , we will always book directly with rental company .
negative	do not !!!
negative	repeat do not !!!
negative	take out a contract of any kind with this company , they will rip you off and threaten you as they have me .
negative	i had a 0 year contract with this shameful company which i duly completed and then asked them to unlock my iphone as it was perfectly ok and i intended to take out a sim only deal with another_provider .
negative	they said they would unlock it for a charge of £_00 . 00 which i reluctantly agreed .
negative	after months of costly calls to an overseas call_centre the unlock has not been provided forcing me to go to o0 for another contract and new iphone which is not really required at increased personal cost .
negative	orange said that they have unlocked my phone which they have not and i finally got through to the ee tech department the other day who confirmed it hadn_'_t been unlocked .
negative	the guy who promised to come back to me has also disappeared now .
negative	i am now being subjected to aggressive calls to my home number from a debt recovery company called nco threatening allsorts of recovery action over the £_00 . 00 which i have now reluctantly paid to avoid further upset to my wife and children .
negative	the purpose of this review is to warn you against dealing_with ee / orange as they are dishonest , unreliable and will not_hesitate to bully you and your family should they need to .
negative	disgrace of a company , they should be closed_down .
negative	not only have i been lied to over unlocking my iphone_0s at the end of a 0 year contract they are now chasing me with menaces for £_00 . 00 unlocking fee service that was never provided and i still have my iphone which is locked and useless .
negative	if you are considering moving to these fraudsters ...
negative	don_'_t !!!!!
negative	!
negative	they are a disgrace .
negative	first_utility sent me an e_- mail requesting details of current meter_readings and i managed to get this sent to them ok .
negative	this was the second meter_reading i had sent to them and as i am paying by fixed monthly direct_debit i wanted to see how my usage was faring against the amount i was paying each month but nothing in their system appeared capable of allowing me to view these details so i tried to contact them .
negative	despite quoting the account number that they showed on their e_- mail , and under which i was able to send the meter_readings , they now stated " this is not a correct account number " or words to that effect .
negative	so i repeat my header , is there any service here ?

negative	trading_depot '_s delivery agent , dpd , failed on three occasions to deliver when they said they would , causing me a lot of inconvenience in making arrangements to stay in for the delivery , then in making arrangements for a neighbour to accept delivery , both abortive because dpd did not deliver when they said they would .
negative	in addition , neither [_name ], trading_depot director , nor [_name ] of dpd have replied to my email of 00th_october , complaining_about their poor service
negative	i wrote a negative_review of a courier company , and had to provide proof of purchase which i did twice , and trustpilot reinstated my review , the whole_process took 00 days .
negative	i then edited my review for the same company , adding the comment that i expected my negative_review to be challenged , which it was , so my review cannot be seen .
negative	i again provided proof of purchase , on 00 th may but have had no reply from trustpilot .
negative	after the first time my review was challenged the courier firm in question received 00 positive_reviews in 0 hour , which to me looked like fakes , these have since been taken down , though i have had no confirmation from trustpilot as to wether they were fake .
negative	the whole system is flawed as the courier company consistently challenges negative_reviews hoping to get them removed , but never replies to customers on review_sites . trustpilot are just helping them to hide negative_feedback
negative	we accepted a quote for a house removal , and paid a deposit of over £_000 , our chosen courier did not contact us , when we contacted him , he said he was sorry but he had a lot on .
negative	we ended_up hiring a van and doing the job ourselves , but shiply will not refund our money .
negative	we have seen other reports of this happening , and also a report from the advertising standards authority criticising this policy .
negative	our house removal is still listed on shiply '_s website as succesful , but it was definitely not succesful for us
negative	our delivery number was item id 0000000
negative	having posted this review shiply asked trustpilot to verify that we were genuine shiply customers , which we did .
negative	it is obvious that shiply are challenging all negative_reviews in the hope of having them removed .
negative	shiply are happy to stand by their no refund policy , and it appears on their homepage , in faint lettering , this is in response to an asa ruling stating that this policy should be made more obvious to customers .
negative	it will be interesting to see if this edited review is challenged by shiply
negative	as expected shiply have challenged this review again , surely it would be better to sort problems out rather_than trying to hide them
negative	an order placed on the 00st_december is still " processing " according to my account details .
negative	the company failed to respond to a request to swap the item in order to get something for christmas and have failed to respond to a request since christmas to cancel the order and refund .
negative	the web_site looks good but it accounts for nothing if the service is poor .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again or recommending them .
negative	i '_ve given then one star as it seems you cannot rate them with zero_stars !
negative	my son ordered 0 xmas_gifts from fancy . com on 00 / 00 .
negative	they stated all three would be delivered next_day .
negative	one was delivered as promised .
negative	the other two were no shows .
negative	after a complaint about the 0 missing gifts fancy . com stated that the ' revised ' delivery date for the two gifts was 00th of january .
negative	now , on 0th_jan , they advise that one of the gifts is out of stock and money will be refunded .
negative	heaven only knows if and when the remaining gift will be delivered .
negative	they have ruined our family christmas .
negative	my son booked a flight with this mob , through a bunch of spanish con artists called edreams .
negative	the ticket he bought turned_out to be non - transferable and non - refundable .
negative	this was not advised by edreams at time of purchase of the ticket , nor in the e_- mail they sent out .
negative	called austrian airlines in the uk and got a call_centre in ukraine .
negative	no way would austrian refund the ticket .
negative	no way would they ( olga & zoryana ) give me the name of a contact in the uk or vienna to write to .
negative	they would not even give me the name and address of their ceo .
negative	( btw his name is jaan albrecht , office park 0 , vienna0000 , austria .)
negative	like most airlines that don_'_t ' get it '.
negative	they think it is better to hold on to £_000 for dear life , rather_than go out of their way to help someone .
negative	mustn '_t do anything to diminish the huge bonus the ceo will get next year , eh !
negative	?
negative	i purchased a dovedale solid_oak desk form the swindon store in april this year .
negative	if you order from this company you will know that you are not permitted to inspect your goods on delivery .
negative	on inspection it was hard to miss the badly_damaged door .
negative	i contacted ofl who promptly dispatched a repair man to refit a new door .
negative	imagine my dismay when he asked me to inspect his handy work .
negative	the door that was previously perfectly fitted into the frame was now some 0mm proud of the frame on the hinge side .
negative	the so called carpenter said he was unable to fit it any other way due to the pre existing screw holes .
negative	i contacted ofl who i now expected to pull out all the stops as i had been the recipient of two successive episodes of bad service from their company .
negative	instead , a somewhat off had & not to sympathetic lady form customer service phoned me to say that ofl had reviewed my photographs & decided to offer me £_00 compensation .
negative	i told them that £_00 will not excuse bad workmanship or bad service & ask what my options were .
negative	i was told that i could return the desk for a refund & re order if i chose to .
negative	i pointed_out that this option would leave me without a desk to work on until the replacement arrives .
negative	i was told that was ofl procedure .
negative	at this point i had a serious sense of humour failure & hung_up on the lady .
negative	in the end i went for a second repair to the door that was carried_out perfectly .
negative	why did the first carpenter not do the same ?
negative	can i add that the swindon store staff were sympathetic but their hands were tied by ofl procedures .
negative	my impression of ofl is of a company offering good quality items but not backing them up with good quality service .
negative	... ' cos you ' re going to work through a lot of them before you can get your problem_solved .
negative	that '_s the only reason we went instead to the post_office , where the ' phones are answered properly and promptly !
negative	before placing an order ( no .
negative	000000000 ) in may this year , i called there sales_team to confirm when the product would be delivered as i had read a lot of bad comments re meeting their commitments .
negative	i was promised in this call that a ship was due to arrive on jayne 00rd with my products on board ready to be delivered within 0 - 0 days .. on this basis , i went_ahead and placed the order but made it clear in the order the commitment that was made .
negative	i called again about 00 days ago and was assured that one of the two products was already in stock and the other was on its way and would be with them in the 00rd june .
negative	i heard_nothing since and therefore decided to call them today .
negative	i am now told that the products will not be in until august at earliest .
negative	you can imagine my fury with this news especially as half the summer has already gone .
negative	in this basis i decided to cancel my order and get a refund .
negative	vicki has very kindle agreed to email me today once the credit has_been processed and the credit should be with me within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	please do not trust anything that anyone tells you in rattan_direct as they are clearly lying to their customers .
negative	wish i had read these reviews before i placed my order .
negative	hope this will help others avoid same hassle .
negative	ordered 0 cookers on a special price deal .
negative	website showed stock and order was placed , credit_card charged .
negative	delivery terms we '_ll call you within 0 days and delivery within 0 days .
negative	no call after 0 days , checked website could still order item for 0 day delivery , so i called them .
negative	sorry no stock can '_t tell you when we will have and someone will call you within 0 days - no joy beyond that .
negative	eventually told delivery would be mid november - 0 weeks after ordering .
negative	next_day item i had ordered was showing no stock on website , but noticed there was showing an identical item in another colour , colour not an issue with me so went into local_branch to try and change to other colour as i could get no where with phoning .
negative	branch rang where ever and were told definitely no delivery on original item until nov .
negative	branch then checked re other colour and identified would be 0 day delivery .
negative	tried to persuade us to just go for other colour but i insisted they call up and check actual stock - again no stock will be mid nov .
negative	manager of store then persuaded us to change to another brand - bush , these are owned by argos so we are never out of stock .
negative	it was an inferior product , but you don_'_t order 0 cookers because you want them them it is because you need them .
negative	so after being absolutely assured there was stock and we would receive them 0 days_later we placed a new order .
negative	should have had my call yesterday to confirm time_slot , didn_'_t happen so i called today and was told yes all in order delivery will be tomorrow 0 - 00 . 00 and will call you on route - great .... then within 00_mins get a call sorry have no stock can '_t make delivery tomorrow ..... someone will call you within 0 days to discuss when we might be able to deliver .
negative	insisted that wasn_'_t good enough but of course no way forward so now waiting for a call .
negative	how can they think a call back within 0 days relating to an item that should have been with me within 0 days is acceptable ??
negative	?
negative	other customers might like to know i was told by a member of staff argos operate like an airline they sell stock they don_'_t have and so then have to bump people - great - how often do they expect us to be bumped before we bump them ?
negative	having been a loyal and very good customer for over a year now , putting good volumes of business through interparcel - i was really annoyed and miffed when there was an i . t .
negative	problem where there site suddenly decided it didn_'_t recognise our postcode as a collection address - having phoned interparcel and spoken to numerous people who suggested various things which didn_'_t work - nobody really seemed particularly bothered - my last dealings with this matter , a supervisor promised to phone me back to sort it out after supposedly going away to look into in more depth - they never did .
negative	their loss - i am now putting all my business through another company - interparcel have lost £ 0000 '_s business through me alone - if this is the way you look after customers when things go_wrong you don_'_t deserve to be in business
negative	hi im very disappointed as a new customer i cannot redeem my voucher ive followed all instructions and gone into my voucher looke for the instruction to print its not there !
negative	went and clicked on link if im having trouble it wont work my voucher runs out tomorrow what happens to my money as i have no goods , this is not right i will now have to call the company who keep office hours only , ive ordered a book from amazon on the same day and its arrived already they are the best i will never ever use this site again i just want my flipping goods and then put this site in the junk_mail where it belongs amazon and ebay all the way .
negative	will be on the phone tomorrow .
negative	a very unhappy ex customer !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	jill desborough
negative	contracted ecologicliving ( carlisle ) to provide 0 seperate biomass systems ( both ' turn key ').
negative	one a 00kw pellet ( one property ) and the other a 000kw wood chip system to provide hot_water and central_heating to 0 properties .
negative	the 000kw project was suposed to be finished by christmas 0000 .
negative	whilst we expected some minor teething_problems , we did not envisage such a delay to completion .
negative	the project is now 0 months , and counting , overdue ( both projects not actually complete - 0 properties still do not have central_heating ).
negative	the company showed us no detailed plans ( scale drawings rather_than schematics ), nor a project works plan ( pert / gantt chart ) and we ( the customers ) have found ourselves being resident site managers ( having to explain to workmen what is required and check the standard of work carried_out ).
negative	we also have to constantly ring the company to ask for various jobs to be completed .
negative	we then get promised that workmen will turn_up on a certain day and , guess_what , they don_'_t show and we get some lame_excuse .
negative	this shocking service is not just a one off it happens every week .... we ask , they promise , it doesn_'_t happen !
negative	last_week , for instance , i got one man for less_than half a day .
negative	i am hopeful that during this summer we might see some real progress ( i ' m holding my breath ).
negative	a positive_note would be that ecologicliving do install good quality boilers .
negative	advice to any potential customer would be :
negative	0 . ensure you balance the stage payments in your favour .
negative	financial pressure !
negative	0 .
negative	get a legally binding ( set in stone ) completion date with draconian penalties for overruns .
negative	0 . demand regular site meetings ( have it in the contract ).
negative	will do a further update when project is actually near a satisfactory completion !
negative	no contact number , tracking_numbers don_'_t work , two delivery dates missed and still not in possession of the package sent on the 00th !!!
negative	utter_rubbish don_'_t use
negative	ordered goods at the beginning of december .
negative	still not received by 00th_dec so cancelled order .
negative	they then said order ready to send .
negative	i told them i had cancelled it , they confirmed this in email on 00th_december and said refund would be in 0 to 00 days .
negative	00 february - still_waiting for refund .
negative	rang and emailed numerous_times - no reply to phone messages and emails keep saying refund is coming but it never does .
negative	we purchased tickets for a yankees game , did not get contacted to collect our $_000 + order .
negative	no one to talk to at cheaptickets .
negative	no contact email of the seller provided .
negative	no tickets !
negative	called the company multiple times , but they are closed .
negative	game is today .
negative	not cool !
negative	cheaptickets - the internet is a 00 / 0 online marketplace .
negative	you are selling tickets for flights , events etc_., you need to have customer support at all times ...
negative	my review is for curries in yeovil , i ordered a product and paid for it on dec 00nd , there was no mention of the product not being sent to the store in time for xmas , after 0 attempts to collect it the last time on jan 0st and was told it still wasnt in i phoned the helpline , total_waste of time , all he kept saying was that it was in store waiting to be collected which it clearly wasnt , they wouldnt give me the store number so i had to keep going 00 miles just to see if it had arrived , i will never be using the store again and would highly_recomend using ao . com they were brilliant .....
negative	if i had my way i would not choose city_link .
negative	if you miss a delivery , trying to re - arrange it is like pulling teeth without an anaesthetic !
negative	and if you try and speak to anyone they are at best curt and at worst rude .
negative	i dread it if i get a card through my door saying city_link had tried to make a delivery .
negative	i know how difficult it '_s going to be to get the package to be re - delivered .
negative	having bought and paid for items ... still have not received them .
negative	trust is gone .
negative	firms you deal with are rubbish ; as is your ordering system .
negative	don ` t deserve any stars and it probably wont let me publish this
negative	only contact from music city has_been to confirm that order was placed .
negative	the order was placed almost 0 weeks_ago and as yet i have not received any confirmation that the order has_been processed or dispatched .
negative	i am beginning to feel that this is a bogus company .
negative	i understand that delivery time from u . s to u . k will be little longer_than normal but i paid over $_00 . 00 for delivery so i am expecting better service than i already have received .
negative	if i get the goods before_christmas , i may use site again , if not then no way .
negative	this is a present for my wife .
negative	not happy so far .
negative	0 star only coz its christmas time
negative	my parcel was not delivered to the correct address and not signed for by me - my name is misspelt according to the delivery e_- mail .
negative	should have been delivered to no .
negative	00 ( with 00 " high numbers on white background ) but instead delivered to no .
negative	00 ( very small 0 " high numbers ).
negative	waited in all day for delivery expected between 00 & 0 - parcel delivered wrongly at 00 : 00 !
negative	all other couriers have delivered correctly !
negative	if you think you will be supported by a so called high_street name forget it i bought a 0d mk000 which has developed a fault they are so deliberately evasive
negative	real chuckle brothers to canon to jessops so utterly unprofessional so un customer friendly , they answer the phone for a sale do they ring back when their is a problem
negative	no way !!
negative	you have to chase and chase better shop on ebay and take a less risk this company will go belly up soon just like comet big fire sale on its way
negative	ordered watch in sale , 0 weeks_later they tell me sent to covent_garden store in error .
negative	said they would sent out last_week still_waiting .
negative	read other reviews they are true this unit grabs your cash then you are on your_own !!!!!
negative	the watchhut you are rubbish .
negative	it also seems the internet site is a diff set_up than the shops so if things go_wrong the shop cannot help you !
negative	if any manager from this watch_hut reading this please get a grip of your staff , or you all will be out of a job .
negative	update 0rd sept just phoned covent_garden shop sending out today .
negative	0 .
negative	pick_up watch 0 . put in jiffy_bag 0 . take to post_office 0 . go for lie down
negative	i have still not resolved the overcharging with this company , calling their phone help and u will lose the will to live .
negative	on 00th_november i placed an order with this company , then received an e_- mail the following_day , to say the items were out of stock , and asking if i wanted to wait_until they were in stock .
negative	as i needed the bulbs in a hurry , i replied that i would prefer to cancel the order and receive a refund .
negative	come 00th_november , i still had no refund , so used the website '_s live_chat option to query the situation ( i still have the transcript for this ), and was assured that the refund would be made immediately .
negative	yesterday , 00th_november , i still had no refund , so phoned the company to query the situation , and was again assured that an_immediate_refund would be made .
negative	as of today , 00th_november , i still have no refund .
negative	this is the worst service i have * ever * received from any online company in 00 years of internet ordering .
negative	the only reason i have given one star is that there is no option for no stars .
negative	feeling totally let_down by car trawler and holiday_autos .
negative	having used this company a number of times without problem , i noticed this year when booking that cartrawler appeared in the search page .
negative	not thinking anything had changed i continued to book a car .
negative	however the hire company chosen was not named until i paid with my credit_card .
negative	big_mistake !
negative	to make_sure that i was totally covered , i took out the recommended security deposit , insurance .
negative	this is with allianz ,
negative	so no_worries then ….
negative	another big_mistake !
negative	!
negative	arrived in murcia to pick_up my car from a company called dickmans , should have realised , who on earth , would name their company , dickmans !
negative	their office is in a van , row three murcia airport .
negative	trying not to pre judge the situation , i put my paranoia behind me and showed my cartrawler pre_- paid voucher .
negative	it was at this point that i started to feel uneasy .
negative	the agent took one look at my allianz insurance_cover and laughed !
negative	he would not accept this and stated that i would either have to pay £_000 deposit , directly into his bank_account , returnable 0 to 0 days after return , or take out their own insurance at £_000 .
negative	well common_sense should have told me to walk_away , but this being murcia airport , with few facilities , i was intimidated into accepting the situation or walking .
negative	another big_mistake !!
negative	!
negative	having paid up , stating i was not happy , an employee then took me to the car and in a whirlwind after making me sign an inspection form , made his exit .
negative	no real chance to establish the cars faults , i photographed each elevation of the car and drove some 000kms to our destination , upon which we found there was no hi viz jacket , emergency triangles or first aid kit , which are all mandatory in spain .
negative	i tried_ringing the contact number on the paperwork , but no answer from the company .
negative	you ’ ve guessed it ………….
negative	on return i again photographed all elevations and returned the keys to a hole in the back of the van , things were looking up , there were now 0 pallets stacked up , for customers to reach , the service window .
negative	i am still_waiting for my deposit , to be returned , in the meantime i have contacted my credit_card company , who will act for me and tried to contact cartrawler through their complaints website , which allows you to upload your written complaint , but not supporting information , although it states the info , has_been successfully updated !
negative	i have always used holiday_autos in the past , but since cartrawler have been involved , i believe you have little redress , the company clearly knows there are issues with dickmans , ( see dickmans rent a car , reviews on tripadvisor ).
negative	incidently , taking out the recommended extra security deposit insurance with allianz , is a total_waste of time , because unless dickmans actually states the car is damaged allianz will not want to know , best thing to do is crash the car into their van , you should then be able to claim !!
negative	!
negative	its such a shame that a relatively reliable company should be let_down by the antics of cartrawler and its car_hire partners .
negative	will post again if i hear_anything , positive or negative .
negative	ordered a present from them for my little girl last christmas and am still_waiting they promised me it would be with me for christmas then just ignored emails and are impossible to reach by phone .
negative	awful company and would agree they are con_men , even if it '_s the cheapest or you can '_t get what yolu want anywhere_else i would avoid them like the plague or put your money in the fire it '_s the same thing .
negative	only gave them a star because i couldn_'_t post unless i did believe me they don_'_t rate at all .
negative	i keep on getting nuisance calls from a foreign call_centre which is ran by vodafone .
negative	i have never had any products through them and do not know how they got my details .
negative	i have asked them to stop contacting me and remove my details from their system but they persist !
negative	i purchased their xl broadband package wanting reliable and fast internet access .
negative	when watching programs on the bbc iplayer i sometimes get a message_stating ' insufficient bandwidth ' which i was assured would not be the case .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	00_% of the programs broadcast by itv are complete rubbish .
negative	it seems as though they are attempting to dumb down the nation .
negative	bbc documentaries like the attenborough series ' are far_superior to anything made by this ' broadcaster '.
negative	i was trying to find a new shirt using their website and gave up after 00_minutes .
negative	it is utterly rubbish .
negative	luckily i was passing by a shop so could pop in - they have a good range and reasonable_prices for ok quality .
negative	it '_s just the website doesn_'_t seem to show all items they stock in store .
negative	received a card from moon pig the other day and thought to myself how impersonal it is having a typed message .
negative	what is wrong with hand writing out a nice message ?
negative	bought my battery on the 00rd jan , when i rang on the 00st i was told by a very rude girl that they had trouble with their courier and my battery was not dispatched until 00th .
negative	very rude unhelpful staff , because of their problems i have had to pay over £_00 in public_transport costs .
negative	avoid at all costs
negative	i would rate them 0_stars .
negative	i ordered a flame failure device for my cannon gas cooker main oven .
negative	i checked beforehand that the model number was correct .
negative	.
negative	the part they sent me did not state it was for the grill and top oven .
negative	after returning it and waiting for my refund .
negative	i had to ring on two occassions .
negative	the second time the woman_who answered had a very bad telephone_manner .
negative	very offhanded .
negative	i then was put through to a manager at my request to ask why i was charged two lots of postage .£ 0 . 00 for delivery and returning the item .
negative	when it wasn_'_t my fault .
negative	?
negative	they didn_'_t state it was for the top oven and not the main one .
negative	as the gas fitter travelled some considerable distance to fit the part neither him or myself were very pleased .
negative	i do not recommend this firm at all .
negative	no star_rating !!

negative	we were accused by the manager of our local_store of being shoplifters despite a total_lack of evidence .
negative	when we complained to the store . experience team they told us that the store manager could expel us if she liked .
negative	we disagreed with the manager '_s assertion and subsequent messages to the store . experience have vanished into the ether .
negative	queries to the online waterstone '_s message board have , through the online intermediary , revealed that they have no_intention of continuing the conversation .
negative	shocking !
negative	just of the phone to these cretins " if wit was a sh # t , they would be a prize t # rd " , details came through for some person in my address , and a letter from bt saying that they were sorry to lose me , 00 sec call to bt sorted_out my end .
negative	trying to stop mail coming through to my address a whole different kettle of fish .
negative	after speaking to cretin number " in customer service " employee of the month goes to the woman not uk_based who asked for details and then of the account .
negative	i said the persons name the envelope came through with and she then said you are not this person , i said no this is my address stop sending mail here .
negative	she then said on my system is down you will need to call back later .
negative	i said i ain '_t calling back you write the details down and sort it when your pc is working .
negative	i cannot do that i am not allowed to , i said ok let me speak to your supervisor , i can only do that if there is a problem .
negative	i said there is and its me , so let me speak to the supervisor silence ..
negative	i said hello think i had been transferred .

negative	i ordered a camera 00 days before i needed it for my holiday as it was meant to be 00_hours delivery .
negative	i had an_email the next_day to say the camera had been dispatched and giving me a tracking_number .
negative	the next_day i tried to track my camera ( being delivered by dhl ).
negative	dhl told me that they had received the data for the package but no package and told me to talk to pixmania .
negative	this was a vicious circle , pixmania said they had sent it but dhl hadn_'_t received it .
negative	i asked pixmania to send me a replacement but they refused .
negative	i asked for a refund but they refused .
negative	i received the memory card which i had ordered along with a vipix card which i did not order .
negative	this had been added to my invoice (£_00 . 00 ) and there was nowhere i could cancel it .
negative	i rang pixmania to ask them to cancel it but they said they couldn_'_t - the card would give me cheaper postage for the next year !
negative	!
negative	as i had paid by paypal , and 00 days had passed i logged a complaint with paypal .
negative	i eventually had all of my money refunded by paypal today , a month after my order .
negative	the camera never showed up and i did not receive any explanation from pixmania .
negative	i would never use them again and never recommend them to anyone !
negative	wrong product sent , no reply to emails .
negative	i ordered a necklace for my granddaughters bday .
negative	on the 0th_august and stil have not received it , this is the first and last time i shall be ordering from this company , as ive emailed them 0 times and all the say is they have no tracking , i feel totaly peeded off now waiting , i do beloive the necklaces comes from usa hence why its either got lost or taking so long !
negative	but i they dont mention the fact its shipped from the usa !
negative	i have asked for refund but havent got that yet , so im very dissaponted with the service , they should be providing tracking for their items .
negative	not a good service i wont be using again !
negative	did a online order and got a call after 00_minutes to say the restaurant was too_busy to accept my order . why take the order and process it in the first place . left to reorder from another restaurant and wait for another hour .
negative	jordan was the rep from just eat no compensation was given very rude service .
negative	also have a previous experience where just eat agreed to a refund which i never got from a sit indian resturant called the rice in hatfield area .
negative	all in all this is a joke of a company who need training in customer service .
negative	ordered lights on 00 may and we are in june and have still not received them .
negative	paresh patel order no 0000000000
negative	order never arrived on time after paying extra for the service . no compensation for all the time wasted .
negative	goods (£_00 . 00 total ) ordered 00 june 00 , confirmation received same day , chased 0 july with numerous attempted phone_calls in between and since .
negative	these_people are cheats and worse , we are pensioners .
negative	this fraudulency needs lots of publicity to get these_people out of business .
negative	deplorable .
negative	we ordered some goods on the 00 th april a . m having established online that they were available .
negative	we received confirmation of our order later that day and therefore expected to take delivery within their 0 - 0 days standard timeline .
negative	on the 00 th we received an e_mail to day that they did not have enough stock . we cancelled .
negative	i rang the firm to request confirmation of cancellation by e_mail and asked how long it would take to refund ( t and c say take 00 days ) given the fact that the firm could not process our request and we had not taken delivery of any goods .
negative	i was told that someone would get back to me asap .
negative	i am still_waiting .
negative	have since gone with an_alternative provider which has_been excellent .
negative	awful !
negative	i booked a courier and arranged to work from home on the arranged day ( s ) so i could be in .
negative	0st attempt - courier didn_'_t turn_up
negative	0nd attempt - courier came but outside the time window arranged so wasn_'_t able to make the pickup
negative	0rd attempt - courier claimed to come , knock on the door and ring the doorbell .
negative	however i have a coded gate at the end of my street and was in all day and recieved no calling_card
negative	the communication_throughout , whilst prompt , was awful and i never recieved an_apology or an explanation .
negative	just an_automated_response requesting my order number and another time / date to rearrange the courier for .
negative	i requested , and got , a refund and booked with myhermes . com who were excellent and cheaper and came the day after to pick it up no problem .
negative	avoid interparcel at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	the website is impossible the phone line not much_better .
negative	my milk order has_been incorrect several_times and often no milk at all and then i '_ve been charged for it .
negative	this means another call and somtimes i just can '_t be bothered .
negative	am going to stop the service the next time they get it wrong .
negative	i was contacted by orange to sign up for landline and broadband .
negative	i explained that i was already in a contract with another_provider for another 0 months .
negative	orange said they would pay the outstanding balance to the other company in order for me to move to orange .
negative	i said i wanted to keep my number .
negative	no problem was there reply .
negative	simply contact your existing supplier two_weeks prior to the switch to get the existing landline ported across .
negative	i did as instructed and was asked by my provider why i was moving considering i had £_000 to pay for cancelling my contract .
negative	i explained orange had agreed to pay the balance .
negative	my current provider said that orange had been saying this to customers but in truth they only pay up to £_000 .
negative	i had been mis_- sold the deal and contacted orange to cancel the switch .
negative	orange said they would cancel the switch immediately .
negative	however they didn_'_t .
negative	instead they switched my landline and broadband to them anyway . they had also given me a new landline_number .
negative	i contacted them immediately .
negative	they told me that the girl who cancelled the instalation did not know that she had to cancel the instalation on two computers and this is why the switch had went_ahead .
negative	as a result i was left without a landline or broadband for 0 weeks until orange could switch me back to my previous provider .
negative	i lost my phone number and this was a major inconveience .
negative	the orange customer service were rude and although i was promised phone_calls from supervisors they just didnt bother .
negative	they did however send me a cheque for £_00 after i had wrote several complaint letters to them .
negative	this was pathetic considering the major inconvenience i had suffered .
negative	all in all orange are liars and cheats who offer the worst customer service i have had from any mobile or telecommunications company .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	placed order for 0 tyres on 00th_feb . payment taken straight_away .
negative	no sensible emails received fro m company .
negative	two_weeks_later get email_telling_me my fitting date was 00thfeb .
negative	fitters had received nothing .
negative	today 0th_march my tyres have been fitted .
negative	almost one month to get my tyres .
negative	fitting_centre fine and no_complaints .
negative	what sort of a company takes your money and doesn_'_t have the courtesy to tell you that the tyres are not in stock .
negative	tyreshoppers owes me the interest
negative	on over £_000 which they " borrowed " for nearly four weeks .
negative	tyreshoppers deals with problems by silence and ignoring the customer .
negative	will go_elsewhere next time .
negative	alans
negative	this company sold me a tap that was badly manufactured and needs replacing with one that is not faulty .
negative	instead of saying sorry for your trouble here have another one that isn_'_t faulty they make it very difficult by asking you to send photos and then more photos and even more photos .
negative	meanwhile days go by and i still don_'_t have a functioning bath .
negative	after all that bending over_backwards they then tell you it '_s not faulty !!
negative	unbelievable , i would never deal with this company again and i advise everyone to stay well away .
negative	*** update **** one month later i have had a refund - yipee .
negative	guess_what ?
negative	the tap was faulty !!
negative	such nice people but such poor customer service .
negative	what amazes_me is that people read these reviews , then buy from vic plumb and then wonder_why they have problems with customer service and quality of products .
negative	remember , you could be that half a person who has a problem and not the 0 . 0 who get a great service .
negative	i too placed an order in october and was given week 00 to expect delivery , unlike previous reviewers infurn have not been in touch with me , or answered any emails .
neutral	decided to fumigate a small caravan i just purchased .
neutral	there were small flying things and crawlers and i thought the mini fortefog would do the trick .
neutral	it didn_'_t .
neutral	0 hours after activation i re - entered the caravan expecting to see dead insects and crawlers but only found live ones who seemed un bothered with the very small_amount of smoke produced by this product .
neutral	the product didn_'_t produce enough smoke to fill my small caravan .
neutral	the company sent a replacement but no different results were obtained .
neutral	i can '_t recommend this product but the company were quick to respond .
neutral	i had to change the dates i was going on holiday ( an easyjet package ).
neutral	i made the change less_than 00hrs since paying and the brochure price for the new holiday was over £_000 cheaper yet they gave me £_00 back , it would have been cheaper to go to the travel_agents , they tell me there would have been no charge for this , but how do you fight your corner properly at the end of a phone ( which by the way cost me over £ 0 )
neutral	buy same product from my local pizza house for a third of the price
neutral	check the reviews before you order , there are some really dodgy takeaways on my site
neutral	if you like to keep to the same stuff all the time then ok , but the variety is very minimal on the food side .
neutral	the fresh and frozen_food is costly .
neutral	the special non food items they get in are good value but be quick as they only sell a few .
neutral	but beware of network_coverage
neutral	it was the best thing when i left bt and cheaper
neutral	excellent prices and ease of service from this website , i have used before but , although blackcircles part of the deal was excellent they have changed the tyre depot to use to get the tyres_fitted .
neutral	before it was spotless and efficient unfortunately this new depot was somewhat the opposite , very dirty employees and i had my son with me and the boss was communicating with a customer in hear shot swearing and generally not really bothered my young son was standing practically next to him , very unprofessional ..
neutral	so definately not using this depot again !!!
neutral	!
neutral	tyres , good make , great road holding but very very noisey , ten times worse_than the michelins they replaced , so would not recommend them
neutral	a good product , easily fitted with good instructions .
neutral	the web_site is easily_navigated and the ordering_process simple to follow .
neutral	the goods took over a week to arrive well within the up to 00 days the web_site suggested it could take due to the items coming from a depot in europe .
neutral	however i was exasperated to receive customer feedback / buying experience e_- mail after 0 days asking for a review when i had not yet received the goods ???????????.
neutral	this annoyed me as it would be " good practice " for this feedback request to go out to customers at a time when they are likely to have actually received the goods and had the proper time to appraise etc .
neutral	( customer_services please take_note !!!)
neutral	i posted a review in the heat of the moment and actually i think used the b word once suggesting it might be better to allow at_least the 00 days possible delivery before bombarding the customer with requests for buying feedback .
neutral	i also praised the company for the ease of ordering and the easy to navigate web_site but as they were so upset at the use of course language ( 0 b word ) they complained and had the post removed .
neutral	i hope the company reviews their feedback procedure in the future and allows the appropriate time to elapse before requesting such information .
neutral	i should also like to apologise for the use of a course word in my original review and state for the record that after spending £_000 . 00 on your company products i would use you again and would recommend your products .
neutral	the products they sell speak for themselves , the postal prices are too much and the free option is way too slow , not even posted on day of order when ordered before lunchtime , and still no tracking_info 0 days on .
neutral	i tried them because the coffee is inexpensive compared to proper nespresso .
neutral	however the taste is poor and the pods are really cheap and don_'_t seem to be solidly packed with coffee .
neutral	will be going back to nespresso .
neutral	the booking experience was good but despite enquiries on delivery and promises of a dispatch date .
neutral	when the tickets had not arrived two days before the concert - we had to fly to the event - we ended_up chasing the courier and had to collect from their office rather then have them delivered .
neutral	sadly this soured an otherwise pleasant_experience .
neutral	we checked many companies on the internet looking for the best price for arden_grange light dog_food .
neutral	monster gave us this .
neutral	their email order confirmaton also gave us a delivery tracking_number .
neutral	on the day delivery was due , we tried to track it via computer but got the answer that the number was unknown .
neutral	we then phoned yodel ( their delivery agent ) and were told that it would be that day but could give us no estimate of time except - between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
neutral	we waited in and there was no delivery .
neutral	it arrived next_day when we were out .
neutral	i have written to monster suggesting that they review their use of this delivery company .
neutral	they have written back apologising for the problem
neutral	i am being asked to rate the company when i have only just ordered the product .
neutral	it says that delivery is 0 to 0 weeks which i think is unacceptable in this day and age , but it is a present for someone_else which they really want ; otherwise i would have found an_alternative .
neutral	the other thing is that the delivery starts at £ 0 + which for an item of £_00 + is virtually 00_% and makes the whole point of buying online pretty worthless .
neutral	transfer , accommodation and shooting range were all cool but our guide tried to take us to the most expensive bars so we did our own thing
neutral	having been given a delivery date , i waited in all day but my item never turned_up .
neutral	nobody had the decentcy to contact me to update me of the situation .
neutral	i did however get a phone_call at 0 . 00 am on the sunday after the delivery date from the driver saying he was half an_hour away .
neutral	he arrived but had no explanation as to why it was not delivered on the due date or to why i was not informed of any delay ..
neutral	however the customer service that followed was good , but was unable to give any reason for the delay
neutral	sky park steve booking was easy to use and very straightforward .
neutral	however , received an_email afterwards offering a further 0 %_discount if i revisited the site when i had already made my booking which was a bit rough !
neutral	whilst the customer service of the company seems pretty good the course i followed ( social_media marketing for dummies ) was clearly created a long time ago .
neutral	most of the social_media interfaces have changed since the course was designed and several of the features have ceased completely ( eg there are chunky sections on linkedin answers and linkedin events both of which are no_longer supported ).
neutral	worse still , there is a whole module on gowalla which ceased trading a year_ago .
neutral	the section on roi and analytics is less_than useful , and the test at the end seems a little bug ridden .
neutral	a shame because there is some good stuff in here and the style of presentation is engaging ( even if the sections are a little brief in some cases ).
neutral	trevor lambert ec0000
neutral	i received my headphones , the day after i placed my order , very impressive !
neutral	they are comfortable to wear and the case is convenient for carrying .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that i could still hear the car radio , when i was trying to listen to an audio book .
neutral	this was the main_reason for buying them .
neutral	also if using them with sky go on my ipad the sound goes out of sync , in fact distorted if you with the noise reduction mode !
neutral	good price and helpful staff however delivery was supposed to be on 0 / 0 and for some reason was arranged on 0 / 0 .
neutral	unfortunately it snowed over the weekend and the person we had arranged to sit could therefore not get here resulting in my husband having to take 0 hours off work .
neutral	my name is conor , i am from ireland . i am not a simply_electronics employee . if you wish to contact me my email is conor . heffernan @ iol . ie . i had a fairly decent experience with se .
neutral	it does say on the site that delivery would take between 0 and 00 working_days , basically , the best part of 0 weeks so i was ready for a wait . so i ordered a google nexus 0 00gb and started the process on the 00th of april_0000 .
neutral	i too went through the multiple status updates on the site which was very annoying , but every couple of days it progressed to the next one .
neutral	there were about 0 in all which is ridiculous . i think they are there to make it look like there is something always happening with your order .
neutral	finally , on the 00th of april , it said my order had been shipped and gave me a tracking_number with a courier company called aramex .
neutral	with most courier companys you can track your shipment across the world as it gets scanned into various places , but with aramex , nothing of the kind .
neutral	instead , on their tracking page the item remained " forwarded to : kowloon office hong_kong " for five days ., i rang the aramex office in ireland and the first time they hung_up on me .
neutral	the second time the girl took my details and said she would ring me back in a few_minutes but never did . that was on the 00th of april .... my phone arrived on the afternoon of the 0st of may but i remain seriously unimpressed by aramex . it was really well_packaged and when i unboxed it , all was as it should be .
neutral	this is not my first transaction with se , i bought a canon 000ex0 from them back in 0000 and it was actually delivered fairly fast .
neutral	tbh , after_reading all the reviews on here , i doubt i '_ll be using them again , but i just wanted to state for the record that my experience was a good one .
neutral	i have screenshots of the transaction if anyone doesn_'_t believe i ' m a genuine reviewer . regards , conor .
neutral	ordered a dewalt circular saw through ebay , waited a few_days and no delivery , sent an_email and was advised a new model replacement would be dispatched once in stock .
neutral	waited another 00 days and received the newer model but wrong voltage .
neutral	sent back using buyaparcels courier collection , waited another week while the incorrect unit was checked before the correct item was dispatched .
neutral	all in all a mixed experience , just unlucky with the mistakes and having to wait 0 weeks for what usually would be 0 - 0 days .
neutral	would still recommend as the pricing and service is great .
neutral	pretty_much says it all really ..... frustrating that it seems to be impossible anymore to simply buy a ticket for an event with greasing the palm of companies like these .... but at_least they ' re usually reliable unlike several others .
neutral	i '_ve had a few good buys via_groupon , and on the few occasions i '_ve had a problem , they '_ve been quite responsive .
neutral	too often though , you see " bargains " in their daily offer , that you can find just as cheaply elsewhere .
neutral	overseas call_centres most times i '_ve had to call them for broadband problems .
neutral	generally the service itself is fairly reliable , but if you have a problem , prepare to explain it to several people several_times .
neutral	also prepare yourself to count to 00 each time you ' re asked the most basic of questions about things you " could try " to resolve it .
neutral	actually , the website '_s pretty good , but for some reason i almost never get what i '_ve asked for when i get to the train ( quiet carriage , facing forward , table seat ?
neutral	pot luck !
neutral	)..... also , very inflexible if you need to change your travel_plans .
neutral	on a few occasions i '_ve been early enough to catch an earlier train - go to the ticket office and invariably it '_s " buy another ticket "..... fair_enough when it '_s a peak time train , but with no allowance made for the ticket i already paid for ?
neutral	seems unfair .
neutral	have had some very good experiences with amazon with amazingly fast deliveries , and had some bad .
neutral	slow delivery plus something not arriving at all from an amazon connected supplier .
neutral	amazon did refund the money eventually though .
neutral	having been with this site for couple of years , when making a sale ( which is few and far between i might_add ), i am constantly informed after making a sale that the quality of the image is not good enough !
neutral	continually told to re - photograph the images is impossible as any of the works i have on the site are either sold or have been discarded due to damage .
neutral	i was a premium member but i am now in a quandary as the artwork is still not good enough even_though i have limited sizes available for buyers as i am useless with fauxtography .
neutral	blurry , lighting , half cropped signatures are always the problem + i hate making sales when i know that i will get an_email_stating the image is pixelated , blah_blah_blah !
neutral	i realise it is up to the seller to check images at 000_% but it would be good to have someone check the upload , someone who_knows what they are doing , advise the artist to amend this and that before a sale is made !
neutral	as an artist , i am constantly attempting to make the images larger , only to be told they are still not " good quality ".
neutral	a cancellation recently occurred and i was gutted again .
neutral	i am not a photographer , have no_idea about cameras and yet now i have to await my son in laws visit to see if he can do the job that faa needs to get a " quality " photograph that will be up to scratch , and then maybe i will become a premium member once again .. we will see !
neutral	i bought tyre from tyreleader fast delivery at my door in 0 days from france .
neutral	and they recommended all the garages near me that fitted and how much , thought great either deliver to garage or to home i chose home , just as well as i live in glasgow largest city in scotland , and not one of the garages i called fitted motorcycle_tyres or even had herd of them .
neutral	i said to garage do you know you are recommended on tyreleaders web_site .?
neutral	not one had even herd of them , glasgow is in the central belt of glasgow but no i had to call the usual_suspects victor divine , mickey oates , ride on , when called ducati great western road glasgow wanted me to wait a week , and all priced between £_00 and £_00 depending if wheel was on or off bike these_guys are bad enough with there over pricing , and should be_ashamed they want you to buy tyre from them .
neutral	so they have the monopoly on it , but sorry guys the internets here .
neutral	so yes tyreleader , great if you have tyre leavers .
neutral	in garage , but failing that what you save in price you lose on having it fitted .
neutral	so my advice phone the garages near you to see if they fit motorcycle_tyres and how much , when i asked victor divine honda glasgow .
neutral	how long it took he replied 00_minutes , me and my mate took wheel of with trolly , jack in garage in dark in 0 minutes shame on you victor divine and all the other suspects in glasgow you know who you are , i will never cross any of there doors again .
neutral	ps tyreleader asked for garages in glasgow and would investigate .
neutral	done nothing no explanation just an_apology .
neutral	i particularly like secrets of the phoenix as its not available on other_sites .
neutral	however , at times i have to turn chat off - the hosts are very variable .
neutral	some allow blatantly sexual banter while one female host in particular drags people off chat for the slightest reason , particularly where she does not agree with their jokes !
neutral	when k is on duty i switch off chat and just concentrate on the games !
neutral	winnings are up and down but i withdrew £_000 this weekend :)
neutral	first off let me say that i have always thought that talktalk have some good ideas and services but they really can let themselves down .
neutral	firstly calling to offer additional boosts to save call costs when the boost would cost more than my total call costs !
neutral	the real bugbear though is when you have a problem with the line , all starts off well and i can imagine that if they get it sorted first time the process would be pretty slick , the difficulties arise when the problem does not get fixed first time around .
neutral	their insistence on going back over the same process from the start each and every time is infuriating , why not pick_up from where you have got to !
neutral	then comes the matter of the text_messages to which you can either only reply with a yes or a no , or even worse when you cannot reply at all .
neutral	i had 0 texts in 0 days that were no reply type messages telling my problem was being worked on when i had already had the problem sorted_out .
neutral	talk about a waste of time !
neutral	there is more but i do not want this to turn in to a rant .
neutral	they need to get their problem handling system sorted_out .
neutral	the email from simply_electronics acknowledging my order and a subsequent email_advising about delivery were poorly formatted and difficult to decipher .
neutral	they gave a poor impression of the company .
neutral	the packaging of the camera was inadequate and the corner of the camera box was damaged .
neutral	the receipt came from google_checkout not simply_electronics .
neutral	simply_electronics would help themselves if they adopted systems and packaging of a similar standard as amazon .
neutral	the delivery came in 0 days [ which incuded two public holidays ].
neutral	this company must be cheap , the only reason any one uses them had a washer deliverd by them arrived damaged , pointed_out damage to delivery driver he said you can unpack it and use it .
neutral	had to order a new one to replace it , could get new one but could not get damaged one collected same day so have to find room for two washers . have to say the after service was better_than the delivery , and they went out of there way to sort my problem , nisha made sure my replacment washer and the damaged one were swopped on the same day , thank_you for that .
neutral	orderd from sports_direct but wrong adress put on parcel , sports_direct rang yodel to get it changed , i rang yodel three_times last time on the morning of delivery and was told they had heard from sports_direct and the adress had been changed , next im told parcel had been deliverd to wrong adress , the lincoln center never botherd changing the adress , was only delivery driver who went out of his way to correct the problem , and went the extra_mile to get me the parcel , many_thanks to him .
neutral	i have placed a number of orders with music_magpie ( mm ) recently & here ’_s my experience .
neutral	for cd ’_s , dvd ’_s & games , as long as there is a barcode , the disks are all there and the album artwork is perfect mm will accept and pay .
neutral	for clothing , mm accepts only a limited number of labels and the item descriptions on the website are not always how you would describe an item .
neutral	the items must be perfect for mm to accept and pay .
neutral	mm does not pay for “ missing ” items although they were all there when they left me .
neutral	the website works well enough when dealing_with barcodes but is slow dealing_with clothing and arbitrarily rejects items without stating a reason for rejection .
neutral	the amounts offered are not good but , in my experience , they are as good as car - booting & avoid the people factor .
neutral	overall , i lost 0 . 0 % from offer through accept / reject to payment .
neutral	you contract to mm t ’_s &_c ’_s so read , understand and accept they ’ re written by mm to mm ’_s advantage .
neutral	if you ’ re not happy don_’ t do it .
neutral	mm uses hermes for collections in my area .
neutral	if you ’ re not going to be in for the 00 hour collection window , the mm website offers very few characters for collection arrangements , “ in the side alley ” is about all you ’ ll get in and then the disinterested guy from hermes fails to collect from the side alley .
neutral	hermes is also more difficult to track than collect +.
neutral	collect_+ tracking shows up the delays built into the mm system .
neutral	eight boxes sent by collect +, all delivered to mm within 0 days but in some cases not “ received ” by mm for 00 days .
neutral	the average time ( despatch to cleared money ) was just under 00 days .
neutral	i bought a set of bathroom fittings and they were delivered as promised .
neutral	product quality was ok but fixing screws missing from one box so not checked before dispatch .. luckily i had some plugs and screws that i could use but could have been most annoying if i had to go and buy some .
neutral	i notified victoria_plumb but had not response .
neutral	i find paypal a useful financial service but as most of my transactions are small , the fees make it inappropriate for serious business volumes .
neutral	i have also found that they are very quick to return money to a purchaser without understanding the issue properly , seems like the seller is assumed to be at fault and this makes me wary about using paypal on and high loss transaction .
neutral	it is however a conveniant service and one i have used for many_years .
neutral	lovely_lady spoke to me on the phone , my only_criticism is that i was promised a phone_call at 0 - 00 and it was actually 0 - 00 when i got the call .
neutral	we decided to book and we were short on time , your site was really helpful but pricing was really high , we had to take it , we wanted to book the hotel ( crown plaza down town in dallas texas ), but we found it much_cheaper on other_sites .
neutral	yours
neutral	eslah
neutral	i was disappointed to discover that , although the information material said that my car could be left at the drop_off point close to the departures door , i was in fact required to leave it at point c of short_term parking , a couple of hundred yards away .
neutral	since i am_disabled this was a considerable inconvenience .
neutral	when i called the office , the woman_who answered simply kept repeating ' well that '_s where you have to leave it '.
neutral	however the man who answered the phone on my return 00 days_later was much more helpful and did in fact leave the car as close to the arrivals area as he could .
neutral	east_midlands airport_parking is not disabled friendly .
neutral	i booked car_rental with car del mar for a trip in december and i had problems .
neutral	i carried on with my february booking with advantage at toulouse via car del mar .
neutral	i wish i hadnt .
neutral	at_least this time i knew where to find them - 00 minute_walk from the terminal in sub zero temperatures .
neutral	at the office i had to wait 00_minutes before anyone came to the counter .
neutral	the booking process was quicker this time but as i was booking the car for over 0 days i had to pay for a tank of diesel - luckily i used the whole tank otherwise they wouldve made money out of this .
neutral	i then went to find the car .
neutral	it wasnt where they said it was and when i found it the car hadnt been cleaned .
neutral	it had been wiped over and looked terrible due to the snow / salt marks on it so i couldnt really examine it for damage .
neutral	as i had to drive 0 hours i didnt want to wait for it to be washed .
neutral	apart_from that the car was ok . as the office would be closed when we were to return it we were told to park it at the car_rental hertz near to the airport .
neutral	on return we did this and hertz initially would not accept it and said we had to take it back to advantage .
neutral	we refused and eventually hertz accepted the car .
neutral	i am now awaiting the final_bill for the fuel and the additional driver as hertz inisited on taking all the paperwork including the itemised bill for these items .
neutral	if i am charged for anything_else i will be expecting a refund .
neutral	i will be very careful in future not to accept a booking using advantage as the car supplier at toulouse airport as the difference in price is not worth the reduced level of service you get with them .
neutral	if you have young children , lots of bags or reduced mobility do not use advantage as you will struggle to get to the offices .
neutral	i seem to have had the same problems as a lot of se customers .
neutral	0 ) not being told they are hk based
neutral	0 ) generic replies to emails ( we are sorry for the delay , awaiting dispatch , high level of orders etc ), none of which answered my questions
neutral	0 ) upgrading of delivery process
neutral	i am sure this all stems from the fact that they wait for your order , and take your money , before they source the product .
neutral	this is highly suspect and very unethical .
neutral	however , the product did arrive in a reasonable amount of time and i am pleased with the camera .
neutral	but unless i hear they have raised their game , i will not be using them again .
neutral	order arrived really quickly , however some items were smaller than_expected and i do not think they are worth price paid , also when i first looked on the site that day it said free brio watch on order over a i think £_00 but by the time i came to placing my order this offer had disappeared and i got a free leg wipe thing in a shoddy looking packet .
neutral	the only reason i ordered off this site in the first place couple of years_ago was that they stocked my favourite_perfume which they don_'_t do anymore and now tell me they have not heard of it when i search the site , makes me sad , so come on please_please get hold of " myqueen " eau_de parfum by alexander mcqueen again so i can buy more .
neutral	but i am happy with the order and items i used so far .
neutral	thanks
neutral	my only issue is having received my order for two 0gb of paired ram one of the modules was faulty .
neutral	this module was replaced promptly
neutral	and is working_fine the computor is up to full speed .
neutral	i used offtek as an_alternative supplier as they were the cheaper when compared to crucial whom i normally use .
neutral	my dissapointment is i have incurred £ 0 : 00 registered postage_costs ( as recommended by offtek ) sending back their faulty item , i would have assumed the postage to be refunded .
neutral	any savings gained are lost and otherwise spoiled aa acceptable experience .
neutral	recently_purchased a charging dock and a car dock for a samsung_galaxy_s0 , the price was very competative .
neutral	the delivery although free took a lot longer_than i expected , i would have either considered paying for faster delivery or buying elsewhere had i known the actual delivery time .
neutral	i was going on the site feedback which focussed on super_fast delivery .
neutral	both items were delivered by royal_mail and in courier bags , both items had damaged boxes which was very dissapointing .
neutral	the boxes themselves are made from very thin cardboard and in my opinion should have had some added protection before being sent in courier bags .
neutral	for this reason i don_'_t see myself buying anything_else from this outlet , i would pay a little extra to get the items quicker but the damage to the boxes just shouldn_'_t happen .
neutral	a lot of messing for little money , ok telling you of each process that is going on but all that for so little
neutral	they suddenly take a dislike to a product and you never see it again ....!
neutral	the latest is my brand of sparkling water .. it was nearly the cheapest , in glass ... now its gone !
neutral	and its apparently not coming_back !
neutral	something_else i have to go to tesco / sainsbury for ....?
neutral	if you want last years gear shop at pc_world !
neutral	i never had a problem with city_link until they lost a 00 " tv i was getting .. next_day delivery !
neutral	what was worse at the time was that they said i had it and had signed for it !
neutral	it got sorted but i aged a couple of years in the process !
neutral	i have vm broadband cos i can get 000m / sec !
neutral	and it is quick !
neutral	* i dont take their tv cos its so expensive compared to sky !
neutral	finally got my delivery from the us .
neutral	happy driver but 00 days late .
neutral	urgent stuff from friday still not collected !!
neutral	0rd friday this has happened .
neutral	many options were available and it was easy to book a hostel for my travels .
neutral	i have and will recommend to others hostelbookers . com
neutral	had qualified for a free gift , it was in my basket , however somehow lost it on checkout .
neutral	when i contacted cheap_smells they refused to honour gift .
neutral	these goods were ordered on 00 feb and delivery is not now scheduled until 00 mar .
neutral	no telephone_call was made to schedule the delivery and the order did not show on the tracking_system despite the correct tracking code being entered .
neutral	i think bingocams is a great conception and it '_s a great site .
neutral	the ch make the games enjoyable and are great .
neutral	they involve everyone in the room .
neutral	there is a clique with some players and they can be quite hostile to anyone different winning !
neutral	!
neutral	the ch soon nip that in the bud though !!
neutral	the only_downside is that there are too many of the same winners / jp winners and if you don_'_t play all day every day you have very little chance of winning big .
neutral	a lot of the promotions are geared up for those who can play in the evening and there is very little incentive for the morning / daytime players to play .
neutral	i ordered two tyres online .
neutral	procedure was quick and easy , but it wouldn_'_t accept my postcode .
neutral	i had to use another one nearby , giving a different address .
neutral	not had that problem elsewhere .
neutral	parcel not received on time after paying premium postal rate !
neutral	not happy .
neutral	now have to return item as arrived too late .
neutral	i own a range_rover , the first man who came took one look at the damaged screen and told me he could not repair it .
neutral	he arranged for a replacement to be fitted , when i pointed_out the likelihood of rain he told me they would cover the range_rover with a canopy attached to their van .
neutral	when the next men arrived to fit the screen it was raining and they took one look at the range_rover and told me they could not fit the screen because the canopy would not fit over it ?
neutral	i then had to make an_appointment to take the range_rover to the nearest autoglass centre , which was some miles_away .
neutral	they could not fit the new screen because they found some small areas of rust under the old screen , from this point the service from autoglass worked well and following the removal of the old screen and the treatment of the rust the screen was fitted .
neutral	if the size of the range_rover had been taken into account on the first visit and i had been asked to take it into the centre at that time i would have considered the service to be very good , as it was i was left feeling frustrated .
neutral	i bought a dell_laptop as i ' d had good experiences with dell in the workplace .
neutral	took forever to arrive and impossible to track effectively - seemed to be lost for weeks .
neutral	all the names and contacts i was given were never to be heard of again .
neutral	their info was out of date , the delivery company had moved their base 0 years before and told dell many_times , but dell kept giving me the old address .
neutral	spent hours and hours on phone lines , being cut_off , told garbage , etc .
neutral	warning : dell assumes you have internet access , which i didn_'_t have till i got the laptop !
neutral	!
neutral	bread is best around , some fruit and veg good .
neutral	not good on veggie food .
neutral	recent shelf rearrangement has_been a pain , no logic to it , just wasting my time .
neutral	prewrapped cheese is a rip - off compared to the cheeses counter .
neutral	often have good deals on alcohol , but i don_'_t drink much .
neutral	cafe is handy , some branches better_than others .
neutral	they have at last managed to stop the fresh coffee overflowing the cups but he flavour is not as good as it was .
neutral	great strong bags - especially the ones with apples on them - bring more please !
neutral	you lost out badly on the time the fire alarms went and i had to go outside , then you unloaded my trolley .
neutral	i had a broken arm at the time and it had taken half the morning to load it .
neutral	quality of the coffee in your cafe has dropped dramatically , but you still stock some of the best ground_coffee around .
neutral	( your mocha limu is fantastic !)
neutral	don_'_t like having coin operated small trolleys while the big ones don_'_t need a coin .
neutral	????
neutral	?
neutral	most of all your queues after 00pm with only one check - out operator working ( edinburgh jewel )
neutral	your veggie options are good right now - please don_'_t withdraw them .
neutral	know you can '_t maybe solve it , but why do you attract massive customers with trolleys laden with junk food and huge loaves of bread ?
neutral	amazon now have so many international sellers , you may want to purchased a uk branded product to support the uk seller but end up receiving the item from another international country .
neutral	we have used intrerparcel for over 0 years .
neutral	they are priced very competitively but i guess with that you have to expect a downside and these_guys don_'_t disappoint !
neutral	easy to use website offers all the main couriers at around 00_% less_than their own websites for ad - hoc deliveries .
neutral	we use them once or twice a month and their ups prices in particular are very good .
neutral	the 0 % future discount is a bit misleading as you have to join a shopping club to get the voucher - i wouldn_'_t bother !
neutral	technology is basic but is good / straightforward as you ' d expect so 0 - 0 minutes to book on a collection .
neutral	no urgency though as most of the services are next_day and you really need to book before 00am to guarantee same day pick_up .
neutral	problems 0 or 0 times a year with missed deliveries or lost / damaged shipments - mostly resolved in the end .
neutral	offer of free insurance is a waste of time so if its a valuable shipment you should get additional cover .
neutral	contacting them is a trial , they should know that using a premium number and long hold times doesn_'_t go down well with customers nowadays !
neutral	!
neutral	all in all enough goes right to keep using them ....
neutral	i bought flights to lanzarote and decided to pay extra for extra_legroom .
neutral	on the way out , brilliant , on the way back , disastrous !
neutral	the rhs of the forward cabin were just normal pitch , useless .
neutral	cock and bull excuses about configuration changes of the aircraft takes away half of the extra_legroom .
neutral	and jet0 were still selling extra_legroom at check in according to the ticker .
neutral	so it was a flight of two halves for me .
neutral	going out great , coming home , a nightmare .
neutral	i ' m not sure of the legality of changing an aircraft '_s configuration after selling extra_legroom which now doesn_'_t exist but as far as i ' m concerned it '_s an_absolute disgrace .
neutral	it '_s all very well giving a refund but i need the extra space and because i ' d booked and payed for it i should have got it .
neutral	beware of promises !
neutral	order some unlicenced mite killing product which was sent swiftly .
neutral	emailed regarding use / dosage / reapplication on bantams and no reply came .
neutral	i understand reluctance on part of seller but if they will sell it , advice should be forthcoming .
neutral	in this day and age with technology the way it is .... it really is unacceptable to make people wait all day for a delivery .
neutral	delivery at 0 o ' clock is not good enough unless i ' m told beforehand .
neutral	if i went to the garage ( freezer is housed in there ) i would have to check the front_door for delivery as these_people barely wait long enough for you to actually get to the front_door .
neutral	i '_ve missed no end of deliveries when i '_ve been in ... to find a post - card saying sorry you were out .... well guess_what ...
neutral	i wasn_'_t .
neutral	not bad service
neutral	no_frills airline had a problem with the plane divereted to manchester waited for another plane to take us to tenerife , was kept_informed at all times .....
neutral	good interest_rates but it '_s slow investing and not many new investments .
neutral	money should not be in limbo whilst waiting for drawdown , other_sites such as wellesley are instant and are also backed by assets .
neutral	reporting is poor and needs improving .
neutral	money transfer in should also be quicker e . g use faster transfer direct into own account .
neutral	my view it '_s one of a portfolio of p0p sites intended to spread the risk .
neutral	when i first came upon this site , i really liked it as i thought i was getting honest opinions of shopping sites .
neutral	i even posted a couple of reviews of companies i had bought from and after_reading comments about companies i was thinking of buying from changed my mind about them and tried another company which had good reviews .
neutral	so far so good .
neutral	that is until i bought furniture from oakfurnitureland . co . uk and received below par furniture , i posted a review which was removed , i received an_email from trustpilot asking me to verify i actually had dealings with the company as the company could not verify i was a customer from the information on the trustpilot website .
neutral	i sent trustpilot my receipt to prove i was a genuine customer but almost two_weeks_later my review is still not showing .
neutral	on scrolling down the reviews of this company i noticed they had excellent reviews but a lot of reviews had been removed and were being_investigated , i assume they were giving negative_feedback like myself .
neutral	what is the point of ths site if the company who gives bad service or sells rubbish stuff can get the reviews removed ?
neutral	starting to think this might not be a site i can trust .
neutral	took them a week to assemble the order , other wise all ok , goods as ordered , well_packed .
neutral	i ordered this particular bunch of flowers for my mothers 00th_birthday .
neutral	she_loves roses and purple .
neutral	the flowers arrived on time and were well_presented .
neutral	the colours and arrangement were lovely .
neutral	i only have two complaints ...
neutral	the roses , on the second day , have already started to brown at the edges of some petals .
neutral	secondly , i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for a bigger ' bunch '.
neutral	for the price i was expecting more .
neutral	i ' m a little disappointed to be honest , but , my mother was very happy .
neutral	hotpoint htv00s stainless_steel visor cooker_hood .
neutral	one of the cheapest stainless_steel hoods i could find .
neutral	thin metal but sturdy enough for the job .
neutral	one rear light with sbc bulb ( small bayonet cap ) & three fan speeds .
neutral	quite noisy on top speed but it '_s cheap !
neutral	you can set the internal hood flaps to recirculate back into the kitchen or extract via a standard circular duct .
neutral	mains_lead only 0 metre long & no 00a plug supplied .
neutral	flat mesh filter with a circular carbon granule one on fan inlet .
neutral	its a standard fit & can be mounted by top , side or rear screws .
neutral	handyman skills required to install but no more .
neutral	the mainly pictorial instructions were abysmal .
neutral	i am an engineer so could work out for myself how it was mounted & configured but for someone less technical it would be difficult .
neutral	once installed it works well and sucks in food steam / smoke from the cooker below , blowing out non - smelly air
neutral	i would recommend it as an item that does the job but you get what you pay for and spending more may get you a better quality one .
neutral	i had nothing to compare it too .
neutral	i give it 0_stars as - 0 for instructions & - 0 for quality of materials .
neutral	with excellent quality food on offer , why oh why don_'_t sainsburys provide enough staff at their checkouts ?
neutral	my branch in frome , somerset often has queues of customers waiting to pay while staff are running around with earpieces or watching shoppers getting more and more frustrated .
neutral	no wonder the tills at asda are constantly ringing .
neutral	i bought the tiger k tape which was a good price at £ 0 . 00 +_vat , however the next_day delivery by courier charged at £ 0 . 00 was expensive and unnecessary .
neutral	give the customer a cheaper royal_mail option .
neutral	a little obserd to pay more for delivery than the product is worth .
neutral	this is the only reason i gave this review 0_stars .
neutral	we booked through rentalcars . com as it was cheapest .
neutral	next time we '_ll probably pay a little more and hope for better .
neutral	arrived at pisa and there was no queue so we had the comprehensive sales_pitch to sell us the extra insurance as otherwise we would have to pay € 0000 excess ( this amount was reserved on my credit_card anyway and paying € 00 per day extra wouldn_'_t have changed this ).
neutral	this was boring and time wasting but i had expected it and managed to resist this rip - off .
neutral	we were given a free upgrade to bigger car , thank_you , and told to go over to collect the car that had no scratches or damage at all , but if we saw anything we should bring it to the attention of the man there .
neutral	having been ripped_off previously ( by europecar ) i knew better_than to accept their word but i was surprised to find that the car was covered with scratches , some damaged paintwork , a damaged mirror and 0 damaged hubcaps .
neutral	maybe they just save_money by having us punters do the work for them or maybe they would just have charged me for the damage if i hadn_'_t spent 00_mins documenting it , either way that could have been better service if they had made an accurate record of the damage instead of telling_me there was none .
neutral	car was ok , hadn_'_t been washed , windscreen washer didn_'_t work but nothing serious .
neutral	on returning car the man barely checked it ( apart_from the fuel gage ) ( but did check the car before me quite thoroughly and found some damage that may or may not have been there before according to the user ) and sent me off with the paperwork to the office .
neutral	unfortunately there was a queue of people waiting to go through the insurance sales routine in front of me and each one took 00_minutes so with just one person on the desk , it was an_hour before i could drop_off the papers .
neutral	fortunately we had allowed 0 hours before the flight so we just managed to get the shuttle_bus , go through check - in , grab a sandwich to eat through security , and then board with no time to spare .
neutral	could have done without the stress .
neutral	suggested improvements :
neutral	offer insurance with a reasonable excess to start with .
neutral	make_sure the damage inventory is complete and accurate .
neutral	wash cars
neutral	fix minor_issues ( windscreen washer )
neutral	have separate pick - up / drop_off people on the desk .
neutral	thank_you for :
neutral	free upgrade
neutral	allowing us to return with full_tank ( instead of saying it had to be returned empty and charging a flat rate €_000 to re - fill as happened to my sister with a different company at pisa )
neutral	polite and friendly staff .
neutral	bathing aids : cast & dressing protectors : cast and bandage protector - adult - long leg ... not suitable to use with compression bandaging .
neutral	believe this should be stated in description .
neutral	you matched a rival comp on price , you also said you would throw in some firelighters free but did not arrive .
neutral	first of all , i hate the new website .
neutral	full of glitches , hard to navigate and their stock_levels are unreliable with some items selling out quickly and not replenished .
neutral	there isn_'_t enough info about the product and they give no guidance that i can see on the exact lengths of short medium and long for trousers etc which makes_life difficult as the models they use are usually 0 ' 00 so the pictures are no help at all .
neutral	i am not impressed with this season '_s clothes which veer from dated and boring to quirky and overpriced .
neutral	they don_'_t seem to be able to decide where to pitch themselves and with shoes for example they offer cheap synthetic heels then jump to decent leather courts at £_000 !
neutral	what about something in between .
neutral	i ' d be shopping in lk bennet and upwards if i wanted to spend more than £_000 /£ 000 on a pair of shoes .
neutral	their underwear , men '_s socks etc still seem ok , but this is hardly enough to keep them going .
neutral	on the plus side , their instore delivery is prompt , though it is a shame you can return via simply food .
neutral	however , seem to have a good range of corner shops that you can return to .
neutral	unable to purchase due to bank security check each time i try to make a purchase from gamesbite resulting in purchase being turned down untill check complete .
neutral	which means i am unable to re - order for 00_hrs due to failed order while completing security check .
neutral	which means i have to source points else where so i don_'_t miss the offer i was hoping to purchase .
neutral	meaning not sure if after 00_hrs i would still be able to purchase .
neutral	maybe you should add paypal to your payment_options or once a successful purchase has_been made log the details so that there is no need for security check everytime .
neutral	just used this service .
neutral	order came 0 mins early - everything there .
neutral	not bad
neutral	i needed to change my booking - that was done pretty quickly and efficiently and did not cost too much extra so that was good .
neutral	the hassle was at the airport ( manchester t0 multi - story ).
neutral	they are meant to detect your booking via your license plate - that didn_'_t work ( and i suspect that was a problem for others trying to enter at same time ).
neutral	i didn_'_t have the qr code ( or confirmation_email ) to hand and had a queue behind me , so pressed the green button .
neutral	once parked i then located my email , and realised that it was probably safer to leave as once you have pressed the green button your booking is not recognised .
neutral	so i left ( getting charged £ 0 . 00 ) and tried again .
neutral	still didn_'_t recognise license plate and didn_'_t recognise qr code , but could speak to someone via intercom and give booking number .
neutral	still don_'_t know if i have done the correct thing - therefore i think it is quite complicated ( and i am £ 0 . 00 out of pocket )
neutral	i am looking for a holiday in salzburg , austria and have not found what i am looking for with last_minute , although they are the first people to come up on a web search they don_'_t do it for me .
neutral	i '_ve done this flight from heathrow to nassau many_times .
neutral	the quality of the on - board service varies from excellent to appalling , depending on who is in the team .
neutral	therefore i cannot give more than three stars .
neutral	i have been insulted by cabin_crew and treated like a princess - this does not make for a confident traveller , as you never know how your innocent request for a glass of water is going to be taken .
neutral	but the pilots usually arrive at the destination on time or early , so it '_s not all bad !
neutral	0nd order , first was brilliant - bulk anti - hystamine .
neutral	this one i ordered 0 x 00 one - a - day multivitamins .
neutral	when it was arrived it was 0 x 00 .
neutral	still a great price , but a little disappointed .
neutral	will still use them again though .
neutral	however , the delivery charge is where they make their money .
neutral	far too expensive .
neutral	ok , they are usually the cheapest when you ' re after something , especially electronic products .
neutral	recently i '_ve been reading about their 0 hours staff and the terrible work schedules .
neutral	they are cheap but what what cost ?
neutral	found bravofly after searching with kayak who directed me there .
neutral	i booked & paid .
neutral	i could not then find the booking on the airline website .
neutral	i then read some reviews of bravofly .
neutral	whilst i accept that people only post bad_experiences , they looked pretty scary .
neutral	then found my booking on the airline site .
neutral	all looks good , but we '_ll see what happens when i try to check in and go to the airport .
neutral	my order was delayed twice .
neutral	no contact by them after 0nd delay .
neutral	when i eventually got hold of them having left messages .
neutral	delivery was near instant .
neutral	so bad communication , bad record keeping , bad order progressing .
neutral	good radiator , good price
neutral	...
neutral	i got stung for charges during a transfer of funds back to me .
neutral	cheeky !
neutral	......... but they don_'_t deliver to bfpo .
neutral	they do however deliver internationally now .................. just not to bfpo .
neutral	bit of a slap in the face with a wet fish really .
neutral	not a fast moving company , from my email record , over a week to be dispatched & if my memory serves me correctly then some time before delivery .
neutral	the £_00 . 00 battery arrived too late for the holiday :-(
neutral	just over a year later they ask me for a revew .
neutral	0_stars is given for a acceptable experience , which ended with the promised product being delivered in the desired quality .
neutral	if it is not common order in plentey of time .
neutral	the battery worked well this march holiday
neutral	it was a very quick service and it was waiting for me when we came home though i thought i had to sign for as it came by the tracker post
neutral	caravanning round the uk i was looking for a network that supported iphone & gave good service .
neutral	o0 has done this though i am surprised with the various ' blackspots ' in coverage in scotland & middle england compared to my wife who '_s phone is orange .
neutral	quality / depth of service is certainly better_than hers when we both have signal but she has signal more often than i
neutral	all that seems to good to be true usually is too good to be true .
neutral	been waiting over 0 weeks now for the money to arrive .
neutral	phone was received by them before the end of march .
neutral	the company made some excuse that they cant send the cheques all out at once , sounds_like a cashflow problem to me .
neutral	update .
neutral	the owner mark went out of his way to put my money in the bank within an_hour of him learning of my problem , i have revised my original review to reflect the good handling albeit late of the person in charge ,
neutral	thumbs_up for better service after a bad start .
neutral	arrived for breakfast at 000am , member of staff crossed my name off but that was the only contact staff made .
neutral	i wanted a veggie breakfast as advertised but non was on offer .
neutral	there was no staff around to ask how breakfast works & another guest showed me where to get tea and coffee from .
neutral	the hotel is sited well for airport and bus 000 from airport goes reasonably close .
neutral	a 00 min walk from the bus_stop .
neutral	if you have heavy bags you might want to take a cab .
neutral	security / bed good .
neutral	no window to open .
neutral	well i bought a yamaha np 00 from ebay and it was supposed to arrive on thursday but it hadnt arrive so i phoned inter linked and said they hadnt recived the order so i phoned fair deal music and told me they had the purchase but hadnt send the order and said they will send it for tuesday week after thursday hoping it '_ll come
neutral	booking the appointment and the fitting were by two completely
neutral	different departments .
neutral	booking the visit was pointless .
neutral	i originally booked for the the tuesday .
neutral	i was telephoned the day after i ' d booked and told the tyres wouldn_'_t be at the branch until the thursday .
neutral	also , could i ' phone the branch on the thursday_morning to make_sure the tyres were there .
neutral	when i ' phoned the branch they had no knowledge of my appointment and had to ' phone me back to comfirm the appointment .
neutral	the branch was faultless , though i did have to wait about 00_minutes which i would have done if i ' d just turned_up .
neutral	i had thought that by making an online booking i would have been fitted in straight_away without the wait .
neutral	therefore when i need new tyres in future i shall just call into my local_branch and take my turn , which i did anyway .
neutral	online booking i give 0_stars , local_branch 0_stars ( because of the wait ) hence the rating at the top !
neutral	my wife continues to berate me for letting the app upgrade occur ( 0 month now ) the previous maybe 0000 app was easy to use and presented products in clear simple vibrant colours .
neutral	the new app is cluttered with small product images and in presentation like wandering round a warehouse - shopping_experience now painful for me every friday as she mutters her way through it with the odd accusing glance ... have just checked out the waitrose site which dose look better so will be bravely suggesting a change .
neutral	delivery excellent , do not expect as much when returning items .
neutral	i thought having the groceries delivered to the door would be great as i work full time and my time off is precious .
neutral	the delivery was prompt and the delivery man very polite , problem was that the fresh items delivered had one or two day shelf_life , many items where looking past the shelf_life .
neutral	i contacted when i at first glance saw items that had perished who where extremely apologetic and sent me an e_- voucher to compensate me .
neutral	but as the next couple of days unravelled i found more items with same day delivery shelf_life .
neutral	this experience has put me off getting my groceries delivered .
neutral	as long as you don_'_t expect them to stock any of the stuff they advertise on the website they are ok for the odd deal .
neutral	however , my local_store has got into a bad habit of pushing certain brands ( do they get a bonus for this ?)
neutral	which can make in - store browsing a bit tiresome ( have you considered an lg sir ?).
neutral	note to self , always wear headphones when entering shop to drown out the sales_pitch :)
neutral	great prices if you are close enough to pop into the store to avoid postal_charges .
neutral	the only black mark is the amount of grey_import stuff they sell which means any warranty may be with scan rather_than the manufacturer ( samsung disk drives are a case in point ).
neutral	i haven_'_t had to return anything yet so i can '_t comment on their customer service .
neutral	great prices if you wait for a sale , but the quality of their gear varies wildly .
neutral	i '_ve had walking boot from them that have started to fall_apart in a week , and others that will probably outlive me !
neutral	i ' m no fan of their ' discount card ' gimmick either , but the sheer range of goods they stock instore keeps me going back and the staff are always very helpful .
neutral	i stopped using this company a few_years_ago after a very poor experience trying to send back a faulty motherboard .
neutral	they insisted that i had to accept a repair rather_than a refund ( on a brand_new item ) and refused to accept the law of the land that states i should have the choice of a full_refund .
neutral	it '_s a shame as i keep seeing links to gear on their site at very tempting prices .
neutral	maybe i should give them another go but once_bitten ...
neutral	a couple of years_ago i would have given screwfix 0_stars , but prices keep rising in relation to other sellers , stock_levels haven_'_t kept up with the product range and the discounts given at the new ' trade counter ' are being paid for by everyone on the other side of the dividing wall ( cheers for that !).
neutral	add to this constant issues with account numbers changing and it '_s just not the same as it was before the takeover .
neutral	i still use them when i have to , but begrudgingly now rather_than happily :(
neutral	another convenient store that repeatedly fails on stock_levels , partly because the way they store stuff means if they say they have 00 in stock , 00 are probably broken / missing / on a pallet somewhere_else .
neutral	at_least the big stores store some of the wood horizontally , unlike wickes where 00_% of it is warped and twisted !
neutral	another gripe is the new ' trade counter ' that means if you are buying 00 sheets of plasterboard from a b + q warehouse and don_'_t have a trade card , you now have to lug the stuff through the old dears buying begonias to pay at the normal till !
neutral	i use tesco every week as it '_s convenient .
neutral	scratch that , it '_s not just convenient it '_s everywhere !
neutral	from a point of view of customer experience they are better_than the co - op ( where do they get their staff ?)
neutral	but still found wanting compared to other stores .
neutral	maybe a little staff training is in order , or possibly just give them more money ?
neutral	i '_ve contacted probikekit to query delivery and they haven_'_t got back to me today ( yet ).
neutral	ordered 00th , supposed delivery 00th , then told by parcelforce 00th , contacted both company and parcelforce ( parcelforce 0 times today by phone , twice by email , westin '_s line had switched to an answer phone by 0pm ), order finally delivered sat am , not to the right house ( yes we were in ), but 00 is close enough !
neutral	have to say i have no_idea why parcelforce can '_t understand the instructions when they are plastered in a large label on the top of the box " perishable - do not return to depot ".
neutral	now contacted their customer_services by their emailed ' ticket ' system and await their response to wether the meat is indeed consumable still as it is right at the limit of the 00_hours and all the packing had melted .
neutral	sadly , our first order and a terrible experience .
neutral	amended to 0_stars from 0 : as i said , to be fair to westin , they seem to have been let_down by parcelforce .
neutral	a week_later , a ticket opened with customer service , and answered , and one phone_call and a refund agreed without_any quibble .
neutral	if it was just westin i had had to deal with i ' d certainly have given 0 or 0 .
neutral	i really wouldn_'_t bother , i know some people find it brilliant , but not me !
neutral	i was unlucky .
neutral	i asked for a delivery to another address but paid by paypal but nothing warned me that this would mean it was sent to my home address and the one i had asked for would be ignored .
neutral	i picked this up but on sat when no - one was there to stop the delivery .
neutral	when i rang on monday the chaps said the paypal thing was a bit of an issue which needed to be ironed out and he would recall the laptop , refund me and ring me when it turned_up to see waht i wanted to do .
neutral	£ days_later no call .
neutral	i rang again and got a lady_who said the paypal issue was in your ts_&_cs and i should have realised .
neutral	i said it was astupid place to put it and it needed an upfront warning or even refuse to allow paypal payment if you wanted a non - home address .
neutral	the laptop hadn_'_t come back yet so she said i should wait .
neutral	ok but no need for the hassle .
neutral	i got a refund a couple of days_later , but no phone_call .
neutral	i reordered the laptop online , paying by visa .
neutral	next_day i get a text ; problem with the order , please ring .
neutral	i ring .
neutral	same lady .
neutral	why did i want to send to non - home address .
neutral	i explained i was buying the laptop for my sister who_lives in belfast .
neutral	i live in london .
neutral	she said they didn_'_t usually deliver to a foreign address .
neutral	i said belfast is not foreign .
neutral	she said it was over the water !
neutral	i said there was nothing about this on the site and i had paid the non - mainland postage .
neutral	she said it was in the ts_&_cs .
neutral	i had read them by this time .
neutral	like the paypal thing it isn_'_t .
neutral	she reluctantly said she would release the laptop .
neutral	next_day i get a text saying delivery refused by addressee .
neutral	i discover from dpd that this is because i have put my own postcode in not the belfast postcode ( stupid mistake on my part ).
neutral	i ring again .
neutral	same lady .
neutral	you put in the wrong postcode so laptop in woodford , she says .
neutral	could it be changed i said , expecting a fight .
neutral	yes , she syas and does it .
neutral	phew .
neutral	laptop turns up next_day in belfast .
neutral	amazingly_quick .
neutral	next thing i discover i have been charged twice on my visa bill .
neutral	i ring .
neutral	chap said he would have to look into it and would ring back .
neutral	no call back .
neutral	left it a few_days .
neutral	rnag again .
neutral	told repayment had been authorised on 00 / 0 .
neutral	left it a few more days .
neutral	repayment eventually turned_up on 0 / 0 .
neutral	good points ;: excellent price , good text comms about delivery , you do the right things eventually .
neutral	bad points ( which could be fixed ) - no - one ever rings back and over - defensiveness when things go_wrong .
neutral	need tp refuse paypal for alternative address .
neutral	the night before collection , we used online facility to extend the rental period and request a collection earlier in the day .
neutral	on arrival at the collection office at the new time , we found the office was not aware of the online changes .
neutral	why can '_t online booking revisions be relayed to collection points in less_than 00_hours ?
neutral	also , the gps system was useless .
neutral	the software was far too slow for inner city travel .
neutral	we had driven past the turnings before the gps caught up .
neutral	and the gps was unable to find one address .
neutral	you provide decent cars , why do you offer bottom - of - the - range satnavs ?
neutral	despite these administration disappointments , the service from the office staff was excellent .
neutral	the front office is doing it '_s job , the back office must shape up !
neutral	this merchant is fine if you can work out the part number from the manual and order it online .
neutral	support is useless as they never answer the phone or respond to email , though this is normal for r / c model shops , none of which seem to care to support the complex and fallible products they sell .
neutral	beware also a noticeable snobbishness in favour of petrol and against electric models !
neutral	the service was efficient and quick .
neutral	my ( husband '_s ) 0 photos were subtle in tone and colour but with a fresh ( winter ) sparkle to them - this was lost in the cards and the colours appeared dulled and in one case ' greyed '.
neutral	just usable but disappointing .
neutral	i chose small cards and would have preferred the ' cardtown ' logo to be appropriately smaller , less obtrusive and also to be left off the envelope .
neutral	i know the card source needs to be shown , but i wasn_'_t paying for showy advertising .
neutral	probably won_'_t use cardtown again
neutral	we use the shuttle a lot on our visits to mallorca , mainly_because it is decent value when compared to the cost of a return taxi .
neutral	however there are downsides that you need to be aware of .
neutral	firstly , there can be very long q '_s at the check - in desk , the last thing you need after a long flight , the tedium of going through passport control , and your bags coming off the carousel last .
neutral	there has to be a better way in this day and age .
neutral	secondly , there will be an almost inevitable wait of up to 00_minutes ( well that '_s what the say on the website ).
neutral	the bus will wait_until they have crammed on as many people from as many flights as they can .
neutral	unfortunately you do this without the engine running and hence no air - con .
neutral	with outside temperatures between 00 and 00 in june , july and august you can imagine what it '_s like inside the bus !
neutral	finally , they have a smartphone app which is pretty good .
neutral	you can check your return pick - up time but you still have to make a phone_call to confirm your return_journey .
neutral	surely this could be done from the app ?
neutral	got into the car - park no problem and found a space immediately .
neutral	on our return we thought that the signs for the car - park were really poor .
neutral	if we hadn_'_t have remembered the route we took on arrival we might still be there now !
neutral	tyres and price ok garage used one stop not so good .
neutral	tyres_fitted on friday and having to take back next week to have balancing redone , also had to go back as fitter left my centre cap of , these are about 00 quid and it was lucky i checked before i left the garage as i have been caught like this before
neutral	i purchased two flights and was charged in gbp .
neutral	credit_card bill comes and is £ 0 more_expensive involving time_consuming calls to credit_card company .
neutral	flowers as_described , although next_day delivery did not happen until 0pm .
neutral	just lacks customers :(
neutral	from a usability perspective our full width sofa bed is great and it came at an unmatchable price .
neutral	once assembled , it is a full double_bed size when pulled_out and the sofa itself is wide enough to use as a single bed , so ideal for what we wanted - a put you up in our spare room .
neutral	it is also a large comfortable sofa in its own right .
neutral	however .....
neutral	as clearly warned , it arrived on a pallet and really needs two people to safely take it off the pallet and transer it to the room where it is to be constructed .
neutral	it is essentially a 0d jigsaw puzzle which has to be built piece by piece from good quality mdf ( heavy ), sponge and fabric ; the last items to be fitted are the arms ( which are pre_- constructed ) so it is not possible , as with most sofas , to lift it by the arms to move it .
neutral	in fact , it is nigh on impossible to move without it disassembling itself ; it is very heavy .
neutral	so , in summary , great value item for the spare room , but i wouldn_'_t personally recommend it for your lounge .
neutral	for a product ( por00 fuel preservative & stabilizer ( us pint )) costing_£_00 . 00 to pay £ 0 . 00 postage will unfortunately make me think very carefully before buying again - sorry !
neutral	the order was for some spare bulbs for a bell push .
neutral	the product supplied was a manufacturer '_s original replacement , and the price charged was competitive with other_suppliers .
neutral	however , the delivery in 0 - 0 days slipped somewhat .
neutral	i received notification of a despatch date which was at the longest applicable under their terms .
neutral	i rang some 0 days_later to let them know the consignment had not been delivered .
neutral	i accept that they had a supply problem ( not stated at the time of ordering ), but surely some communication notifying the late despatch would have been helpful .
neutral	i have waited in all day for my parcel .
neutral	went down to the garage to find it in there .
neutral	no knock on the door and no note left through the door , so i waited in all day for nothing .
neutral	suggest dpd get more reliable drivers who are prepared to deliver to the door , or at_least advise that they have been .
neutral	following my review , after a phone_call from the driver , he insisted that they had knocked and received no answer .
neutral	he could not explain_why if that was the case , there was no note left through the door .
neutral	i am however increasing my rating on the assumption that he is not a liar .
neutral	i have upgraded my opinion of interparcel , because although their response to my non collection issues by hermes ( who should be avoided at all costs ), was slow and cost me my sale , eventually tried to rectify the situation .
neutral	interparcel need to be more careful about the couriers that they support , as ( was in the case with my customer ) the seller gets the blame .
neutral	hermes who were the culprit got away scott free ( or so they think ).
neutral	i do not think with the reviews that hermes are getting on trustpilot . com and also facebook that they will be around for much longer .
neutral	interparcel should drop hermes as soon as possible before it tarnishes their reputation !
neutral	the products are as you would expect , but given i specifically paid extra for them to be delivered within 00_hours , had the email_confirmation and they didn_'_t arrive ( with no explanation or forewarning ).
neutral	i had to chase up and they arrived 0 - 0 working_days after ordering , what '_s the point ?
neutral	ineeded to know something about the booking i made with lowcost yesterday , so phoned the 0000 no re existing booking to be promptly informed that no agents were available and it would cost me 00p_per_minute to wait !
neutral	!
neutral	thought oh well , at first , then after almost 00_minutes of waiting ..... and much out of pocket , and in sheer frustration , called new booking line ... and , lo and behold got through straight_away ....... was not impressed i can tell you ....... what it said to me ???
neutral	we got your money now sod off !!
neutral	thankfully the agent for new bookings was able to answer my very simple enquiry ........ but now i await an extortianate phone bill !!
neutral	thanks lowcost !
neutral	initially my add on partner paid rental_cars £_00 . 00 to hire a small car from enterprise . however when he got to enterprise they would not let him rent as he didnt have enough utility_bills to show them ( despite tv licence and aletter to him at his current address ).
neutral	however on asking for a refund so as to hire elsewhere they said it was rentalcars who had his money , not them . so he asked rentalcars for a refund and they refused ..... after a tense conversation with a manager there my friend managed to get £_00 . 00 back ..... money for old rope and a nasty rip_off , so beware good rental prices but , with a nasty sting in the tail !!
neutral	to add_insult to injury my add on driver got fined for parking at his own workplace despite having informed the company he was in a temp hire_car and them agreeing it was ok and signing reg no in every day ... this was obviously a mistake .... fine was squashed ... however , enterprise have charged £_00 . 00 admin_fee to my bank_account and despite agreeing if the fine was deemed wrong and squashed , i would get my admin_fee back , no such luck ..... even after several emails to the traffic violation dept ... i have heard_nothing !!
neutral	i hired this car as a goodwill_gesture for a friend ... never ever again will i help anyone out like this again ....... even_though this was not his error ... i have been charged for it and i am the only one out of pocket for doing a good deed .!!
neutral	and enterprise have received £_00 . 00 for absolutely zilch !!
neutral	how is that fair ?
neutral	no wonder they are the cheapest car_rental company around ..... thats because they make their money in other ways , obviously !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered item early on thursday ( item was in stock ) but did not receive it until late the next wednesday , there was no way of tracking its progress
neutral	they need to use a better delivery company other than royal_mail
neutral	having run this catalogue for many_years i have seen many changes and not many of them for the good .
neutral	it used to be the sum total of your order could be spread over 00 weeks or 00 weeks , now it '_s each individual item which can make the payments too high therefore limiting the number of items bought , so catalogue is missing out on profit .
neutral	it used to be a free phone number but now it '_s premium , which is not good as it costs a lot of money by the time all the options have been gone_through .
neutral	i know that catalogue prices have always been higher than shops but now the difference is getting far too much i . e .
neutral	ps0 in the shops £_000 in the catalogue £_000 .
neutral	£_00 is far too much of a difference .
neutral	also not getting rewards on sale items and other things is not fair on the person running the catalogue .
neutral	if items are out of stock then remove them from the on - line page or at_least mark it as " out of stock " it would be good if you could also request your cash rewards on - line as having to spend so much money in a phone_call to get it is not good enough and also the length of time it takes to get is not good .
neutral	it would be nice for long_term loyal_customers to get a wee reward or incentive as a thank_you .
neutral	i '_ve been using usenext for over a year .
neutral	the service has_been ok but you have little idea what you download until you do and i would guess most content is pirated and therefore useless and it frequently contains viruses .
neutral	it was ok for watching some us tv series but i got a bit fed_up after a while and decided to cancel my subscription .
neutral	i did this and cancelled the paypal automatic payment as well .
neutral	it seems matters then got a little out of control .
neutral	i received an offer of another free_trial which i did not take up and despite this usenext confirmed i needed to take no further action .
neutral	i assumed all was well at that point .
neutral	but then i started to get demands for payment for access after our agreement had been cancelled and after my access had ended .
neutral	these demands included penalty charges on top of subscription charges that i did not want and could not use .
neutral	the demands included links that required my response but directed me to missing pages .
neutral	i tried to communicate with them but they use a message portal which does not confirm the content of your message for your records and invokes the usual numb call_center reply .
neutral	in the end i had to send a recorded letter to them .
neutral	if i subscribed again , which is unlikely after my recent experience , i would confirm my cancellation by recorded mail so that i can not be scammed .
neutral	usenext - subscribers will come and go .
neutral	this has to be their decision .
neutral	you rightly have control and allow access after payment up front so you can not loose .
neutral	trying to trap customers will mean they are less likely to return .
neutral	i would probably have come back for a while after a break of a few_months but not after this experience .
neutral	it is simply not worth the hassle .
neutral	they seem to like to blame website for pricing , offers inconsistencies .
neutral	i ordered a laptop and wireless adapters / extenders should have been free but even_though free on website £_00 added in checkout .
neutral	had to cancel order .........
neutral	another time order accepted , no product arrived and on phoning them , they said my card_details were incorrect , even_though they stored them on their system from previous orders and i have used them again since ..........
neutral	but price was not honoured as offer had finished when i contacted them to find out where my laptop was ........
neutral	sales & service was good but the product was not , the speaker on the iphone is covered over by the vynal pouch causing very low sound .
neutral	the iphone fits too low in the retaining pouch blocking the home button somewhat & the iphone can slip out of the pouch very easily .
neutral	i am now shopping for a better iphone wallet .
neutral	chris
neutral	was attracted_by the £_00 joining bonus , and then went on to earn enough to get over the payout threshold .
neutral	in all_respects , pretty_much on a par with quidco in respect of rates and ease of use .
neutral	not any higher than 0_stars because when it came to paying out there are a number of administrative obstacles to overcome - i ' d say they use some sort of breakage model to retain the commission longer_than is necessary .
neutral	eventually got paid out though , but it was quite a wait .
neutral	the tesco credit_card is pretty middle of the road in many respects .
neutral	a 00 . 0 % interest rate as i write , and for new customers a reasonable free balance transfer and 0 % on purchases offer .
neutral	what set it apart was the rewards programme - you can use clubcard_points to convert to cash , or to convert to airmiles , with extra rewards if you use the card in a tesco petrol_station .
neutral	this was one of the very best ways of collecting airmiles until recently .
neutral	now , tesco has more or less halved the rewards points , and of course airmiles has moved to avios at virtually the same time , and now passes the taxes that were once absorbed on to you .
neutral	a double whammy hit on the benefits from using a tesco credit_card .
neutral	what was once a 0 star offer is now reduced to a middle of the road one .
neutral	still a good card , but my , how the rewards have been cut .
neutral	although i have used animed_direct for ages and delivery has always been a bit slower_than other_suppliers , i allow for this when ordering .
neutral	however on the last order , funds were taken from my account on the day of ordering but goods were not despatched for a further week , despite_being told that if this could not take place within three days i would be notified , this didn_'_t happen .
neutral	the online system is brilliant and certainly saves you rushing around when youi can reserve and collect !
neutral	the only problems seems to be lack of stock and chosen stores so sometimes when ordering a few items you cannot get them all from same store which is not good as they only hold reserved items until end of the next_day and if you have to wait for another item to come back into stock it means going back to collect !
neutral	we had a delivery of an electric towel_radiator that had no brackets , after several phone_calls , sending pictures to prove what was wrong a replacement was supplied a week_later , strangely both items were delivered by plumb center part of the wolsey group .
neutral	it was lucky that we hadn_'_t had rain , or a rubbish collection that day .
neutral	i think that the delivery service left a lot to be desired - no card was left to say that the parcel had been left , or where it was
neutral	ordered two bouquets , at the same time , to be delivered to the same address , on the same day .
neutral	one arrived , one didn_'_t .
neutral	the second one arrived the next_day but no - one was in .
neutral	my email complaint and request for an explanation has_been ignored .
neutral	the flowers arrived on the monday and i ' m told they were lovely .
neutral	i '_ll try serenata one more time , but any more glitches and bad manners and i '_ll not use them again .
neutral	i placed my order on 0th_june and received an acknowledgement .
neutral	i also uploaded the prescription , as requested .
neutral	also acknowledged .
neutral	i heard_nothing more until the 00th , when i received a " reminder " that the prescription had not been received .
neutral	i was surprised but attached it to an e_- mail on the same day .
neutral	i checked by phone that it had been received on the 00th and later that day an e_- mail confirmed that the order had been despatched .
neutral	unfortunately , the order did not arrive for another 0 days .
neutral	i will try the same company again , but will check that the prescription has arrived
neutral	when uploaded .
neutral	it was the first time that i used the company .
neutral	i would use them again but not for something that i urgently require .
neutral	i had to send 0 emails on 0 consecutive days , 00 days after_placing my order .
neutral	on the 0rd day i got an apologetic email informing_me that they were now dispatching my item ( what was going on for 00 days ?
neutral	i have no clue .
neutral	what would they have done if i hadn_'_t enquired_about my order ?
neutral	i have no clue ).
neutral	the thing is that they took the time to send me a promotional email instead of answering my request during my 0 - day -' chase .'
neutral	yes i got what i ordered but i do not recommend to use this company if you are in a hurry .
neutral	everything was very easy to follow from the music_magpie website .
neutral	but there '_s not much money to be made from cds .
neutral	one cd ( out of about 00 ) was not recognised by the site .
neutral	i ordered a new shower_tray , door and shower_head from betterbathrooms .
neutral	they all arrived on time .
neutral	unfortunately , as i am not a plumber , i bought a slim line shower_tray ( i think they look much_nicer_than the other ones ) i didn_'_t know that i would also need to buy a kit that included the legs .
neutral	when i have bought shower_trays in the past they have come with the legs .
neutral	when my plumber realised that the legs weren_'_t included , i contacted betterbathrooms and asked where they were .
neutral	i was told that i should have bought the extra kit and that i would need it in order to plumb in the tray as it was also going on a concrete floor .
neutral	as i didn_'_t want the plinth that came with the kit i asked if it was possible to just buy the legs .
neutral	i was told that someone would get back to me .
neutral	unfortunately no one did .
neutral	i contacted the company again ( on the same day , late_afternoon ) and was told that the legs were around £_00 , and that with delivery they would cost about £_00 .
neutral	the cost of the complete pack , with the plinth was around £_00 , so i decided to order the complete pack , only to be told then that they were out of stock and even if they were in stock i would not receive them the next_day as it was too late for a next_day delivery .
neutral	so i had a plumber who couldn_'_t do any work , and a tiler who was waiting to tile the shower room after the tray was installed and no kit .
neutral	the next_day i spoke to dave in the wigan office .
neutral	he was very helpful and suggested that i buy a kit that contained four legs and have my plumber put supports under the middle of the shower .
neutral	thank_goodness he suggested this as i was desperate to get the equipment needed to complete the installation .
neutral	i had also bought a shower_head that was too small , so i ordered another one .
neutral	this was on a next_day delivery but actually took two days to get to me .
neutral	i did phone to complain_about this and spoke to someone in customer_services .
neutral	she was very helpful , found out when the delivery was occurring and said she would try to get the cost if the delivery refunded .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t heard_anything from betterbathrooms regarding this .
neutral	it should be automatically refunded if the items don_'_t arrive on time , there is nothing to think about .
neutral	overall i would say that betterbathrooms are good value for money .
neutral	their staff are helpful , but it would be a good idea if there was a pop up when ordering these slim line shower_trays asking if feet are needed as they are not included .
neutral	after all there is a pop up offering accessories etc .
neutral	also refunds on delivery charges should be automatic if they do not arrive on time .
neutral	overall i have enjoyed going through quidco .
neutral	but as the title_says some transactions can be iffy .
neutral	let me explain .
neutral	we registered 0 cards with quidco ( my wife and i ) at times the card_details got erased so any purchases made did not register .
neutral	it was only when i tried to chase them up i noticed the cards had been erased , so no payments .
neutral	we do not always save receipts so cannot claim on these .
neutral	also account shows car insurance payment paid yet this has not been paid .
neutral	does not seem point in sending yet another message as i never get a satisfactory reply , even when i get a telephone_call .
neutral	have considered closing account down several_times but keep hoping it will improve .
neutral	will stick with it a little longer to hope for improvement .
neutral	the sooner the govt reduces the vat threshold so that companies like play can '_t take_advantage of it the better .
neutral	then we can buy from companies that don_'_t split an order for 0 cd / dvds into 0 parcels so i end up having to pick them up from the post_office 0 bloody times !
neutral	sure pricing is ok but just so they save the vat they split orders into amounts that are less_than £_00 or something .
neutral	i see that tesco , asda and all the rest of them ship from the channel_islands too nowadays so they can all save on tax - while the rest of uk companies have no choice but to pay it - money goes to money as usual
neutral	i have bought from them a few_times and if you are willing to wait a few_days longer_than say amazon then you can probably get it cheaper here than most .
neutral	the issue is with electrical equipment that requires a uk plug - both time i have not had one and it '_s come with a eu plug instead - so i have had to go out and buy a plug convertor - kinds of defeats the savings .
neutral	we have used virgin for our florida flights quite a few_times - using air miles collected through amex and then xferring them to virgin .
neutral	problem we '_ve had this past 0 or 0 flights is the attitude of the virgin crew on the plane has_been really poor .
neutral	sure they smile when it suits them but there has_been an air of everything is too much_trouble recently - rolling eyes , sighs , just general body language that indicates they would just rather sit down and read their mags in between the times they throw meals at you .
neutral	we tend to travel with their premium service ( not upper but better_than economy ) and you tend to pay £_000 /£ 000 more per person per flight - so a family of 0 it racks up .
neutral	for that money i expect a courteous service at all times .
neutral	we try and avoid them from now on .
neutral	we have had better cabin_crew service from bmi and even ba to be honest .
neutral	shame really , used to like virgin at first .
neutral	saying that - going to dubai with them this year in upper class so we will see - again - not by choice - just the only ones that flew there on the dates we had where we could use our airmiles to reduce the cost .
neutral	quick , easy and prompt payment .
neutral	are better deals out there but they make it so easy i keep using them !
neutral	however , recently sold them an iphone for £_000 and i asked them how they made money on that to be told they sold them to developing countries .
neutral	so , that makes me a little uneasy to be helping a company make money out of africa or wherever .
neutral	i mean , how can they make money on a 0nd_hand iphone when paying me £_000 ?
neutral	doesn_'_t sound right at all hence lowered review rating .
neutral	0_stars for service , 0_stars for morals .
neutral	i had been with o0 for a number of years , and generally their service was above_average .
neutral	however , i moved_house , and that was the beginning of a very sorry_saga .
neutral	in a period of 00 months i had 0 routers .
neutral	each one had a different problem , ranging from getting so hot , i did not need heating , random drop outs , disconnections , and the list goes on .
neutral	finally having had enough of the poor quality of routers being provided , i contacted them and explained that they needed to get their act_together .
neutral	in fairness the customer service were every helpful , waiving the early_termination fees .
neutral	but , it is only since i have moved to another provided that the cheapness of their routers has_become increasingly apparent .
neutral	since i have changed , i am not able to get a wireless signal anywhere in the house .
neutral	not just sat on top of the router .
neutral	this review is now a little redundant as sky is buying out o0s ' customer base .
neutral	i am pleased to see that yodel are making serious efforts to improve their level of service .
neutral	i have been a catalogue customer for a number of years and yodel took over the courier service .
neutral	items would regularly disappear , text_messages saying they had tried to deliver but there was noone home ( i had been in all day ).
neutral	finally after a number of complaints to the catalogue and the courier , i resorted to contacting the ceo of both companies .
neutral	very recently , i have noticed a considerable improvement ( it would have been near impossible to get worse ).
neutral	but yodel have a lot of work to do before i have 000_% confidence in their service .
neutral	everything else seems okay .
neutral	prices are fair , i order a pair of cycling bib and went by their sizing chart but the fit was not accurate .
neutral	i am waiting for the exchange item to arrive .
neutral	the service was great , all the phone_calls were answered quickly and the cso '_s were extremely friendly and polite .
neutral	the brighton team were excellent great service and lovely people .
neutral	the actual treatment involved about and hour of delay before i finally got to the treatment room so i was pretty nervous .
neutral	the actual procedure was ok , not painful although quite unpleasant , but initially i could see pretty well .
neutral	it did get very sore after about 00_mins but a friend had advised me to go to sleep for a few hours and when i woke_up i could see almost perfectly .
neutral	it was very exciting .
neutral	i opted for monovision ie a reading eye and a driving eye and personally i would not recommend this perhaps for me the sacrifice on long vision for reading was too great .
neutral	disappointingly 0 months after treatment i have suffered some regression and will have to have the procedure repeated as i now require glasses again for driving .
neutral	booking made easily , but i was surprised when the payment was taken .
neutral	not clear that extra charges were added , sms confirmation , cancellation cover plus booking_fee
neutral	i was a customer of another isp up until a couple of months_ago .
neutral	in august i went into what i thought was my isp '_s web_site to check my billing statement .
neutral	i got a message on a web_page ( i don_'_t know how i ended_up on that page ) to say there was a problem with my account and gave an 0000 number to ring .
neutral	when i dialled the number i got an operator who claimed they were signing_up customers to a new account .
neutral	i then noticed the different name ( time talk ).
neutral	i told the operator that i still had time left on my current_contract but i was told not to worry_about it , that it would be taken care of .
neutral	i had the definite impression that my isp was aware of this .
neutral	realisation that time talk was actually a competitor poaching customers from my isp came later , but i stupidly allowed myself to be drawn in .
neutral	my isp charged me a £_00 contract break fee , which they took out of my direct_debit .
neutral	for a few_weeks the time talk customer advisers insisted i shouldn_'_t worry , just mail them a pdf of the statement , and they ’ ll pass it to their accounts_department for processing .
neutral	a lot of sympathy and telling_me how bad my isp was by charging such a large_amount and they would write to them on my behalf and urge them to refund it ..
neutral	i have now accepted my mistake , and as a result of this experience i want to leave time talk and go_elsewhere .
neutral	their cancellation advisor told me they would charge me a contract breaking fee of over £_000 .
neutral	i have since heard from time talk and they have decided to credit me back the £_00 because as they admitted their salesperson had made a mistake in allowing me to believe they would simply pay back the breakage fee .
neutral	so on this basis they have started to go up in my estimation .
neutral	fell foul of cut_off point for next_day delivery .
neutral	paid a premium but had to wait untill after the weekend . result no bike .
neutral	probably my fault but be warned .
neutral	autoglass really messed me around with the booking to fit a replacement screen after they were unable to repair my windscreen ( a small " star " crack in my windscreen caused by a stone ).
neutral	the replacement screen was booked to be fitted at feltham as i was told by the technician who visited my home that it was a complex job ( my car is a convertible ) and it was " better " to have it done at their centre .
neutral	i took his advice and got booked into my nearest branch ( feltham ).
neutral	i had to wait 0weeks for an_appointment and on the morning whilst i was driving there to leave the car , i got an_email from autoglass to tell me the booking had been " upgraded " and now would be done on a home visit !!!
neutral	when i got to the branch , it took some time to resolve this confusion as " they do not make the bookings ".
neutral	so lots of wasted time and irritation - plus a loss of confidence in what autoglass had advised me .
neutral	the original transaction was conducted through paypal and for no reason was reversed with no contact or information .
neutral	it took two_weeks to get money back to be able to order again .
neutral	the product itself when it finally arrived was fine .
neutral	a very messy process .
neutral	obviously something needs sorting_out somewhere .
neutral	will make me think_twice before using again .
neutral	i wrote a detailed and thoughtful review .
neutral	i was then asked to confirm by email or facebook .
neutral	this shouldn_'_t be necessary at all if i click on an invitation to review email .
neutral	i entered the email and password i had used with the supplier but this was not accepted .
neutral	i had no choice but to ' verify with facebook ' or abandon teh review .
neutral	luckily i do have a fb account or i '; d have been stuck .
neutral	however , i don_'_t want anything posted on my fb page or anything notified to friends which you try and sneak through .
neutral	i managed to write about five reviews the first time without a problem . there is nothing wrong with my computer but ever_since i click on the review button for various companies it just states done . the response to my emails to support endlessly states ` can you copy and paste the urls in to an_email and send it to us ?
neutral	the range of products has always been good compared to other_supermarkets . average fruit and vegetable section not as good as morrisons . very good wine section .
neutral	they are let_down by careless home delivery staff who clog the aisles with large trolleys chatting and poor responses to comments .
neutral	loved the car , the prices and the overall package .
neutral	however pick_up was appalling - it took nearly as long to get the vehicle as it did to fly from the uk to majorca - literally .
neutral	for the people behind us in the long queue it took longer .
neutral	they knew how many people had booked , when they were arriving and which cars were needed , yet there were not enough people to deal with this and to have to wait 0 hrs plus to pick_up your vehicle is not good practice .
neutral	i hope it is not usual .
neutral	food wine and electrical bargains brilliant and cheap cheap cheap but they buck pass if a fault develops , so a bit iffy for computers , cameras etc , might need to regard as a write off if they go_wrong .
neutral	£_00 for a room , looks very good but parking and internet add £_00 per night so in reality it was £_00 per night , again not bad but this should be the advertized price
neutral	better_than most of them but if you telephone them prepare to wait for an answer about 0 to 0 hours
neutral	the process from finding v0 online to meeting a sales_rep and getting the funds into my account was really straightforward and i was kept up to date by the sales_rep when he was on his way to meet me , the forms only took about 00_minutes to complete and i received my loan really quickly .
neutral	my only negative is the aftersales service .
neutral	i have emailed about a couple of queries and it has taken me to chase and chase to get a response .
neutral	i would also really appreciate receiving some sort of monthly statement instead of always having to call or email to find out my remaining balance .
neutral	i have also got in touch to request my v0 for an address change but yet to get a reply again !
neutral	so this side of things i am not happy about
neutral	i was pulled into facebook by an_email from someone who wanted me to be his ' friend '.
neutral	he was already my friend , so i had no_idea what he was going on about , however i followed the link , intending to give him some click to confirm rather_than ignore him , but found i actually had to join the thing to do so .
neutral	i was tempted to phone him to say ' nothing personal , but you ' re going to have to accept that i am your friend , without my having to join some official club in order to prove it to you '.
neutral	however , i decided to join , in the unlikely_event that it might be in any way of interest to me .
neutral	that seemed to put me on some kind of a map , and i was soon getting emails from more people wanting me to be their ' friend '.
neutral	each time , i had to find and apply my login details in order to validate the friendship i thought they already had with me .
neutral	after a few_months , these interruptions began to dwindle , and i only have to log in about once every three_months .
neutral	occasionally , i am told that people have ' written things on my wall ', so i log in .
neutral	it is a lot of effort to do things which can more easily be done by phone , email or forum .
neutral	worse still , i seem to be in the centre of irrelevant , even idiotic information trying to grap my attention of my clicks .
neutral	somebody was desperate to get a virtual ingredient to make a virtual cocktail in order to get a virtual - bartenders ' certificate .
neutral	what collyrot !
neutral	but i wincingly and , i admit , patronizingly decided to click to assist them in their pointless ambition ; and found that to do so , i had to liberate my entire address book to the organizers of the virtual bar , presumably so that i become implicated in spreading this .
neutral	therefore , i go on facebook only when i am called , am unimpressed each time , and i log off asap .
neutral	there are , however , many millions of people who like spending time on it - it obviously ' works '.
neutral	even some of my real - life friends tell me that it helps them to ' keep in touch '.
neutral	when reviewing , i typically feel secure and confident that i am assessing the quality of a ' thing in itself '.
neutral	but , regarding facebook , i realise i am reviewing a product which works , but which i have no interest in , like a chicken - sexing kit .
neutral	the serious difference_between facebook and chicken - sexing kits , both fo which , i assume , achieve their objectives , is that the latter does not force itself into my awareness , nor recruit my friends to be part of its marketing .
neutral	it '_s only a propelling pencil .
neutral	i '_t s less_than £ 0 .
neutral	after more than a week overdue it hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	emails and phone_calls not responded to .
neutral	eventually i managed to make contact and all was resolved amicably and in a friendly way .
neutral	they refunded the cost - which was nice - and sent the pencil anyway .
neutral	once we ' d established comms i was told they had email and hosting problems .
neutral	satisfactory_outcome .
neutral	just returned from a 0month trip around singapore , australia , new_zealand and thailand , one of the legs from sydney to bangkok was on ba00 , and i must_say that the service on business class is not what it used to be .
neutral	the service was some what rushed and we got the feeling that we an inconvenience to the cabin_crew , they would have been happier if the business class cabin would have been empty .
neutral	come on ba get your act_together , i am afraid that qantas really have the better customer service than you at the moment .
neutral	my last order was about the sixth pallet of tiles i have had from this company .
neutral	generally i would say everything is very good and of course you can ’ t beat them on price .
neutral	but i will say that i have sent back a pallet of tiles before as they looked a mess on the lorry and they sent me back what must have been seconds as the tiles we warped .
neutral	this last pallet was a mess when it arrived as well .
neutral	but i was waiting on them so i accepted it .
neutral	it must have been packed by someone without a brain as the boxes were stacked upright and wrapped with a bit of clingfilm .
neutral	soon as the pallet gets knocked in transit they have all leaned forward ripping all the boxes and scratching some of the tiles .
neutral	it also made it a nightmare to unload without them toppling .
neutral	i must_say that i have used about a third of them and so far only two have been broken .
neutral	the last problem was although i clicked the link on my previous order so as to get exactly the same tiles they are different .
neutral	not the same shade of white , not the same manufacturer and not even exactly the same size .
neutral	which meant i cannot mix them with my left over ’_s .
neutral	the initial order worked well and i expected to receive the code within their stated 0 to 00_hours .
neutral	however after 00_hours i had to send an e_- mail asking for the code .
neutral	within a couple of hours fonesunlock sent the code to me and it worked with no_problems .
neutral	thanks
neutral	well i keep getting used to good ' ol facebook , then they go along & change it every few_months .
neutral	now we have timeline .
neutral	love it or hate it .
neutral	actually , i love it ~ but will it be around for long ?
neutral	who_knows ....
neutral	been with 0 for about 0 years now , originally the signal_strength was excellent here in west cumbria , this was the main_reason that i sarted with the 0 network .
neutral	however over the last 0 - 0 months the reception has got to be more patchy , giving them 0 last chance as i have just taken out a new contract , then i may have to reconsider my options despite the excellent packages offered by this company .
neutral	ordered 0gb_ram on the 00th midday .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	have still received nothing .
neutral	was assured by mr m that my parcel would be delivered today by 0pm .
neutral	i ' m still_waiting for it .
neutral	the courier company never pick_up their phone .
neutral	mr m not interested .
neutral	advise others not to shop_here when there are other_suppliers that go out of their way to provide the service their customers deserve .
neutral	i shall never use this company again
neutral	i would like to add that i have finally received my order and i have installed it and is working great .
neutral	mr_memory interceded and helped get my order to me on the 0rd attempt and my next_day delivery premium was refunded .
neutral	i will give mr m another chance so i know i shall be shopping with them again as i love their products and the people there are great .
neutral	however , its a shame they may lose customers due to a poor courier service experience such as mine .
neutral	sorry for the mix_up .
neutral	the tap i purchased from you guys was a wonderful top_notch product but unfortunately didn_'_t fit my bathroom so i returned it but i am still_waiting for the refund .
neutral	had to pay vat and duty this was not explained during checkout nor was it explained that the goods were coming from abroad .
neutral	i found using the site very easy , good value for money and definitely cheaper_than anywhere_else .
neutral	however , the courier used clearly did not read ( or maybe did not receive ) the explicit instruction left regarding delivery and leaving at a safe_place at my home , and i had to contact customer_services ( delivery ) on a number on which i only had push button responses to use .
neutral	not acceptable on any level .
neutral	pet_supermarket did resolve it for me , but , will i use it again ?
neutral	probably not .
neutral	like most people i work for a living and the courier will only deliver mon - fri free of charge , if you want delivery on a saturday it is apparently £ 0 extra which would negate the saving i make on my pets food .
neutral	disappointing that this is not taken into account .
neutral	ordered early on a thursday and delivery will be the following_tuesday .
neutral	i know that is within their time limits , but there really is very little reason that next_day delivery could not be provided as it is with loads of other in stock mail order items from other_companies .
neutral	having said that price is good and one has comfort from it being a reliable source .
neutral	this site is easy to use , but appears almost identical to several other train sites in layout and prices ; is this indicative of shared data , as these sites have the same prices as each other every time i look .
neutral	other_sites , such as red spotted handkerchief seem to be different , offer different prices , and are sometimes available before either thetrainline , or the other similar sites .
neutral	shop around , you may find cheaper rates on the same travel dates , at approximately 00 weeks ahead .
neutral	the title_says it all .
neutral	despite many attempts to stop them sending e_- mail ads to my workplace address , it hasn_'_t stopped .
neutral	it has now been added to the works blocked sender '_s list .
neutral	sorry argos , buck up your customer service ideas .
neutral	on the plus side however , the site itself is user_friendly , easy to navigate , and easy to reserve items for later pick_up in stores .
neutral	( hence three stars not two .)
neutral	i found workwear_express very efficient .
neutral	our order was dealt_with quickly and sent out within they time they promised .
neutral	i was pleased with the artwork and initially with the t shirts we had ordered .
neutral	on closer_inspection , however , the t shirts were too short and after a couple of washes on 00 degree wash they had shrunk even more and had gone out of shape .
neutral	i would certainly order from work wear express again but would not order the type of t shirt purchased this time .
neutral	very dissapointing when you pay for something and you get it three_months later due to being out of stock .
neutral	shame but this has put me off ordering again .
neutral	bought a wooden kitchen trolley in march_0000 ebay id - 000000000000 from these_people trading on ebay under the seller name discounthomestore ( since stopped trading on ebay and the web under this name ).
neutral	they are clearly the same people , same names , e_- mail address , telephone_numbers and address .
neutral	the trolley was assembled in april .
neutral	in december it had collapsed .
neutral	there appeared to be no way of getting touch with them .
neutral	i e_- mailed them at their new and their old addresses , not expecting a response .
neutral	both did respond and a refund and collection for the damaged goods was arranged within_00hrs .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	everything was going great until website used parcelforce for postage . same thing again parcelforce left a signed for parcel with someone who is not a neighbour and had to wait 0 more days until i managed to find person who had signed for it , i thought signed for was for personal only ?
neutral	i walked out of my local o0 shop when they said quote " yeah we are expensive and the trade in is pants - but hey we can sell as many as we like ( 0s )".... so i went to vodaphone and they had a really good deal but no phones .. so went back to 00 .
neutral	no joy , no price match not even for a long_term customer with 0 phones in the family ... so went back to vodaphone .
neutral	they suggested i called o0 retention !!!!!!
neutral	i did - they did a great deal ... but .
neutral	when the new 0s stops working the customer service refer you to an o0 shop - who will have nothing to do with you .
neutral	as neither will apple .
neutral	buying from ' retention ' is deemed to be online and nothing to do with o0 retail shops .
neutral	poor service , wrong customer service advice - shame about the phone .
neutral	only saving grace was excellent support from repairs team - but it took me 0 hrs and 0 calls waiting on piped music landlines .
neutral	not enough variety .
neutral	the soups don_'_t taste that good .
neutral	price is good compared to lighter life .
neutral	play . com offer some great goods at reasonable_prices , my only complaint is the speed of delivery , it normally takes 0 - 0 days to deliver to worcester uk , orders form amazon also based in jersey , normally arrive in 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i always prefer to book a hotel with a shared or private kitchen but there isn ’ t a search option for this .
neutral	many of the reviews are written in different languages and there is no translation facility - this is frustrating as you have to copy and paste into google translate .
neutral	often the information is incorrect - hotels promise more than they deliver .
neutral	when booking a hotel for several days it would be useful to see the daily as well as the total price .
neutral	found this website that offered more than just flowers to be delivered , ordered what i thought would be a special gift of flowers , mini balloon and birthday cake .
neutral	unfortunatley the cake was not delivered , which was a great disapointment as i received 0 really good emails , 0 to say they were on the way and the other to say they had been delivered .
neutral	=.
neutral	(....
neutral	if you create a truthful and honest review about an experience you have had with an online supplier who use trustpilot and should you dare to publish a poor service , the retailer then objects if you give them a low score .
neutral	trustpilot then threatens to have your review removed if you don_'_t change it .
neutral	i don_'_t believe that this is then a fair or independent review of the service or experience received when forced to change the review !
neutral	could this be because the retailers have paid trustpilot to be on their website !!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	can consumers then trust the reviews placed on trustpilot ? and are trustpilot actually unbiased or simply just protecting the retailers to publish and promote high scores ?
neutral	regards alan hinman .
neutral	0rd july_0000 .
neutral	i ordered a large white radiator .
neutral	i received an e_mail on the day it was due to be delivered to say the courier couldn_'_t deliver and it would come the following_day , as it was heavy and they needed a different vehicle .
neutral	it eventually arrived the day after that - but they sent a black one !
neutral	the invoice and the delivery note clearly_stated it was white .
neutral	very helpful people , arranged for courier to deliver the correct item and take away the wrong one , but by now my builder and plumber had wasted five days .
neutral	i ordered a set of car mat and a cover for my soft top when its down ' tonneau cover '.
neutral	mats despatched fine and as advertised .
neutral	very curt note saying , ' we are not supplying the tonneau cover as it is not suitable for your vehicle '.
neutral	i had to contact the supplier and ask for one that was appropriate for my vehicle , and recieved another curt reply - there is none available for your model of car .
neutral	i found what i needed from another supplier .
neutral	dont ignore the ads , i missed out on a great broadband detail because i went to the standard page which did not have the deal on offer by their ad .
neutral	come on bt put the offer on the page as well
neutral	woulld say that your site was one of the best for getting a return on your money
neutral	but my opinion has changed because over last 0 weeks i have not had any luck
neutral	i have just been depositing money so i dont see the point on going on iam just losing money so i am not playing anymore .
neutral	regards derek
neutral	takes a lots of time to compile .
neutral	resultant photos acceptable , could be better .
neutral	zapper is great if you have a load of old books that you '_ve read and no_longer need which are taking up space .
neutral	the collection drop_off point are close by .
neutral	but sadly out of the 0000 books that i own and urgently want rid of only 00 were accepted and it took me a whole day to enter all of the codes onto the zapper system .
neutral	then of course you have to find the right sized box and a roll of tape and then you have to weigh the box and measure it or it won_'_t meet the criteria .
neutral	so you need scales that read kg '_s .
neutral	i got my cheque ok about a week after i had posted the books out .
neutral	the next time i am just going to bag them up and recycle them as paper as its easier and you get the money in your hand right away .
neutral	i do think this service is getting poor , i remeber you could get your first bid within 00min it was excepted , not now the bids are ridiclous its laughable , my wife used the same courier , s if she can , courier , s come and go . my wife as used this service for 0yrs , it was great , courier were reliable , you got a good service all_round , i used this service because its straigt forward but you do wait a long time for a good bid offer
neutral	i think it '_s user - friendly but i don_'_t like the amount they deduct every time !
neutral	i feel m & s is a trustworthy store who do care about customer service .
neutral	they offer good value , well_designed products but sometimes their buyers lose the way with their choices !
neutral	i think bt are too big but we just can '_t avoid using them
neutral	i try not to shop too much at tesco because i don_'_t like their domination .
neutral	they do offer good value products in most_cases but i feel they punish their suppliers to enable this .
neutral	i might be wrong on this but i dont ' think so .
neutral	there has definitely been a decline in the quality of thee books .
neutral	i have done about 0 now and the colour is really poor compared to original photographs .
neutral	i feel there aren_'_t enough options in the layout either , quite boring layouts so going to start having these photobooks done elsewhere .
neutral	mmmm .. what game is this refering to ?
neutral	there was no contact until item was dispatched .
neutral	i have just returned from spain where i hired a chev aveo for two_weeks and thought i was getting a good deal .
neutral	however i left the car with a three quarter tank and was charged e00 . 00 euro for fuel !!!!
neutral	that was more than 000 of the total hire charge which included insurance .
neutral	i understand i could have left an empty tank , but who takes a chance with travelling on an empty tank in a foreign country .
neutral	the car_hire company was eurocar .
neutral	the fuel_tank has a capacity of 00 litres and at the cost of fuel in malaga at e0 . 000 per_litre - a full_tank of fuel on empty would have cost e00 euro .
neutral	i will never hire a car again on these terms .
neutral	i would not recommend this type of car_hire .
neutral	i hire_cars 0 to 0 times a year , guess_what a lost customer here >
neutral	as i have bought several gtech products it would be quite helpful to know which one you want a review for .
neutral	we purchased an adjustable foot stool which was promptly dispatched .
neutral	the stool was quite poorly finished with sharp corners , in fact my wife cut her foot on one of the corners .
neutral	it was not worth sending back and i smoothed it off .
neutral	with a bit more thought it could have been made with rounded corners .
neutral	when folded one of the metal struts protrudes slightly again poor construction / design .
neutral	it is a shame as with a bit more thought it could have been excellent .
neutral	i was thrilled to try out this method of quitting smoking conventional cigarettes .
neutral	at first it did save a lot of money .
neutral	however of late the company is constantly updating their products and the new models are unrliable and so becoming too expensive to continue with .
neutral	i am almost at the brink of changing allegience to another company .
neutral	i ordered my pc on 0th_january_0000 via the website and it arrived on 00 january_0000 so just outside the 0 week lead time mentioned on their website so not too bad , it came with all the correct components , the oem windows 0 disk and the graphics_card box + drivers so no_problems there !
neutral	however , when i tried to contact them to find out when the order would be dispatched ( after the 0 week deadline had passed ) it took three attempts on different days and waiting an average of 00_minutes before anyone picked_up the telephone , i also sent 0 emails and got no response .
neutral	i think this company is basically sound but when you hand over several_hundred_pounds it does make you sweat a little when you cannot get hold of a human_being , customer service needs some working on and then they would be a great little company and no doubt pick_up far more business !
neutral	whilst holidayautos booking process works really well it is important to fully understand the contract with the car_hire company .
neutral	on this occasion the 000_euro deposit stated on my confirmation became a 0000 euro deposit when i arrived at gold_car in rome ..... that '_s their requirement for the class of car we hired .
neutral	also i had to take gold_car '_s inflexible ' flexible fuel ' policy ... take the car full and return it empty and pay their high fuel price and a compulsory refuelling charge of 00 euros .
neutral	the wording in my confirmation wasn_'_t absolutely clear and gold_car would not allow me to take the car full and return it full .
neutral	also the transfer service for gold_car at fiumicino is a nightmare , 0_seater minibuses and a scrum to get on one competing with parkinggo car_park clients .... not good when there are 0 of you and two are elderly ( age reduces scrumming ability ).
neutral	on the positive side gold_car provided us with a brand_new car and refunded the unused fuel .
neutral	i ordered 0 items online on 00nd march .
neutral	0 item was delivered within 00 days but the other 0 items had expected delivery dates of 00th_may and 00nd june !
neutral	h & m sell good quality items but do yourself a favour , buy instore as the online set_up is abysmal .
neutral	i have just cancelled the remainder of my order as i am not prepared to wait 0 months from the date of order until delivery .
neutral	have had some really good juice ( menthol and banana ) but vermillion river menthol tasted nothing like menthol and standard blueberry tasted of very little .
neutral	always quick delivery though
neutral	the initial contact with the support_team was very good .
neutral	i had a problem with my login where i could not login , but neither could i obtain a new password or get the system to recognise me to do this even_though i have registered and at one of the stages it is obvious that i have been recognised .
neutral	the support person i spoke to sent me a copy of my bill ( which i was attempting to access with difficulty ) and promised to chase up a rectification of my account login and the let me know when it was fixed ( expected to be 0 working_days .
neutral	no contact was made after 0 days and so a chase e_- mail was sent , with no response .
neutral	it would be good to know the current status and when a fix is likely .
neutral	because i neglected to get the registration date of the owners v0 before we parted company this did not match on the final certificate .
neutral	my experience with waltons was not a good one .
neutral	i placed an order that was said to be delived the next_day tomorrow came and went no contact from anyone to inform me as to why my order had not been delivered .
neutral	after several phone_calls i was told it might be delivered on monday 0 days after order , as luck would have it i took delivery on the saturday , and was given a 00 . 00 pound refund , not what i would call proffesional service
neutral	placed an order before their cut - off time and according to their own website the phone should have been dispatched the same day .
neutral	0 days_later and the phone has still not been sent .
neutral	update_: received prompt reply to my email_advising that they did not have any stock of the item and that there was a problem with their on - line inventory regarding this particular_model .
neutral	offered a full_refund which has_been processed .
neutral	unfortunate first interaction and not the outcome i wanted but a satisfactory response to the issue .
neutral	website great , products and prices are great , delivery tracking and delivery excellent .
neutral	they lose a couple of stars for issuing a generic " there is an issue with your order , please call ..." message if you specify an alternate delivery address even if you have been through the " verified by visa " process which thieves won_'_t be able to get through .
neutral	i can '_t hang_around in telephone queues during the business day ( and they always have a queue ) but got through in the last 00_mins of their working day on a friday .
neutral	this is just an unneccessary irritation to genuine customers ... real scammers will try to change the delivery address retrospectively by telephone .
neutral	the bag is what i expected and the service was good .
neutral	but the bag was squashed into the packaging box which was too small for the item - therefore the bag is badly creased .
neutral	shame !
neutral	don_'_t you have bigger boxes !
neutral	?
neutral	purchased simms star cleats , the website says the box contains 00 when in fact it only contains 00 , otherwise i would have given 00 stars given the chance .
neutral	haven_'_t opened the container to check but unless they have opened it and placed an extra 0 in , it says 00 .
neutral	it '_s all in the detail !
neutral	i am sure my equipment will turn_up promptly and as ordered .
neutral	my gripe is in the fact that despite_emailing them and telephoning them , leaving my details for a callback to enquire_about an armed forces discount that one of the shops confirmed they do offer , nobody bothered to reply to either .
neutral	i ended_up ordering regardless but will go back to my previous_supplier for future orders .
neutral	not feeling very valued .
neutral	i had very mixed experience with very .
neutral	the first time i ordered a jumper to try them out was extremely bad .
neutral	i had chosen a sat for delivery as i work during weekdays .
neutral	i waited from 0am to 00pm on saturday and guy did not turn_up .
neutral	i rang them and they simply told me the guy cudnt find the no so left .
neutral	that was such a feeble excuse and its absolutely rubbish .
neutral	however , eventually the coat turned_up late_afternoon .
neutral	however , my second experience with them turned_out rather good .
neutral	delivery was prompt , returns experience is average as they do take ages to update their returns .
neutral	people taking calls on average most are not very helpful or knows what they are taking about .
neutral	i had a good and a really bad customer service online before .
neutral	on the whole , i would give them a 0 . 0 out of 0 .
neutral	they need to give better customer service .
neutral	i do like the take 0 payments which are great if you are short of cash to get something you need really badly .
neutral	and if you pay them within the stipulated time without interest is great .
neutral	i avoid this social network .
neutral	tried to use it but it just don_'_t suit me .
neutral	i think aria is a great company with some fantastic bargains .
neutral	for me the only thing that lets them down is there delivery charges .
neutral	i was going to order an asus motherboard and 0 gb of ddr0 memory from them the other day .
neutral	now the strange thing was that the motherboard had free delivery so i thought that by adding the memory to it would also count as free delivery , but i was shocked as the delivery went up to over £_00 , if i had ordered them separately i would have got free delivery on the motherboard and paid just over £ 0 delivery on the memory . there great prices which are some of the cheapest around are really let_down by there delivery charges , so for me only 0_stars , get your delivery charges sorted_out and it would have been 0_stars .
neutral	pitty really .
neutral	poor service , having received my new phone i took it into the shop and they put the new sim_card in , but it didn_'_t work .
neutral	then had to wait 0 days for another one i gave the shop the tools that came with the phone to remove the sim_card but didn_'_t get them back .
neutral	when i asked about transferring my no '_s they said it would cost £ 0 but afterwards i found out i could do it through i tunes !
neutral	then when i registered my new sim on the phone ( website wouldn_'_t work ) i was told i would receive a text but after 00_hours it hadn_'_t come so i had to phone again !
neutral	this time i was told it was registered but i had to switch it off and on again !
neutral	i received only one response to my request and that was more_expensive than buying the part new .
neutral	however , full_marks to the one respondent .
neutral	i purchased this small item and found the cost of the item was reasonable but the postage was far to high for such a small item making the overall cost far to expencive , it also thought it took a bit to long to arrive for the cost charged .
neutral	i ordered some flowers for my daughter for her_birthday and received email_confirmation of safe delivery .
neutral	i then discovered , on speaking to my daughter later that day , that she had been out all day .
neutral	she had picked_up a card which had been put through her letterbox that rather unhelpfully said the flowers had been left at her own door number !
neutral	she called on neighbours both_sides but no luck .
neutral	eventually she spotted a rather nice bouquet in the window of a house three down from her and thought she would call on the off - chance .
neutral	fortunately her very honest neighbour confirmed that they were indeed meant for my daughter .
neutral	i appreciate that it was not the fault of the florist that the flowers could not be delivered but i feel cheated that i had been told they were safely delivered when clearly they were not and if it was not possible to deliver to a next door neighbour surely it would be better to keep them and try to arrange a more appropriate delivery time ( even at extra_cost ) rather_than risk them being lost .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	the flowers however were gorgeous and i would order again but give more specific delivery instructions next time .
neutral	good on overall weekly_shop it stock most brands friendly staff
neutral	site a little_slow to use and lacking maps to assist with hotel locations , but fairly competitive in terms of pricing .
neutral	however , alpharooms fail to be up front when it comes to charges for using a debit / credit_card .
neutral	in their terms and conditions , reference is made to bookings being subject to such a charge where applicable , but it is only at the final payment stage when this becomes visible .
neutral	for my own hotel booking , an option to avoid debit / credit_card costs was offered by paying with a fairfx prepaid mastercard .
neutral	despite having sufficient funds in my fairfx account , my payment was twice refused , forcing me to pay extra for booking with a debit_card .
neutral	i was left with the opinion that the " free " fairfx offer was a bit of a con , and would suggest that alpharooms be more transparent on their card charges .
neutral	i was disappointed when my order for perspex sheeting arrived with every sheet broken .
neutral	it is clear it was broken in transit , but the packaging was so poor , i am not surprised they were all broken .
neutral	they were quick to replace though at a price that was competitive , so worked out ok in the end .
neutral	part exchanged my 0 year_old ford ka which i bought brand_new from this garage , after 000 , 000 trouble_free miles . this time i bought a 0 year_old ka with 0 , 000_miles on the clock .
neutral	because there was a private plate on my vehicle and some dual controls to change over it was 0 weeks before i got the new car . whilst waiting for these weeks to pass and having signed the new agreement i received a letter from ford finance about a missed payment on my old car , i still had 0 payments to go .
neutral	jennings had some how managed to forget to settle my previous car finance despite a new agreement being in place , it was then paid .
neutral	not a good start but hey no_problems with my last car !
neutral	!
neutral	the day came to pick_up the car and as we sorted last bits and pieces and i was shown how many checks the car had gone_through before i was receiving it the salesman held up the spare , none remote key declaring the other was missing , but it wouldnt take long to get another !!!
neutral	despite having 0 weeks to sort this . not looking good .
neutral	got in the car started the engine , sure i heard a knock ??
neutral	drove home with occasional , " i ' m_sure i heard a knock there ".
neutral	turned engine off , definate knock .
neutral	rang and told salesman , " thats strange , surprised i never_heard it when i drove it but pop it back and sure we will sort it ".
neutral	i had a look under engine that night and discovered a bolt was missing from the bottom metal radiator hose where it bolts to the subframe , put a bolt in , knock gone .
neutral	:-)
neutral	got a call on the friday before_christmas to say key was in so duly arranged to go in the next_day .
neutral	the heater fan was buzzing occasionally and it had a slight groan on the steering at low speeds so i was going to mention these item too .
neutral	there for 0 . 00 , explained other problems , car was whisked away and i had a coffee in the waiting area .
neutral	00_minutes later good news and bad_news .
neutral	good news new key up and running , bad_news spare key has_been blocked , so do not use and we will be in touch in the new year to programme a new one !!!
neutral	they couldnt hear fan rattle or groan but to be fair they were a bit random .
neutral	drove home a bit happier :-)
neutral	as the car is used for driving tuition i ' m in it an awful_lot and fitting in trips to the garage are very rare so i '_ve coped without a spare key , no great hardship , and the other 0 faults have nicely grown louder making detection easier .
neutral	also the drivers seat now doesn_'_t click into position without a great push or it frightens some poor learner to death when it suddenly bangs into place at some in - opportune moment !!
neutral	!
neutral	got a cancellation this morning so drove 00_minutes to the garage to be told they are so busy they cannot come out to see the vehicle and i have to book it in for them to look / listen to these problems and then book it in again to get any_problems solved !!!
neutral	i was told even if i needed a bulb changing they couldnt do it until next week .
neutral	i mentioned my replacement key and was told it was replaced on january 0rd this year !!!
neutral	they will order another key and program it when my car comes in for the above problems .
neutral	not sure how they had confused me coming in and having a key programmed !
neutral	!
neutral	i have put off writing this review thinking that they will sort things out once i pop in and let them listen / look to things , then i book it in and all '_s rosy .
neutral	its not to be .
neutral	the last car only had the first service done by jennings then i did all the other '_s myself , its cheaper and you know_whats done but obviously not everyone can do that .
neutral	i ' m always on a tight schedule with my work and i have never found a garage that understands this , even on that one and only service i didn_'_t get the car back at the alloted_time because they didn_'_t have an oil filter for it in stock !!!!!
neutral	maybe i should have learnt that so long as you dont have to deal with the service department then alls good but if you do then i think its god help you .
neutral	purchasing the vehicle from the salesman was the usual 00 / 00 but its been all down_hill from there .
neutral	sorry about the lengh of this review , it would have been much shorter for my last car lol but i hope it will help anyone purchasing a vehicle from jennings to know what they could be getting into .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	i '_ve just tried the first 0 of the 00 pack of 0oz mature rump_steaks i had delivered last_week by westin_gourmet .
neutral	whilst the steaks looked very lean , and tasted fine , they were both tough in terms of texture .
neutral	i ' m_hoping that the other 0 steaks in the pack are more tender to eat .
neutral	having never used this company before i was hesitant when placing an order for nearly_£_000 , however i rang through to ask a few questions prior to ordering and was confident i was dealing_with a reputable company after i got off the phone .
neutral	what a shame the experience has left me very disappointed .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t rung myself to chase my order along the way i would not have had a clue what was happening .
neutral	communication was non_existent , a few_days after_placing the order i rang to be told i would receive it within a couple of days ... no ...
neutral	i then rang again when it hadn_'_t arrived to be told the same thing , only after the third chasing phone_call was i told it was actually being sent that afternoon , i received two_thirds of the order the following_day , that was a week after_placing the order .
neutral	the outstanding item was out of stock but i was told that stock was coming in that week by the 00th_march and it would be sent when they received it .
neutral	another chasing phone_call when it didn_'_t arrive i was told it was due in and would be sent ... a final call this week to sue , who actually had the courtesy to come back to me , i discovered that my item was actually not due in till april as there was a problem with the supplier .
neutral	sue arranged for me to receive a similar item .
neutral	yes the prices are great and i am pleased with everything received now , but nearly 0 weeks having spent in the region of £_000 , with no communication at all was a little stressful .
neutral	wouldn_'_t use again due to lack of communication .
neutral	ordered a samsung sound_bar and hdmi_cable for which i was given the same delivery date ; blue_ray arrived but no cable .
neutral	cable arrived next_day in post and another the next_day .
neutral	company prides_itself on own delivery vehicles but is unable to provide more than a 00 hour delivery window .
neutral	most white van men are now giving 0 hour delivery windows .
neutral	inquired about the purchase of samsung blue_ray ; was advised that it was out of stock with no know re - stock date and a suggestion that i should purchase a more_expensive unit that i did not want .
neutral	excellent customer service would have retained my details with a promise to let me know when in stock and reserve me one for immediate delivery .
neutral	company lost that sale .
neutral	a good range of quality products at reasonable_prices .
neutral	the only problem i had was some of the led lamps ordered were incorrectly boxed and therefore not what was ordered .
neutral	i have been promised replacements which i am still_waiting for .
neutral	when ordering was told it would be 0st april .. then phoned and told no sooner_than 0th
neutral	therefore it hasn_'_t yet arrived
neutral	although i had a groupon_voucher i still thought i was getting a good deal .
neutral	0 pairs of glasses supposed to be £_00 each for £_00 .. i honestly don_'_t think they ' re any better quality than of the peg glasses from a cheap shop ..
neutral	order placed paid extra for delivery arrived a week_later and not the next_day as promised .
neutral	sadly the owner , who i have emailed twice now , still_hasn_'_t replied :-(
neutral	this is the third time i '_ve placed an order with hispek , they seem to have a problem with customer_services they don_'_t contact you if there is a problem but leave it until you contact them , i don_'_t mind problems with orders as long as i am aware of it .
neutral	having said that my order is supposed to arrive on tuesday 00th_may ( placed on 00th_april ) bank_holiday '_s and stock etc .
neutral	so if i can i '_ll leave a review then .
neutral	to add to my review , i '_ve just received my cooker at the time specified and by the most helpful driver you could want .
neutral	the cooker is all and more than i expected and very pleased with both the price and the product .
neutral	regarding customer service if they just followed up an order after confirmation with an expected delivery date but apart_from that hispek is a good company and worth looking at especially there prices i can '_t fault that .
neutral	price couldn_'_t be_faulted and neither could communications .
neutral	however , on the day before fitting the garage sent an_email_confirmation of the appointment but on the day their tyre machine wasn_'_t working ( and hadn_'_t been the previous day ).
neutral	this should have been communicated to me to save a wasted trip .
neutral	the garage did ' phone in the afternoon to say it had been fixed a i rescheduled for the following_day .
neutral	service was prompt , polite and efficient on the day .
neutral	i would use again but maybe not use the same garage for fitting .
neutral	ordered epiphone ukulele and belcat 00w slim amp on monday and tracked until thursday when they said that they had tried to deliver but they hadn_'_t so after several phone_calls to yodel they managed to phone their driver who was in next village so arranged to meet at coop to pick_up package ( never really wanted to be a courier ) his excuse was that his sat_nav sent him wrong .. any way product is good although it came without pick guard and amp was not slim one as ordered ( but not worried_about this ...) i would recommend this firm as i think courier was at fault ..
neutral	ordered last thursday , just too late to get dispatch that day , but was advised order had been dispatched friday - got tracking_information and everything .
neutral	tried to track today , but no information , so rang bdw only to be told that one of the products that i had ordered ( one they had specifically emailed me about to tell me it was back in stock ), had not come into stock until friday at 0 . 00 pm meaning that my order was not dispatched at all .
neutral	they had not contacted me to advise me of this delay , and would presumably have just let me arrive home tonight to find my dog without food .
neutral	i really am not impressed with this experience , and will almost certainly use a local supplier from now on .
neutral	revised rating following the apology from the company , and some compensation .
neutral	still feel there are aspects of this experience that could have easily been avoided .
neutral	i run regular speed tests on a bunch of services .
neutral	this one is much like all the others .
neutral	except when it takes time to load .
neutral	( like today .)
neutral	no better , no worse .
neutral	never rely_on a single source for this sort of data .
neutral	delivery address 00 sheepcot drive watford herts wd000dz email not going to you regards kathy
neutral	quick effiecent service and prices comparable at_least on the tem i bought .
neutral	kara bistro set .
neutral	i have started my exante diet today .
neutral	i have 0 weeks supply of the winter warmer pack which was very reasonably_priced .
neutral	i made up the porridge according to the pack instructions , and was surprised to find a hot milky drink with a few bits in !!
neutral	are there some special tips to make it thicker ( apart_from halving the water content !!!)
neutral	i would be grateful for any advice as i have 00 packs of porridge !!!
neutral	!
neutral	really pleased with the bars very filling .
neutral	the pasta carbonara is ok ..... gonna try & tweak the strong salty flavour & runny consistency & leave to stand / soak for longer to expand & soften the pasta .
neutral	this holiday was booked for 00 and at the last_minute 0 were unable to travel due to the death of my father ( grandfather for the other party member ) i was told no refund will be given and was very disapointed as this was not just someone not wanting to go .
neutral	it was essential non travel i am in the process of drafting a letter to head_office under the circumstances i would like to know if any kind of refund is available as £_000 is a lot of money to loose especially under these circumstances . other than this side i would consider_using travel_republic again but willwait to see how i get on with this matter
neutral	i had booked 0 flights with flybe through bravofly - then found these reviews !
neutral	my worst fears were confirmed when the 00kg hold luggage each , which i had paid extra for , showed on the flybe booking site as 00kg .
neutral	as we are cruising - we need big bags !
neutral	i experienced 0 really bad phone_calls to someone in india ( i think ) , who did not understand what i was complaining_about and left me on hold for ages before i hung_up .
neutral	i then contacted the contact on one of these posts - simona - who has sorted it , with no further charges .
neutral	( dont know what the phone bill will be though !!)
neutral	so far so good !
neutral	!
neutral	the iphone 0 is fantastic .
neutral	but phones0u added the wrong data bolt on to the package .
neutral	o0 sorted this out but i had no data connection for 0 days .
neutral	other than that i had no issues .
neutral	twice now animed_direct have dispatched my cats cystitis pills never received , the most_recent order being 0000000 .
neutral	this is not acceptable and the second time i have had to do another emergency order and then claim back the prepaid funds for the lost orders later . no point in free delivery if it never arrives !
neutral	!
neutral	the pc is great looking and from my son really good spec .
neutral	what i haven_'_t liked is the box it came in had no padding or protection for such an expensive item .
neutral	then a few_days_later my son set it up for me , but noticed the front usb socket was bent inwards presenting it to be used .
neutral	to save hassle of sending it back he has bent it into place .
neutral	now up and running we have now come to the disappointment of the windows we paid for being an online server ?
neutral	when we picked it we were under the impression it would be the normal windows .
neutral	but in saying this my son bought his computer through them 0years ago and was disappointed to find he had been sold a build windows disk and not the full pro pack that you get in the shop .
neutral	apart_from these the pc is great , just struggling to use it with this rubbish windows server os
neutral	unfortunately my purchase did not arrive .
neutral	i notified woolovers after 0 days ( surely it would have arrived by then ?)
neutral	but was advised to wait 00 days before contacting them again .
neutral	i just hope i can resolve this dispute .
neutral	perhaps all parcels should be " tracked " as m & s do on mail order deliveries ?
neutral	my previous purchases ( and there have been many !)
neutral	have arrived_safely and service excellent .
neutral	also subsequent large purchase arrived within a few_days but i am still_waiting for my pretty cardigan !
neutral	overall t mobile have offered a good reliable service , with good coverage over most of the uk , however they do seem prone to changing their price structure at the drop of a hat , and their contact number has also changed .
neutral	being a bit of an old fogie i prefer stability in my service providers .
neutral	overall they are good but could do better !
neutral	some very interesting offers , but their service , when you need to speak to someone is pretty poor .
neutral	got a message to say that the product was to be delivered on this particular day but the website it referred me to seemed to have lost the item or sent it somewhere_else .
neutral	whatever i decided not to stay in and sent e_- mails to both companies .
neutral	no one replied with what was happening - i only got an e_- mail ( basically the same one from the courier and the vendor ) at the beginning of the next_day saying that the part would be delivered that day .
neutral	unfortunately i was out all that day but fortunately returned 00_minutes before the item was delivered .
neutral	at the end of the day all was well and the product works_fine .
neutral	but it could have gone wrong spectacularly .
neutral	the reply below was well received .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	this experience won_'_t put me off as in most_cases described in these reviews everything_went well .
neutral	i assume i must just have been unlucky !
neutral	i ordered two items .
neutral	000 phoned the next_day to say that the wc was out of stock , would be delivered in a few_days .
neutral	that '_s exactly_what happened .
neutral	unfortunately the shower was not included .
neutral	i phoned to find out where it was .
neutral	a charming young_lady promised to find out and phone me , but didn_'_t .
neutral	i had to phone again , this time she did reply , the shower was not in stock .
neutral	would like to have known that at the start .
neutral	i needed to set_up the shower room , so asked her to email instructions .
neutral	yes she said , that will be fine .
neutral	no instructions , but finally , after three_weeks , the shower did arrive .
neutral	we booked well in advance to select a villa rather_than a specific country or region that would meet our diverse extended family needs and were disappointed that this villa and our second choice were both withdrawn over the following months having booked and paid a sizable deposit .
neutral	villa_plus staff helped_us select an_alternative villa on both_occasions and offered some compensation which we accepted .
neutral	that said bob parish at villa_plus was very helpful and overall the villa atalaya was more than adequate .
neutral	the pool and garden were good and safe for the kids with supervision .
neutral	the local rep and local staff were good too ( gardener , pool cleaner and villa cleaner ).
neutral	the jet_0 flights were very good and there was plenty to do and see in the surrounding area but a car is essential for getting around .
neutral	the local beach was disappointing .
neutral	there are some shops : butcher , baker and supermarket within walking_distance as well as a couple of bars and restaurants .
neutral	it all worked out in the end and the family holiday was judged a success by all .
neutral	i '_ve been a customer for over five years .
neutral	the prices are competitive , the web service is ok , the email service has improved to ok , but every now and then you get outages for up to several hours when you can '_t get to you email .
neutral	i agree with another_reviewer , watch for the auto - renewal , they love to capture your card_details and generate those invoices .
neutral	but also note that all prices are displayed excluding vat , which only appears on your emailled invoice .
neutral	printer was ordered at 00 : 00 on wednesday_morning , showed in stock and the money was taken straight_away so i hoped to get the stated " usually shipped same day if ordered before 00 : 00 " deal .
neutral	very disappointing that the shipment was not made until the following_monday_afternoon .
neutral	thankfully parcel_force did their bit and got it delivered next_day .
neutral	not my best experience and will not be top of my list next time .
neutral	this was my first order with boohoo . com it was free delivery ( with code ) and free returns .
neutral	i sent for 0 pairs of leggins in the sale at £ 0 . 00 a pair . the sizes were 00 / 00 and m / l to fit my daughter who is a size 00 , but only one pair was a perfect_fit and another pair fit ok .
neutral	the other three pairs she could not even get them past her knees .
neutral	don_'_t know if i would order from them again as you have to pay for delivery normally .
neutral	ordered a boquet specifically because it contained chrysanths and roses , but it contained mostly lilies , which are disliked by the recipient , who of course was politely grateful .
neutral	delivery was great and on time by a good guy .
neutral	we have used alpha_rooms for years and always an exellent service all the way , the people they used in turkey this year not good the atitude of the english female rep at dalaman airport was at best terrible the bus went without us and all the rep said was you only paid peanuts so i dont know whay your problem is if you have to wait in heat with no shelter or water for a couple of hrs tough we are quite capable people but what if that was someone old / infirm or with disabled children not what i expect from alpharooms
neutral	... if it were not for their payment_method being by cheque , the process is faultless but take a very long time from acceptance of goods through to authorisation of cheque to posting of the cheque and then the delay while cheque goes through the bank .
neutral	given ziffit and music_magpie can pay via bacs i see this as a weekness in the zapper propostition
neutral	now on second shipment where items i know were shipped are marked as not received , raise it with customer_services and the response is ' well the item ( s ) was not there '
neutral	very difficult to speak to anyone after purchase .
neutral	was charged for handset when it was supposed to be free still_waiting for refund .
neutral	edition 00 makes some bugs .
neutral	i booked a collection via parcelhero .
neutral	it was an international packet to usa .
neutral	i paid for an ' express ' service , with collection any time between 0000 /_0000_hrs .
neutral	i wasted an entire day , nine frustrating hours , sitting here , waiting for the courier ( fedex ) to collect .
neutral	at 0000_hrs , i tried to call parcelhero ’_s 0 . 0 pence per_minute 0000 revenue - share line .
neutral	it closes at 0000_hrs !
neutral	so , if a collection is not made , you can ’ t get hold of the company until the next_day !
neutral	what ’_s more is its ‘ live_chat ’ isn_'_t ' live ' after 0000_hrs .
neutral	it closes at the same early time as the phone lines !
neutral	you don_’ t even get connected with some clueless live messaging centre operator in the third world ; it is just an e . mail service after 0 , dressed up as live_chat .
neutral	what was i supposed to do ?
neutral	sit here for another 0 hours like a fool , listening for the door_bell ?
neutral	i wanted to know why but parcelhero ’_s customer service lines had closed .
neutral	i was absolutely seething :-(
neutral	update 00 sep 00 .
neutral	i have to commend parcelhero for its customer service .
neutral	i have received and made numerous phone_calls from / to its staff , including its md .
neutral	i have been assured by him that the reason the collection failed was because fedex failed to fully record and pass on to its staff my collection address .
neutral	the village name and last 0 characters of the post_code had been omitted .
neutral	there are a few roads in this postal area with the same name as mine .
neutral	as a result , the fedex driver had visited an identical address in an adjacent village .
neutral	however , i do still have some criticisms of the parcelhero service .
neutral	above , i describe its customer service lines , which close at the same time as its last collection time of 0000_hrs .
neutral	in addition , it was ironically ‘ fortunate ’ that my package containing 0 legal knives was not collected by fedex .
neutral	according to parcelhero staff , fedex does not carry knives and my parcel could have been impounded in uk by the authorities .
neutral	this would have caused me enormous stress and concern that 0 valuable items (£_000 gbp ) were impounded in uk , whilst the receiver in usa waited interminably and perhaps eventually would demand a refund .
neutral	i chose parcelhero to arrange carriage of these items since knives do not appear in its prohibited items list .
neutral	the parcelhero md advised me that he would ‘ look at ’ the parcelhero customer service closing time and in addition , consider including knives in its prohibited items list .
neutral	as a result , i am raising my score of parcelhero to 0 points .
neutral	last december we ordered springsteen tickets for the june 00st concert at the stadium of light , we chose 0 tickets @ £_00 . 00 add on booking and delivery fee plus_vat and the total charge came to £_000 . 00 fair_enough !
neutral	we were very happy with the online service from viagogo but when our tickets arrived they were clearly_marked at £_00 .
neutral	this is clearly a rip_off i have tried to ring the customer service number on the event information email , this number according to recorded_message no_longer exists .
neutral	i will be writing to viagogo in the hope of getting a refund of the price difference .
neutral	otherwise great .
neutral	good easy web_site to use , sometimes delivery seems to take longer_than you might expect .
neutral	packageing is a bit naff , seems to be get a box and stuff things in . when arrives all items seem like they have been through a tumble_dryer .
neutral	some great offers , wide_variety .
neutral	down_side delivery on the slow side , puts me off ordering again .
neutral	fine little outfit but be careful with stroppy staff , if you nod or say yes to everything they tell you you may be okay but don_'_t disagree with what they say , it '_ll cost you one way or another .
neutral	look out for the extra charges they hide in everything and be prepared to spend more than you save at the other end when faced with a long_journey to where you thought you were flying .
neutral	example weeze to essen , 00 euro taxi ride
neutral	great system but has a little problem listening to it '_s users
neutral	delivery and packing was about the same as other online grocers i '_ve tried , but unfortunately the food i received was lacking in freshness .
neutral	not sure if they just sent the stuff that was nearly out of date , but i '_ve never had a similar problem from other grocers .
neutral	i might have had a bad one - off , but we '_ve never been back !
neutral	the order came as promised but took a week to come .
neutral	other things i ordered on the same day arrived within 0 days .
neutral	have tried other search_engines but google is deffo the best imo !
neutral	!
neutral	downside .... google_chrome !
neutral	!
neutral	very fast & love the way it '_s set_up with saving footprints etc .. but it just will not function along with certain websites .
neutral	i have come_across a few_glitches but the main one has to be " paypal ".
neutral	upon doing some research over the internet i have found out that they have known about compatability issues with certain website '_s but have chose to ignore it for years , in some cases !!
neutral	!
neutral	that '_s just not cricket !!
neutral	!
neutral	absolutely superb website but has dropped its usual standards due to the following sellers :- zoverstocks = fantastic prices & when the orders are correct , 00_% of the time they are in excellent condition ..... but , they take far too long to dispatch items , which seem to be getting longer & longer .
neutral	out of the last handful of orders i would say 00_% of them have been wrong , missing discs , wrong films , not as advertised ect .. ect ... customer service is pretty quick to rectify but when you wait about 00 days for an item which is wrong , not worth the hassle !!
neutral	!.
neutral	indigostarfish . com ( an amazon preferred partner ).... absolutely_shocking delivery times !!
neutral	!..... no comms whatsoever , items take about 0 weeks then one item from order was was then put back upto another 0 weeks ( 0 weeks in total !!
neutral	).... which was subsequently_cancelled !
neutral	!... absolute joke !
neutral	!
neutral	there are some great sellers on there though and take my advice , avoid the above 0 and you won_'_t go too far wrong !!
neutral	!
neutral	picked_up car at milan airport ( having fully paid for everything ) and even with 0 people manning the desks , i had to wait a full 00_minutes before i walked out of the office .
neutral	not sure why everything needed to be so slow ( about 00_mins per person on average at the desk ) when everybody had already entered all their details when booking on - line .
neutral	car was fine though and good value , by booking early .
neutral	return at pisa airport was quick and painless .
neutral	informed car pick_up point was at florence railway station .
neutral	spent several hours walking round trying to find them .
neutral	eventually rang the company to be told it was a good half / three quarters of a mile away which we had to negotiate with heavy cases and inadequate directions .
neutral	when we finally arrived they presented us with a budget car .
neutral	we had paid extra for a bigger car because there were 0 of us and 0 cases to go in the boot .
neutral	the car provided only held two .
neutral	when we complained we were informed that was all they had .
neutral	after remonstrating they did eventually provide us with a bigger car from another garage - however we had to wait a further hour for them to deliver it .
neutral	however everything else , once we had the car , went_smoothly and handover at other end was very easy and swift ( once we had managed to find an open petrol_station on a sunday to fill the car !).
neutral	we chose a different drop_off point from pick_up point and this option proved to be quite pricey for the privilege .
neutral	ebay are an aggrovating company who move too late and do too little to stop all the scams and fraud .
neutral	you have to be certain you are buying from a seller that is trustworthy .
neutral	my rule is that if the seller has less_than % 00 . 0 in their seller ratings then go_elsewhere .
neutral	this means it '_s time_consuming and whenever you spend more than £_00 or so you have to wonder whether you made the right choice of seller .
neutral	in disputes ebay usually believe the seller rather_than the buyer as it costs more to get the money off the seller and risk losing them than it does to tell the buyer to clear off .
neutral	i still use ebay , dont get me wrong its great if you cant get something from a decent website .
neutral	buying from ebay is like buying a hifi from a flea market .
neutral	you dont know_whats in the box till you pay up and open it .
neutral	it wouldnt be so bad that they are overpriced if they actually didnt , each week , make me have to go to customer service desk complaining that what i bought as buy one get one free is actually not shown as that on the reciept .
neutral	their prices are increasing disproportionately to income and even to cost price .
neutral	politicians blame the banks for this economic depression but i can_assure you that the board room at sainsburys and their cronies at [_external_reference_] etc_etc_etc are solely responsible for the majority of the excessive inflation rates .
neutral	their greed is beyond_belief
neutral	before i get onto a review of the site , i want to say something about the local maplin shop i use .
neutral	the manager at the local maplin is unknowledgable and rude .
neutral	on several occassions i have found it necessary to return goods which were unfit for purpose .
neutral	notably a card_reader with a bent pin , and a wireless networking card that refused to automatically connect via dhcp .
neutral	on both these occassions i had my money returned to me , but not before the manager had passed some comment to the effect that it was my fault .
neutral	i take exception to such accusations and infact in the case of the wireless card i even found it highly amusing that he thought i must be one of the people who havent a clue how to set_up a computer ( i run several networks for various people as my vocation in life is a network engineer ) he demonstrated his complete misunderstanding of how networks operate and what all the letters such as n & g mean and how to use them .
neutral	now onto the website .
neutral	i am frequently told that what shows as in stock on the website is incorrect at the store .
neutral	my local_store hardly has anything i need , and even when they do its overpriced .
neutral	the site itself is substandard and shows results for totally random items .
neutral	fo example i searched for key switch and for some totally bizzare reason i was shown a few key switches and various toy planes etc_etc_etc
neutral	this company really must try a lot harder because they are rapidly sliding down the pan .
neutral	get some staff who actually know wth they are talking_about and get some new web designers the ones you employ are rubbish
neutral	i find preloved easy to use , with a nice format .
neutral	but take care !
neutral	i bought a campervan from a regular user a dealer on preloved , and it was not as_described , quite the opposite .
neutral	the mot was not worth the paper it was on , and vosa failed the van on over 00 major points .
neutral	the guarantee was invalid and i was expected to pay a massively inflated amount for this warranty which would not have been valid if i had tried to use it due to a number of reasons .
neutral	the habitation check was not produced as promised .
neutral	it took me months to eventually take the dealer to court .
neutral	i won , but he still tried to wangle out of payment .
neutral	i got all my money back , and he narrowly escaped a judgement .
neutral	but i cannot warn anybody that these campervans could be dangerous in more than one way .
neutral	what would have killed me first the carbon monoxide or the failing brakes ?
neutral	of course he will sell the van again and uses dodgy practices to sell these vans .
neutral	i don_'_t have any way of feeding back my negative experience about this dealer on the preloved site .
neutral	i bought a twin_pack of ballycastle hot toddy from my local aldi and discovered that the ingredients are described as " a warming sweet hot toddy blended with smooth triple distilled irish whiskey infused with lemon and spice flavours ".
neutral	however as there is no list of ingredients i phoned aldi to ask whether there is added sugar or honey .
neutral	( this is pretty important if you ' re diabetic !).
neutral	the customer adviser clearly thought this was a highly amusing question and informed me between giggles that she had no_idea !
neutral	after putting my call on hold for a long time , she then said there was nobody available to provide the information .
neutral	she took my number and promised that someone would call me on monday .
neutral	i shall await the call with interest , but i do feel that the ingredients should be listed on the product in the first place .
neutral	my friends and i bought tickets for rod on 0 june at men .
neutral	the seats , as promised , were fantastic , block b , row j - 0 rows from the stage .
neutral	however , when the tickets arrived we were not seated together as one of the tickets had been sent to someone_else and we had theirs .
neutral	double0tickets sent us a text advising that we should go to the seats originally allocated in row j .
neutral	the officials at the arena would not allow this , indicating that double0tickets do not have the authority to make that statement .
neutral	we managed to sort it out in the end ourselves .
neutral	the biggest disappointment was that the face_value of the tickets was £_00 and we paid almost three_times that much for each ticket .
neutral	people we spoke to sitting in our row and around us paid £_00 .
neutral	it pays to shop around !
neutral	despite this the concert was brilliant .
neutral	excellent start , good site and booking was done nice and fast .
neutral	once @ dubai airport we received a terrible car , old , full off scratches and not in line with what we expected .
neutral	after we complained we got " an upgrade " which meant , same car other color .
neutral	what do you do ?
neutral	we accepted the car , tired , and left to drive to the hotel .. by the way with an empty gas tank so we had to drive thru half dubai to find a gas station ... bad start thx to dollar rent a car !!!
neutral	!
neutral	ordered a new cooker , on line , on a sunday_afternoon .
neutral	i was surprised to see that the following_day , monday , was an option for delivery .
neutral	as our existing cooker was not working i was more than happy to have it delivered next_day .
neutral	on the monday i phoned to check the delivery time .
neutral	i was told that owing to a technical issue it was not going to be delivered that day .
neutral	we agreed another day and told that we would need to phone the day before to get a time window for delivery .
neutral	we made the call and where told between 00 . 00 am and 0 . 00pm , with the driver calling half an_hour before delivery .
neutral	at 0pm we hadn_'_t heard from the driver so i called fires - cookers .
neutral	i was told the times we were given were only an estimate .
neutral	the driver did call and arrived about 0 . 00 pm , better late than never .
neutral	delivery was excellent .
neutral	ordered late on monday and delivered before 0am on the wednesday .
neutral	box was a little damaged due the weight , 00kg , manufacturer needs to invest in stronger boxes as parts could easily have rolled around in the delivery van .
neutral	we were lucky , all parts were there .
neutral	i left my 00 , 00 and 00 year_old to assemble the frame and then my husband had to take over because parts kept falling down .
neutral	it didn_'_t take long to assemble the 00ft trampolin the main problem was keeping the legs up .
neutral	there are 0 poles that slot in but there are no screws which i was amazed at .
neutral	it means that unless the trampoline is on 000_% flat ground at_least one of the poles lifts on the bounce of the trampoline and there is a real danger it could collapse .
neutral	also makes it almost_impossible to move for mowing the grass .
neutral	screws in the legs would have made the whole_thing much sturdier and i had known this i would have paid more for something that has solid legs .
neutral	saying that we '_ve had it a week , had 0 fourteen year olds on it and there have been zero problems and the price was much_cheaper_than the competiton .
neutral	the same size trampoline could easily have cost £_000 more on some websites .
neutral	so pleased with the product , children delighted but just wish i was happier with the legs and being_able to move the trampoline for mowing the grass without a real danger of it collapsing .
neutral	well i spent some time getting prices for my items and packing them up .
neutral	i chose a delivery slot and indeed music_magpie were good enough to sent reminders about my collection date .
neutral	and so on the agreed date i waited ... and waited ... and waited ... for over 00_hours but no courier , no communication , absolutely zilch .
neutral	i have better things to do than wait around all day for a ' no show '.
neutral	i '_ve since attempted to get a re - scheduled collection date and hopefully things will go well but my first impression of music_magpie isn_'_t very good .
neutral	if my stuff is collected i will gladly post positive_feedback .
neutral	the courier arrived the following_day - 00_hours late !
neutral	as luck would have it i was at home and my parcel was collected without_any problem .
neutral	i have updated the review to three stars .
neutral	i really do like boden '_s clothing for men - it '_s well made and stylish to boot .
neutral	but almost every time i go on the website looking for stuff , it '_s out of stock !
neutral	if i stick to making a purchase i usually have weeks to wait for delivery .
neutral	so , often as not , i amble down the high streets instead , and get decent stuff right away .
neutral	i ' d buy a lot more from boden if they kept their stock up a good deal more .
neutral	the print quality of the photos was fine but the size was smaller than the one i ' d asked for .
neutral	i found the software a little troublesome , with it crashing on me twice .
neutral	i was uploading 00 photos when it got stuck when i was about 00 in causing me to start all over again , searching for them from numerous different folders - so that was annoying .
neutral	we have had a few problems with deliveries with interparcel but have to say it '_s not interparcel them self '_s but one of the company '_s they used which was yodel out of 00 bikes delivered one was damaged badly one has_been lost altogether and about 0 of the cartons was damaged when our customs received them .
neutral	i have noticed that yodel are no_longer an option with interparcel so it seems that they must of had a lot of complaints for interparcel not to be using them any more which is a good thing .
neutral	i now use city_link through interparcel and am getting a better service and the driver that collects form me is very good and takes care with the parcels and i have had no_complaints from my customers with the condition they arrive in
neutral	00p for postage when i print it out myself ?
neutral	easy to use and understand but surely your costs are included in the ticket handling_fee to chrage postage on top is a bit annoying .
neutral	ali went very well until we got back and found that the rear number_plate to the car had come off ( somehow ??)
neutral	could not be sure of some slight scratches to the rear bumper and when asked why they hadn_'_t re fitted the number_plate got no reply ???
neutral	the only attendant left the car_park in the mini_bus .???
neutral	still none the wiser as to how it happened or why it was not replaced .......
neutral	oh_yeah , the head rest on my seat ( was raised up very high ?)
neutral	wonder_if the person parking it was really tall and had a bit of a sleep in it ??
neutral	? too many strange goings on for me .
neutral	would recomend that you take your milage reading and ensure that the car is inspected thoroughly before you leave it .
neutral	it could all be coincidence , but lesson_learned for me
neutral	not sure if my prescription was incorrect or if the glasses are incorrect or maybe i need trifocals !
neutral	- but my new bifocals while ok for reading up very close are too strong for me to read my laptop screen or car speedometer - which is really frustrating .
neutral	flowers arrived on the correct day as promised , however , i was really disappointed to find that the deluxe moonlight bouquet was little better_than you see on a garage forecourt but at three or four times the price .
neutral	i will not use this service again and cannot recommend them
neutral	shipping is way too high .
neutral	the item took a long time to be delivered despite saying on the website it would be delivered within 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i had to phone the company 0 or 0 times before i was informed when the despatch date would be .
neutral	i must_say i would like a bit more flavour ...
neutral	i love licorice and it '_s become my fave , but it is a bit .... erm .... insipid ... still i am still off the fags !
neutral	the thing wit liberty_flights is speed ... they are so quick and don_'_t charge too much for postage ... i likt the xo supreme too , it give good hit and a nicotine supply whilst tasting good .
neutral	best of all their e_- liquids do n ot have that horrible unnatural taste that some have .
neutral	that '_s why i get all my stuff from them
neutral	i was disappointed that it took them a week to email me to say they had now processed my order and it was ready for collection from the courier .
neutral	not sure why it took so long .
neutral	this means from day of ordering to delivery took 0 days which i think is too slow .
neutral	eye_test pretty painless .
neutral	glasses 0 for 0 .
neutral	prices pretty good , but they will not repair broken arms , so at home several pairs of nearly new glasses with arms missing
neutral	go in for 0 tyre , your car needs 0 . had mine mot / serviced , passed ok .
neutral	but told timing belt was due for change , cost £_000 , went to vauxhall because recall on horn , asked about timing belt change , wasnt due for another 0 years , phew saved a few bob there , when you are waiting for car fitters always seem to be on phones telling customers that their cars need something renewing
neutral	when you buy happy meal they will not serve coffee as your drink
neutral	ordered on the phone .
neutral	staff were friendly , well informed & helpful .
neutral	promised same day dispatch , next_day delivery & emails_keeping me upto_date .
neutral	no emails - so i called .
neutral	phone is out of stock .
neutral	will be 0 to 0 working_days before dispatch .
neutral	they really need to make_sure they have stock when you place the order .
neutral	( but they do answer the phone quickly , & are friendly )
neutral	i ordered a canon ixus 000 camera and was able to track its delivery until i received it fairly quickly .
neutral	however it was a powershot sd 000 which was sent , which is the us version of the same camera , complete with us battery_charger .
neutral	on hunting through the small_print on bitesizedeals website it states that they may substitute another countries version of the product you order .
neutral	canon uk customer_services state that the warranty of the powershot i was sent is invalid outside the us and that leaves me relying on the warranty service offered by bitesizedeals themselves .
neutral	i also am left having to buy a uk battery_charger to be able to use the camera .
neutral	bitesizedeals customer_services have not yet got back to me about my complaint .
neutral	if i ' d seen this review website before i would have shopped elsewhere !
neutral	don_'_t go_anywhere_near oak_furnitureland their customer_services are rude unhelpful and uncaring .
neutral	i have never had such bad service anywhere in my whole 00 years of life .
neutral	i am so disappointed with them !
neutral	i just thank_god i never bought the bedroom_furniture to go with my sitting room furniture that turned_up damaged .
neutral	at last they have been back in touch and this time the customer_services were excellent thanks kevin maguire hope i spelt his name right faith restored !
neutral	!!
neutral	hence the new rating 0_stars :)
neutral	product ( 0 pine broom handles ) was ok if a bit roughly finished ; one was not straight but will do for the application for which they were purchased .
neutral	delivery by city_link was prompt but to the wrong house .
neutral	they delivered to my next door neighbour , saying there was no - one in at my address .
neutral	i was in all day along with a crew of builders , so i don_'_t know which door the driver went to .
neutral	the variofocals and fit are not as good as last time i ordered them .
neutral	the prescription was the same as was everything else but this time they are not as good or as comfortable .
neutral	no_problems with the delivery .
neutral	currently have personal 00 phone , which drops the 0g signal and makes it difficult to surf on the move .
neutral	work location has poor reception so personal mobile is pointless during most of the working week
neutral	i bought the ipod shiffle to use in the gym as it was small and compact with easy controls .
neutral	there is a problem with the headphone control button which has failed on two headphones now .
neutral	i had one pair replaced within the warranty_period , but they lasted 0 months .
neutral	this was a known issue and should have been rectified by apple , but customers have to prove the goods are within warranty , despite having recorded the serial_number with apple .
neutral	given that people using this service are usually stressed to get to a plane on time or knackered from a long_journey home , the drivers and staff on the phone could be more precise .
neutral	we phoned 00_minutes away and were told to go to the car_park .
neutral	we did and we waited for 00_minutes which at 0am is a long time , only to have to phone them again to find that the driver had been waiting on chairs facing away from the cars .
neutral	whilst not a big deal it was annoying .
neutral	we fly standby a lot , so we arrive very early for a good reason .
neutral	coming_back we found we had to pay the parking ( not had that before ) and we didn_'_t know and had no english money to hand , so we had to unpack a case by the barrier to find some coins .
neutral	we were not happy about this ... just telling us would have been helpful .
neutral	doesn_'_t mean we won_'_t use it again but prefer the [_external_reference_] people although they don_'_t use the car_parks .
neutral	computer is great - good price , decent spec for less_than pc_world , working well after a month of use
neutral	but
neutral	it arrrived broken , processor moved in transit
neutral	it got sent back - eventually - took days to get this arranged
neutral	another arrived , again it took far too long
neutral	and it arrived broken again
neutral	this time , a support guy talked me through resiting the processor which was a new skill for me - amazingly it worked .
neutral	then i discovered that all my calls re problems , returns and resiting cost quite a lot - which was annoying given it was not my fault .
neutral	support guys were very pleasant and competent but the return and repair process is not too efficient .
neutral	however i would use them again .
neutral	i had previously bought from frost a can of gasket remover , which had been delivered .
neutral	this fresh order , the ultrasonic cleaner and cleaning fluid was ordered but for some reason which i can not fathom i was sent , and charged for , another can of gasket remover .
neutral	admittedly , i had not read the confirmation_email which included this but it was not welcome .
neutral	the u / s cleaner works well .
neutral	i '_ve used printerinks many_times before , but unfortunately they took so long to dispatch my cartridges this time that i will shop around next time .
neutral	cannot see how you can justify charging £_00 for us paying by credit_card , when other holiday companies do not charge anything . the banks dont charge us , so were does your cost come from ?
neutral	other than that holiday is a fair price
neutral	i ordered a well_known manufacturers barbel rod from tackleuk on the 00nd of july this year , according to the website it was in stock .
neutral	however i had a phone_call the next_day telling_me it was out of stock , but a delivery was expected before the end of the month .
neutral	i said to put it on back order .
neutral	as i was going away for two_weeks holiday i was not too concerned about the delay .
neutral	on my return from holiday , still no rod .
neutral	correspondance with tackle_uk continued through their website and i was told on several_occasions that they were expecting delivery at the end of whichever week it was that i contacted them .
neutral	i was on the point of cancelling the order when the order tracking changed from holding to pending on the 0th of september so i hung on a little longer .
neutral	the rod was eventually despatched on the 00th of september and i recieved it the next_day , by next_day delivery at tackleuk '_s expense .
neutral	( i had only requested standard delivery ) i am giving tackleuk the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they were going on information from the manufacturer and that the the delays and missinformation originated with the manufacturer , although i do not know that for a fact and may be being unfair to the manufacturer .
neutral	they did , in the end get my rod to me as quickly as possible , at their expense .
neutral	would i use them again ?
neutral	probably yes .
neutral	have used this transfer service twice once in may which was brilliant on both journeys ( to and from airport ) and just recently in august .
neutral	our return to airport was brilliant but our pick_up from airport to resort did not show and another service took over the booking after ringing the number of the firm and getting clearance .
neutral	wish they had kept me posted on the despatch / delivery .
neutral	i had to keep chasing and eventually i contacted their delivery company myself - frustrating !
neutral	!
neutral	bought a hotpoint washer / drier .
neutral	installed by a monkey .
neutral	went into meltdown after a month .
neutral	phoned currys to complain .
neutral	within 00_minutes an engineer was on the door_step .
neutral	thank_you hotpoint for the most remarkable service .
neutral	currys , you need to improve .
neutral	well on arrival to destination waited for 0 / 0 hour for pick_up . the fiteen minute journey we were told took nearly 0 / 0 hour . on return arrived at pick_up point for time they asked . bus was 00_minutes late . driver missed one client and had to do a return to pick_up point . from there almost at airport when driver apologised and returned to resort and did a further 0 or 0 pick_up before eventually heading bak to airport . as you can imagine was not very pleased . may think again about using resort_hoppa .
neutral	i ordered flowers to arrive in england when i was visiting my parents for my stepmother '_s birthday .
neutral	i ordered them for the day before her_birthday as we were going to france on her_birthday for lunch .
neutral	well they arrived the day of her_birthday and had to be taken in by a neighbour .
neutral	quality was reasonable considering the extreme snow etc .
neutral	i . e .
neutral	the roses showed some deterioration , browning on petals .
neutral	i purchased a pair of adidas golf_shoes , had them on about 0 times , due to our lovely weather , had the chance to go back out and play the game i love to find out that the right shoe was letting in water , phoned littlewoods explained the situation , they were so nice on the phone , told me to return them and they would credit my account with the £_000 that they cost .
neutral	a few_weeks_later the shoes were returned to me , no letter stating why , i had to phone littlewoods again , i was told that i had to proof there was a fault within the shoe myself and that i had to get in touch with adidas , now the way i see it is that i purchased the shoe from littlewoods and it should have been up them to find the fault , according to the sales of goods_act , this should have been the case .
neutral	i have always been happy shopping with littlewoods but was left very disappointed with the way i was treated .
neutral	i have to say that i am a very regular customer of amazon - most weeks i buy something and i always go there first .
neutral	on the whole , they tend to be the cheapest , although they ' re not always the fastest and their packaging does leave a lot to be desired .
neutral	my last purchase really annoyed me however .
neutral	i bought a game for my grandson - it had lots of little bits that had to be pushed out and put_together before playing it , so imagine my disappointment and shock when i opened the box and it had all been done - clearly second_hand but i hadn_'_t paid a second_hand price .
neutral	i find this entirely unacceptable and think somebody had probably ordered and returned it , but nobody bothered to check the returned goods .
neutral	that '_s my guess anyway .
neutral	in any case , it has made me rethink my constant use of them .
neutral	i didn_'_t bother to return the game and just kept it , how many other people are like me and can '_t be bothered to complain ?
neutral	i think i will look_elsewhere for products now and not just keep going there blindly .
neutral	in addition , the bad_press about not paying taxes has made me uncomfortable with them anyway .
neutral	why should i pay tax and they don_'_t ?
neutral	so i '_ll be buying a lot less in the future from them .
neutral	good product , will order more , came next da .
neutral	still_waiting for my order
neutral	on 00 april i ordered a variety of items from bigdug , namely some divided galvanised shelving , a longspan bench , a hazardous waste cabinet , a draper tool cabinet and a bolted steel workbench .
neutral	the ordering_process was fine , although i found the website a little_confusing as they have so many items at so many different prices , with similar descriptions that it is difficult to decide , from the limited information available , what is best suited to your requirements and your price range .
neutral	anyway , i spoke to " nicola " in customer_services who assisted me with placing my order and who was very friendly and helpful .
neutral	she offered to throw in a free gift - more of that later .
neutral	the hazardous waste cabinet , the shelving and the longspan bench arrived very quickly indeed .
neutral	only one delivery man , and very heavy goods , so it was just as well there were three of us at home to unload the lorry .
neutral	the pallet holding the bench and shelving would have required an industrial fork lift truck to unload , so we had to cut all the packaging off and unload it piece by piece .
neutral	two slight problems , though , no assembly_instructions for the bench , and the instructions for the galvanised shelving was for ordinary galvanised shelving not the divided shelving .
neutral	a call to customer_services ( incredibly helpful and friendly again ) pointed me in the direction of their website from where you can download all their instructions .
neutral	well , apart_from longspan benches and divided galvanised shelving , it turns_out .
neutral	more calls to customer_services .
neutral	the longspan bench is a new item , and there are as yet no assembly_instructions for it ; but i was sent instructions for bulk longspan racking , which was close enough .
neutral	the divisions in the galvanised shelving i could work out myself without too much difficulty .
neutral	one word of warning , though : i ordered a starter bay with a width of 0000mm and an extension bay of 0000mm , naively assuming that the total width would be 0000mm .
neutral	it isn_'_t , it is 0000mm which meant i had to spend a couple of hours relocating an electrical wall socket , and making good .
neutral	the draper tool cabinet also arrived very quickly , but the bolted workbench did not .
neutral	the website quoted a delivery time of 0 - 00 days when i ordered it , and as i write ( 00 days_later ) it has still not arrived .
neutral	i have been in regular contact with customer_services , who are very responsive , but they say this item is coming direct from their manufacturer , is made to order and the earliest they are likely to deliver is monday 00th_may , three and a half weeks after i placed the order .
neutral	i am hoping that they might just manage to bring this forward to friday , but am not holding my breath .
neutral	one rather odd experience during this whole_process : the free gift i referred to above was a set of 00 small storage_boxes .
neutral	these arrived with the first delivery of shelving and the hazardous wasterage boxes .
neutral	these arrived with the first delivery of shelving and the hazardous waste cabinet .
neutral	i was slightly taken_aback , though , to come home one evening and find a further 0 , 000 small storage_boxes packed onto a large pallet and left on my drive .
neutral	i e_- mailed customer_services who told me it was an " administrative error " and they would arrange for the pallet to be collected , which they did very quickly .
neutral	very impressed so far with the quality of the items i have ordered , i would love to see what my bolted steel workbench looks_like .
neutral	we ordered an electric_guitar and all stuff needed .
neutral	i had a question , so during ordering i tried to phone them .
neutral	phonenumber did not work from of the netherlands .
neutral	so i sent them an e_- mail to ask them their telephonenumber .
neutral	they have not replied untill today .
neutral	ordering_process : it is promised that you can fill in a delivery adress , different from the invoice address .
neutral	that did not work .
neutral	so , after you have ordered and you have paid , you find out that you are not able to fill in another delivery address .
neutral	working with computers and programs the whole day , we managed to change the deliveryaddress during the processing of the order .
neutral	the package arrived at the promised day .
neutral	that '_s good .
neutral	but what a bad carton they had used !
neutral	i have considered to refuge the delivery .
neutral	damage around all over the box .
neutral	our son would not have been happy ...
neutral	i decided to accept the package .
neutral	products : amp / guitar connection makes a lot of noise .
neutral	cheaper_than_expected .
neutral	will we recommend gear0music ?
neutral	mwahhhh .
neutral	marcel blom
neutral	update_: connection cable between guitar and amp was damaged .
neutral	matthew kirk wrote us that we would receive a new one .
neutral	which they have sent immediately .
neutral	which we received very swift .
neutral	positive_note : it was a better quality than the original supplied one , so there was much less noise and rumble at the amp .
neutral	small issue : they managed to mix partsof the invoice address and the delivery address .
neutral	lucky us that it arrived anyway ...
neutral	here is my letter to hammonds sent 0 weeks_ago - still no reply or even acknowledgement , also no allen key which was apparently posted 0 weeks_ago as the senior fitter refused to give it to me !!
neutral	!
neutral	we write to complain regarding the above order of bedroom_furniture taken by your designer , john fox on 00th_january .
neutral	a surveyor ( lee ) checked the order and measurements on 00th_january and installation was booked for 00th and 00th_february_0000 .
neutral	we expressed concern at the short_notice and were advised that hammonds required seven_days ’ notice of cancellation .
neutral	despite the shortage of time to decorate the room in readiness for the installation , we complied and were ready for the fitter , lee falconer to commence work when he arrived at 0am .
neutral	on wednesday 00th , i overheard lee contact his manager as he was concerned straightaway about the position of the main light switch , something which was raised with the surveyor as i was worried that john fox had not taken this into_consideration in his design .
neutral	the manager told lee the company would pay for electrical works to move the switch , however , lee managed to get around this although the wardrobe doors overlap more than they should .
neutral	we would not have wanted the switch moved as this would have ruined the decorating already undertaken .
neutral	lee also advised me that the internal brackets had not been delivered but should arrive the following_day – at no time were we advised of this in advance by hammonds .
neutral	furthermore the internal floor panels promised by the designer had not been ordered .
neutral	at around 0pm that day it transpired that the internal brackets would not arrive the following_day and since customer service closed at 0pm i was unable to ascertain when the delivery would be made .
neutral	by this time it was too late to contact my husband who had the thursday booked as leave , a complete_waste of a day ’_s holiday .
neutral	lee could not complete the works as booked and was most apologetic – i completed his paperwork accordingly before he departed .
neutral	despite my request for hammonds to contact me first thing thursday_morning with an explanation of what was happening , i was not contacted until late morning only to be told that the bedroom_furniture could not be completed until the following thursday ( 00th ).
neutral	i have therefore had to take additional leave .
neutral	to cap it all , i received a text on monday 00th stating that hammonds would be delivering the furniture on tuesday 00th before 00am .
neutral	i telephoned customer_services at 0 . 00 to rearrange as this was inconvenient but never received the promised call back and had to telephone yet again at 0 . 00 to find out what was going on !
neutral	i was told that the order would be delivered to a fitter who would in turn deliver it to our fitter who was due come on thursday 00th – only for a box of parts to be delivered to me on wednesday 00th .
neutral	i was then told that a senior fitter , wally , had been booked for thursday 00th who would handle the remaining fitting and ensure i was completely_satisfied with the furniture .
neutral	despite_being ready to receive wally at 0am , he had not arrived by 0 . 00am .
positive	on the day of delivery i was emailed and text a one hour delivery time_slot which was accurate !
positive	if only all online purchases were so straight_forward and user_friendly , thank_you !

positive	after experiences of john_lewis ( nice stores but difficult to try anything out and very limited for real hifi separates ) and richer_sounds ( the less said the better ), i was very pleasantly_surprised to find that the old_fashioned approach of courtesy , helpfulness and expert friendly advice could still be found in the high tech age !

positive	brilliant .
positive	thank_you .

positive	the fact that there are so many small pieces to put_together to make each part of the building makes it a blind task unless you have previously erected one and would therefore be aware of pitfalls encountered .

positive	we had been into several travel agencies and felt pressurised but on speaking to the advisor tina at very cheap holidays she made us feel comfortable from start to finish .
positive	we knew where we wanted to go and she gave us her advice and of course fantastic price and on no occasion were we pressurised to use the company or bombarded with telephone_calls which is what we had with other_companies .
positive	she advised the hotel it was our_honeymoon and also my husbands_00th_birthday and we had a bottle of champagne chilling in our room when we arrived .
positive	we were also thankful of her suggestion of the extra baggage_allowance and felt quite smug watching everyone_else panicking with their lowly 00kg .

positive	frank galloway of galloway consultancy services ltd is a highly experienced auditor of business systems who helped_me get to grips with the chaotic systems i was working with even_though i wasn_'_t aiming for accreditation at this time .

positive	recommended .
positive	as part of my kitchen refurb last_year , i put new cupboard doors on the old units from hh '_s parent company jmt trade ltd .
positive	i was originally going to reuse the old handles , but after a little bit of umming and aahing from the other half , i decided to have a look online for the replacements .
positive	i hadn_'_t gone into household handles premises because i just assumed they would be dear .
positive	not so .
positive	when i did find them online , almost accidentally , they were cheaper or similar price as the other_suppliers .
positive	because i had already chatted to them about the doors for ages before i made a decision , i knew they were trustworthy .
positive	so i had no_hesitation in buying once i had seen their prices .
positive	even the part number sticks in my head ... ftd000 traditional pattern knob - i ended_up with 00 of the little tinkers and very happy i was too .

positive	your service is excellent , your products are excellent and your staff the very best !
positive	i '_ve tried a number of sites but this is head and shoulders_above the rest for ease of use .
positive	their early bird system is well_worth upgrading to as you do get the opportunity of first viewings and refusal .
positive	i '_ve found that by the time accommodation becomes free for all to contact , the best ones are already gone .
positive	used for first time today .
positive	will_definitely_use again and recommend to others .
positive	ditto comments about service , convenience and value .
positive	thank_you
positive	brilliant news for sports car buffs , brilliant threads and opportunities to find out about whatever you need to and a real sense of community .
positive	it '_s a great forum for keeping in contact and getting technical_support , blowing off or having a serious debate .
positive	downsides - only one really - a rather incestuous relationship with petrolhead nirvana .
positive	there are other tour companies out there , but the amount of free publicity they get on pistonheads must be worth many tens of thousands of pounds !
positive	when i needed a same day service xerox said they ' d try and do it and never rang me back - fuss 0 had an answer within the hour - how good is that ?
positive	lovely soft towels and very quick delivery - whats not to like ?

positive	have been very very impressed with diy kitchens .
positive	okay , so you need to know what to order ( including end panels , plinth , cornice , handles ), but ordering is pretty straightforward and it is well_worth making the effort as the prices are amazing .
positive	things i have really liked about diy kitchens :-
positive	- massive_range of unit sizes / styles , allowing you to create a truly bespoke looking kitchen
positive	- good quality units .
positive	was a little_nervous_about how good the quality would be , but even our carpenters who fitted the kitchen were impressed !
positive	- ready built units .
positive	saved loads of time at installation
positive	- colours .
positive	we went for a painted kitchen , and could pick any farrow & ball colour
positive	- unit ' options '.
positive	you can ask for units to be dry assembled , and have screw in feet , allowing you to adapt units easily .
positive	we have used base unit on a base unit to create mid height oven housings , and done the same to create some extra high storage areas .
positive	- massive selection of ' finishing touches ' - pop up power points , intergrated bins , magic corner units etc_etc
positive	- tea & biscuits with the order - carpenters were very happy .
positive	- sorting_out post delivery problems .
positive	we had a couple of doors missing .
positive	these took about 00 days to come , but we were kept_informed and they were very helpful !
positive	if i could change anything about their service ( and i ' m getting petty now )
positive	- would be great to get sample painted boards for the bespoke painted kitchens ( we chose colours from test patches painted in the wall )
positive	- delivery notes that are easier to check off against the order ( need to ensure everything is okay within 00_hours ).
positive	other things to consider if you order from diy kitchens :-
positive	- don_'_t underestimate the space you will need when the cabinets arrive !
positive	- be sure of what you need before you order !
positive	- get yourself a good fitter ( who can often advise on what you will need in terms of panels / cornices before you order )
positive	- measure carefully and check how units fit ( i . e .
positive	does it fit flush against the wall ?)
positive	you can phone diy kitchens for this information .
positive	i am a very happy customer and would heartily_recommend diy kitchens .
positive	wow , posted my phones on saturday_morning , money in my bank_account by monday lunch_time .
positive	well impressed and received a fair price !

positive	great delivery service - pay for next_day and not only do you get what you pay for , you get tracking_information too .
positive	as for their products , i am a repeat customer several_times over , and being a fussy so and so ( polite or what ?!
positive	), that '_s high praise indeed .
positive	if their goods and services were rubbish , they would have been binned a long time ago .
positive	if you ' re looking for chocolate products , especially for cake decorating , don_'_t go_anywhere_else .
positive	their cigarello '_s come with very few breakages and they are the best tasting too .
positive	i love pet_supermarket .
positive	as the elderly mum of two 0 month old indoor kittens , i couldn_'_t do without their support .
positive	we use the worlds best cat_litter ( which is by the way !)
positive	and buy the huge and heavy 00kilo sack every 0 weeks .
positive	at my age there is no way i could carry that home from the supermarket , even if i could find somewhere locally that sells it .
positive	when the soft food and iams kitten biscuits are on offer and cheaper_than my local supermarket , which is very i buy them on line as well .
positive	as shipping is so quick and reliable i don_'_t have to stockpile litter and food in the house , i just order 0 days before i need it .

positive	and they always have the best value .
positive	i thought they would be expensive but found them to beat just about everybody_else on price

positive	i '_ve known for ages that i could speed up my old faithful but sluggish laptop by increasing its memory , but i was worried that it would go_wrong if i tried to do it myself .
positive	well finally , i plucked up the courage and found mr_memory '_s website ( among others ).
positive	the scan feature was brilliant and recommended exactly the items i needed .
positive	the price was competitive , so i went_ahead with the order .
positive	i was then pleasantly_surprised to find that i could choose free first_class postage .
positive	but i was feeling quite excited about giving my laptop a boost , so i chose express despatch ( only 00p !
positive	).
positive	so , having first clicked onto the mr_memory website at about 0 . 00pm on a friday , i managed to find what i needed , do couple of price comparisons , check the installation process , eat some lunch and place my order within the hour - the memory arrived with the post about 00 on saturday and was installed and working_perfectly by midday .
positive	quick , painless and a massive boost to my laptop !!
positive	thanks mr_memory !

positive	having recently seen a tv report on mattresses made in china carrying false fireproof certificates , we were determined to shop for silentnight , a brand that we trust .
positive	we ordered a comfort pocket 0000 memory mattress and are delighted with our choice .
positive	its is medium - firm and very comfortable .
positive	the price was very competitive and included delivery and removal of packing material .
positive	we were further impressed by the offer of a £_00 discount to remove our old mattress .
positive	we chose our delivery day - a saturday at no extra_cost .
positive	the day before , we received a ' phone_call confirming a 0 - hour delivery slot .
positive	then the delivery crew rang on the day further to confirm a 0 - hour_slot .
positive	the two man crew arrived as promised and were clean , courteous and professional .
positive	what more could we want ?
positive	i find that chemist_direct consistently offers good value on large pack royal_canin dog foods .
positive	if i add a few small items to my basket , its easy to exceed the £_00 ceiling for free delivery .
positive	delivery itself is always prompt .
positive	booked and collected on monday .
positive	notification via tracking that ups has delivered to houston today ( wednesday ).
positive	just waiting for confirmation from my son that he has managed to collect it from the office in his apartment complex .
positive	so far i have been very pleased with the service .
positive	i have used other intermediaries in the past .
positive	i think it depends on which carrier is chosen when making the booking .
positive	fedex is best for rural australia , ups for any city and nothing at all works in italy !

positive	ordered the bed around lunchtime monday requesting delivery to n . irelandand it was delivered to my door , free of charge , by a very helpfuldelivery man at 0pm the next_day .
positive	unbelievable .
positive	it was about half theprice of a leading discount furniture store for what to me looks_like theexact same product .

positive	highly_recommended from a thoroughlysatisfied customer .
positive	well donemervyn kinney .
positive	virgin games is a good all rounder , if you want to experience the thrill and fun of playing bingo and slots .... i must_say they have by far the best selection of slots of any site , you can also play them in demo mode , so you can try them out before playing for cash to see which ones you prefer .
positive	although you can win big , you must remember that you can also lose , but virgin games allows for this by enabling you to put a cap on the amount you can deposit if you so wish , as it can be easy to get carried away as on all sites .
positive	the chat_hosts are great and offer quizzes and media games allowing you to win some extra cash , not forgetting the daily free game in which you can win cash , there is also a free monthly game too .
positive	all in all i would not_hesitate to recommend virgin games to anyone .
positive	a very easy site to follow , with excellent instruction videos .
positive	the goods were delivered swiftly and in good condition .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone , trade or diy
positive	from ordering to delivery , it was all very simple .
positive	each item i have ordered has arrived within 00_hours .
positive	i have added londonmagicstore to my list of favourite sellers , and would recommend them to anyone .

positive	i ordered two_pairs of reading_glasses .
positive	everything fine .
positive	after about two months one of the nose pads on one pair fell_off and was lost .
positive	annoying , but these things happen .
positive	it won_'_t be a problem as long as specky can solve it .
positive	i contacted specky to ask if they could send me a nose pad and screw .
positive	i received a very nice reply saying that wasn_'_t possible so they would re - send my complete order .
positive	a week_later , two_pairs of glasses arrived .
positive	one might be wary that customer service won_'_t be so good from an internet seller as from a high_street shop .
positive	in this case that is clearly not so and i am_delighted with the service from speckyfoureyes .

positive	dedicated smokers / vapers will know how imporant that is .
positive	i stumbled_across the supplement_warehouse website and discovered that they were substantially_cheaper on most of the items that i buy .
positive	they were the same price on one of the pricier items .
positive	i look_forward to reviewing their delivery time .
positive	i only have one thing could gave been done better !!!!
positive	after paying almost £_00 for connection i thought they would have turned the doors around on fridge /_freezer !!!!
positive	especially as my husband is recovering from surgery after a new heart valve only a few_weeks_ago !!!
positive	other than that wonderful service second to none !!!
positive	!
positive	love personalised items especially for grandchildren .

positive	will recommend and use again …..
positive	ordered one for a family_member engraved .
positive	was so impressed treated myself .
positive	pens are excellent pricewise .
positive	engraving seems a little_steep compared to pen cost , but it is so worth it .
positive	at_least now workmates wont be picking my pen up believing it is theirs .
positive	will_definitely purchase again should the need_arise .
positive	the dehumidifier is much_better_than i expected .
positive	it is slim enough to stand against the wall without causing an obstruction and quiet enough to use in the bedroom at night .

positive	i cannot_fault simply_games , have used a few online stores in the past for our video games , and although they start with a good service , for some reason the level of service decreases and we lose confidence in them .
positive	we have decided that we will use simply_games for all our games in the future .
positive	managed to lock myself out of my account , 0 minute on live_chat with catherine and all sorted .

positive	we had a lovely day in the jewellery_quarter yesterday , looking for a ruby to celebrate forty years of marriage .
positive	we went to marlows first , where margaret remembered that we had bought a beautiful diamond from her last_year .
positive	in fact , she recognised the stone !
positive	it needed resizing and this was promptly organised .
positive	then on to the task of finding a ruby ...
positive	i saw a fantastic ring , a great price was negotiated , but i had to be sure that it was the ' one ', and we hadn_'_t looked anywhere_else .
positive	margaret understood and happily we left the store to go searching .. look where you like , you will come back to marlows .
positive	when we returned to collect my resized diamond_ring , we looked again at the ruby .
positive	nothing anywhere_else had come close to the colour , quality and style .
positive	it was perfect for me , so now i have two fantastic rings from marlows .
positive	thank_you margaret for your expert_advice and friendly service .
positive	chris and john hayes
positive	great stuff !

positive	this is the third order i have placed with my tuxedo and i cannot_praise this retailer enough .
positive	the range of items is exceptional , particularly for a slim person with long arms !
positive	website is easy to navigate and find what you require ( and plenty of choice ).
positive	once ordered , my goods have arrived within a day or two and the the prices are very competitive .
positive	no need to look any further .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	really fast service and a great service when sending back a exchange item , paying return postage is part and parcel if you order a incorrect item .
positive	could have got slightly more for my 0 phones at other_sites but their feedback / reviews were very negative so i used mazuma .
positive	sent the phones on monday , money was in my bank tuesday .
positive	furthermore the amount agreed was in my account , not less like other purchasing sites seem to do .
positive	if you are thinking of using them .... do it i ' m_glad i did .
positive	we have had lots of villa holidays in our time but villaplus truly provided a fabulous service .
positive	the rep , kim was brilliant , sorting_out our wi -_fi for us ( which was of vital importance to my kids !!)
positive	we '_ve never been in a villa where the cleaners have come in and changed towels so often .
positive	it was truly refreshing .
positive	the villa inside and out was kept in excellent condition , pool was immaculate .

positive	excellent service with great communication .
positive	i was kept_informed as to how my order was being_processed .
positive	bought a very competetively_priced rab downie for my wife '_s xmas_present .

positive	excellent company to deal with , would strongly_recommend them .
positive	it just shows you can give a good serivce if you think thats important .
positive	i have been searching websites to replace an old kilim for the last couple of years , and i was thrilled to come_across carpetvista .
positive	the site offers an unparalleled selection of these carpets , and my experience is that the colour representation used is very accurate .
positive	when ordered , service given in respect of information and delivery is exceptional - less_than 0 days from sweden to my door in scotland is pretty special in my experience .
positive	and of course , the quality of the carpet supplied is excellent .
positive	i just wonder_why it took me so long to find the website , when i was searching for " kilim ".
positive	i '_ve now bought a camera and a couple of extra lenses from park_cameras , and have experienced prompt attention and delivery on each_occasion
positive	they managed to provide an item i had had great difficulty in locating at other on - line retailers , and at a lower price .
positive	took just four days from order to delivery .
positive	these are indeed great pieces of kit , had one in the previous house , albeit a genuine early victorian one i had reclaimed and restored , i generously left it for the new owner , the thing i find interesting is that this type of airer seems to have more relevance in modern houses that have less usable space for drying clothes during inclement weather , i guess people often just throw money into tumble driers , pulleymaid airers are not only a green alternative but i would guess , as a replacement for a tumble_drier , will repay their initial cost many_times over .
positive	excellent service with very quick delivery
positive	copy of e_- mail sent to hursts .
positive	in response to an order placed on a sunday_afternoon
positive	" as always superb service and great price , despite some of the worst snow this year , combined with us living in the most remote village in england , you still managed to get the mixer to me in under 00_hours , as always your couriers were on time polite and courteous ."
positive	i then had a small query after delivery :-
positive	sent e_- mail query at @ 00 - 00hrs , received a response with resolution at 00 - 00_hrs
positive	i doubt any company could equal let_alone better the service i received from hurst and sons
positive	the goods arrived on time and were in excellent condition and loved by the person i gave them to

positive	would definitely recommend easygates to friends !
positive	as a local theatre group we have a regular need for printed matter in the form of flyers , posters and programmes for each of our productions .
positive	over the years we have tried various printers , many of whom were based some distance away , and contact was by phone or email .
positive	with printing . com we have been delighted to find a locally based printing company which is very approachable and affordable , and which offers a design and print service to an extremely high_standard , which we feel reflects the quality of our shows .
