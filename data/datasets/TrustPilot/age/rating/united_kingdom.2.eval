negative	as others have said , i wish that i had seen this site before ordering .
negative	this is the first really bad_experience of on - line ordering for me .
negative	as others , i placed an order and paid for it , but the have not goods arrived - and i needed them for a deadline .
negative	as i paid by credit_card i shall go through the process of informing the credit_card company of the dispute , but it will take a long time to get my money back .
negative	in addition have made a complaint to consumer direct ( i was referred there by trading_standards ) on 00000_000000 and recommend others to do the same .
negative	they suggested to me a form of words for a letter to be sent by recorded delivery .
negative	the complaints are logged , so the more people who complain to them , the more likely it is that action will be taken .
negative	i have purchased a product , via amazon , and the supplier uses yodel to deliver to their customers .
negative	i received notification , and tracked same , yesterday 00 / 00 / 00 that it would be delivered on same day .
negative	it did not happen .
negative	tracking it today and the data has_been removed from the tracking yodel data base so i have no_idea when to expect it .
negative	i have used the amazon contact procedure , the suppliers contact procedure and obviously yodel also .
negative	no response received from any one although after a number of years of use i have never had this problem before with amazon .
negative	i had never_heard of yodel before yesterday and i am not surprised .
negative	no company i do_business with would consider_using them .
negative	we have always had good service from nitrotek until we sent our rc car on 0 .
negative	february for repair .
negative	all thru february i kept asking when it would be ready kept getting emails saying how busy they were what a backlog they had .
negative	then in march they claimed they had sent me an_email on00 february with an estimate which i had not replied to .
negative	how could this be when the same week they were still telling_me that no one had looked at it yet ?
negative	on 00 march i paid by paypal hoping it might be done soon .
negative	gain and again i emailed no reply , tried going via their website , no reply .
negative	finally i rang their sales line as there is no number for customer_services .
negative	i was told the car would be repaired and sent the next_day ... the following_day we received someone_else '_s car !!
negative	three_weeks_later i am still_waiting four car and presumably some poor soul is waiting for this car .
negative	do not buy from notrotek , they have made my 00 year_old very unhappy .
negative	still_waiting for my goods after 0 weeks .
negative	i have left messages on their answerphone and emailed them but no replies received .
negative	when i eventually managed to talk to someone on the phone they were very pleasant and plausible - " goods not in stock in the warehouse but you will get them within a few_days !!"
negative	then a week_later " parcel was sent by first_class post so you should have received it we will investigate and call you back " - they didn_'_t .
negative	when i called them they said they had issued another invoice and the goods would be with me within a few_days .
negative	taht was almost a week ago and i still_haven_'_t received them .
negative	this was my first shopping_experience with this company and will be tha last .
negative	i buy a lot of goods over the internet and i can say that this is by far the worst experience i have ever had .
negative	did not receive order ,,,,
negative	have been with flogas since 0000 and dealt_with the huttoft branch in lincolnshire things have gone from bad to worse . my husband has_been ill and had not checked the gas levels so we ran_out of gas 00 jan rag the huttoft number and explained the situation that my husband had been ill ( he is also disabled and cannot get around ) the man of the telephone said there was no chance of getting any gas today as he could not contact the depot as they were not answering their phone i explained this was an_emergency we had no hot_water of use of our cooker without it he said that he was sorry but he could not do anything about it .
negative	this company seems to go out of the way to upset people last time we ordered gas they took our money but could not tell us when they were going to deliver as again they could not reach the depot and give us a delivery time .
negative	i know the drivers have mobile_phones and carry extra cylinders on their lorries but that does not seem to matter .
negative	we are not big customers have 0 - 0 cylinders a year so perhaps we do not matter ,
negative	customer service is unknown to this company and after 00 years with them i have had enough .
negative	we will no_longer use them and will find another supplier
negative	what looks_like a simple way to get a divorce quickly becomes very expensive with divorce - online .
negative	the basic price only covers the company filling in the divorce petition form for you .
negative	it '_s then up to you to submit it to the court with the appropriate fee .
negative	if you want divorce - online to handle the whole divorce for you , it gets very expensive .
negative	having forked out for the petition to be filled in , i ran_out of money and was unable to pay divorce - online to manage the rest of the process .
negative	the forms that i ' d paid for were useless as they showed divorce - online as my legal representative .
negative	result ?
negative	£_000 flushed down the toilet .
negative	divorce - online wanted over £_000 plus the £_000 court fee just to get me to the decree nisi stage .
negative	in the end i submitted my own divorce petition to the court , using online help notes and a bit of " trial and error " training .
negative	having had a bad_experience with another online company pretending to be a uk organisation , i re - ordered a camera through valuebasket . com , again not realising they are based overseas and pretend to be a uk company with phone numbers etc .
negative	they claim their phone system is not working , their customer ' service ' agents do not read emails properly and i cannot seem to get a refund .
negative	now the status of my order has_been changed to order held and i have had to send yet another email via their website simply asking for my money back .
negative	it appears they are very poor at refunding your money , although they seem to be able to extract it from your account quickly enough .
negative	foreign companies pretending to be british based are ruining the internet_shopping_experience .
negative	valuebasket , com have my money , will not agree to a refund and have put my order on hold , so i am apparently not going to get my camera or my money back .
negative	i will have to go sheepishly to my bank to get a refund of the money , twice , and surprisingly taken by the same payment organisation company skrill limited each time .
negative	what a coincidence ..
negative	i hold out little hope of receiving my money back from these_people , they are too evasive and slippery .
negative	all i can say is avoid them like the plague if you value your hard_earned cash .
negative	i will happily update this review if i get a refund within a week , but i think hell is more likely to freeze over first .
negative	00th_october .... despite the promise below , no change in my account balance and no - one bothered to get in touch with me .
negative	so it is starting to appear that they are even worse_than i thought .
negative	i tried to buy a camera for my wife .
negative	the website appeared to be a uk company and the price was good , so i ordered the camera .
negative	it turns_out they are based in hong_kong , masquerading as a uk company .
negative	my wife '_s birthday came and went , but the camera never arrived .
negative	after several phone_calls where they tried to claim that my camera somehow got damaged , and they couldn_'_t say when it would be delivered , i asked for my money back .
negative	they told me this would take 00 - 00 working_days .
negative	this has come and gone , and when i spoke to the agent on the phone , they said they were having trouble processing refunds , and couldn_'_t say when it would be , although it was now ' expedited ' which is meaningless .
negative	they process the payment through a company called skrill ltd , which are also used by valuebasket . com ( yes , when i cancelled my order i ordered another camera ) who are as difficult to deal with , saying they have a backlog and won_'_t give a delivery date either , although claim to have 00 camera '_s in stock .
negative	they are not acknowledging my request for a cancellation at all .
negative	i think the two companies are related , or one and the same .
negative	they definitely appear on your credit_card statement as the same payment company , and both masquerade as a uk company with uk phone numbers .
negative	i now need to explain this whole sorry story to my credit_card company totry and get the money refunded by them , but my advice to any potential clients of either company is totally avoid like the plague .
negative	they are either internet fraudsters or just totally inept .
negative	either way , simply_electronics ltd have made my blood boil , and still have my money .,
negative	00rd october update .
negative	following the comment below , simply_electronics have now refunded my money , thank_you .
negative	mothers_day flowers .
negative	a sad affair .
negative	the flowers my mother recieved was a disgrace for the money i paid .... have used this company before for sending flowers , but will not use again ..... was proper mugged this time .. never again ...
negative	this site has never ever answered a question correctly and i really do wonder what it '_s purpose is .
negative	sofa should be delivered 00 july , phone_call from very rude staff_member on the 00 july to say container with my sofa on never arrived and they don_'_t know when it will be arriving , this also applied to many other dissatisfied_customers .
negative	booking the day off work and i am sure if you thought your sofa was being delivered the following_day you most certainly would not have your old one meaning people are left to sit on the floor .
negative	i am certain that sofa works would have been informed well before the day before delivery that it was not arriving on time .
negative	containers take days to arrive so surely they would have known well in advance but failed to inform their customers .
negative	i have heard from neighbours and a family_members the same situation happened with them with sofa works and they have had to wait several weeks after arranged delivery date for their sofa to arrive .
negative	i will be asking them to review their experience on this site so more people can be made aware before purchasing from this company .
negative	i have always purchased from dfs never had an issue and customer service excellent unlike this company .
negative	i hope now that the ceo jason . tyldesley @ csl - furniture . co . uk does the decent thing and returns my deposit as requested and have a word with your suppliers they are giving you a bad_reputation !!!
negative	more details of the response from jason to follow .
negative	i bought a kitchen from the meir department stoke on trent . after fitting the kitchen i found out i had to purchase the edging strip separately unfortunately the store did not have the strip and i had to order the strip directly from scotland . i was asked to pay in advance as they could not send or order the strip for the store as it was regarded as a special order . i was charged a delivery charge which i felt was unfair as this item i feel should have been available in store . the item was to be delivered within five days but after three_weeks i am still_waiting despite a number of calls to the store . very poor customer service .
negative	incorrect billing from october still not resolved , because it '_s impossible to get through to the call_centre !..
negative	emails just seem to go into a black_hole and get ignored ..
negative	they ' re only interested in sending final demands , whether correct or not !
negative	the call_centre must be woefully under - manned , and i don_'_t think this is a temporary blip , but here to stay .
negative	the poorest customer service i '_ve had in 00 years as customer of goods & services !
negative	giving feedback is very important .
negative	i hope and believe that your products are of high_quality but unfortunately i don_'_t know it yet as i have not received my order .
negative	according to the tracking :
negative	thu 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 : your order has_been scanned at the origin depot for export .
negative	fri 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 : your order has arrived at the carrier '_s central hub .
negative	i will change the rating if / when i get the products i ordered .
negative	i ordered linking balloons in 0 colours which should have all been the same shape .
negative	some were sausage shaped which i couldn_'_t use and 0 had holes in them so were useless .
negative	poor and hence won_'_t be using again .
negative	ordered a sewing_machine 0 july_0000 , today , 0th_august nothing has yet appeared .
negative	in the meantime , phoned , emailed and been sent up the garden path .
negative	just phoned and been told that on the 0th of august it should arrive .
negative	told by a bad tempered , rude person who spoke bad french .
negative	no apology from him .
negative	with difficulty extracted the name of the transport people from him and date of arrival .
negative	looked the transport people up in the yellow pages ( la redoute guy had no phone number ) but they are not responding .
negative	this is the last time i buy from laredoute france !
negative	!
negative	compare that to amazon or ebay sellers !
negative	. 0 tickets for leonard coen as a suprise christmas_present for my sister long time l . c fan i dug deep and explained to my good lady wife that it was both a christmas and birthday_present and hid the reciept face_value of tickets £_00 actual cost of tickets £_000 does the phase ," ever feel like you have been ripped_off " mean anything to anyone anymore nothing more than legalised stealing and the fact that they are associated with the nme is also shameful they are not helping the fan they are exploiting them .
negative	avoid this site is not very good either so far on my 0th review but it keeps crashing anyway
negative	having unsuccessfully tried to purchase some items their non - appearance several weeks_later is really frustrating .
negative	then contacting them to be told go away we '_ll get back to you one day sticks in the gullett .
negative	i am about to issue a summons to the small_claims court .
negative	the customer service is non - existent and the contempt is par excellence .
negative	i would never ever go to this company and i would actively dissuade anyone from using it - unless they want a protracted dispute , appalling ryan_air style customer service , and a trip to the small_claims court .
negative	to date no goods received no refund and no further communication .
negative	inept incompetent and edging on highway robbery .
negative	on first attempt a neighbour did not accept parcel , following_day he left parcel with another neighbour but did not leave a card to advise where parcel was ?
negative	hence the goods in the parcel were late !
negative	this is not the first time this has happened , i will be complaining to my shipper .
negative	my experience with the company was good a few_years_ago and my order came quickly .
negative	however , this time things were different .
negative	there was no sign of the gloves i ordered for about 00 days .
negative	i was sent a royal_mail tracking_number but it was not valid on the royal_mail website a week_later , so they did not appear to have been posted .
negative	my email to the company was unanswered .
negative	after a conversation on the phone i was told they were looking into it with royal_mail .
negative	i pointed_out that the gloves were needed for a trip very soon and after more telephone_calls they agreed to send a pair but said they would cut_off the cardboard so i could get them quicker .
negative	this didn_'_t sound ideal but i was assured this wouldn_'_t affect my right to return them if they didn_'_t fit .
negative	they ended_up being too small and i returned them using the address and instructions on the website at the time and sending an_email to let them know .
negative	over a month later i have no refund !
negative	after an unanswered email and another lengthy conversation by phone i was told they hadn_'_t had them back as nothing had been logged .
negative	unfortunately i did not use recorded delivery so cannot prove they were sent or received , however , it seems too much of a coincidence that royal_mail lost the both gloves originally sent and those i returned !
negative	my hunch is either the company are extremely disorganised and have lost my return package , or they decided the gloves are not resaleable without the cardboard label so not to give a refund .
negative	it is too easy to blame royal_mail but i have sent and received many things before and never had a problem .
negative	once when something went_astray it was returned to me , however there '_s no sign of this package .
negative	i am disappointed to have lost money and would not advise others to use this company .
negative	just when i thought i had seen every scam , sharp_practice and rip_off that holiday autoes could throw at me , you come up with an_absolute beauty .
negative	you should be really proud of yourself because this must have made you millions of pounds whilst distressing thousands of your customers , not just me .
negative	before i continue , i ask that in any response to me you don_’ t insult me by saving it is nothing to do with you and it ’_s your suppliers .
negative	or tell me it ’_s on the terms and conditions .
negative	i run my own business and when a client deals with our company we are responsible for all parts of the supply chain .
negative	i would not expect to complain to a supermarket to be told to go and speak to the farmer .
negative	i know that you are aware , understand and agree to all charges , conditions and operating practices of the car_hire_companies .
negative	when i book a car through holiday autoes that is exactly_what i do .
negative	if you ( like at my company ) did not agree with the terms of a supplier then you can either get them to change the way they operate or you could drop them as a supplier , from this i conclude that you have sat down with them at formal meetings and agreed all charges and ways of working , you have therefore agreed to these scams .
negative	if not , your set_up is amateurish .
negative	the scam that has really got me angry this time is arriving to pick_up my car , after paying for everything i wanted on line to be hit with additional costs of 000_euros ( in case you think this is a typo , you are right one hundred and ninety six euros .)
negative	we travelled on one of the busiest fridays of the season friday 00th_july , to one of the busiest airports alicante , at the busiest of times , after work on friday .
negative	when i picked_up my car , the airport was packed with families picking_up cars and after waiting for an_hour was charged an additional 00uros ( thirty five euros ) it appeared on the bill as “ others ” when i challenged this i was told it was because it was late .
negative	now let me remind you of something , it was “ peak time ”, peak season and the airport was packed so why did you charge me 00 euros extra ?
negative	i could understand if it was 0am at an airport that was closed but this was the main pick_up period .
negative	this scam is a disgrace and you should be_ashamed of yourself .
negative	is it your policy to try and ruin hard working customers holidays before they have even begun ?
negative	and before you try , in your usual way , of distancing yourself from all your responsibilities , i would also like to mention that friends on the same flight as us who booked their car through another company , not holiday_autos , were not charged this 00 euros .
negative	i want this 00 euros refunding to me .
negative	the second part of your scam was the additional driver cover on the policy .
negative	you can ’ t go on a family holiday and not have additional_insurance_cover .
negative	if the main driver was not able to drive ( sprained ankle for example ) then you have to make_sure you can legally drive .
negative	we were charged 00 euros for this .
negative	now to put this into context , only one person can drive the car at a time and my wife driving is no more likely to have an accident than me so why were we charged a rate equivalent to 0 , 000_euros a year .
negative	this is over 0 times my fully comprehensible insurance cost at home to drive .
negative	and this is an extra don_’ t forget on top of the car_hire cost which was inclusive of insurance .
negative	you can ’ t say it is an admin_charge at this rate .
negative	also , my wife put herself down as second driver on our friends car , the family who did not book through holiday autoes and they were charged 00 euros , so explain_why the same person is charged twice as much through holiday autoes
negative	i want 00 euros refunded to me for this overcharge compared to other_companies
negative	the third part of your scam is the fuel charge .
negative	we were charged 000_euros for fuel we did not want or need .
negative	as well as the rip_off factor , i would also like to question your corporate responsibility .
negative	according to my research , the fuel_tank size of the berlingo is 00 litres .
negative	the cost of fuel at the time of the trip was 0 . 00 per_litre which equates to 00 euros .
negative	you charged me 000_euros , a difference of 00 euros .
negative	what a rip_off .
negative	i want this 00 euros refunding to me .
negative	no one can dive a car and return it empty , this is impossible for obvious reasons , at the best there would be 0 litres left in the tank .
negative	how dare you charge for the full 00 litres when nobody can or would risk driving to empty ?
negative	i want 0 euros refunding to me to cover the fuel that is always left in a tank
negative	a full_tank covers 0000 km , how many people do you know who drive this distance on a beach family holiday .
negative	we have been charged this amount before by holiday autoes for a 0 day holiday .
negative	this would equate to an annual mileage of 00 , 000_km .
negative	we did not want this fuel yet we were charged for it .
negative	in the past you have said that some customers prefer to do it this way , well firstly i have never spoken to anybody who has said that , and secondly , if that is true you should allow customers to choose .
negative	it would be a 0 minute job to add to the website the fuel_policy choice to enable people to return the car full or empty , the fact that you don_’ t provide this choice proves to me you are part of this fuel rip_off and profiting from it .
negative	my company creates websites so i know this to be a very simple job .
negative	i want 00 euros refunding for the ¼ tank of fuel i was unable to use .
negative	what infuriates almost as much as your contempt for your customers and your clear determination to rip each and every one off as much as possible , is your contempt for the planet we live on .
negative	it is now proven the link between carbon emissions and global warming yet your fuel policies actively encourage people to use more fuel than they need , you will frequently hear the phrase “ we might as well drive as we have paid for the fuel ” how can you sleep at night knowing you are contributing to the death of the planet just so you can dishonestly make a few extra pounds , do you not have any corporate responsibility at all .
negative	do you not care about the next generation who will inherit the planet from the rest of us ?
negative	i wonder_if you have a mission statement to “ ruin family holidays and destroy the planet ”
negative	please contact me to arrange the refund of the 000_euros i have been unjustly charged and to explain what changes you are planning to make to the way you operate .
negative	daughter had problems with boohoo . com do not touch at all spread the word to avoid theft by them !
negative	awful service , rip_off thieves , unhelpful customer_services dept .
negative	did not listen to problem , their way is right you the customer have no rights .
negative	wrongly labelled ( size ) item returned and customer charged for it .
negative	disgraceful response three_times from customer_services .
negative	i strongly_advise everyone to avoid using this company
negative	i wanted to switch because talk_talk '_s provided wireless router is poor quality and they do not offer support on privately provided routers .
negative	they failed to follow my request to terminate my line and it took about four months from original request for them to finally disconnect their line , whilst i had switched within two_weeks of request to my new provider .
negative	talk_talk tried to charge me for the four months beyond my last usage of their service and in the end i have paid two of the four months having had threats of sending debt_collectors to my home .
negative	i will never use them again
negative	i too wish i had read the reviews about this company before ordering .
negative	ordered two items in early_december which have not arrived and i have now cancelled order following two unanswered emails .
negative	i have requested immediate_refund and will use small_claims court to reclaim monies if not received .
negative	i purchased a coat for my wife for christmas .
negative	it needed to be returned and this was done with confirmation of receipt over 00 days ago .
negative	like others here , i can not get my refund out of them .
negative	i am now just passing this to my credits card '_s insurance department .
negative	its a shame because my wife has purchased desigual products through the house of frazer for some years .
negative	cant_believe they are allowed to trade like this .
negative	i ordered product that took over a monthy to arrive , had it said out of stock in the first place i wouldn_'_t have ordered it .
negative	i got lucky .
negative	i was at the checkout stage when i got suspicious - no mention of vat .
negative	as the payment page was loading i googled them and discovered their true colours .
negative	needless to say , i didn_'_t go_ahead with the purchase !
negative	forced to give them a star by trustpilot .
negative	not happy about that !!!!!
negative	!
negative	one year later , two lost houses later , £££ in wasted phone_calls and recorded delivery costs the underwriter finally contacted me yesterday to tell me the decision in principle issued by hsbc was wrong ( delivered in a manner suggesting this error is somehow my fault ) all couched in extremely xenophobic terms .
negative	if your name sounds ' foreign ' ( their words , not mine ) walk_away .
negative	now , i ' m told my original documents are lost by the bank ( again as though this is somehow my fault ).
negative	the bank will abuse you in every way possible save for actual physical assault .
negative	for goodness_sake , don_'_t waste your time , energy and goodwill .
negative	banks are bad , but not this bad .
negative	we were only applying for 00_% ltv as premier customers and still untold misery ensued ..... oh and by the way , don_'_t bother writing to the md / ceo as his department doesn_'_t bother responding to correspondence .
negative	is first direct really a subsidiary of hsbc ?
negative	how can it be any better .
negative	notwithstanding those rave_reviews and tempting switching fees , i will never touch an hsbc related company again .
negative	if there was a zero star option that would have been generous .
negative	i ordered 0 pairs of merrell shoes for my elderly parent and having bought this brand regularly for years i had no reason to believe there would be any issue with the size .
negative	when the shoes arrived , one pair looked worn with the elastic side strap already lose and stretched and the boots were designed so badly the angle at the ankle made it impossible to fit the foot into the boot .
negative	considering the boots are advertised as " slip on and off " this defect was unacceptable .
negative	the shoes were advertised as new and in perfect_condition .
negative	i immediately notified outdoor_kit within 00_minutes of receiving the shoes .
negative	i am shocked at the response from this company which is attempting to deprive me of my statutory_rights .
negative	having taken a great deal of time and effort , to clarify the defects in detail which could cause a serious injury to my elderly parent , i received an_email_confirming the order would be refunded when the goods were returned .
negative	the return label emailed following repeated requests was actually the label used to post the goods to me .
negative	i then received another email_stating the refund would only be processed if there is a defect with the size of the shoes reneging on the earlier agreement .
negative	in the meantime , i still_haven_'_t received a valid return label .
negative	it has_been an aggravating experience which is far from over .
negative	i regularly buy goods online but i can state with some certainty this is not a company i would trust again .
negative	very unprofesssional company run by a person who will quite happily make arrangements and subsequently hang up the phone and fail to attend appointments without reason .
negative	dealing_with cookersolutions wasted a lot of my time and effort and my cooker in the meantime is still not working .
negative	don_'_t waste your time on this company .
negative	it seems amazing a company as large and established as pixmania could have such draconian processes .
negative	more than 00 days after_placing an order it still_hasn_'_t arrived yet i have been charged twice for the same item .
negative	trying to resolve even simple matters by email is impossible as the staff are determined to misunderstand every communication and when calling the company i was cross examined about my personal circumstances by a barely litterate undereducated rude adolescent .
negative	low quality service by undertrained staff .
negative	this is only my second order from pixmania and i won_'_t be making any more purchases with this company .
negative	having spent hours surfing the internet for the right watch at the most competitive price i ordered a rotary sterling silver watch from the watch_hut .
negative	the order was confirmed and payment taken .
negative	at that stage the watch was also available at other outlets for the same price .
negative	later the following_day i received an_email from the watch_hut telling_me the watch would not be supplied having been discontinued by rotary .
negative	i contacted rotary and discovered the watch is still available as a current line item .
negative	the watch_hut simply shrugged off its lie telling_me this is the standard response in such circumstances .
negative	of course , by now the other outlets had sold the watch .
negative	i even tried reporting the problem to rotary without effect .
negative	apparently rotary is happy for its authorised distributors to use its brand to lure customers with non - existent products .
negative	my advice ?
negative	buy a different brand from another shop .
negative	same as just about everybody_else .
negative	ordered replacement saute pan lid at beginning of october .
negative	they took the money immediately but failed to supply the item .
negative	telephone line permanently busy but by continually redialling eventually got an answer and was advised that item would be delivered week_commencing 00 / 00 .
negative	failed to arrive , unable to get through on phone in spite of redialling and no response to online requests to contact me .
negative	cancelled order online at beginning of november and expected automatic refund .
negative	didn_'_t happen of course .
negative	still couldn_'_t get through on phone and no response to email or written letter .
negative	on advice from consumer direct will now send refund request by recorded delivery using all the right words .
negative	don_'_t expect an_immediate_response but will not give up on this without a fight .
negative	i do not like being_ripped_off !
negative	we '_ve used xln telecom for a number of years , and were always skeptical about the very bad_reviews we read about them .
negative	however on cancelling one of our contracts with them , we '_ve be hit with what i can only describe as a scandalous hidden charge of £_000 . 00 .
negative	apparently even if you give the proper notice to switch line provider , and after they have given you a mac_code , if the new provider takes over the service even 0 day early , they hit you with this charge .
negative	i called xln today to complain , and all they did was fob me off with small_print .
negative	these_guys have a very bad attitude_towards customers and thoroughly deserve all the bad_press that they get
negative	paid £_000 up front to get our neff dishwasher fixed , their local engineer a j p dom app ser of 0 the courtyard , saxon lane
negative	bn00 0ql seaford , east sussex tel 00000_000000 called to take a look .
negative	didnt even bring out his tool box .
negative	came back to carry out the repair over a week_later , and although having assured us the dishwasher was now working , left us with the original fault and a broken dishwasher .
negative	we immediately complained to repaircair who promised that they would arrange for the engineer to return .
negative	however having waited in for 0 days no engineer has_been and we are left with no repair and just broken_promises .
negative	what a scam !
negative	i closed my account with talk_talk and yet they still kept billing me - despite_numerous complaints .
negative	ended_up having to cancel my direct_debit with the bank
negative	they still owe me money - but its not worth the hassle trying to get it back
negative	just as well i had not ordered anything important , ordered on 00 , supposedly sent on the 00th but as of 00th it has still not arrived .
negative	i was told as it was sent second class i should give it another week before i email them again .
negative	i am well versed in royal_mail 0nd class post , i sent several items to customers .
negative	generally they arrive two days_later and at a push three .
negative	i think it is sloppy customer service to just blame royal_mail .
negative	pharmacy_0u charge £ 0 . 00 for second class post whilst the actual cost is £ 0 . 00 .
negative	delivery failed for a freinds birthday .
negative	00_hours_later still no joy and a further 00_hours until i ' m due to get a response - never again .
negative	the prices offered are very competitive but items they claim are in stock take a long time to arrive - fine as long as you are aware of this beforehand .
negative	all my orders have had a delay of some sort .
negative	i cancelled one of my orders after it did not arrive before it was needed despite_being advised that they would make it a priority order .
negative	00 days_later , many phone_calls with long waiting times and many emails , i still have not received any refund and am told it may be at_least another 00 days .
negative	i am getting quite concerned - the customer service officials are polite but can offer no assistance of any kind .
negative	they just offered to email on my behalf .
negative	please beware - i do believe i will eventually be refunded but connstant checking / ringing and emailing with no response is very frustrating .
negative	we had previously had appliance cover with british_gas but when they increased our premiums by about 00_% despite us not having made any claims we shopped_around and settled for the silver package from the warranty shop .
negative	as luck would have it the heating element in our dishwasher decided to breakdown so we looked to make a claim on our policy .
negative	the t &_cs are such that you can '_t claim within 00 days of starting the policy .
negative	although we weren_'_t happy about it we understood the reasons why they have that clause .
negative	so on day 00 of holding the policy we contacted the warranty shop to start a claim and that '_s when the fun started .
negative	we went through a series of questions and at the end were told that because or claim was such a short time after the end of the claim period we would be contacted within " 0 - 0 working_days " by an assessor to go through more detail .
negative	given that we had already waited 00 days we couldn_'_t understand_why this was necessary but reluctantly had to go along with it .
negative	a couple of days_later i got a call from the assessor to arrange a " convenient " time to have an " interview " about our claim .
negative	by this time i was starting to feel like a criminal .
negative	the " convenient " time could only be scheduled between 0 :_00am - 0pm monday - friday and would last 00 - 00_minutes - hardly convenient when you work full time in the sort of job that has set times ( ie lunch break !).
negative	eventually i arranged a time which was by now a week after the original claim was registered .
negative	the " interview " consisted of going through exactly the same details as i ' d already given the warranty shop .
negative	fortunately it only lasted 00_minutes .
negative	i was told they would submit a report and we ' d hear the outcome within " 0 - 0 working_days ".
negative	0 days_later i received a call from an outfit called dvs .
negative	at last i thought , our claim has_been accepted and this is to arrange for the repairs to be made .
negative	wrong !!
negative	this was a call to go through the same questions i ' d already been through directly with the warranty shop and the assessor .
negative	by this time i was getting completely exasperated with the whole_process .
negative	the sting in the tail with this call was that you now have to pay your excess of £_00 and that i would be contacted within " 0 - 0 working_days " for an engineer to call and assess our dishwasher .
negative	i enquired as to whether we would get our excess back if the warranty shop wouldn_'_t honour our claim .
negative	the person on the phone couldn_'_t answer and just kept referring me back to the warranty shop .
negative	so once again i called the warranty shop .
negative	i was told that if the engineer has_been to assess our dishwasher and it is decided that they will not honour our claim then we wouldn_'_t get our excess back as costs had been started .
negative	the only way we could get our excess back was to cancel the engineer '_s visit .
negative	i asked on what grounds our claim wouldn_'_t be honoured and one of them was " wear and tear ", so with cynical head on now , i said that i expected that this would be the conclusion of the engineer , especially as the dishwasher is nearly 0 years old .
negative	by now completely fed_up with the whole_process , being made to feel as though i was making a fraudulent claim and still no nearer having our dishwasher repaired , we decided to withdraw our claim and cancel our policy with immediate effect .
negative	since then i '_ve contacted a local domestic appliance repair man who came round to assess the dishwasher on a saturday and will be able to do the repair on a tuesday_evening when he '_s received the part .
negative	it '_s costing us £_000 but worth it to have a working dishwasher repaired at a convenient time for us .
negative	we ' re also going to put the warranty shop premiums we ' re saving in a bank_account to cover any future repairs we need doing ( once in the last 0 years is not a bad strike rate !)
negative	so the moral is if you want a cheap multi - appliance policy then the warranty shop will tick your box .
negative	however , if you also want a hassle and stress_free claims process ( not an unreasonable request in my opinion ), then i would avoid the warranty shop at all costs
negative	0 parcels expected this morning .
negative	0 parcel came around 00 . 00hrs .
negative	i told the driver that there should be 0 parcels but he was adament there was only 0 , even_though the box said 0 of 0 .
negative	later in the afternoon i received a text which said my parcel would be delivered between 00 . 00hrs and 00 . 00hrs .
negative	we sat in and waited and no parcel arrived .
negative	tried to ring to find out what had happened but the number given was automated and kept telling_me the parcel had been delivered and signed for at 00 . 00hrs .
negative	at 00 . 00hrs i received an_email to say " tried to deliver your order from scan_computers however no one available to accept delivery ".
negative	how ridiculous , we were home all day waiting , have 0 dogs who bark loudly when anyone comes through the front gate so there is no way we would miss anyone calling at our house .
negative	therefore we have the case for the computer but no parts to put in it and had arranged for someone to come this evening to put it together .
negative	very disappointed indeed at this bad service and what a wasted day considering it is so near christmas and we could have spent our time getting the bits of shopping .. the driver obviously went home early or couldn_'_t be bothered to do all his deliveried .
negative	i have read all the reviews regarding this company of morons and idiots .
negative	it '_s the same old story , i ordered things on the 00 / 0 / 00 on their 00 hour delivery .
negative	needless to say the items never arrived .
negative	i visited their site to check the order status and low and behold it said order " pending "!!
negative	i phoned them up , and you guessed it thy only had an answering_machine service .
negative	so i decided to contact them via their online email form .
negative	oh i never recived any confirmation_email as others have written in their reviews .
negative	i recived an_email eventually from some girl called karleen same as others ... seems like they only have one customer service rep .
negative	anyhow , i cancelled the order as i saw some better vibrators on another site called love honey .
negative	karleen said that i would get a refund within 0 days .
negative	you guessed it i ' m still_waiting after 0 weeks .
negative	i am now in the process of taking them to small_claims court to get my money back plus costs .
negative	i would strongly_advise anybody not to purchase from these_people as you can hardly call them a company !!
negative	they are a total load of bullshiters and shysters !!
negative	!
negative	i have never_heard of this ' hermes ' delivery service before .
negative	i ordered a poster from allposters . com who used this service .
negative	i checked on their website and was supposed to arrive today .
negative	judging_by the reviews i can expect to receive a terrible service .
negative	i hear this company is owned by the germans .. i mean what do you expect .
negative	they should stick to making volkswagens .. lol
negative	this service is absolutely terrible , i would not recommend anyone buying from this site .
negative	allposters . co . uk is not a uk site , which had me fooled !
negative	they are based in america but use the co . uk tag presumably to fool people in the uk .
negative	i ordered two prints and a poster .
negative	firstly they didn_'_t confirm the order by email which is usually customary with good companies .
negative	then they got my address details wrong !
negative	then when the order came it was incomplete !
negative	then when they sent out the missing order they used an unknown delivery company called ' hermes ' who failed to deliver the item !
negative	i mean what more can i say ... steer_well clear is my advice .
negative	a while ago we used them , and a scream boxed set ( amongst other rejected items ) which were in very good condition were rejected on the grounds on " damaged artwork ."
negative	they refused to return them , as they had been " recycled responsibly ".....
negative	i have since heard that they recycle under the name " zoverstock " on amazon ... daylight_robbery in my opinion .
negative	this cover was requested for before_christmas since it was a gift .
negative	i expected 0 weeks sufficient .
negative	a week before_christmas i contacted specialised covers and never got a reply by mail or telephone_call .
negative	after christmas my opinions were expressed , we were advised the cover would be delivered asap , the next story was it went to the wrong_address , verbal apologies mean nothing in business , as far as i ' m concerned .
negative	cut the cost or remove the deliver cost and one might consider returning .
negative	i certainly wont return and would advise others against this company .
negative	refused delivery of item which was returned to very '_s warehouse .
negative	over a month later and they sent me letters stating that i owe them £_00 . 00 for the item and 00p interest and that if i didn_'_t pay then it would be taken further .
negative	i phoned them on the 0000 number which cost me and explained that they had the item at their warehouse and it stated the same info on my online account .
negative	still got another letter and then the phone_calls telling_me to pay .
negative	not one sorry for hassling me or nothing ..... total shite company .
negative	i placed an order customer number 0000000000 order delivery enquiry 000000000 and i received a confirmation for my order but did not receive my items and my order disappeared from the site !
negative	i contacted customer_services who promised to resend my order , then nothing
negative	i contacted customer_services again & this time my order was sent out but i had an e_- mail saying i had set_up a credit account when i hadn_'_t but this is ok if i get my order at the original price charged ie £ 0 not full price without the discount accepted on my original order !
negative	i need a response to my e_- mails as i will keep the credit account and order again in the future if i am only charged the original amount of my order ie £ 0 otherwise i will have to return my order and close my account and not order ever again , thank_you !
negative	i like the prices of the items but i still expect to get the item pictured & the boots i were sent were a good 0 - 0 inches shorter than in the picture of the item onsite !!
negative	!
negative	the 0nd pair i ordered killed my feet on the first time of wearing them and so are useless to me now too as are not just extremely uncomfortable , not true to size and they left me with numerous blisters !
negative	!
negative	i expect the items i purchase to be functional and fit for purpose as well as the actual item sent as in the picture not shorter boots which they definitely were
negative	i am not a happy customer & if this is not resolved in a satisfactory way i will be going to trading_standards with my complaint as the boots were not just useless but not as shown on site either and the other ones left scars on my feet :-(
negative	( p . s i do not see why i have to pay for return postage and nothing was said in regards to the other pair which are useless and unwearable and neither of the issues are my fault as i bought them both in good faith !! )
negative	was horrified to find that two payments had been taken for my recent order to hungry_house , now yes e_- mail of apology sent to me explaining it would be back in my account in 0 working_days but i am on income support & on a very limited_budget so to treat_myself to a take away is a rarity and of real importance to me as in quality of food and service as i don_'_t have money to waste !!!
negative	!
negative	the meal itself was dire , i had to wait nearly 0 hours for it and it was cold on arrival & the delivery driver had a car parked outside my door with around 0 other guys in it at 0am with me in my nightclothes & i felt very uncomfortable & find this to be extremely unprofessional plus like i said the food was dire anyway but my issue is the extra £_00 . 00 which was taken from my account was actually for my electricity for over the weekend !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	so to find that money gone from my account meant i had no money for my electricity for over the weekend and my electricity ran_out this morning ( i had used the emergency credit ) so i was panicking of course and i cannot even describe the hassle i went through to borrow money to put on my meter and actually spent my saturday_afternoon in tears thanks to hungry_house and it is not just about an e_- mail of apology and a refund of my money in 0 working_days as it is of no use to me when it was my money for my electricity for over the weekend !
negative	:-(
negative	i have decided i want nothing more whatsoever to do with your company & you can keep my money i am so appalled with your company that it is worth it just to get_rid of you and the stress caused out of my life , so pocket the money & i hope you do well with it & all the best for the future for you and your staff !
negative	:-) x
negative	( please_note i do not want my money back , i do not want a refund - i am so disgusted with your company & what they have done today that you can keep it , thank_you !! )
negative	the first order i places was fine , but the next one was awful .
negative	there was a problem with delivery , then the items were out of stock , and i didn_'_t hear_anything for a week .
negative	then they said that it would be sent the next_day , but it was delayed more .
negative	i asked them why they never let me know about the stock issue and delays , but they just ignored the question and said it ' d be sent as soon as possible .
negative	the advert says free next - day delivery , but when you do the order , it isn_'_t free .
negative	i '_ve reported them to trading_standards , as they are obviously a bunch of cowboys .
negative	not recommended .
negative	where is my gift_voucher ?
negative	!
negative	a branch of primark recently opened near to where i live , i bought a 0 pack of underpants " jersey slip " but was unable to actually see them properly because of the packaging they were much skimpier than the picture on packaging showed and subsequently a very poor and uncomfortable fit .
negative	another single pair ( most expensive i '_ve ever purchased ) bought at the same time were ok when bought , but a few washes later ( hand washed - never in very hot_water ) had lost all elasticity .
negative	i had lost my receipt and one of 0 pack had been worn so i was unable to do much about it - although a trip to trading_standards has_been contemplated .
negative	i would suggest anyone purchasing anything from primark keeps their receipt very safe , although i personally won_'_t be shopping there again .
negative	i gave this a one star_rating because the staff were pleasant and there was no way not to give any stars at all .
negative	so many things wrong - if using subtitles sometimes the subtitles start again mid programme so you ' re trying to read current subtitles and subtitles from before the break .
negative	same sometimes happens with sound too .
negative	tonight unable to watch corrie even_though i declare i ' m over 00 .
negative	in all itv_player is a waste of time they could_learn a lot from bbc iplayer .
negative	yet another thing today monday 00th_jan the thumbnails are showing pictures of last weeks episodes .
negative	( although the date says 00th_jan )
negative	while ordering a bouquet for my wife i saw a rose lily one and when i received it it have 0 roses and two stems of lily with fill in flowers as not what i needed , emailed the company and telephone them on many occasions , and the quality of the flowers was poor .
negative	in the end i felt that it was my fault for every ordering from these no florist manager would not speak to me and when i complaied about the quality i got a long email about how to look after flowers well i have learned my lesson do not use this company .
negative	after the last email about how to look after the rubbish bouquet i received i went out to a high_street florist and bought a replacement for myself so i could throw the rubbish flowers in the bin
negative	i ordered a yamaha digital_piano on line , together with pedals and bench seat .
negative	estimated delivery date was wed .
negative	i changed to thurs .
negative	i received order confirmation but no further emails .
negative	i checked my order on the wed only to find the delivery date had been put back 0 days with no notification .
negative	i telephoned customer_services to be told that the bench seat was out of stock because i changed the delivery date and so nothing was being delivered .
negative	why no email , i would have settled for the piano and pedals and waited for the bench to be delivered at a later date .
negative	customer_services offered delivery of piano 0 days hence ( estimated ) no good as i work .
negative	if i had been informed immediately i would have arranged for delivery on my next_day off but as they did not seem too worried that no emails had been received informing_me what was happening i just cancelled the order
negative	very poor communication , and do not appreciate that some people order on line and arrange delivery dates because their free time is limited !
negative	i ordered a telephone ( 00pds plus ) which was faulty on delivery - i returned it but have not been paid a refund ( over 00 months now ) despite many requests and reminders - they also trade as sales @ ezstyle . co . uk
negative	i would advise_anyone not to buy from them
negative	do not do_business with this company - they supplied faulty goods and when returned did nothing to replace or refund - they dont answer their customer service telephone line nor do they respond to email enquiries .
negative	got tv broad band could not get any extra channels rang up had rude manger i put phone down and she kept ring back next_day i rang talk_talk and asked them if i could cancel my package i got put thorgh to a contact center abroad he was nasty rude he told me he had my bank deatailes and could any thing he wants and i cant stop him had to close my account what twats they are

negative	i bought a samsung laptop which arrived yesterday .
negative	it will not connect to the internet .
negative	after hours on the phone , being pushed from_pillar to post , calls not being returned , it was finally agreed that the laptop was faulty .
negative	misco then refused to take it without an authorisation from samsung ( which i had and which i gave them ) - even_though under the sale of goods_act the product is their responsibility - and put the phone down on me .
negative	customer_services do not know anything about consumer_law .
negative	i have spent £_000 and received nothing .
negative	terrible service with no apology at any stage .
negative	the website looks great .
negative	i picked the country ( france ) which then directed me to the flowers available .
negative	i love yellow and there was a beautiful bunch called sunburst .
negative	it '_s description sounded perfect ....
negative	inspired by the midsummer sunshine , this ensemble of seasonal blooms perfectly encapsulates the season '_s charm with a modern twist .
negative	with the finest quality sunflowers , yellow_roses and a selection of complimenting blooms , this pretty arrangement is finished with an edging of funky green foliage .
negative	a best seller , and with good reason .
negative	i ordered the large bouquet as i had already succumbed to a discount_code i found online therefore figured that i would use that discount to be able to get my mum the best flowers for mothers_day .
negative	i picked a delivery date , and i received an_email_confirming the order .
negative	all seemed fine .
negative	the delivery date arrived ( day before mother '_s day ).
negative	my mother rang me from france to tell me the flowers had arrived and they were very nice .
negative	i was puzzled by , very nice ?
negative	i asked her what they were like and she said lilies and red gerberas and two yellow_roses .
negative	clearly this was not the same bouquet i had ordered that was inspired by midsummer sunshine .
negative	she then posted a picture on facebook for me and all our relatives to see .
negative	i have never been so embarrassed in all my life !!
negative	!
negative	the bouquet consisted of 0 flowers and i really really hate lilies .
negative	i immediately raised a complaint ticket ( saturday ).
negative	on thursday ( they say they respond within 0 days .. hahahahahahahaha ) they replied to offer me a £ 0 voucher towards more flowers .
negative	again i replied immediately to inform them they severely underestimated how angry , disappointed and upset i was .
negative	the flowers were already dead or dying .
negative	and i asked them to arrange_collection of the flowers and arrange for a full_refund .
negative	i received no reply so i started commenting on their facebook_page and also through their twitter feed .
negative	eventually i got a reply via private message on facebook telling_me someone would look at my complaint .
negative	i then received another reply telling_me to check my emails .
negative	excited i opened up the email .
negative	shock .
negative	they quoted their own t &_c which state
negative	0 . 0 if we do not have the goods you order in stock , we will - in the case of flowers / plants - send an_alternative as outlined elsewhere on the website which will be of equal or greater value , quality and style .
negative	in the case of other items , we will offer you alternatives before we dispatch your order .
negative	therefore what they are telling you is , by all means look at the pretty pictures on the website , facebook or twitter .
negative	hand over your money to them in good faith .
negative	but do not expect the flowers you ordered to be the ones that are delivered ?
negative	of course i have told them i consider their reply to be totally_unacceptable .
negative	they have not replied .
negative	and , trying to speak to someone on the phone .. again aha hahahaha , on an 0000 number , they answerd the phone and left me hanging before the call was disconnected .
negative	their online life support is never online .
negative	they do not respond timeously to their own ' tickets '.
negative	and to top it all , they have now protected their facebook and twitter pages so i cant ( and others ) from contacting them that way .
negative	i have already tweeted @ whichuk and @ bbcwatchdog to ask them to investigate .
negative	i am now going to trading standard and contacting my credit_card for ' chargeback '.
negative	well i must_say the title no how is about right for the service dept as they have no_idea of how to deal with a customer or tell the truth about a repair .
negative	i took my computer in last saturday as i had a problem paid my £_00 and also paid £_00 for anti_virus under there recomedation and was told computer would be ready that afternoon .
negative	i then receieved a call to say it would be sunday morning to collect from store and what documents would i like saved .
negative	somebody was telling porky pies as my wife goes and picks up the tower unit and i plug it in guess_what nothing had been done .
negative	take it back to store yes we will look at it and get back to you monday come afternoon nothing so i have to ring and guess_what the hard_drive is gone .
negative	what a joke nobody can tell you the truth .
negative	the service is disgusting as i was told i would receive a call this morning guess_what nothing .
negative	all i can say is buy you pc etc from somebody_else as i will be doing in the future and also i will be recommending this to other people and buisness .
negative	trevor dodds
negative	had a very urgent parcel to be collected and they give a time_slot of between 0 . 00am to 00 . 00_hours .
negative	i received a text from them to say it would be collected before 00 . 00 but needless to say they never turned_up .
negative	you can '_t ring them so have to just use ' chat ' and all they do is rebook for the following_day , which is what we have done .
negative	they still_haven_'_t collected the parcel and i have now stayed in for two whole days which has cost money .
negative	will now have to pay someone_else to deliver the goods , probably hermes as they are supposed to be good .
negative	would never use this company again and wouldnt trust them to deliver the parcel let_alone pick it up !!!!!
negative	i put them on a par with citylink who very kindly lost a £_000 caravan awning !!!!
negative	!
negative	two boxes collected from a address in bolton ( caravan awning brand_new )
negative	only one containing the poles delivered the box with the awning is missing , value £_000
negative	still_awaiting a report , the courier in question is citylink .
negative	booked on friday to collect monday . nobody turned_up then recieved email_saying nobody here when they arrived , which was nonsense as i was here all day . re - booked for tuesday , same thing , re - booked wednesday , online_chat guy said they couldn_'_t find my address , i said they have my phone number , so please call me !!
negative	he said the couriers don_'_t have ' works phones ' and are under no obligation to use their own .. i just couldn_'_t believe it !!
negative	the guy on the chat - window said he ' d leave a message for the depot manager , but this took two attempts without_success . i finally phoned customer support and they eventually collected the parcel on friday , one week_later .
negative	i ' d been sending apologetic e_- mails to my customers all week , keeping them informed of events , and fortunately they were ok about it .
negative	it would have only taken one phone_call to me and this would '_ve been sorted within minutes , but with such appalling communication it dragged on all week .
negative	i find it unbelievable that a business can operate in this manner , let_alone be successful !
negative	i booked 0 months_ago for my parents and myself and husband to travel to rome in june_0000 .
negative	unfortunately my father has_become too ill to travel .
negative	i contacted expedia and they said they could refund all the hotel costs but only a portion of the flights and they quoted an amount i would be refunded .
negative	on the strength of that , i gave my parents their money back .
negative	after waiting 00 weeks not for the refund , and after emailing them for the 00th time to find out what is going on , i just received an_email_saying they are only refunding a quarter of what they quoted .
negative	now i certainly can '_t go to my parents and say they owe me hundreds of pounds .....
negative	i can '_t afford to carry the cost as my husband is battling cancer and doesn_'_t work .
negative	i have two jobs to try and make ends meet .
negative	do you think expedia care ????
negative	?
negative	no !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i am so angry and frustrated by this company but there doesn_'_t seem to be anyone who will take_responsibility for this .
negative	so many bad_reviews but they continue to rip us off .
negative	is there a governing body that can look into this ?
negative	:' o (
negative	i have forwarded my complaint to an ombudsman and a travel watch organisation , so fingers_crossed they can help .
negative	i first won items from 0st june , to date i have received about 00 items , i have won about 00 / 00 .
negative	i won a sony viao ( 0 months_ago ), this week , after several emails , they eventually tell me the item is no_longer in stock .
negative	they want to replace with a toshiba , they say this is an upgrade ( 0gb to 0gb ).
negative	after i refused , they replied stating this is in the terms & conditions that they can replace any item won with another and its not based on rrp , just an upgrade .
negative	does anyone know where i stand legally ?
negative	whenvever i find out that yodel are delivering my parcel ( of which i have many ) my heart sinks .
negative	on this occasion i received a text at 00 . 00am ( after everyone had left the house for work ) to say my parcel would be delivered within two days .
negative	at 00 . 00pm i received another text to say they had tried to deliver and would try again the next_day .
negative	does yodel really expect anyone to sit in and not make a noise ( in case you miss the knock on the door ) for two days ??
negative	[_external_reference_] can give you an_hour time_slot with previous warning , so why can '_t yodel ??
negative	i always leave a note on the door to say leave on the doorstep if no answer ( we are in a rural_area and our doorstep is very secure ) but only yodel are unable to carry out the customers wish '_s like their competitors .
negative	i have no issue whatsoever with the delivery guys - they are always polite and understanding as to my frustration and i understand they have strict rules , but i do have a real issue with yodel as a company .
negative	suggestions - give the customer a one to two hour time_slot with adequate notice and if the customer indicates a safe drop_off point then allow that delivery to be made .
negative	on this occasion it was a pair of flip_flops that took two delivery attempts !
negative	potential_customers of yodel - please think very carefully before using yodel as your delivery source as it could have a damaging effect on customers future_purchases with you .
negative	rant over !
negative	can i also add this is not the first issue with yodel and i ' m_sure it wont be the last unless they start listening to what their customers want ........
negative	the vent i ordered was promptly delivered but with 0 of the 0 components badly broken and parts missing .
negative	that was not plumbingforless ltd fault , perhaps ( though the packing was minimal ).
negative	the failure to respond to my emails asking what will happen to replace it is very disappointing .
negative	i have discovered today via a competitor that balance optics are no_longer trading but their website is still up and they are taking orders and people '_s money , but have no_intention of for filling any orders therefore do not buy from this company
negative	i am_currently using paypal to get a refund and i ' m hopefully paypal will also block them from using their service going forward
negative	having placed an order for food and cystease , i realised that 0 days had past and that i had recieved nothing .
negative	i emailed my complaint , chasing devilery only to be advised that as they had no stock of cystease they had not sent anything out , awaiting new supplies .
negative	at this point , we were out of both items and desperately required replenishment , therefore i cancelled the order , requested my paypal credit and that all my personal_data was removed from their system to prevent any unwanted correspondance , with a confirmation_email when complete .
negative	a further 0 days_later , after ordering and recieving goods from a competant supplier , no email , no credit .
negative	contacted them again and again requested the above .
negative	suggestion , your more professional opposition have systems which advise if there is no stock when ordering or at_least will email you the next_day .
negative	i have received my goods quicker with free delivery before you have even bothered to rectify your errors .
negative	suggest any pet_owners use " vet uk "
negative	visited last_night , a disgusting experiance , stinking , sticky , smelly carpets , uncomfortable seats ( superiour seats !!)
negative	game machines dumped inside next to door , very poorly managed .
negative	did my wife take me in ?
negative	what a horrible experiance .
negative	rubbish on the shelves , with misserable desperate people doing their weekly_shop , for anything cheap .
negative	not for me .
negative	i uppose that there is room for all in the market , but i prefer to pay for quality and good taste , ok yes , i am a snob .
negative	only thing i can agree on , is the rather stupid people on the tv programme , who dont understand_why they have missed their flight when the plane is still there .... berks !
negative	thats just what i thought the last time i had to go .... only because it was still open .
negative	they dont stock many brands , or they are " out " of everything you need .
negative	it is a good place however to meet strange smelly locals if your that way inclind .
negative	sorry , had real bad problems with their service and when you try to sort , you speak to someone going through the questions on the card , like an eastern robot ...... moved to o0 .
negative	i grew up believing that the bbc was the best service on the telly , although at the time there were only thre stations !
negative	now , raher than being the best , with actual news rather_than dramatised gossip , they have decided to try to compete with the other channels for worst programmes transmitted , oh and then repeated ..............
negative	i have never shopped at primark and never ( hopefully ) will .
negative	dont people think about where this stuff comes from ?
negative	have you thought how long it takes to make the fabric , make the shirt / jeans then theres the shipping cost from which ever poor country it comes from oh and transport in th uk to the shop and all for £ 0 or £ 0 ??
negative	?
negative	what are the children making them getting paid ???
negative	one or two bowls of rice ?
negative	come on people , get some ethics and principles or look the words up to know what they mean .....
negative	appauling service from both the shop and tellysales staff .
negative	mobile replaced eventually , with another one that didnt work .
negative	never had a problem with o0 or vodafone .
negative	grest waiting
negative	a long_story , cut short bought items jan_0000 parts missing , would not talk on phone , opened a ticket , took me until 00 / 00 /_0000 to get my cash_back , told blatent lies , tried every trick in the book not to refund me , agreed to pick goods up never did till 0 promised date , sent proof of refund lies never got it , had to email hundreds of times to get a reply , had to take a day off work to let them pick_up , now wont compensate me for my lost wages , will be putting up a website with all details of the problems with telephone and fax numbers plus phone numbers for all unhappy people who want to support me by telephoning and emailing them , will post here for all to see
negative	here is the email where the said they has passed the refund lies

negative	my mobile contract is with talktalk have had limited service or none for 0 days .
negative	customer service do not have any idea when normal service will be resumed they told me i would just have to be patient !!!!!
negative	perhaps they will have to be patient for their payment !
negative	i was told yesterday that it '_s vodafone '_s fault as they share a network .
negative	when i asked how long before it would be back to normal i was told i had to contact vodafone to find out .
negative	i am so angry surely my contract is with talktalk and they should find out when it will be sorted when i said this i was told they could not contact vodafone it was up to me !!
negative	we have had similar problems with our broadband ( very slow speeds ) which was also with them .
negative	we cancelled and went to bt and have a much_better service .
negative	my advice would be steer_clear !!!
negative	!
negative	ordered 0 remanufactured hp carts but all 0 would not work with either of my printers .
negative	have e_- mailed but no response .
negative	will no be using them again and would not recommend .
negative	so this is the complaint i have just sent them .
negative	i will post again re the rest of the story ... let '_s see if anyone will actually contact me and if the parcel will ever be collected
negative	dear_sir or madam ,
negative	i would like to complain_about the service i have received and am continuing to receive from your company re the above order .
negative	when i booked the delivery last thursday online it was booked for collection on friday .
negative	i organised someone to wait in all day on friday but no one came .
negative	over the weekend no one came either .
negative	on monday i found out how to contact your instant messanger help and was assured it was to be collected that day .
negative	you have guessed it no one came .
negative	on tuesday it had been deleted from your system and when i finally got through on the instant help i was told it would definitely be collected today .
negative	we have been waiting in all day and contacting your service only to find a card put through the door about 0pm - two of us were in the house and the bell did not ring .
negative	the name on the card is patricia and the number given is 00000000000 however the only facility is to send a text which has not been answered .
negative	all your online people keep doing is saying it will be rebooked for the next_day with no sense that this cannot go on forever and at some point complaints have to be escalated .
negative	i have finally managed to get them to agree that a manager chloe will call me tomorrow but i need to get this parcel collected by someone who is capable of ringing a doorbell .
negative	excuse me if i sound angry it is because i am .
negative	i hope that someone can contact me urgently on my mobile tomorrow to reassure me that someone is aware of this problem and something is being done .
negative	i ordered a samsung_galaxy_s0 on the 0th_dec expecting it to be here for my daughters xmas_present , after a number of calls and emails i still havent had a answer to where it is , i feel i have been_scammed
negative	no need to repeat all that has_gone before , enough to mention
negative	incompetent engineers ; lies from the help - centre ; money taken to which they are not entitled .
negative	without a doubt the worst company i have ever had to deal with .
negative	i give them one star because it is not possible to give less .
negative	ordered a gerbera bouquet on 0th_feb for delivery on 0th_feb .
negative	bouquet was for a dear friend '_s 00st_birthday .
negative	the flowers were not delivered on the 0th .
negative	i communicated via online " chat " on 0th towards the end of day , was informed they would be delivered by 0pm .
negative	they were not .
negative	i then communicated via chat again on the 0th asking where they were .
negative	was informed there had been a problem with the delivery van , but that they would be delivered today , and was given a £ 0 voucher_code as an_apology .
negative	my friend has just called to say the flowers have been delivered ... and they are dead , leaves all dropped_off and whole_thing squashed .
negative	how horrible , embarrassing and sad .
negative	she is taking a photo of them for me so i can take it up with iflorist .
negative	this was the first time i have used them ( usually use interflora ), and very definitely the last .
negative	do not use this company if you want a reliable service .
negative	i am so disappointed .
negative	i had a line only contract for several_years with bt / o0 for my mobile_phone , my phone broke so i chose a new phone and 0 year contract in the local o0 shop .
negative	i had paid for all the years with a direct_debit from my barclaycard , i was told i could no_longer do this so provided my bank details for direct_debit .
negative	first problem , noticed over christmass , the internet was not available on the new phone without my house wifi .
negative	after christmas0 . 0 hours on " chat " did not resolve this so decided i would visit the o0 shop when i had time .
negative	a couple of days_later i had a text saying i owed money , now i couldnot make phone_calls .
negative	chat again , 00_mins later , and 0 connections to chat i had my phone back and internet_connection on the mobile .
negative	monday_morning i had a letter from o0 , perhaps an_apology , no a default notice stating i owed £ 0 . 00 and i must pay this within 00 days .
negative	if the action required was not taken within 00 days further action would be taken .
negative	i rang the payment difficuilties phone number and asked them to explain the notice , all i heard was i owed £_00 . 00 .
negative	i asked what i had not done when i signed the new contract that put me in this situation .
negative	the answer was perhaps i did not have enough money in the bank .
negative	after assuring the gent on the phone i did , he concluded it was my banks fault for not telling_me it takes could take00 days for a direct_debit to be set_up .
negative	so if you want customer service , uninerupted smooth transition or any sort of sence from support , do not choose o0 .
negative	couldn_'_t access webmail for several accounts under one domain .
negative	although i hadn_'_t changed the password i thought i would reset the passwords from the control_panel but the credentials i was using wouldn_'_t work .
negative	using the chat support , ' john ' got me access to the control_panel but the mailboxes were not there .
negative	they had been deleted by 000reg hence the error .
negative	apparently i had free mailboxes either as an error or part of some legacy account .
negative	john said :-
negative	" we understand that is not your fault however please_note that this was a system error and the emails used were free of charge instead of paying for them .
negative	we have previously written to advise you that your account exceeded its mailbox quota and that unless addressed , some of your email_addresses would be suspended after 00 days and deleted after 00 "
negative	this is utter_rubbish and i have had no such communication from you either via the post or email .
negative	deleting mailboxes in such a wholesale , carefree manner is unacceptable .
negative	i only have a couple of domains with you but also run a web agency and will be moving mine and all future business away from you .
negative	thanks .
negative	if any of the " customer service " personnel worked face to face with the public they would be punched in the mouth for sure .
negative	i spent £_000 on an all - in - one pc and paid for nominated day delivery .
negative	it never arrived .
negative	i had to chase them constantly over the next couple of days to be told " it was despatched from our supplier 00_minutes ago " yeah_right !
negative	when it did eventually arrive the machine constantly rebooted with a " error 0000 no os ( operating_system )".
negative	i again chased for days for a return number which when eventually it arrived , brazenly stated that i would have to pay £_00 to have the pile of garbage returned .
negative	unbelievable .
negative	i phoned them and was told in no uncertain terms either pay or leave it where it is .
negative	this place gives internet trading a bad name and to think comet went_bust trying to compete against these ill - mannered thieves .
negative	at_least comet knew what customer service was .
negative	i was in the market for a few pc '_s for my business but their attitude has probably lost them £ 0 , 000 in sales .
negative	to the directors of laptops_direct - you need to do an " undercover boss " episode .
negative	to prospective_customers - do yourself a favour go and soil your underwear , you '_ll have much more fun !!
negative	oh and i too think 0 star is too much but it '_s the minimum .
negative	i wish i had read_reviews of purely gadgets before ordering through tesco direct .
negative	an order for samsung_galaxy nexus phone placed on 00 september is sitll marked ' to be dispatched .
negative	i cancelled the order on 00th_october as it was destined for a birthday on 00th .
negative	i am still_waiting for a refund .
negative	tesco direct should be_ashamed to be associated with this company .
negative	i am not impressed with tesco direct shifting the responsibility to the customer when things go_wrong .
negative	there should be the option of selecting 0_stars for such lack of customer service .
negative	i had a very bad_experience with this company .
negative	no one was there to greet me when i arrived and their telephone lines were busy .
negative	i called over and over to find out when they were arriving for me and could get no answer .
negative	in the end i had to leave or miss my flight .
negative	had to leave my car in short_stay car_park which i then had to pay for on return .
negative	the company are now refusing to refund me what i paid them despite not giving me any service .
negative	maybe if it goes_smoothly they are great but what makes a good company is how they treat you when there is a problem .
negative	booked & paid for a mobile appointment - received a call next_day to say we cant make it .
negative	then said it will be up to 0 days before i get my refund .
negative	dont take payment until you are sure you can provide the service kwik_fit
negative	i ordered some products for my birds but they have not arrived after 0 weeks .
negative	i have been trying to use the live_chat , the telephone_number and sending messages .
negative	i have had no reply from any of these systems .
negative	i am about to make a complaint to paypal .
negative	i wish i had checked this site first , i don_'_t know how this company is staying in business .
negative	set_up direct_debit with tesco credit_card in april for full monthly_payment .
negative	got interest added on in may and june statement .
negative	got interest credit back immediately , after costly 0000 phone_call to tesco credit_card call_centre .
negative	cancel my direct_debit today .
negative	never pay tesco credit_card using direct_debit facility .
negative	their system is flawed .
negative	when applying , there is no clear warning such as ,” you will receive a message on your xxxcard statement when your direct_debit has_been set_up .
negative	until then , please continue to pay your account in the usual way .”
negative	the direct_debit guarantee stipulates ,
negative	if you request tesco bank to collect a payment , confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request .
negative	even_though in my may statement : your nominated bank_account will be debited with the full balance on 00 / 00 /_0000 or soon after .
negative	to my horror , in my june statement , i still have £ 0 . 00 interest added on for not paying on time previously .
negative	just received my phone bill today , £ 0 . 00 ex - vat to tesco credit_card call_centre .
negative	in may £ 0 . 00 ex - vat to tesco credit_card call_centre .
negative	one week ago i notified virgin_mobile that my mobile_phone did not receive any signal in my local area .
negative	one week on , the problem has not been solved .
negative	however , i have discovered that 0g network is working_fine .
negative	cheeky virgin_mobile has quietly reduced my mobile signal in my local area to 0g , while many of their competitors have upgraded to 0g for their networks .
negative	yesterday my online_banking was blocked .
negative	reluctantly i phoned santander ’_s helpline to unblock it .
negative	their helpline number , 0000 , cost me money .
negative	to my horror , a credit agency , experian , used by santander has not been informed that i was a santander customer .
negative	another excuse came up by santander fraudulent department was that i recently changed my mobile_phone .
negative	when i challenged the definition of the word , ' recently ', and they said anything up to 0 months .
negative	so , i immediately reminded them that new and better smart phones coming out every few_months .
negative	anyhow , i have got a 000 current account , paying £ 0 monthly_fee .
negative	so it seems that not only i have to pay a regular monthly_fee for a current account , but also i need to pay extra phone bill .
negative	however , i have demanded a refund of £ 0 .
negative	the refund of £ 0 would just cover the cost of phoning their helpline department .
negative	it covers neither the cost of santander providing a poor service , nor feeling of humiliation , embarrassment and helplessness suffered by me .
negative	done my first order online with ocado .
negative	their computer is a bit strange .
negative	i bought 0 colgate toothpaste and 00 pronamel toothpaste .
negative	ocado computer could not distinguish the two toothpaste when both were doing promotion .
negative	the helpline is not helpful .
negative	so i have cancelled my order within the hour , and no more online shopping with ocado for me .
negative	i placed an order on july 0th 0000 for 0 pairs of work trousers and a pair of knee pads , everything that has happened to shaun happened the same to me .
negative	they answered my call once ( after 0 weeks ) and promised delivery within the next 0 days , i am still_waiting on 0th_september .
negative	i would never use this company again .
negative	and i have requested a full_refund , i will get my work trousers from krowmark embroidery .
negative	i have just left another message on their answer phone asking them to get back to me , i doubt they will but it ’_s worth a try .
negative	it looks_like i will have to take this down the legal route
negative	in common with the majority of others , you must avoid this company , i have waited 0 months now for an accurate bill that reflects my usage .
negative	i had smart_meters installed sadly they were not .
negative	i had them taken out and replaced with ' dummy ' meters but am still being sent estimated bills that relate to the smart_meters removed 0 months_ago .
negative	i am now in dispute with the company and while the dispute is ongoing i am building up arrears ( which is worrying )
negative	i have asked for compensation and been advised that compensation would not normally be discussed mid - dispute .
negative	i have contacted the ombudsman .
negative	unbelievably i am reluctant to switch suppliers because for me , given my postcode , first_utility remains on a cost basis , the cheapest .
negative	however sometimes cost is not the only factor !
negative	!
negative	failed to collect parcel twice rebooking both times , if you can avoid using them do so , no compensation for my wasted time .
negative	this company have absolutly no after_sales support .... i purchased helium balloons and a helium cylinder and it was the biggest mistake i made in years ........ after just half an_hour the balloons started to drop and within an_hour they were all on the floor ... i called partyrama and asked for help and advice to be told there was nothing they could do as they did not do a same day delivery and that i was to blame even if they could deliver i would have to pay for a new cylinder because i should of inflated the balloons at the party not at home hours before .... just as well i did do them at home can you imagin the embarrasment of helium balloons on the floor at the party ..... i suggest you stay_clear of this company ... i will never use them ever again ......
negative	ordered christmas_gifts from them , money taken from my account immediately , no goods have arrived .
negative	tried to email got a response stating the email could not be delivered , tried to phone got a message_stating the number was unavailable .
negative	will never order online again ..... i am gutted , have lost money i have worked hard for all year .........:(
negative	these_people are frauds - do not buy from them !!!
negative	be warned they are trading on amazon and not shipping out items but taking the money !
negative	they trade under cresentdirect on amazon - you have been_warned
negative	i traded an iphone0c with cex on saturday for a lumia 0000 which was faulty so i took it back on sunday as no other way to contact them , they offered me a replacement phone coming from s different shop , said it would be delivered tues / wed well post has_been and no phone also i dont have any receipts as the blackpool shop kept them i need someone to ring me or im contacting the police as im out of pocket to the tune of £_000 this is just stupid no way of getting intouch other than having to go into_town to the shop , getting the feeling i have been ripped_off big time i have given them until 0pm today to contact me or im going to have the iphone blocked
negative	spent 00_minutes in carphone_warehouse in blackpool bought the gemini tablet online before_xmas for a gift less_than a month later packs up customer service say take it back to your local_store which i did today guess_what cos its out of 00 days cant get money back but if an item is faulty by law under the sale of goods_act im entitled to a refund ,, noooo not at carphone stand around and wait while staff yawn , text , mess with their phones , then told we have to send it away for repair , but wait ( another 00_mins ) we dont repair that tablet we replace it ,,, but i dont want a replacement as its crap and will break again , well thats our policy and thats all were offering , well i want to speak to manager cos under the sale of goods_act , remember that ::::::: all goods must be :
negative	as_described
negative	of satisfactory quality and
negative	fit for purpose
negative	if they ' re not , the retailer is in breach of contract and you have a claim under the sale of goods_act .
negative	well i wait a bit more to speak to the man in charge only to be told we can only offer a replacement ,, oh and now the same tablet is cheaper and to add_insult to injury you dont get the difference back in what you paid and what we now sell it at ,,,,, so i now have same tablet but for more money plus i know it will be going back cos its rubbish and will break again , so i came home made a complaint to their customer service department on the phone but she was reading from the same script ,,,, lesson to be learned , if your buying from them they cant do enough for you , in - between the yawns and the texting their mates , but if you want to take back a faulty item take a flask and a blanket cos you will be there a while , and dont expect them to adhere to the law cos its not there policy ,,,,,, the end ( well for now anyway )
negative	where do i begin in january this year me and my husband decided wed like a change from the car we had a chevrolet kalos which we also purchased from stoneacre and said we never would again after the problems we had with the kalos anyway we thought wed try them again what a mistake they couldnt do us a deal on what we wanted so the salesman phoned us up the following_day said hed found us a nice car that he could do us a deal on so off we went to look at it it was a renault megane it was lovely so we bought it what a mistake the car went in about 0 times first time it was just little things like heater control and a few bulbs didnt work when the car was repaired we picked it up only to find that the mechanics had damaged the centre console so it went back to have a new one fitted got the car back again had it a few_days and the gearbox started having problems so the car went back to be repaired again this continued for the next 0 month in the end finance and stoneacre decided we could change the car to a fiat panda low and behold this has_been a nightmare in and out of stoneacres for repairs only had the car 0 months and its been in for repair 0 times already to which there saying they cant find anything wrong with it but we get it back and the following_day the problem starts again we paid for a life time guarantee on the megane only to find out we had to pay another life time guarantee when we got the panda bearing in mind we only had the megane 0 months i just dont think this is fair why couldnt they have transferred the guarantee from the megane onto the panda for goodwill but no they wont they have ended costing us more money because the panda was less money than the megane the situation now is were so fed_up because they now want us to take the car in and let the mechanic have it a few_days to see if the problem occurs while in his hands or they will buy the car back for a reduced price of what we paid for it we are now looking elsewhere as the problem is still persisting all we want is a car we can rely_on dont think weve been treated fair at all
negative	ordered many items over bank_holiday and reserved online , said to collect on sunday 00 / 0 / 00 , however store closed when i arrived . so i then went and placed order online only to find now my account debited and no items received , they gave very poor excuse saying " problems with web orders " be warned do not purchase from the homebase website . will now be taking up refund to my card thru my credit_card_provider , simply unacceptable customer service .
negative	hi ordered 0000 premium business_cards , sent 0 emails no replies at all , only automated receipt emails . paid nearly_£_000 and used 00_%_discount_code and free_postage but was charged postage and no discount was applied , tried several emails to customer service and no replies received . regards shaun jackson . excelarate driving school .
negative	i had the misfortune on an offer from photobox , spent 0 hours on web , trying to upload_photos for calender , speaking on chat numerous_times with tracie currie , poor customer service as saying will not upload_photos from google chromebook ? saying i need to try different computer . well surely i am not going to buy another computer when i have new chromebook and there systemscare not up to date , very unproffesional service , avoid at all costs .
negative	phoned up for simple fridge hinge , no replies for 0 hours , then phoned to to clarify and they were emailing someone_else on totally different email address , very confused as to whether the part for my bosch fridge was the correct_part despite all info given to them on the product number , so to this end went online to another company part , ordered within minutes and £_00 cheaper , so i would say avoid this company .
negative	ordered flowers they use yodel courier , never arrived on day promised . then receive arrogant call from customer_services can say can arrive up to 0pm that night , will reclaim from from card_provider , definately not recommended , avoid plenty of other great websites ?
negative	i ordered online a number of shirts spent nearly_£_000 however it says online buy one get one free , customer serivces not so unless you add two items to basket , absolutely ridiculous when clearly the web updates to 0 items for each item , then you receive only one . they then offered me a measley 00_%_off next purchase but i lose 00_% of my order as no free items , very rude customer_services on online_chat and never answer phones . avoid this company be warned shop elsewhere online read all below negative_reviews . digraceful .
negative	hi ordered items in one order 0 items despite going into store after receiving email to say to collect on two items arrived , rude staff instore and online help unbelievable poor , like trying to contact india , in short close your online account . dont_bother with debenhams much far_superior customer service on the high_street
negative	hi
negative	i bought 0 for 0 inks for my kodak esp0000 & have just used a compatible from you & the picture is all red & white stripes down faces .
negative	it worked_fine with the kodaks .
negative	i also phoned you after i had sent in my order to say i didn_'_t realize that i had to put in a code for the 0 for 0 offer so i paid full price .
negative	the gent i talked to said it would come off my next order but i don_'_t have an account with you as i paid through amazon so can find nothing from you .
negative	order no .
negative	000 - 0000000 - 0000000 , this is the second time i have sent this as no answer from you by email
negative	please avoid this company like the plague !!!
negative	ordered a acer tablet for my sons xmas_present , they sent a email setting out the dispatch time and delivery times , as this time ( 0 days ) passed i then emailed for find out what was happening , but just received an_automated_reply , i then read the reviews on the company and started to panic !!
negative	lots of people were or had been in my boat .
negative	eventually got through to their customer_services agents , what a joke that is !!
negative	cancelled the order and was promised a full_refund within 0 days , 0 days and numerous_emails later i am still_waiting !!!
negative	what a shame they can offer very competitive_prices but their customer_services badly lets them down .
negative	avoid !
negative	!
negative	i was about to but a washer from ao . com , very attractive price , but here '_s the rub .
negative	to get an evening delivery £_00 . 00
negative	to get removal of old washer £ 0 . 00
negative	to get disconnect of old machine £ 0 . 00
negative	to install new machine £_00 . 00
negative	this is the extra_cost of £_00 . 00 suddenly not so attractive , some argos offers include all this for free so looks_like my business is going to argos .
negative	also argos offer 00 month interest free credit using their argos card .
negative	why don_'_t you do this ao . com
negative	had a thief smash my window this afternoon , i called my insurance who said i must use autoglass .
negative	i called them at 0000 today , they suggested they would call to fix tonight between 0000 and 0000 .
negative	this is a totally unreasonable .
negative	i told them not to bother !!!
negative	! they really dont have a proper out of hours service be warned if you use them they cant really care offering stupid times like that .
negative	i have used this service before and had a good service but not this time .
negative	i called them 00_mins before i arrived at manchester terminal 0 only to be told we are very busy as this time and you will have to wait 00 - 00_mins outise the terminal .
negative	i mean they know we are coming and at wha time .
negative	the police were not impressed .
negative	they dont like you wating more than a few_minutes .
negative	when we got back this morning i was told we are very busy and only have one driver and you are 0rd in the queue .
negative	i waited 00_mins at 0000 this moring in the cold .
negative	when i called them they were verty rude .
negative	they also had clocked up over 00 miles on my car so not so impressed this time .
negative	i bought some verifocals in may 0000 and had them within a week .
negative	they were not comfortable so i tried to get a refund as their policy .
negative	however , they don_'_t tell you that they will not refund for lenses which is most of the cost .
negative	i ended_up ordering a new pair with a partial_refund for the frames and paying the cost of the lenses again .
negative	it took_ages to get these back and they did not have the reactions lenses nor the polarizing lenses i had paid for .
negative	i sent them back again and eventually_settled for a partial_refund and to them sent back as they were , as it was now three_months since my first purchase and i was not willing to wait any longer .
negative	because i can '_t even get a response from their so called customer service team .
negative	i placed an order for two items - syringes and melolin pads ( basic medical items ).
negative	got an_email the following_day saying part of the order was out of stock .
negative	tried to call cs - on hold for ages so thought i would email .
negative	the link in the email didn_'_t work and the email address it was sent from said it was an unmonitored one - but it was the same email address given to contact the sales / cs team .
negative	i eventually got sent a link to a ticket that had been opened on 00 . 00 . 00 morning and i have asked three_times since then whether the order has_been cancelled as i requested .
negative	no response in 00_hours and their online_chat is a total_joke .
negative	after four minutes it logged out of the chat box and an_email template popped_up .
negative	how this company makes money is a wonder .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	if a medical company can '_t stock something as basic as a syringe , there '_s no hope .
negative	ordered a next working day delivery item for my holiday and specifically made arrangements to be in to receive it and then get an_email from evans telling_me that they have kindly refunded my delivery charge because this useless bunch of &^%^&$ can '_t even do their jobs - and not for the first time either .
negative	i '_ve told evans i won_'_t be shopping with them again and if i see a delivery service that offers hermes as the courier , then i won_'_t bother .
negative	i wish there was an offer of zero_stars as that '_s all this shambles of a company is worth .
negative	i booked online to have my exhaust checked and when i turned_up , the man at the garage was very rude and said i didn_'_t have an_appointment because i hadn_'_t phoned .
negative	nowhere did it say i had to phone when booking .
negative	he then checked their computer system to see that the booking was on and he discovered that it was .
negative	no apology , just another tirade about no - one had phoned him .
negative	i felt like walking out and going elsewhere !
negative	he said to drive the car in and he ' d have a look , which he duly did after 00_minutes or so .
negative	the he gave me a quote which was £_00 more than the quote i ' d been given at my local_garage .
negative	i said no thanks .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again !
negative	my 00 year_old father has had a pride 0 mph scooter for some years which has_been excellent in operation for him .
negative	however now he has stopped driving a car , he asked me to source a small 0 mph scooter suitable for taking onto a bus .
negative	in doing some research i came_across proridermobility . com .
negative	their website says all the right things i . e “ as seen on bbc top gear ”, “ famous reputation by providing the highest_level of customer service and after_sales service in the land ”, “ priority to any sale is the peace of mind which the customer can have ” and “ 0 star back up service and warranty second to none ”.
negative	these self ( deluded ) awarded references are , in my opinion , completely false and very misleading as i will now tell .
negative	as there are size / specification restrictions for taking a scooter onto public_transport , i telephoned pro rider and spoke to [_name ] in sales to get advice on a suitable model .
negative	i explained what was required and for what purpose and on her advice , i decided on the pro rider elite portable scooter at £_000 . 00 as she said it was certainly fit for purpose required .
negative	the scooter arrived in packaging that needed to be cut open to gain_access .
negative	fully_charged my father took the scooter 00 yards along the pavement in his cul - de - sac , so he could cross a small side road with drop kerbs .
negative	the scooter went down the first drop kerb ok but ground to a complete halt when trying to get up the opposite drop kerb .
negative	now this is a perfectly normal low gradient ( 0 : 00 ) drop kerb but this scooter was unable to drive up it !!
negative	my father was then stuck on the scooter which was firmly stuck having grounded itself on its two stabiliser wheels !
negative	incidentally my father weighs 00 stone so not exactly heavy .
negative	i then tried the same manoeuvre taking a faster run up but the same thing happened to me – stuck with no ability to go back or forward !!
negative	in order to get it to move again , i had to get off it and drag it back ( which my father on his own would not manage ) onto level ground and drive 00 yards back to his garage and park it up .
negative	totally not fit for purpose – utterly_useless !
negative	my father agreed with me that the scooter be returned with an explanation as to why it was not fit for purpose and request a full_refund as this was only 0 days after delivery .
negative	i rang and spoke to another sales staff_member [_name ], who said the scooter “ should ” be ok for the intended use .
negative	i said it was not and said we wanted to reject it and could they arrange to collect it .
negative	no was the answer they would not !
negative	i asked if the carrier they used to deliver it could be contacted to help and i was told no again .
negative	we would have to re - pack it and get it to them ourselves .
negative	i therefore packed it myself and arranged for a courier at a cost to us of £_00 . 00 to deliver it back to proridermobility . com
negative	a few_days_later proridermobility . com wrote back to say they had received the scooter back in a dirty and damaged condition !
negative	i then rang their general manager , a man called [_name ].
negative	he claimed that the damage was sufficient that they would take £_000 off the price paid .
negative	i asked for photos as i said that the scooter was clean and had only been ridden for a few yards .
negative	the photos he sent were not very good but showed a couple of scuffs marks – not £_000 worth of damage !!!
negative	about a week_later my father got a partial_refund of £_000 . 00 .
negative	so we ended_up with a lot of aggravation , wasted hours of our time which we paid £_000 for !!!
negative	.... and still had no scooter .
negative	i feel very let_down by this experience with proridermobility . com so before you buy from them rather_than another supplier be warned !!!
negative	on my experience they are a company who are happy to take your money but when things turn out like those we experienced they don_’ t want to know or help and will then find a way to not refund in full .
negative	good points : absolutely none at all .
negative	negative points :
negative	0 .
negative	£_000 is low and it shows in the quality of the prorider scooter which is low grade in design & finish .
negative	0 .
negative	the performance was appalling not able to go up the smallest of gradients .
negative	0 .
negative	the shopping_basket had such a poor fitting it fell_off at the first small bump in the pavement .
negative	0 .
negative	proridermobility . com are not a customer service focused company – by any stretch .
negative	we both feel extremely let_down by this awful experience with proridermobility .
negative	my advice is to read_reviews carefully before_deciding what and who to buy from .
negative	perhaps a safer and even better option when buying a mobility_scooter is to go to a local retailer rather_than buying something untried online from a company who could lead to the type of problems we encountered .
negative	you should then be able to test_drive and make a satisfactory purchase .
negative	this is what we ended_up doing and my father is delighted with the small shoprider monaco scooter bought from the well stocked retailer ‘ the mobility shop ’ in west moors , ferndown , dorset .
negative	this scooter performs really well and incidentally has no problem getting up the same drop - kerb the prorider failed at .
negative	he has now made his first trip taking it on the bus with ease .
negative	i expected my review to end on this more positive_note but i ’ m sorry to say it does not !!
negative	having posted my review at the beginning of january_0000 , my father received a telephone_call out of the blue from the general manager at proridermobility .
negative	he claimed that the review was libelous and said they were considering legal_action !!
negative	my father told him that the review could not be libellous as it was the truth .
negative	a little while later he rang my father again to say that he had now spoken to his staff and he now had a truthful understanding of the situation .
negative	( did that mean the scooter we had returned was not even the dirty , damaged one they had previously referred to ?!)
negative	they were now prepared to offer my father £_000 .
negative	my father told him he was happy with that .
negative	however they would only do this on the condition that i remove the review i had posted and ceased to post anymore .
negative	the gm wanted to speak to me which we did the next_day .
negative	he agreed with me that my review was not made in haste and was thought through well but reiterated the conditional offer .
negative	i explained why i felt that they should be to cover the consequential loss of expenses and compensate me for the day off i had to take and the 000 mile_round_trip to sort this out .
negative	i said an additional £_000 was more than fair .
negative	as it was not his decision he said he would get back to me .
negative	but he never did !
negative	some days_later my father received two emails a few_days apart_from mr_simon betts managing_director of proridermobility full of incorrect statements but saying that as communication had broken down they were taking_legal proceedings and considering contacting the police regarding my review !!!!
negative	i decided enough was enough and wrote to the md mr_simon betts of proridermobility as this was a complete nonsense and i did not take kindly to the bullying tactics of this md simon betts .
negative	i spent a considerable time and effort to spell out all the inaccuracies in his ridiculous email .
negative	in return i got a email back from mr_simon betts spouting more rubbish but the threats had now got serious .
negative	mr_simon betts was now accusing me of blackmail and threatening to sue for “ substantial damages ” as i had not removed my review !!!
negative	some 0 weeks_later i have not heard a thing from their solicitors or the police or mr_simon betts .
negative	to say all of this fiasco and accusations has vexed me would be an_understatement .
negative	i have no_intention of being bullied into removing my review as it is 000_% accurate and the deplorable way my father and i have been treated is exactly why the review will remain live .
negative	do not buy from proridermobility . com they are awful and their product is too .
negative	i notice the website for this company is ' under maintenance '.
negative	i hope this means it will no_longer be used to take orders and money for furniture which will never be delivered or refunded .
negative	i have been appalled to keep reading_reviews from others like me who are considerably out of pocket because of the unfair trading practices of the owner of this company .
negative	i switched my electricity supply from scottish_power to isupply energy on 00 november .
negative	i have been chasing scottish_power ever_since to , first , accept my final meter_readings , second , close my account and refund £_000 . 00 .
negative	meter_readings finally accepted on 00 november , but account is still open and no refund cheque issued .
negative	looks_like a deliberate series of delays to me .
negative	day 0 : 0 . 00am ordered flowers for same day delivery to office address ( 0 . 00am email_confirmation of order ).
negative	0pm delivery promised - £ 0 . 00 paid + £_00 for flowers .
negative	0pm - no flowers .
negative	email to customer service ......... nothing .
negative	0pm leaves office with no flowers , having to stop at some florist to get flowers !!
negative	another £_00 spend .
negative	next evening reply from customer service that flowers had been delivered to security who had promised to see i got the flowers the next_day , as flowers delivered at 0 . 00pm .
negative	wrote back and told customer service and demanding a full_refund as non - delivery is breech of contract .
negative	of course have not heard_anything back for 0 days ..........
negative	summary : don_'_t waste your time and money on same day delivery as it will become an expensive mistake as i ended_up paying nearly_£_00 for flowers in total .
negative	never in my life experienced_such bad service or poor attitude .
negative	buy anywhere_else and don_'_t trust the reviews - they are very selected and does not give a true picture .
negative	do they actually deliver ?
negative	the southampton branch doesn_'_t appear to do so .
negative	my 00 year_old mother has_been waiting for two_weeks for a package from gap .
negative	from the tracking it seems to leave the depot and return to the depot on a daily_basis .
negative	if it was possible to award it no stars then that '_s what it deserves .
negative	if i ' d realised that gap were using yodel i wouldn_'_t have helped her order from them as i refuse to purchase from any company using yodel based on previous experience .
negative	however , the package i received from gap ( not out of southampton ) arrived in good time .
negative	they took my money and even_though i kept asking for the tickets they cancelled the day before .
negative	these were tickets i had bought for my son and husband as a present .
negative	they were extremely rude to me when i rang them and hung_up on me .
negative	had to fight to get my money back .
negative	only when my bank intervened did this happen .
negative	i was left feeling stressed and angry and stupid for having let myself fall for such a scam .
negative	i booked a flight 0 weeks_ago with bravofly , within 0 / 0 hour i realised i had made a mistake with the time so phoned and cancelled the booking .
negative	i was told ' no problem ' we will refund you asap but will be charged 00 euros for admin .
negative	ok i said , that was acceptable even_though i had already been charged £_00 ( 0 % for using credit_card )
negative	i have phoned 0 times now , ( calls are to switzerland ) each time i am told the refund is being_processed .
negative	i have phoned the airline ( united airlines ) who have told me the flight was never charged to bravofly .......
negative	so basically they have had my money for 0 weeks now , not had to pay for anything at all .
negative	i have now put a claim into my credit_card company to get a refund .
negative	i know it was my fault with the time mistake , but it does not take this long to rectify a problem .
negative	it '_s a front for collecting money .
negative	we also had a call where they volunteered to take the details from another website and gave us a cheap offer .
negative	we never had an enquiry as a result and they then took a full subscription from my credit_card for the following year .
negative	if you do try and use the website to find a property the only search criteria is by country !
negative	absolutely_useless .
negative	who is goint to trawl pages of properties until the find the odd one or two that meet their criteria .
negative	doesn_'_t bode well if you are listed on page 00 !
negative	!
negative	stay_away from these
negative	i purchased some electronic cigarettes how ever money taken in july and to this date nothing in post and the company who was posting told me when i asked why delay apparently waiting for goods from china weeks go by nothing same excuse and then ring again bizarrely now no one answers .
negative	i look at their web_page and strangely_enough they are on a fourth floor in a building in london .
negative	contact voucher and they say give them 00hours to respond blah_blah .
negative	well i would not buy from them if they gave a holiday for £_00 .
negative	all i want is a refund .
negative	basically dont be conned like me .
negative	went with anglian as a respected long established company to have all upvc windows replaced .
negative	god do i wish i hadn_'_t .
negative	product fitted and day after reported some snagging faults .
negative	two windows fitted wrong so couldn_'_t open them without damaging and another had a large scratch .
negative	also reported the fact that the windows rattled .
negative	despite_repeated calls and letters even to the ceo they refused to discuss or fix the rattling .
negative	was told the scratch could be ' buffed / polished out ' stated i wanted the window pain replaced repeatedly .
negative	five and a half months later finally two windows fixed , but the fitter said no way could the scratch be buffed out .
negative	so by the time the glass is replaced it will be six_months down the road .
negative	completely_unacceptable .
negative	appalling customer service , if i could give zero_stars i would have done so .
negative	would recommend everyone steers clear of their shoddy service .
negative	this company is absolutely_useless run by a load of cowboys why people don_'_t use royal_mail more often is beyond me and out of all the alternatives this lot of morons are the worst even worse_than yodel would you believe and they are rude with it , if i could give them half a star i would , had i known my amazon order was coming through them i ' d have paid extra for royal_mail , but at_least i know next time , ovoid this company at all costs .
negative	phoned up to confrim that my parcel was out for delivery the next_day after ordering i was told it was tracked as " out for delivery " so i stayed in .
negative	late_afternoon as it had not arrived i phoned again and asked for the tracking_number which they gave me , but when i tracked the parcel it showed it had not even left the hub in london .
negative	i waisted the best part of the day waiting in as i was given the wrong information about the progress of the parcel .
negative	i phoned again and asked why i had been told it was out for delivery when it was clearly not and i found i was dealing_with one of the most useless rudest company '_s i had ever delt with .
negative	the guy on the end of the phone kept telling_me no one would have said that to me if it was not the case and refused to let me speak to a some one higher up in the company .
negative	he kept telling_me that i had made my mind up any way and what was the point of talking to any body else .
negative	i am presuming he was the one that told me it was out for delivery in the first place .
negative	he also kept blaming parcelforce , but my problem was not with parcelforce being late just the fact i was waiting for something that was never going to arrive when i was told to expect it before 0pm .
negative	on nov 0 0000 i bought a compressor via_ebay for £_00 . 00 gbp .
negative	i recieved the compressor totally broken .
negative	i tried to contact them and they finally told me to send it back .
negative	i paid an extra 00 euros to send their rubbish back .
negative	they never bothered to offer any replacement and / or compensation .
negative	of course they don_'_t bother answering any of my e_- mails .
negative	it seems that they do not understand the meaning of after_sales support , or even respect !
negative	my wife had to renew her passport recently and it arrived ( eventually ) via this excuse for a company .
negative	the driver failed to deliver on day one , unable to operate the doorbell .
negative	so , we visited the website which was unresponsive .
negative	tried again 0 hours_later and eventually re - booked delivery ( they try hard at this point to charge you for accelerating the service ).
negative	passport was delivered the next_day after the driver phoned , again unable to operate the doorbell
negative	well , today we have ( not ) received yet another home office document .
negative	so , back to the website - it tells_me the ticket number and postcode i have entered don_'_t match ( hello ...
negative	i have your card dx group , you were here at this postcode at some point this morning ).
negative	after much messing_around on the phone (" why not pay to accelerate your delivery ...") re - booked for tomorrow .
negative	what is the government thinking_about !
negative	passports , id cards and such like are important documents , you need them to get on planes and so on .
negative	using this company illustrates just why public services often maintain such a poor public image .
negative	one also wonders , given the nature of what they are delivering whether there is actually intent to get you to pay for delivery ?
negative	got a plane to catch ?
negative	ordered a simple treatment product for furniture .
negative	the manufacturers price was on the container at £_00 . 00 .
negative	however , gw charged £_00 . 00 .
negative	so delivery is not free , it costs £_00 per item .
negative	it took 00 days for delivery , when order acknowledgement said 0 - 0 days , and when it arrived the packaging was crazy .
negative	a box 0m high , by about 00cm by 00cm and what was inside - s small spray containers .
negative	certainly would not order again .
negative	poor service , difficult to communicate with , if it was the customers choice i ' d never use this company .
negative	for customer service , ease of use etc our experience is that the post_office is best organisation to receive parcels from - the flexibility in picking_up your parcel you get if you are out at work is great with po ,
negative	dhl not too bad and you can get to speak to a local human_being easily without going on line but yodel - rubbish - they even have to ask the local posties where the delivery addresses are .
negative	the aftercare staff are no help what so ever , i booked a car with rentalcars . com was told everything was covered , when i got to my desination i was chanrged another 000_euros , i have tried to call customer service and was told i had to email them , i received an_email back to be told they would contact me again within 00 days , very poor service do not use them unless you want to be ripped_off
negative	bad customer service and no refund for returned goods , until there were threatened with court_action .
negative	they advertise very cheap goods that they do not have , just to get people '_s orders of £_00 or more when they offer free delivery .
negative	i do not recommend them .
negative	i ordered items from this company on 00 / 0 /_0000 .
negative	i received an_email with a tracking_number which stated that the items would be delivered in 0 to 0 working_days ( before the 0nd july ).
negative	i phoned the company on 00 / 0 /_0000 to get an update only to be told that the item was out of stock and had been when i ordered it .
negative	i told them that this was not the case as i had booked tradesmen in around the delivery date and that i most certainly would not have ordered out of stock items .
negative	i was then told that there had been problems with their website .
negative	i asked to speak to a manager but hey_ho that would take 00hrs .
negative	i asked why was this ?
negative	did their managers not come into work ?
negative	i was told they were always in a meeting .
negative	this company are taking people '_s money for goods they do not have in stock .
negative	i will be informing the trading_standards people about this .
negative	needless to say i have asked for a refund which i am told will take 0 week .
negative	meantime i will now have to go and buy my goods elsewhere , which i wish i had done in the first place .
negative	i cancelled my contract due to them not being to match a deal with t - mobile , that ’_s where the problems started !
negative	i received a text thanking_me for upgrading , i immediately called them and advised i hadn_'_t , and had cancelled my contract - they put me on to their fraud dept who advised my new phone was down to be delivered to london - advised i live in manchester and had not ordered it - they confirmed they would cancel the order .
negative	0 days_later i received an_email_confirming it had been delivered - long_story short and numerous_calls later i was assured they had cancelled the contract , they were aware a new phone had been fraudulently obtained by another person and i would hear nothing further .
negative	0 months later i receive a letter from a debt agency advising i owe £ 0000 - called them explained i had no contract with o0 and explained what had happened with the fraud dept , it was advised they would take this up with o0 .
negative	at the same time i wrote to o0 expressing my disappointment and asking for a formal apology , i have written twice since and am still_waiting a response !
negative	today i have received a further letter from the debt agency advising they have been instructed by o0 to continue to pursue the debt - this in simple terms is harassment , as i owe them nothing and don_'_t even have a contract with them anymore .
negative	simply the worst company i have ever come_across and would advise everyone to stay well clear .
negative	at the beginning of february i ordered an urgently_needed twin pushchair for my grandchildren and chose kiddisave because their web_site stated the item was in stock and they use express delivery .
negative	i waited a week and nothing arrived so sent them an_email asking for an approximate delivery date .
negative	the email went_unanswered .
negative	i tried several_times to contact them by phone and on the one occasion they answered it i was immediately cut_off .
negative	i sent a further email with my phone number which also went_unanswered .
negative	after several more attempts on the phone i finally got to speak to customer_services who told me that the item was not in stock despite their web_site stating that it was and that the item would not be in stock until the end of february .
negative	adding on delivery time meant that i would not receive the goods until march .
negative	i told the assistant that i would have to cancel the order in that case as i needed to order it urgently from somewhere_else and she told me that i would not receive a refund for about 00 days despite the fact that they took the payment from my account the day after i ordered it .
negative	i find this absolutely appalling as i can '_t order another one until i receive the refund .
negative	kiddisave need to get their act_together and be honest about what is in stock and what isn_'_t .
negative	don_'_t they realise that baby goods are very often urgently_needed ?
negative	they also need to improve their customer service by answering emails and at_least answering phone_calls .
negative	i would not recommend this store to anyone .
negative	booked .
negative	holiday last june , almost a year in advance , to get what we wanted . yesterday went to pay on line . a difference in price . so i had to ring up to find out what was the correct price . our extra leg_room seats had been taken off ."
negative	change of plane " i was told . we sent an_email to confirm this , no you didn_'_t . it appears that if you book too far in advance and a plane is changed they don_'_t inform you . its not good enough , we '_ve just had this with thomas_cook . but they charged us for them .
negative	rubbish communication jet_0 .
negative	i recommend this company to a friend after buying our ottoman base from them .
negative	she ordered an ottoman base and mattress .
negative	both were confirmed for delivery but only the base arrived at 00 . 00 .
negative	my friend was advised to ring the company but they had shut at 0000 .
negative	my friend is 00 and spent the night in the chair .
negative	she rang the following_morning and was advised that 0 other mattresses had been mislaid but they would get back to her .
negative	she rang again at lunch_time and was advised the mattress had gone to another warehouse but would be delivered the following_tuesday due to the easter_weekend .
negative	needless to say she asked for her money back and we sourced a mattress locally .
negative	total_waste of time & money !!
negative	!
negative	we were mis_- sold brightpearl on the basis that it was a product you could implement yourself without little trouble , the main advantage with paying would be the speed in which it would be done but we could not justify paying £_000 / per day for five days works , even_though this was given at a 00_%_discount .
negative	after trying to implement we came_across numerous issues and raised tickets which went_unanswered and were later told that ticket system was not there for implementation issues and we should have opted for paid implementation .
negative	after weeks of getting_nowhere and passed from one person to another , i landed up with , james scott – senior vice president , customer service , believe me , a grand title really did not account for anything .
negative	james went on to explain that unless we had erp experience we should never have been told that we would be able to self implement , and he was adament that we would not have been told we could implement ourselves without this by his sales_team .
negative	when i told him we were never told this and infact his own online literature makes no reference to erp and claims self implementation is an option and only warns that it will take you longer .
negative	he said that we must have spoken to a new member of the sales_team ( spoke to the same person for a 0 - 00 month period ) and that the literature should be updated ( which is still as it was two months_ago , today !! )
negative	we then went through a early_termination review , lol !!
negative	what a total load of b *** ocks !!
negative	a process made up by brightpearl which is a total_joke , and i questioned james authority and position within the company if this review had to take place at all .
negative	anyway , they stood by their decision , not to refund me the quarterly bill we had already paid as they had upheld their part of the t &_c and are still adament that we were not lied to by the sales_team and everyone after that , even james had lied to me within the communications we have had .
negative	we actually rang the sales_team after all of this and came_across very dumb , asking very basic questions , giving the impression we could just about navigate our way round a keyboard , yet where still told that brightpearl was suitable for self implementation !
negative	!
negative	beware if you are considering using brightpearl , self implementation is very hard and should not be given as an option , or atleast you should be made aware that erp experience is required !!
negative	otherwise you will sign up then be quoted £_000 per day , approx 0 days to carry out the work ( notice it has now dramatically gone up ) when you are unable to carry out the implementation yourself .
negative	absolutely disgusting service , use at your_peril , avoid like the plague !!!
negative	!
negative	this company is a joke and everything bad in an internet business , ignorant , rude and offer zero customer service !!!
negative	the only thing they do well is take your money !!
negative	!
negative	we ordered a kit for a charity football match that was due in 0 weeks from date of order and sent all the relevant_information and order was confirmed , was told order was on a 00 day service but as we had ordered so far ahead it was not an issue .
negative	0 weeks in and no delivery so we contacted them , not easy , e_mails unusually ignored and the telephone rings out constantly , but if your have a few hours to kill it gets answered .
negative	we were told they were waiting on the medium size tops and this was due anytime and would get the order out in the next few_days .
negative	0 weeks still not received the kit , rang up and eventually got an answer and was fed some story and that the kits were going out any day .
negative	0 days before our game and 0 weeks from order , a box arrives
negative	0 .
negative	no keepers top
negative	0 .
negative	shorts wrong_colour as ordered
negative	0 .
negative	sponsors print quality was shocking !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	rang again and was told that if i wanted to have the correct shorts i would need to return the wrong ones , once received , they would send the correct colour out straight_away .
negative	to ensure we had shorts i asked would they send the correct colour first , so if they did not arrive by the saturday ( bear in mind the time we had already waited ) we would have shorts to wear .
negative	was told that was not possible , and they would only send the correct ones if they receive the wrong ones , asked what would happen if they did not arrive in time , i was told i could buy replacements locally to me !!!!
negative	absolutely_shocking attitude !!!!
negative	asked later in the conversation , if i send the shorts next_day delivery , arrive with them on wednesday , would they confirm the correct shorts will be sent wednesday using next_day .
negative	this they could not do as they needed to order the shorts and delivery would be 00 days , so if i had sent them we would have been playing without the shorts we ordered !!!!!!!
negative	absolutely disgusting !!
negative	!
negative	the keepers jersey turned_up on the friday , just in time , but the print quality was as poor as on the tops we had received !!
negative	!
negative	i had complained on the telephone and followed this up with an e_mail , that has_been received , asking for some money to be refunded to compensate for the wrong shorts ( obviously could not return as we had to wear them ) and for the very very poor print quality , to this day , no one has had the decency to reply .
negative	i run an online retail company and if i offered this level of service we would quickly have no customers .
negative	we would never use this company again , will never recommend them and will tell anyone that asks the truth !!!!!
negative	!
negative	as in the uk we always tell everyone about the bad_experiences , this one will be told for a very long time !!!!
negative	!
negative	in summary - spend your money somewhere_else , this company will tell you initially they can supply on time , but once they have your money you will be ignored , lied to and then ignored again !!
negative	!
negative	prosocceruk offers the most appauling service ( if you can call it that ) you will ever receive from an online_retailer !!!!!
negative	as i said in the title
negative	use at your_peril , avoid like the plague !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	( more than happy to cc prosocceruk in on this , might get a reply from my e_mail )
negative	on the day of receipt , i wrote to advise you that i had ordered the wrong item .
negative	you have ' nt even bothered to reply .
negative	email repeated below
negative	dear_sirs ,
negative	many_thanks for your extremely qick despatch .
negative	i received the order today .
negative	unfortunately , it would appear that i have ordered the completely wrong
negative	item .
negative	is there any way we can exchange for the correct item .
negative	please advise .
negative	thanks in advance

negative	the do called easy option of paying your customs fees online is far from easy .
negative	the system has_been down for over a week , have contacted them by phone and email .
negative	they just run you round on circles , contact your local_depot , local my foot it '_s 00miles away , used to be round the corner , but seems thanks to the profiteering they closed it .
negative	still no closer to getting delivery of my parcel .
negative	it took 0 days to get from la to the uk now 0 weeks_later it '_s 00 miles and not moving .
negative	absolutely_disgusted !
negative	will never_knowingly use them again and i recommend everyone does the same and people power puts these useless idiots out of business .
negative	seems that most people have had the same or similar experience with this rubbish , i always seem to be in the area 0 % they reckon they don_'_t cover , now like so many others stuck with a contract i cant get out of without paying through the nose to buy out despite the fact they do not fulfil their part of said contract by providing a service . they do not . i live in an area that according to their coverage map should have an excellent signal , i rarely get more than one bar up on my s0 and almost never get anything other than basic net connectivity if any !
negative	yet my o0 one sat right next to it always stumps up full service with high speed internet connectivity .
negative	their so called customer service cannot be described as such .. yet another fine example of rip_off britain !
negative	i had to write to them asking about their online job application forms !
negative	all i really wanted to know was how to fill the form in as i have window office and it wouldn_'_t fill it in .
negative	no answer but application sent in post !.
negative	not a lot of help for people that dont understand computers !
negative	have been with first_utility for 0 year .
negative	sent my gas and electric meter_readings to them every month with no_problems and i was billed accordingly .
negative	however i chose to have smart_meters installed .
negative	i received several calls telling_me when they will be installed , which was all different , i had installers turn_up without_any dates being booked and had meters installed on the 00th_july and still had calls from suppliers asking when i want my meters installed .
negative	sent complaint to first_utility but no response .
negative	from that date non of my bills have been accurate and i found out that my gas smart_meter has not in fact has ever worked since i had it and i have been receiving estimated bills .
negative	complained to first utiltiy , no response until i chased them because the obilgitory 0 weeks for a response had gone way past but all i got was that they were still looking at it and was given energy ombudsman contact details .
negative	i am still reciving estimated gas bills and because of their mix_up i had a massive bill in jan_0000 of over £_000 .
negative	today i chased them again and they say they have contacted me and i had to inform them that first_utility have never contacted me and the only way i have had an update is when i have chased them .
negative	my gas smart_meter is still not working and i was told that it may happen in march .
negative	i was also supposed to have received a call back from them today about my dual user refund but guess_what , no call back .
negative	what a bad service , you cannot complain to a higher level as they say they are customer_services so they are voting for turkeys at christmas .
negative	what a shambles and the quicker i can leave their service the happier i will be .
negative	despite growing numbers of people having screen problems ( usually just after the warranty runs out ) amazon refuse to acknowledge there is a problem .
negative	all they seem interested in is selling me an overpriced second_hand kindle .
negative	on one hand they insist that kindles cannot be repaired and on the other insist that the tat they are trying to sell me is ' refurbished ' how does that work then
negative	out of 0 deliveries i have had problems with 0 .
negative	one was delivered to the wrong_address and the current one should have been delivered by latest today and is ( depending who i talk to ) either still in the hdnl hub in droitwich or lost and i need to claim .
negative	rest_assured i won_'_t be using them again
negative	now this site won_'_t let me rate at zero_stars
negative	just recieved information from the hotel i booked with budgetplaces . com that they had been booked up for over a month !!!
negative	i now have to find another hotel , and battle to get my deposit back !
negative	!
negative	the main problem i think is that they use hermes as a courier .
negative	i ordered on 00th_december .
negative	since then i have phoned debenhams several_times .
negative	they are pleasant enough on the phone , but cannot help as apparently it is impossible for them to talk to hermes and hermes will not respond to customers !
negative	during the process debenhams reorganised a separate delivery .
negative	neither have arrived as of 00th_december .
negative	however hermes tracking tells_me that on several_occasions they have failed to deliver because of access problems .
negative	this is total nonsense , as i work at a national logistics warehouse !
negative	we have hundreds of deliveries every day .
negative	if they can '_t deliver here , they can '_t deliver anywhere .
negative	apparently both are now being returned to debenhams as damaged .
negative	no doubt they take out their frustration at their gross incompetence on the parcels in their care ?
negative	i have also lodged a complaint on debenhams website , but they haven_'_t bothered replying .
negative	it is a shame i have to give one star .
negative	zero or less would be more appropriate .
negative	avoid debenhams and anyone_else using hermes .
negative	is it a plot to get us to give up shopping online ?
negative	just had shopping delivered and yes part of it has not arrived again .
negative	this time i made the poor delivery guy check what was missing ie 0 items not a happy_bunny what is it with asda they can '_t get any delivery right .
negative	so i ’ m waiting for a call back as if that ’_s all i have to do is wait around .
negative	the last delivery was the same and it took two_weeks to get the goods i had ordered plus numerous_calls .
negative	no apology from the store , no gratitude gift for the length of time it took but at_least they had taken my money .
negative	then we go to the subs none hay fever tabs none sent but they stated they has subbed it where .
negative	richmond thick sausages they sent richmond ’_s skinless thin .
negative	lwenbru beer sent tubor crap beer .
negative	i ’ m defo not a happy shopper maybe time to change provider i ’ m sick of no apologises and the fact the mess up so often .
negative	once or twice in a year is poor but nearly every shop is total unacceptable now i know what it means by cheap is not always the best .
negative	sorry this is so long but to highlight the comedy of errors i have to endure and to ensure you know how bad the company is i have added what all happened me and what i did .

negative	dear_sir / madam
negative	ref_: customer number ( number removed )
negative	good evening ,
negative	rather_than phone you yet again about the order i have just received , i have e_- mailed you .
negative	i received my order ( num removed ).
negative	as usual we have had substitutes and yet again they have not been amended as ordered this is getting a regular occurrence .
negative	this time we ordered 0x 00cl x 00 lowenbru original lager total bottles 00
negative	we received 0 x 0x00cl lowenbru original lager and 00 0x00cl pernoi lager total bottles 00 ( please_note i had put lowenbru original beer on the original e_- mail and had not changed the substitute as pernoi ).
negative	price was the same but quantity less by 0 boxes of 0 .
negative	so i have paid the same for less this meaning i have ended_up paying the same for a lesser amount this is not what your substitute service offer states .
negative	i have only just started to check the amount spent to quantity since i had lenor delivered and realise later the amount i paid i was a nearly a litre down on quantity .
negative	also where is the 0x0lt bacardi that i ordered is clearly on your delivery notice but hasn ’ t been delivered , i have received the glava and bushmills but no bacaardi ?
negative	we purchased these items when there on special and in this case to put away for xmas .
negative	so by giving me the money back it in three or four days this is not suitable as your offer may have expired .
negative	how can so many errors be made every time ?
negative	do i have to check the whole delivery on arrival before the driver leaves this is ridiculous i am not happy as you can imagine .
negative	i ’ m_sure you have a list of various other errors i have phoned about before that is why i have chosen to write so as to keep a log of errors .
negative	as i have no_intention of sitting on the phone for ages to clear this matter up again , costing me more money and time please either contact me on my home line ( tel num removed ) or by return e_- mail .
negative	my preference in this matter would be for you to deliver the items as i did pay for them and for a full delivery service anyway .
negative	thank_you
negative	called customer service team on wednesday 00 : 00 was told they had called the store and they would be in touch with me .
negative	i accepted this as except the call within the next 00_hours .
negative	called the customer service team on friday 00 : 00 was told they had rung the store on thursday and spoke to ( name_removed ) who was to ring me .
negative	i have not had any call back from tony or the customer service team to tell me what was happening .
negative	i asked to speak with the supervisor as was not happy regarding the period of time it has taken to sort this bearing in mind we have paid for the said goods .
negative	( name_removed ) stated after a few_minutes that the manager was unavailable at this time but she would contact the store again .
negative	when i asked how much longer i was expect to wait for this to be dealt_with ie today a week , a month .
negative	she just stated she didn ’ t know .
negative	i then asked for a copy of the companies policy of complaints_procedure to be e_- mailed me and the reply was she was unable to do this .
negative	i explained that this should be available to the customer if requested so she then stated she would ask her manager .
negative	this document should be available to all customer service staff as it should state the time limit to reply to any complaints also stating a limit for the complaint to be dealt_with .
negative	as i have had to chase this up myself the time limits i must assume have not been adhered .
negative	due to the delays ( bad customer service ) and the fact that this is not the first_instance we have had to complain .
negative	call returned by cs at 00 : 00 missed the call ( phone was on charge in my kitchen ) so i phoned back at 00 : 00 spoke with ( name_removed ) and he has informed me that ( name_removed ) team_leader at the store will be calling me tomorrow .
negative	when i asked why he has not taken the time to call me today i was informed that they could not deliver today and when they sorted the routes out tomorrow they will ring me and let me know what is happening .
negative	i asked why i had not been refunded as i requested in my last phone_call i was told to wait for the call from the store .
negative	monday and i have finally received the missing goods .
negative	another delivery wrong .
negative	new delivery sunday 00 dec_0000
negative	delivery arrived just after 0pm as requested .
negative	straight_away i notice that some of the shopping was missing .
negative	due from my past order i requested the driver went through the shopping with me so as to verify what was missing .
negative	we list the following as missing :
negative	domestos citrus fresh bleach x 0
negative	asda 00l tall bin liners x 0
negative	finish dishwasher cleaner x 0
negative	gillette shave gel senstive x 0
negative	nescafe coffee 000g x 0
negative	bold lavender 00 pk x 0
negative	lenor spring awakening 0 . 00 lt x 0
negative	the adsa non drowsy hayfever / allergy 00 pk x 0 which had been substituted but had not been sent .
negative	the driver tried to telephone the store but couldn ’ t get through .
negative	he asked was if i available all day when he returned to the store he would get it dealt_with and would return with the said items .
negative	by 0 : 00 i still had not received the goods or a call from the store to inform me to what was happening .
negative	i then tried to ring the customer service team starting from 0 : 00 .
negative	i was on hold for 00 . 00 min then i was cut_off .
negative	i rang straight back and again after 00mins was cut_off this carried on till i decided enough was enough and stopped calling at 00 : 00_hours .
negative	as of 0 : 00 on the 00 december_0000 i still have had no contact from the store i started to ring the customer service team .
negative	finally i was answered at 00 : 00 by ( name_removed ).
negative	i explained what had happened and she stated she would get in touch with the store and asked them to ring me back .
negative	i stated that i wanted a call today and that i wasn ’ t prepared to wait a week again for my shopping .
negative	she assured me that it would be sorted today .
negative	00 : 00 00 december 000 .
negative	(. name_removed ) from the customer service contact centre phoned me to state he had spoken to ( name_removed ) one of the managers at the telford store .
negative	unfortunately they are unable to deliver the missing goods so would we accept a refund bearing in mind we paid for delivery for all the goods in question .
negative	no apology , no telephone_call from the store nothing .
negative	believe me this is the last time i will ever use the store again and i will be putting this account of errors on the review_sites as well as face book etc .
negative	i ordered a couple of items on the 00th_may and although the money has_been taken from my account , i have not had an_email to say my items have been dispatched .
negative	i am a new customer so i registered at the same time but when i tried to log in , it keeps saying it does not recognise my email address .
negative	i have contacted qvc who say they have rectified the problem but i still cannot log in .
negative	they still did not tell me when i can expect delivery .
negative	i also put in orders with 0 other_companies on the same day and i got emails from them on the 00nd to say my goods have been dispatched but i have had no word from qvc .
negative	not happy !
negative	bought an item from their hyde store online .
negative	0 days_later got a phone_call to say the store had been broken into and they had taken my item ... strange that the thieves went for my £_00 item when the store was selling £_000 items and these are still being advertised on their website so obviously the thieves did not bother with them ( perhaps they only like cheap items ??)
negative	would have preferred the truth .... very disappointed as the item was for my autistic grandson who was looking_forward to getting it and now i will have to look around for another one .
negative	well it happened again , i fell for the good prices and promise of ' in stock ' fast delivery .
negative	ordered two_weeks_ago and heard_nothing , have emailed for updates and not even had a response .
negative	i have done this twice before but over the mists of time forgot just how bad this company are on delivering .
negative	they will get away with it for now but long_term it is a recipe for disaster .
negative	the most infuriating thing is that they mustn '_t read the multitude of reviews that complain_about their customer_services , or they do and they ignore it which must be worse .
negative	they have got to realise if just one person is put off buying from them because of reviews such as this then they are losing a vast amount of money , a fact which i find unbelievable .
negative	the offers often seem too good to be true ... because the are !
negative	example offered a ' wowcher ' for garden games alleged rrp ( in fairyland maybe ) £_00 wowcher price £_00 ordered lawn snakes and ladders for the kids for summer .
negative	hmmm got a square of polythene about 0sqm printed as a snakes & ladders board and 0 blow up cube style poly balls ( think blow up medium size beach balls )
negative	and blow up ' cones ' as counters .
negative	not learning my lesson ordered a hells kitchen knife block & knives rrp £_00 . 00 wowcher offer £_00 . 00 got voucher ordered knives early september ..... still_waiting despite mailing complaint to wowcher who passed complaint to ' gadgets & gifts ' who i think are asociated with wowcher though i have no proof but the garden games were from g & g .
negative	unsubscribe now don_'_t get caught my case is going to trading_standards as we type .
negative	zero_stars avaoid like the plague !
negative	!
negative	it '_s impossible to redeem wowcher despite_emailing wowcher for help .
negative	rubbish company and i will_certainly not deal with them again !
negative	very bad no refund still from 00th_march good luck to anyone_else do not order
negative	shower unit ordered last october ( price was good , could be a reason for that !).
negative	website said 0 units in stock .
negative	no shower delivered .
negative	finally got through on phone ( very poor customer service on phone_calls , they don_'_t pick_up for ages , put you on hold for ever and don_'_t call back ) they said it was on it '_s way .
negative	after more calls and emails i called the oft and am now taking them to court .
negative	if i do get a refund and apology before going to court i will update on here .
negative	update_: after sending a letter to qssupplies threatening court_action i then phoned and spoke to zia .
negative	he said that i had already received a refund .
negative	i checked my account while still on the phone to find this was not the case .
negative	he then accepted this but refused to send me a refund and said he was happy to go to court .
negative	on oft advice i sent a further , final , letter to qs .
negative	they have now refunded my original amount , but ofcourse i am still out of pocket due to the number of phone_calls , the two recorded delivery letters plus the inconenience of it all .
negative	however , i have still received no letter of apology or explanation .
negative	i hope that they improve their customer service .
negative	use them at your_own risk .
negative	tried several_times to order one wardrobe and one chest of drawers from argos but the page just hung and i didn_'_t receive any confirmation - well not until i received 0 emails from them confirming 0 orders for the same thing - and they had taken the money from my credit_card !
negative	ouch !
negative	contacted them immediately and gave all order details and told my account would be credited within 00 days ?
negative	hmm .. they can take my money immediately but drag their feet to re - credit !
negative	several phone_calls later i received a part - refund and eventually ( 0 months later !!!)
negative	received the remainder - even then i had to go in to one of the stores for a credit - i will never book a home delivery with them again !
negative	don_'_t book a food delivery with them - i did .
negative	they operate 0 hour slots ( allegedly ).
negative	booked a delivery for a sunday expecting a roast for sunday lunch - delivery between 0pm and 0pm - at 0pm i got a call saying they couldn_'_t make it ( after being_fobbed_off on the phone & no lunch ).
negative	i was promised a delivery for the day after at 0pm .. they turned_up at 0 . 00pm - substituted cheese and onion crisps with salt and vinegar - like they couldn_'_t switch a brand_name for their own !
negative	very poor - even complained to their head_office who were totally dismissive - so they lost my custom .
negative	i '_ll stick to sainsburys - never had a problem with them .
negative	be aware that paying out bonuses is discretionary ( read small_print )
negative	two days i stayed in for a collection . with no joy . chatted on a live_chat . sorted .
negative	they swapped me to <_external link_removed >. they came ok . not happy at all . its starts off with one parcel and could of lead to 000 ; s , very poor service . thought they had 0000 vans . ok snow i could understand not picking_up first day . but i did book it 0 days before pick_up .
negative	have been trying for three days to get through to this company , to pay my disabled and elderly mothers electricity_bill , average of over an_hour eating every day regardless of the time of day , definitely will be changing provider to eon , disgraceful service !!!
negative	!
negative	yesterday i ordered two advanced single tickets for travel between reading and gloucester ( a trip down to my father '_s home to take him fishing for a few_days ) using this supposedly reputable company '_s website .
negative	having confirmed the order , i spotted that i had inadvertently entered the wrong dates for travel .
negative	i checked the site and was reassured to see that changing the dates was no problem .
negative	i had paid £_00 for the tickets there and back , using my debit_card , supposedly saving £ 0 .
negative	joy !
negative	however when i followed the route on the site , to change the ticket dates , i was informed that in order to complete the change , i would need to buy a second set of tickets for the right dates and then a refund on the original tickets would be authorised .
negative	reluctantly i spent another £_00 and purchased the new tickets .
negative	i was then informed on the site , that my refund had indeed been authorised and £_00 was being re - credited to my account .
negative	er ...£ 00 ?
negative	.. what happened to the other £_00 you owe me ?
negative	the other £_00 had been claimed by this greedy bunch as a £_00 ' admin ' fee for each ticket .
negative	i eventually found an_email contact address and composed a message explaining that my previous experience with their service , had been both fast and reliable and i had used it regularly .
negative	however having inadvertently entered the wrong dates , i felt it was a little_steep to charge me an admin_fee of £_00 on a £_00 transaction ..
negative	i gave the email subject as ' valued_customer ?'
negative	to my limited knowledge i think a debit_card transaction costs around £ 0 . 00 so an admin_fee of £ 0 i felt would be more appropriate ( and i seem to recall a possible change in law to enforce this ?)
negative	the reply i received from trainline . com was polite but somewhat patronising and informed me that i had indeed purchased new tickets , that there was an admin_fee of £_00 per person , per_ticket for each of the ' old ' tickets and that my refund of £_00 had been credited to my account .
negative	completely ignoring my point .
negative	i persisted and sent a second mail , explaining that as an_automated system , the maximum realistic charge for the change / refund should be around £ 0 . 00 and that as a regular , loyal_customer i felt ripped - off .
negative	whist i realised that being ' big business ' they probably wouldn_'_t care , i felt it worth the time to let them know how disappointed i was with their callous , avaricious attitude .
negative	i also informed them that if the charge stood , i would never use them again and would spread my experience as far as i could .
negative	their reply stated that they regret the ' inconvenience ' this may have caused me .
negative	they confirmed that a £_00 admin_fee per_ticket is listed in their terms and conditions , that the fee is system generated and automatically charged and they therefore cannot refund it .
negative	they explained how i could view the terms and conditions attached to my orders and they finished by expressing the hope that the above information was helpful to me ..
negative	so i am now left having been forced to buy 0 new tickets that i would never have purchased , had i known that they were going to rip me off in this fashion and a very sour_taste in the mouth .
negative	the obvious question that arises from this is , if the £_00 admin_fee is system generated and automatically charged and they can '_t affect / cancel it .. who is doing the admin and if it '_s nobody , why are they charging for it ?
negative	or is this just another example of big - business scumbag ethics ?
negative	ordered a bracket dec 00 it arrived not what i was looking for so i sent it back only to be told it was unusable and they would deduct 00_% of the purchase price .
negative	as it was taken out of the packaging .
negative	how else was i supposed to use it ?
negative	it was taken out of the packaging laid on the floor and put straight back in the packaging and sent back .
negative	( supposed to be 00 year_warranty ) they have no pictures of the damage and they have thrown out the bracket or so they say .
negative	we are now taking_legal_action .
negative	so whatever you do buy somewhere_else even if it costs a little more but do not i repeat do not buy from brackets r us .
negative	you have been_warned

negative	booked next - day delivery for an exercise_bike .
negative	the window i was given was from 0am to 0pm ( even_though it says 0pm if you go to the " track my order " page ).
negative	yep , a 00 - hour_window .
negative	nothing arrived by the deadline .
negative	there was no phone_call from either the company or the courrier .
negative	i tried_calling customer service at 0pm but after going through their call steering , i got a recording saying the offices were closed ( of course ).
negative	phoned the next_morning .
negative	was given no explanation and no apology .
negative	naturally cancelled the order and won_'_t be sourcing anything through argos again .
negative	don_'_t use them .
negative	as a first time customer i ordered one item on a next_day delivery basis on 00th_october ......
negative	i am still_waiting !
negative	i was informed that the courier had the item on 00st october and first the courier claimed they could not access the house ( its on the main_road and has a wide driveway easily accessed by all other couriers ) which was then changed to the house could not be found - there are only a handful of properties with the same postcode all next to each other , then it was changed that the courier would contact me directly to arrange delivery - that was over a week ago and surprise , surprise that did not happen .
negative	i have paid on the 00 / 0 for my item and also paid for delivery - yet isme is doing nothing to get my item delivered to me !!!
negative	!
negative	will not be recommending isme to family , friends , colleagues - in fact quite the opposite .
negative	isme you have no customer service !
negative	meg kent worcestershire
negative	website listed item ( sweater ) as in stock when in fact it wasn_'_t
negative	website allowed me to pay extra for 0 - 0 day delivery but item took over a week to arrive .
negative	complaint emails have been conveniently ignored .
negative	company miss sold iphone insurance for my wifes and mine .
negative	vodafone agree it was miss sold but will only pay back £_00 out of the £_000 owed then cut me off .
negative	they have passed me from one department to another , no manager calls me back and i have been hung_up on 0 times in a row !
negative	also they hide_behind emails and not on the phone .
negative	if they dont like what they hear they fob you off and then pass you to another department .
negative	broken_promises galore !
negative	what is the point of having a mobile company like this rubbish rubbish avoid at your_peril
negative	pre ordered modern warfare 0 well before release_date . its 00 / 00 / 00 today still has not come blamed it on post
negative	we were out so they put my parcel in the wheelie bin , when we got home the bin had been emptied and the parcel lost . this was the first delivery attempt [ they say that they do three }. emails are unanswered and you cannot speak to a person . only an_idiot would put a delivery in a wheelie bin , so what are the requirements to work at hermes ?
negative	booked online and the confirmation_email didn_'_t come through .
negative	took over a week for someone to sort_out the day before departure !
negative	arrival at dalaman was ok , there were only 0 of us travelling seeing as it was out if season in april .
negative	did the usual stop off at some tacky transport cafe for a ' comfort break '.
negative	got into the resort and the driver who spoke very little english asked us where are accommodation was !
negative	luckily we had been there before and we ended_up giving him directions .
negative	confirming the pick_up online was useless , the time was not posted in the timescales advised .
negative	tried emailing , but got no reply .
negative	eventually time was posted earlier the same day .
negative	waited and waited , phoned the emergency number , only to be asked for directions !
negative	then they said it would be half an_hour .
negative	the driver had clearly not left yet .
negative	when we were eventually picked_up an_hour late , we were shuttled to marmaris where the driver drive around several back streets looking for another minibus , where we had to get off ours and change to the other .
negative	we were greeted_by a bus load of unhappy passengers who had also been waiting an_hour to be picked_up .
negative	the driver then asked us what time our flight was !
negative	he should have known this !
negative	when he realised how late it was , he thankfully put his foot down and drive directly to the airport without stopping at the tacky transport cafe !
negative	i suppose you get what you pay for , but next time we '_ll be giving this company a miss !
negative	don_'_t bother with this company .
negative	i only wish i had looked out for the reviews before i used them .
negative	after non delivery of flowers despite their online tracking_system informing_me that they had been delivered , it took them thirteen days to respond .
negative	they stated that " we have a backlog of messages which requires response ".
negative	yes i bet they do .
negative	looking at these reviews it '_s clear that i ' m far from being alone in my bad_experience .
negative	to add_insult to injury , the rest of the email ( do these_people never actually talk to their customers ?)
negative	was the usual marketing ( yeah_right !
negative	they wouldn_'_t know marketing if it hit them in the face ) bulls ...
negative	i quote ...
negative	" we deeply value your relationship with iflorist and are committed to providing you with the highest_level of service simply because our customers deserve the very best ."
negative	shame it '_s just words .
negative	don_'_t waste your money or your time using these_people .
negative	complete amateurs and lazy to boot .
negative	two months after leaving scottish_power i am still_waiting for a refund of the credit they owe me .
negative	they ignore emails , do not answer phones .
negative	i would not recommend this company and will have to take them to court to get my money back .
negative	sent me four tubes for my fish_tank , two were labelled the wrong_colour and one did not work .
negative	i returned the faulty tube , when they eventually replied after many ignored attempts to contact them .
negative	they said would send out a replacement a week and a half ago .
negative	nothing has turned_up and have emailed them again several_times , no response , phoned them , no answer .
negative	i even got failed delivery messages to some emails .
negative	will have to contact my credit_card company for a refund .
negative	i would avoid this company if i were you !!
negative	!
negative	update 0
negative	now got a replacement tube after many emails .
negative	they said " send it back and we will refund your return postage " that was over a month_ago and still no refund .
negative	they only seem to reply if you mention disputing the transaction and requesting a chargeback with you credit_card company .
negative	excuse for long delays is " staff sickness ".
negative	must be an epidemic down there as they are ignoring my emails again !!
negative	if you are thinking of buying from them , telephone them first .
negative	if you get no reply , bear in mind this is what you will be faced with if you have any_problems with them !!
negative	i have now formally raised a dispute with my card company and await my refund .
negative	update 0
negative	i only got my money back once my credit_card company took money back off them .
negative	i ordered the athena massage chair and it has arrived mouldy , rusty and clearly pre_- used .
negative	disgusting .
negative	i am now on hold to customer_services for the 0nd time for over 00_minutes .
negative	very poor service
negative	i ordered a generator from this company , the website looked good and genuine .
negative	i received an_email after the order confirming the purchase .
negative	the order was marked as pending .
negative	the generator did not arrive .
negative	i have tried contacting them to ask for a refund .
negative	the phone line goes straight to answerphone , the customer support chatline is always offline and they do not answer the emails .
negative	if you place an order with them , do not expect to receive anything .
negative	they come under a company called anglo pacific trading ltd .
negative	avoid them .
negative	ordered a pair of tyres for a land_rover .
negative	the price was marginally better_than theyir competitor .
negative	0 weeks_later and no tyres have arrived .
negative	customer_services take up to 0 hours to respond , they have so far fobbed me off with :
negative	i '_ll get you a tracking_number ... that was 0 days ago .
negative	yesterday , the same ; i '_ll email you a tracking_number .
negative	heard_nothing again , now it '_s the weekend so we will be into next week before any developments .
negative	i have asked to cancel the order and refund the money .
negative	there is no phone number for this company so consider the pitfalls when something does go_wrong .
negative	i ordered flowers for my aunts 00th_birthday to be delivered to her house but despite having her address and postcode interflora contacted me to say the florist had been unable to find the house which seems incredible i don , t believe the florist really tried as the house is on a main rd its not hidden away so i gave interflora a possible place where my aunt may beshe was having lunch out for her_birthday but i wasn , t 000_% sure she was there but the florist went there and just left the flowers without making proper enquieries , interflora sent me an_email to say the flowers had been delivered but then interflora rang me the next_day to say that the place where i thought my aunt was had rung them to say she wasn , t there so the flowers were left there another 0 days before the florist picked them up again and i found my aunts house on google earth and sent interflora directions i was very dissapointed that my aunt hadn , t had the flowers on her special day and i didn , t get an_email to say my aunt got the flowers in the end but my aunt wrote to me i won , t ever use interflora again the service was appalling the flowers were in a basket so they didn , t need making up like a bouquet and i stipulated that the flowers would need to be delivered by 00 noon
negative	few_years_ago , was contacted by their telephone sales dept .
negative	was told to have a direct_debit with them and i can then forget about it all for they will automatically check my results and contact me via telephone or letters if i win .
negative	rang them up recently , and was told that this is not so .
negative	i could have won and lost all my winnings over the years .
negative	this is false marketing as i see it .
negative	i am thinking of cancelling my account and direct_debit with them .
negative	the website feels old and clunky for starters .
negative	i had a few 000 errors on product pages which hardly instils confidence .
negative	i did however order a microwave because it was the one i wanted and the price seemed ok .
negative	i had to register with the website and to do so was forced to give unnecessary information that i did not want to give about myself .
negative	there seemed to be no option not to retain my card information .
negative	what i ordered was on next_day delivery and it did not arrive next_day .
negative	i was given a tracking_number in an_email but when i entered this number on the tracking page at the comet website it gave me a 000 " page not found " error .
negative	i looked for a telephone_number to call customer_services and only found and 00000 number which was charged at 00p_per_minute .
negative	it is now the day after the day on which this product was supposed to arrive and i want to go out to see an old friend before he moves to india but i am still_waiting for my delivery and am unable to even attempt to find out what might have happened to my order without spending 00p a minute ( more i think because my phone is a virgin one ).
negative	i would spend the money on the phone_call if i thought it would get me anywhere but i ' m_sure i will be told that once the item is with the courier there is nothing they can do so why waste money .
negative	disgraceful service but only just less_than average for the uk .
negative	i will never be using comet again .
negative	i ' m surprised at how i ' m now being treated by dolphin .
negative	i '_ve bought gear from them before and they were ok but " it '_s all over now baby blue ".
negative	i wanted a new amp for my birthday .
negative	i ordered one on wednesday by telephone for next_day delivery .
negative	i found it for £_00 less at an on - line retailer that i ' d never used but thought that i ' d order it from dolphin because i ' d never had a problem with them and i trusted them .
negative	i was told it was in stock and there wouldn_'_t be any problem .
negative	this day was 0 days before my birthday so ...
negative	i was going to have an amp on my birthday wasn_'_t i ?
negative	i ' d even taken a few_days off work to enjoy my birthday_present so what could go_wrong ?
negative	i waited and waited_patiently .
negative	no amp .
negative	i called on friday and was told that it would be sent out immediately .
negative	the following_tuesday i called again only to be told that they did not have the amp in stock .
negative	they offered me a shop - soiled one at a discount .
negative	i said that i wanted a full_refund .
negative	the money is now tied up with them and i can '_t afford to order one from somewhere_else until i get the money back into my account .
negative	my birthday is now 0 days away and there is little prospect of me having an amp in my possession by then .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	a really disappointing lack of feedback as to what i have just purchased using my valuable credit_card .
negative	waited for ages for an_email_confirmation : have i actually hired a car at all ?
negative	when it arrived it was so vague as to be downright annoying .
negative	apparently this is not a voucher and my voucher will arrive in the next 00_hours otherwise i can email somewhere .
negative	this , my friends , is not how to do_business on the net .
negative	comparing you to the average us hire company leaves you in the bad place .
negative	it is so nice to see this company finally getting the caning it deserves on the web - my advice is to read the reviews and then walk_away .
negative	i had a payg phone with a large_amount of money in credit which i used as a backup to my contract phone with o0 .
negative	i used to make a diary entry to make a call at_least once every 0 months so i could keep the number active .
negative	however , the one and only time i forgot , with no warning whatsoever , vodafone disconnected the number and i lost all the credit .
negative	when i phoned up to query it i was read the terms and conditions by 0 different customer service officers and told to write to head_office , but they will say the same thing - so they had effectively stolen my money and stuck two fingers up at me .
negative	i will never touch vodafone again and i am pleased to say that my experience has persuaded many friends and colleagues to steer_well clear and when my company renews it '_s mobile_phone contract , which is a multi - million pound contract , i will do everything i can to influence the decision to ensure that vodafone does not get it !
negative	i very rarely hope that a company goes bust , but the sooner it happens to vodafone the happier i will be !
negative	had an orange payg sim which had some credit left on it , so i thought i would transfer the sim to ee to use the 0g data .
negative	after_reading the reviews on here i predicted to my work_colleagues what would happen and to my surprise i was right .
negative	0st phone_call to ask about transferring number and credit - was told no problem will be done in 00_hours ... guess_what .... didn_'_t happen .
negative	0nd phone_call to find out why it hadn_'_t happened - was told puk had been requested but transfer had not been actioned ; was promised the transfer of credit and number would be done within 00_hours .
negative	00_hours_later my number is transferred .... but guess_what .... the credit wasn_'_t !
negative	0rd phone_call to ask where my credit was - could not understand a word the call_center person said ; i had to explain the situation 0 times before she understood my problem .
negative	i was put on hold for 00_minutes , then she came back and told me she was escalating the problem and would phone me back within 0 hour .
negative	0 hours passed and guess_what .... no call !
negative	0th phone_call to find out what was going on - had to go through the same process again , in pigeon english , to be told that there was no credit on my old orange account , so no transfer to do .
negative	i got annoyed with the guy , who then checked the account and admitted that he was wrong .
negative	i have been personally assured that my credit will be transferred and that he will make_sure it happens ....... in 0 to 00_hours !
negative	guess_what .... i think this review will be amended to include 0th phone_call !
negative	** update **
negative	you guessed it , 0th phone_call , this time to the english sales_team to find out what was going on ( again ) - i explained the situation , the guy then read out the message that had been recorded on the system by the indian_call_centre in my previous call and neither he or his manager could understand what it was trying to say , so he is raising another transfer .... so it continues !
negative	** another update **
negative	0th phone_call - apparently my credit is still on the orange account and not the ee account , but the orange account doesn_'_t exist anymore .
negative	i was told that the original transfer was not done properly and another attempt would be made , which would take ..... you guessed it upto 00_hours to complete .
negative	why do i get the feeling that i will be phoning again in 00_hours to go through the same process all over again .... never witnessed such utter incompetence .
negative	oh i did get my first and only apology , but only after i pointed_out that no - one had the common decency to apologise for this joke of a situation .
negative	i urge_anyone_thinking_about joining ee , save your money and go_elsewhere they are a complete digrace ; i have complained to ofcom and will be contacting_trading_standards first thing on monday - i would actually like a full_refund of my credit so i don_'_t have to deal with this company again !
negative	!
negative	i told amazon over a year_ago that i would not shop with them while they use yodel and since then they have used their own extremely reliable couriers .
negative	however , this week i placed and order and my heart_sank when i saw yodel was the delivery firm and once again my experience has_been predictably bad .
negative	the package was due to be delivered on friday 00th_april_0000 , so i took this day of work to be at home .
negative	i got home from work on the 00th_april to find a card on the door mat stating that an attempt at delivery had been made .
negative	not a problem , i went_onto myyodal and rearranged delivery for the 00th_april .
negative	i checked the tracking on the morning of the 00th and it stated that the parcel is still at the depot .
negative	so i rang customer_services and queried this and was told that they can '_t contact the driver but he is aware that i need the parcel today ( 00th ).
negative	i mentioned while i was on the phone that the mobile number left on the card was actually for a local gas company , but yodel confirmed the number was correct and told me to phone it .
negative	i phoned the number and found myself going to the voice_mail for a gas and property maintenance company - so are yodel now using gas engineers to deliver parcels ?
negative	after posting my review i received the reply shown below from yodel which states that my parcel is out for delivery !
negative	update_:
negative	i telephoned the courier and he informed me that he is in scotland and if i really want the package he can get his wife to deliver it as it is in his shed ( which is encouraging ), otherwise delivery would be monday_evening .
negative	i told him to send the package back to amazon !
negative	i contacted amazon and asked for a complete refund and told them that i will no_longer buy from them while they continue to use yodel as a courier !
negative	i have replied to the e_- mail posted below which just shows the level of sheer incompetence of this company as i would like to know how my item was out for delivery when the courier was actually hundreds of miles_away in scotland and my parcel was is in his shed - no answer required yodel , i have drawn my own conclusions !
negative	so thank_you yodel for once again making me waste a day of my annual leave waiting in for a parcel that was never going to turn_up .
negative	i urge any supplier to desist from using yodel and i will never do_business with anyone that uses them as a courier :
negative	i will make_sure that i keep all of the evidence for this situation so that when a " reputation " company comes along in 0 years time ( yes this has happened ) and ask me for proof then i will be able to accommodate !
negative	i ordered a bike from evans .
negative	because there wouldn_'_t be anyone at home during the working week i opted to pay £_00 for a saturday a . m . delivery .
negative	guess_what - 0 :_00pm arrived and no sign of the bike .
negative	phoned evans who said there must be a problem and they ' d call back ' very soon '.
negative	an_hour later i was phoning them again .
negative	ended_up cancelling the whole order .
negative	would i buy from them again ?
negative	never !
negative	i ordered a package from a reputable company .
negative	couldn_'_t have the goods delivered during the working week because nobody would be home so i paid the extra for a saturday_morning delivery .
negative	guess_what - no sign of the parcel .
negative	checked the tracking_number to find that the parcel had arrived in the local parcelfarce depot at 0 : 00 in the morning but they couldn_'_t manage to get it into a van for delivery .
negative	in my opinion they '_ve stolen the money from me because they charged a premium for their so - called saturday_morning delivery .
negative	the sooner this bunch of jokers are sold to a competent company the better .
negative	i am an online retailler with over ten_years experience .
negative	before that i was a director of a freight / courier company in london for an equal amount of time .
negative	so i think i have pretty_much heard and witnessed all that can happen from both_sides of the business .
negative	i thought i would give parcel_hero a try .
negative	after_reading all the hype on their site , i ordered a collection for a customer in singapore .
negative	it was supposed to be collected on the following_day with ups .
negative	they failed to arrive .
negative	after numberous phone_calls to parcel_hero , i was reliably assured that they would be along on the following_day to collect .
negative	the customer service agent assured my wife on the day that she " would remain in the office until the package was collected ."
negative	they never collected and , sure_enough the agent went home .
negative	what followed was profoundly pathetic .
negative	parcel_hero decided to imply a whole catalogue of childish excuses rather_than take_responsibility for their shortfall as a shipping agent .
negative	they even went so far as to try and blame me ?
negative	i asked for a refund , the squrming and wittering was embarrassing to hear , i had to wait days for the money to be returned and in the end i had to place a claim through paypal .
negative	with good cutomer service they could have turned the situation to their advantage , resolved the issues quickly and they would still have me as a customer .
negative	rubbish ..
negative	bought lg washing_machine for £_000 now on site for over £_000 ahhh now i see why you cancelled delivery 0 times , cunning plan , so i would cancel my order , well that worked for you as you had my money for over five weeks !
negative	!
negative	delayed the order for several weeks due to one item being out of stock .
negative	i then changed the order and was due a refund - this was never sent .
negative	hopeless service , no phone number , no response to e_- mails .
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	postal service very slow ordered on 00 december 00 .
negative	received an_email that product had been sent on the 0 january 00 , so it might arrive tomorrow saturday 0 january or 0 january which will be0 week taking out 0 days for bank_holidays .
negative	why was it not sent out on the 0 january ?
negative	rec ' d link on facebook for free dress , just pay p_&_p .
negative	as i was getting free dress , as it was added it to my order , i decided to buy other clothes .
negative	imagine my disappointment when i got email to say my order was dispatched but not the free dress !!!!
negative	after i enquired i got rather a cheeky email_saying it was a mistake on the website and that i should have known it was not free !!!!
negative	was quite happy with other items i bought , but will not , and have informed my friends not to buy from the site either !!!!
negative	!
negative	this store has terrible staff , and managment .
negative	they are rude , arogant and extremely unhelpful .
negative	they will do their up most not to do an exchange or a refund , reciept or no reciept .
negative	i have had more than one problem with this branch .
negative	store assistant " amanda " is particualy rude and has a very clever attitude , i think she things she owns the whole company .
negative	store manager andy is very poorly trained and not management material at all .
negative	i have never had any trouble or bad service at other argos stores , just keighley , so stay_away from there if you think you may need to return anything .
negative	in fact stay_away full stop , not a nice store at all .
negative	i hear the same about the store from friends , family , and just people i know passing me in the street , keighley argos has a terrible reputation , especially regarding its staff .
negative	i am so disgusted with this company !
negative	i have tried to post a review for an item three_times on the website but very do not post it !
negative	seems they only want people to see good comments , not truthful ones !
negative	we purchased a double glass display_unit a while ago and thought we would get the matching single unit to stand next to it but it does not match at all !
negative	the colour is at_least three shades darker than the double one and although the description states it is the same size the single unit is almost 0 inches taller so the shelves do not align with the double , it has different feet and the wood is rounded , where as the double unit is straight edged .
negative	the description on very is really misleading and needs dealing_with !
negative	unfortunately as we assembled the unit we were unable to return it so have had to put it somewhere different to where we wanted to , it is a great unit just not matching as stated , so a complete_waste of £_000 .
negative	i contacted very and was told they were sorry the item was not as expected and offered me 00_%_off but i would have to keep it !
negative	i said no as i think that is an insult , i '_ll still be paying £_00 for an item that was sent in error !
negative	they really dont care and say that the most they can offer will be 00_%_off and really dont care that they are charging me for an item they mis_- sold !
negative	i have been forced to pay for their mistake !
negative	even after quoting the distance_selling regulations to them , they still refuse to do anything_else !
negative	i have never been so disappointed by a companies customer service like this before .
negative	as long as they have your money , they dont give a toss about customer_satisfaction !
negative	the shed that i ordered was great well built and easy to put_together however customer service was terrible and shedstore was not able to resolve a simple problem .
negative	the shed was to be delivered in mid april_0000 .
negative	i rang shedstore the day before to find out whether it would be a morning or afternoon delivery .
negative	i was called back and told that it would be an afternoon delivery .
negative	i therefore went out in the morning and came back just before 00 : 00 to find the shed part stacked in the drive .
negative	no delivery paperwork had been left , there were no assembly_instructions and the roll of roof felt was ripped and had holes in .
negative	had i been at home , i would not have accepted the roof felt .
negative	i immediately contacted shedstore who emailed me the instructions and asked for a photpograph of the damaged felt .
negative	i immediately sent a photograph .
negative	that was on 00th_april .
negative	i sent a follow_up email on the 00th_april because i hadn_'_t had a response to my first email .
negative	i then started telephoning them .
negative	i must have made 0 - 0 phone_calls to them .
negative	they are always very pleasant on the phone and promised that i would get a replacement felt sheet quickly or that someone from the manufacturer would call .
negative	none of this happened until 0th_may ( about 0 weeks after i notified them of the damage ) and guess_what ... the new roof felt was cut about 00mm too short so could not be used .
negative	luckily a friend had a part roll of felt so i used this instead .
negative	i would not use shedstore again .
negative	there are many similar companies out there and i would hope that at_least one would have a better customer service department .
negative	six_weeks .
negative	no delivery .
negative	still advertising 0 days .
negative	i can just imagine the fun i ' m going to have getting a refund .
negative	placed order with woolworth for some canvas_prints .
negative	told they would be received by such and such a date then heard_nothing .
negative	only by checking the website re status of delivery did i find the order had been stopped due to out of stock and they never even bothered to inform me .
negative	would not use the site again .
negative	i placed my order for a galaxy ace phone on the 00th of november and it is now 0th of december and still have no phone . i have phoned got no joy , sent e_- mails someone will get back to you that is the answer i keep getting still hoping i will get a reply to say when my phone will be on its way if ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	have been waiting in all day on my day off for a bed i was told the driver had to change the route owing to an accident and that it would be delivered by 00 . 00 this is tuesday 00 / 00 /_0000 by 00 . 00 not arrived so went back to the tracking it said that it was carded which meant we had recieved a card no all lies we have been in and nothing the next minute it was showing gone back to depot no phone_call to me no text nothing not only that tonight i am sleeping on the floor thanks for that ????
negative	i am back to work tomorrow can '_t take phone on the ward so thats another day .
negative	help
negative	order not sent out .
negative	no contact to explain_why .
negative	use this company at your_peril .
negative	once they have your money you ' re irrevelent .
negative	paid £_000 for a 00gb iphone_0s sim free .
negative	carphone_warehouse sent me a locked phone .
negative	i changed networks 0 months after purchase and found out carphone_warehouse had locked the phone and are unwilling to replace it .
negative	i was told by the company i was returning an item to that it would be collected on either thursday , friday or monday but not to worry at i would get a txt from yodel telling_me which day and the company arranging the return asked for an_alternative location for the trousers to be left should i have to get out .
negative	i received no txt so decided when i was going out on the thursday to leave the wrapped item in the designated woodshed .
negative	by tuesday no sign of yodel , so called the clothes company to be told a collection had been attempted and that a card had been left .
negative	nope , nothing my end .
negative	another collection was arranged and the woodshed was still the alternative collection point .
negative	the next_day i did come home to a card simply saying they had shouted everywhere , obviously some clever take on their name .
negative	what they hadn_'_t done was on any occasion texted to say which day they were collecting or paid any attention to the note for my collection that they could access the woodshed to find the trousers .
negative	the third and final time they came i was luckily in a led the beleaguered driver to the obvious wood shed to retrieve the trousers - he claimed he had no information about an_alternative collection point or that the company was meant to txt the delivery day .
negative	i can imagine why the clothing company would tell me of such arrangements and ask for a secure place i would leave the clothing for collection in my absence .
negative	yodel have obviously made a good sales_pitch to secure the contract but can '_t fulfil any of it .
negative	after ordering a bedroom_furniture set in aug and was pleased with decided to order another one for different room in oct arrived 0th_nov some of which was damaged , told rang customer_services told to refuse delivery of those items and replacements would be sent out y end of week which we did . of course replacements were not coming anytime soon , after numerous_calls to the call_centre and apart_from been told different things about a resolution to our problem which we had to restart the story each time we rang , it was all so robotic word for word even down the very insincere apology for the problem . anyway after all the calls and a letter that was advised by trading_standards giving a deadline saying what we wanted to happen by ( which they responded to the day before that date with no resolution ) help from credit_card_provider and 0months later after a lot of stress we decided to demand a refund which also took days to sort_out properly despite reassurances it would happen . i would never recommend a large purchase from asda direct that comes from a supplier . they clearly don_'_t care about their customers and definitely need to look very hard at their customer_services which is out of uk with no empathy or real knowledge of what they are doing there '_s no way contacting anyone in a higher position , you just can '_t past their 0000 number i know i tried . the whole_process is an_absolute joke .
negative	order some flowers on thursday last_week to be delivered on friday and they didnt arrive or on saturday or today !
negative	just spoke to someone on the live support and after asking me all the same question i had to fill out to get on the live_chat , he said there has_been a system error so they didnt get delivered .
negative	i asked him for them to be delivered tomorrow then and he said he cant do that as its past the cut_off date !
negative	i told him he missed my cut_off date by 0 days so he should be ale to get them delivered tomorrow .
negative	after alot of him not really understanding what i was saying , we agreed they will be delivered on wednesday .
negative	we shall see !!
negative	kind of too late on wednesday though , ruined the moment !
negative	!
negative	i ordered 0 magicozy blankets in early november on the ebay deal of the day offer .
negative	i paid immediately by paypal .
negative	after missing the estimated delivery date i contacted them - no apology said they were getting more in .
negative	after that i had to chase all the time and because i chose not to cancel my order ( i wanted the items ) they just said more would come but gave no time frame .
negative	after countless emails ( but never an_apology ) i contacted ebay .
negative	i have now received an_email_saying that my order has_been cancelled and my " credit_card " has not been charged ?
negative	the money was taken from paypal on 00th_november_0000 and today ( 0st march_0000 ) has not been refunded .
negative	truly_appalling - all_round
negative	kim beadle
negative	i paid for a ' queue jump ' service but the company had my ipad for over 0 weeks and kept using the excuse that they were waiting for supplies of screens to arrive !
neutral	the jacket was well made and the website appears to offer two shades of red ; red and dark red .
neutral	in practice , however , it only dispatches dark red and this only becomes apparent once the goods are delivered .
neutral	if the company would have delivered what is described on it '_s website then i would been happy .
neutral	please_note that the company is a bit_slow when it comes to refunding payments .
neutral	i purchased a hoodie for my grandaughter who is petite , when the top arrived it was way too small , but she was able to return at no cost to herself , and received a larger item which fitted her perfect just a few_days_later .
neutral	not working for me through explorer , nearly missed bargain but went through chrome and went ok .
neutral	way back in june , my wife bought some pre_- packed strawberries from sainsburys .
neutral	when she was cleaning them she noticed several blue pellets in the base of the pack in contact with the fruit .
neutral	we thought these were rat poison and were horrified to think what could have happened had the grandchildren been with us and helped themselves to the fruit .
neutral	although the immendiate reaction by sainsburys was good , ( the assistant manage visited us with replacements within a hour ), things then stalled .
neutral	the grower contacted us to apologise and explain that the pellets were slug pellets ( rat poison , slug poison ... both are not really part of a healthy diet ).
neutral	he promised some of his best cherries when they were in season as goodwill .
neutral	sadly he forgot and it was 00 weeks_later after we made several contacts with sainsburys that a tray of apples , pears and plums suddenly arrived ... no note ... no apology , nothing even to indicate the sender .
neutral	we are dissappointed by sainsburys because we have had to push all the way to get any reaction .
neutral	nothing was forthcoming .
neutral	we were not after material gain , just a good old_fashioned apology .
neutral	maybe a token of goodwill would have been in order , but not the prime aim .
neutral	we have received a £_00 to shut us up ( as well as the anonymous tray of fruit ) but no one has taken the time and trouble to write to us to apologise for what could easily have been a nasty incident .
neutral	can you imagine the headlines ' child poisoned by poisoned strawberries '.
neutral	sainsburys don_'_t seem to have thought beyond the '£ 00 , now shut - up ' stage .
neutral	come on sainsburys , time to put the care back in customer_care .
neutral	a clue .
neutral	swallow your pride , put pen to paper and apologise .
neutral	the £_00 voucher is not the way forward .
neutral	was delivered later than the one hour time_slot allocated . no apologies received or notification he would be late .
neutral	i was disapointed because there was no air_con an we got bitten to death !
neutral	plus the t . v .
neutral	was all dubbed in german !!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	so i ordered an snes super scope from ebay last_week to use as a prop for a convention this coming weekend and it was dispatched quite quickly .
neutral	i thought " great , i should get it by friday or saturday at_least " and nothing could go_wrong right ?
neutral	wrong !
neutral	it '_s the following_monday , i '_ve been waiting for my package .... or at the very least , updates on it ... my tracking_number is p00lmbg
neutral	loaded_onto perth van
neutral	at 00 : 00 , mon , 00 sep 0000
neutral	delivery attempted , we will reschedule
neutral	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
neutral	loaded_onto perth van
neutral	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
neutral	they have attempted a delivery , whilst it was true that i was out of the house on saturday and didn_'_t come home till after 0 , why was there no calling_card left ?
neutral	was the parcel even delivered or did the guy just think " screw it they don_'_t really need this ".
neutral	and loaded_onto perth van .... why is it so hard to get it to dundee ?
neutral	it '_s literally the next town over , it '_s at_least a 00 minute to an hours drive and i live in a street that is really not hard to find because it '_s outside the city_centre which is small .
neutral	it doesn_'_t take at_least 0 hours to get it to the next city over
neutral	i ' m yet to contact them but when i do i will not be happy
neutral	next time i will pay for the shipping with royal_mail and not always go for the free shipping
neutral	[ update ]
neutral	i have contacted the customer service line and they were actually really helpful , they just had a problem with my address .
neutral	i provided the details and the package actually arrived whilst i was on the phone .
neutral	lovely , good quality products though this most definitely isn ’ t the company to use for the faint hearted or those wanting a stress_free time !
neutral	the invitations were the easiest and best ordering experience but it went downhill from there .
neutral	misinformation was given regarding motifs , the print colour of our order of service ’_s was wrong and then finally we received an a0 table plan when an a0 was ordered .
neutral	mistakes were corrected quickly , quibble - free and courteously – however there were far too many and they really shouldn ’ t have happened .
neutral	paid for 00hr delivery and received 0 days_later what can i say is it worth chasing no i wont go back im_afraid .
neutral	i ordered my duel fuel cooker and in 0days it arrived i wanted to have it installed with ao . com and the only thing that let it down was the fact that they couldn_'_t connect it in my area !
neutral	!
neutral	i was disappointed and a little annoyed but i found some one that charged me £_00 less_than ao . com if they had of fitted it for me ...
neutral	but apart_from that i was delighted with my purchase delivery slot and service ..
neutral	ordered about 0 things on 0 order and they just arrive out of the blue here there and everywhere .
neutral	hard to keep check when they arrive at different times .
neutral	very very slow delivery and thank_god i have amazon_prime .
neutral	i will have to think very hard before ordering again , i think i would rather pay a couple of quid difference knowing my item would be delivered in a reasonable time
neutral	always seem to have great offers but never at the time that suits me .
neutral	i am eagerly waiting to try one out to complete the experience withthe potential savings on offer .
neutral	when away from home i delete many e_- mails on my return to keep pace with them but i always read the dealchecker ones .
neutral	dell sent me a ' no reply accepted ' email to say the pc would be delivered by courier in next week or so .
neutral	next_day 00 / 00 / 00 the courier sent me their first contact , a ' no reply accepted ' email " your dell order is scheduled to arrive between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	please arrange for someone to be there throughout this time - as we cannot be more specific about the time of delivery .
neutral	as your order is already on its way we regret it '_s too late to change the following details :
neutral	0 . delivery date
neutral	0 . delivery address
neutral	0 . order details "
neutral	i tracked down someone at dell to complain at this attitude and to say that i ' d have someone available 0 - 0 : 00 but it would have been nice to have proper contact with the courier not this ultimatum .
neutral	and that roads around here are badly flooded so it ' d be an idea for them to ring us anyway to discuss access .
neutral	the delivery was fine , but this sort of attitude suggests a lack of customer_care .
neutral	needed a spare key for our tow_bar . and on googling found this site ... really happy with price .. not so happy with postage .
neutral	it was 0 . 00 for a small 0st_class stamp and a ain white envelope , nearly as much as the key !
neutral	so , i '_ve had not one but two issues this morning with dpd .
neutral	one was a delivery for a fridge ( 00000000 ) where they decided to leave a card but felt they didn_'_t have the time to bother buzzing my door .
neutral	i specifically took the day off to wait for them ; i was sat in my flat all morning , dead quiet .
neutral	no tv , no loud background noises , in a rural_area where all you can hear are the birds tweeting and the odd car .
neutral	after a short_while i decided to go downstairs to check my mailbox , and surprise_surprise an attempted delivery card !
neutral	i called the retailer ( fridgefreezerdirect ) and fortunately they '_ve been really good and managed to arrange_redelivery this afternoon so i haven_'_t wasted my entire day .
neutral	the retailer suggested they ' re supposed to * actually * attempt delivery and are obligated to wait for 00_mins at each address or they really get in trouble .
neutral	i heard they keep gps logs so i wonder what story the evidence tells ?
neutral	they tried to suggest my buzzer may be on the blink , but i went right down and tested it out .
neutral	sure_enough it '_s loud enough i can hear it from outside , so i can only assume the driver doesn_'_t know how buttons work - god_knows_how they figured out how to operate a vehicle .
neutral	then to add to the confusion , i was awaiting yet another delivery from amazon via dpd ( 00000000 ) and no card this time , just sitting here quietly and an_email popped_up saying nobody was home .
neutral	great , so how am i reading about it in my flat ??
neutral	i got several emails before the " attempt " saying " be sure you ' re in !"
neutral	and " your delivery '_s going to be at this time in the morning ", so i was sat there ready in wait , but this driver decided it wasn_'_t worth their time either .
neutral	i suppose they ' re sharing efficiency tips or too_busy doing doughnuts in a carpark somewhere ?
neutral	i rang up amazon immediately to try and get them to redeliver , but they couldn_'_t reach the driver and who_knows if they ' re actually going to try again today .
neutral	if they can sort it out by the end of the day they will have redeemed themselves somewhat , but i ' m really not impressed .
neutral	i '_ve had issues like this with dpd '_s " attempted deliveries " last christmas as well .
neutral	edit : driver for the fridge delivery just got in contact and he '_s hopefully going to deliver this afternoon , fingers_crossed .
neutral	i '_ll update my review as i see progress .
neutral	edit0 : just got my amazon delivery , the guy claims he came this morning and was outside ringing the bell for 0 minutes .
neutral	i ' m not convinced but i ' m happy i got my parcel today .
neutral	edit0 : my fridge has arrived !
neutral	it '_s unfortunate that i had to take both the afternoon and morning off rather_than just the morning , but at_least everything was sorted_out within the day .
neutral	i still have no_idea what happened in the morning , but both amazon and fridgefreezerdirect dealt_with the matter well and arranged redeliveries with dpd quickly and without charge , which is better_than many other couriers in my experience .
neutral	i have used holiday_autos for more years than i care to remember and this year they placed my business with airauto and the experience was not great .
neutral	i will use them again but lets_hope i get placed with a main stream company like i usually get .
neutral	normally i would have given 0_stars , but not on this occasion .
neutral	bought bf0 limited with b0k was sent 0 keys immediately after payment both in use .
neutral	was given a new bf0 key a couple of days_later , however it took a bit longer to get the b0k , told me it was sent in original email after purchase .
neutral	took a couple of attempts to get across that key was already in use .
neutral	overall i can say from my experience they won_'_t rip you off , its just a shame that when you buy a game in good faith the keys are already in use and its not an_immediate replacement , you have to wait a couple of days .
neutral	i ordered a printer from the website , which seemed to indicate that it would be available .
neutral	the next_day came a commendably early call to my wife ( as i was at work ) advising that , although the printer was advertised on the website , it was no_longer available .
neutral	an_alternative was offered , but at over twice the cost ( plus_vat ).
neutral	a further call followed while i was still at work , wanting to speak to me as the card_holder and then promising to call later , when i returned .
neutral	no call came , despite my waiting in , so i went elsewhere for my new printer - a lost opportunity for the company .
neutral	i have been shopping at morrisons since they bought out safeway in 0000 .
neutral	they keep a reasonable stock of brand items unlike_some , but we have seen them change their management style .
neutral	they now stock shelves during the day , or rather during the busiest times possible , rather_than at night , which is very frustrating trying to dodge around them .
neutral	in addition , it used to be a " nice " place , but the till staff are under so much pressure now , they dare not speak or smile ...
neutral	royal_mail lost my order emailed for replacement and one was sent one out by ups package arrived damaged but goods were ok apart_from the lid on chain lube was cracked .
neutral	i like sportsbikeshop but they need to have a word with there couriers
neutral	easy ordering , delivery ok . not the fastest but all received .
neutral	however i was disappointed that the worming_tablets i purchased have a very short use by date .
neutral	i bought in bulk to last at_least a year but the ones i received need to be used by the beginning of august , so some will end up getting put in the bin .
neutral	they ' re not cheap to just throw_away either :( i would buy again but would be selective in my purchases so '_s not to be short_dated again .
neutral	i have no issues with the booking process , however due to the late arrival of the chauffer on my departure i nearly missed my flight .
neutral	the company was called stress_free parking and i waited 00minutes for a chauffer to arrive .
neutral	i had to make a number of calls to check their progress and in fact check - in had closed by the time i reached the counter .
neutral	i had already advised the controller that if i had to pay any change of booking fees that these would be forwarded to the company as the whole idea of booking valet_parking was to ensure minimum delay .
neutral	as it happened the flight was late in boarding and my checked bag was able to be accepted through security .
neutral	this combination of these two factors meant that i was the last to board my flight .
neutral	needless to say it was not a stress_free parking experience .
neutral	i have ordered two_pairs of raybans from selectspecs in the last three_months .
neutral	the pair were for me , a saving of 00_% from the high_street .
neutral	great price , but ... they took about 0 weeks to come , and then they werent the right fitting .
neutral	as they were varifocals , i put this down to the fact that you really do need to go to a high_street optician , to get an accurate fitting .
neutral	i did send them an old pair of glasses to aid measurement .
neutral	i will have to get the lens changed , and pay the high_street price .
neutral	selectspecs offered to changed them for a a fixed lens pair , but i declined .
neutral	the other pair , for my son , were perfect .
neutral	very pleased with the price , and service .
neutral	three_weeks as_opposed to five .
neutral	ordered over £_00 worth was told next_day delivery , it took 0 days not happy
neutral	i ordered a cooker which was not in stock however pixmania came through a delivered 0 day later great , but the cooker never made off the van as it was damaged here begins the problem :-
neutral	0 ) it took the driver 0 hour to arrange return he then told me to contact pixmania .
neutral	0 contacted pixmania the next_day and was told i would be notified in 00_hours of the appropriate action and refund i managed to get across that i wanted a replacement not a refund .
neutral	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone and through the same story and result wait 00_hours .
neutral	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone and through the same story and result wait 00_hours so i asked for the head_office number but they don_'_t have one as its in france .
neutral	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone i spoke the the same person and he was good enough not to fob me off with the usual " i so sorry " but had no choice but to repeat pixmanias ' position which was " we can '_t do anything until the goods are returned " remember i never even received the cooker .
neutral	so at this point i tried the find out how to contact head_office this time i called dixon group who own pixmania they put me on the the know how group which does delivery and installation with 00_mins they contacted pixmania and i had an_email from pixmania they will deliver the cooker in 0 day result at last .
neutral	despite the above
neutral	the people i spoke to were polite and as helpful as they were aloud to be and although i wasn_'_t abusive my apologies to them for putting up with an irate customer when their hands are tie by an inflexible system .
neutral	this could have be sorted by a phone_call to the delivery company to confirm the return and i could have had my cooker 0 days quicker .
neutral	to pixmania ,
neutral	please train and allow your staff to make decisions to help your customers and not have to clear everything through head_office .
neutral	thanks to your slow lumbering system i will be without a cooker for 00 days instead of my planned 0 day as my gas oven an hob were removed and disconnected ready for my new electric_cooker .
neutral	just as well you have good staff at your call_centre .
neutral	update :-
neutral	following pixmanias ' reply to this review i have been in touch with emma and all is well , i would up their rating to 0_stars if i knew how .
neutral	i had text from dpd uk to say they would deliver a parcel between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 and to make_sure i was in to receive it .
neutral	nothing arrived .
neutral	i checked the tracking and it says " unable to locate " but they have my phone number and only needed to phone and ask for directions .
neutral	they managed to deliver a parcel here for my neighbour this morning .
neutral	i now have no_idea whether they are going to try again or whether it '_s gone back to the depot .
neutral	i tried_phoning their customer_services but couldn_'_t get through to a human_being ( their automaton hung_up on me twice ).
neutral	not fantastic .
neutral	update 0th_january
neutral	today the parcel arrived on time .
neutral	i have therefore updated my rating .
neutral	i just wish they had got it right first time and still feel that the ability to contact a human_being in their customer_services department when none of the pre_- recorded options is relevant would be an improvement .
neutral	i have purchased from pcspecialists for many_years and will_continue all in all still a good service but when building your_own computer on line they don_'_t tell you of any compatability issues in my case i had the rampage motherboard and cosmos 0 tower i added two usb 0 '_s to the front of the tower but was not informed that i would loose two out of 0 of my usb0 ports they are there but not working as they can '_t be attached to the motherboard ?
neutral	so i have wasted money .
neutral	also i have a 0 . 0 creative speaker system but i can only use 0 . 0 as the motherboard doesn_'_t have the grey sound port ?
neutral	this was not explained to me but the tech_guy '_s when i asked about my sound system ?
neutral	lastly i can '_t connect my brother printer wirelessly and the tech_guy '_s again can '_t help instead they tell me to contact the hardware manafacturer of the wireless card they installed ?
neutral	the people at trueshopping were super , and tried their best to help us when their delivery company failed to arrive in time , we waited in all day until 0 . 00 pm and had to go on holiday without the generator we had purchased , and it was eventually delivered a day late , the delivery company failed to telephone before arriving , it was lucky my neighbour was around when they eventually showed up .
neutral	if i was buying again , i ' d be reluctant to use trueshopping because their despatch company lets them down .
neutral	good product but one of them was not stitched at the bottom of the pajama .
neutral	my past experience with pcspecialist has always been positive .
neutral	my latest order has_been a bit dissapointing .
neutral	the specification for my machine was quite high for running xphe , but the performance is very poor .
neutral	i investigated this further and can put it down to the hitachi 0tb hdd having a write speed of 00mb / s and a read speed of 000mb / s .
neutral	the write speed is very dissapointing and drags the performance of what would be a very good computer that will be used for video editing .
neutral	the hdd is also very noisy compared to the previous machines i have ordered from pcspecialist .
neutral	finally , the promised firewire sockets were absent , however a pci card is in the post .....
neutral	i would not use them again purely because in this day and age there is no excuse for not processing and sending an order out in just one or two days following the order instead of 00 days especially as there are so many other_companies to choose from out there .
neutral	to charge extra for slightly faster processing is not good business practice .
neutral	also communication only followed when a query was placed .
neutral	to be fair the product was good and well_packaged and they did respond quickly to queries .
neutral	however as i say i won_'_t be rushing back !
neutral	ordered items after the cut_off time so that i could have them delivered on the date required ( 0nd october ).
neutral	at 00 . 00 on the due date a courier arrived .
neutral	i understood that the two items were coming from different companies so would not necessarily arrive together .
neutral	what i wasn_'_t expecting was to have only half the components for my desk delivered with no legs for it and no chair at all .
neutral	of course , their customer service team only work from 00am to 0pm whilst their customers are potentially still_waiting for their goods .
neutral	i am now not at home for another couple of days which means that i can '_t set_up my home office and get it all working .
neutral	buyer_beware - although i still only have half a desk , the customer service that i have since received has_been excellent .
neutral	i sent an_email after the goods failed to arrive and received a call from furniture 000 at 0 . 00am on 0rd october to sort it out .
neutral	i will update further once the issue has_been resolved .
neutral	final update
neutral	box 0 arrived on time with part of the desk .
neutral	box 0 finally arrived on saturday .
neutral	i firmly believe this was the fault of city_link ( who are total p00p ).
neutral	the chair that was supposed to arrive next_day was re - scheduled for the saturday with dpd ( confirmation text received ).
neutral	my oh dropped me off at a course in london and had to speed home on the friday because i received a text stating delivery would be friday between 00 . 00 & 00 . 00 .
neutral	apparently they were going to attempt delivery but it was definitely scheduled in for the saturday if no one was home .
neutral	he made it back and within 0 minutes of him being home , dpd delivered .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use this company again as i spent too much time trying to actually get the goods that had been paid for ,
neutral	ok it '_s easy and worthwhile going via their site to do purchases and get the credits , but a bit of a hassle actually trying to get " cash " back .
neutral	site said the retaillers wouldn_'_t agree to me getting the cash transferred into my bank_account ( after giving my full bank details !)
neutral	and pushed me towards " love to shop " vouchers .
neutral	i have went down this road as it '_s still ok but i would have preferred to actually get " cash " xxx
neutral	shiply fine be careful book early allow time to go else where .
neutral	seems every one can move a 0 bedroom house in a transit regardless of the i finery or volume requirements .
neutral	fridge bashed dining_room chair split in two wheels off typist chair room full of stuff left behind driver says you will leave me .
neutral	good review i ' m_sure i will .
neutral	get another job
neutral	i had read_reviews and comments regarding the onboard prices and they were not wrong .
neutral	i cannot understand_why this company charge so much .
neutral	most people expect a bit of a surcharge when they are part of a captive audience but when faced with pricing like this , if they are anything like me they become stubborn and refuse to buy virtually anything .
neutral	if i ' m not mistaken a pint of beer was in the region of 0 - 0 euro .
neutral	breakfast at 00 . 00 .
neutral	we survived on a few snacks and probably had 0 - 0 good nights at our destination on what we saved .
neutral	we returned home on irish ferries .
neutral	just as nice for roughly the same travel cost but food and beverage at half the price , 0 . 00euro for a pint of beer .
neutral	back to dfds .
neutral	cabins good .
neutral	staff good to very good .
neutral	due to exorbitant price of food & beverage i treated this as method of getting from a - b instead of enjoying a relaxing cruise with a nice meal and glass of wine .
neutral	if dfds charged reasonable_prices on board their customers would spend twice as much .
neutral	the waterproofs seem quite good , trousers are a bit coco - the - clown !
neutral	delivery was terrible !
neutral	carrier assumed he was at the right house , actually he was trying to deliver to an unoccupied house and kept leaving cards there .
neutral	eventually twigged when i checked the parcel - track on - line .
neutral	ordered a copy of family_tree maker 0000 , but web_site appeared to show picture of 0000 box .
neutral	phoned to confirm the actual version they were offering but they were either unwilling or unable to check for me - had a look on his system and told me he could only see much earlier versions available .
neutral	however they assured me that i would receive the 0000 item as_described if that was what they were offering on their site , and if it was not so i could return it for a refund .
neutral	placed the order on thursday and received the 0000 version on saturday .
neutral	their price was far cheaper_than anywhere_else on the web .
neutral	great delivery and price - pity about the call_centre .
neutral	we bought the corona pine bedroom set .
neutral	the furniture ( now its finally up ) is lovely , however when we got to the final piece , someone in the packing department had packed the wrong accessories unit , so we didnt have the right screws , nails etc to assemble the furniture .
neutral	not best pleased at the end of a very long day !
neutral	i phoned the customer service dept and was told a new pack would be out to me within 0 working_days - fabulous - but after making a little bit more of a fuss , someone managed to get the pack out to us 0 days_later .
neutral	no apologies given until i asked for one !
neutral	i will not buy from them again and would advise_anyone_thinking of doing so to cross their fingers that the correct set of equipment arrives .
neutral	bought everything i needed from this shop .
neutral	the only problem i could fault is the cables . they are cheap rubbish that is no good what so ever .
neutral	and the lights i got as soon as i touched them the button broke .
neutral	the cables and lights were cheap toys !
neutral	it does not reflect on the block party pa i bought , that was excellent .
neutral	be careful and look at what is described ...
neutral	i have never had a moment '_s problem with my o0 phone !
neutral	mine is a simple one as i only want it for making and receiving phone_calls and texts .
neutral	being an only child , and having lived on my own at certain times of my life , i appreciate having knowing that i can now be connected easily to everyone_else .
neutral	at the same time , i don_'_t get too many cold calls and have never had a real nuisance call .
neutral	then there are the frequent competitions , which are fun , the prizes often being free calls - which are always welcome .
neutral	didn_'_t receive the voucher_code deduction at checkout and the free gifts specified didn_'_t arrive !
neutral	however , the items i ordered were received by me the next_day .
neutral	i do wish simply_supplements would specify the size of their products though .
neutral	i have ms and as a result i have problems with swallowing .
neutral	the size of the information print is ridiculously small and the products really should come with a leaflet in my opinion .
neutral	dissapointing result , sorry .
neutral	the thing is with virgin , if it is working it is great but prepare yourselves for when it isn_'_t .
neutral	customer_services , based abroad , are absolutely_shocking .
neutral	nothing to do with them actually being foreign but the fact is the phone lines are shocking , they just do not understand you , and have the most basic crib sheets in front of them to try and diagnose problems .
neutral	on the rare occassions when they deem it necessairy to put you through to a uk level 0 operative you feel like kissing the phone you are that grateful .
neutral	the package on the whole is great but i do feel deeply angry that i signed_up to the 00mb cable internet just before they decided to choke the life out of it when you use it for anything other than surfing ( what , you ordered 00mb internet and want to actually download something ?!!
neutral	- outrageous !)
neutral	i won_'_t move as they are the best there is , but once there is an_alternative i will be gone .
neutral	i '_ve used ebay for several_years .
neutral	around half of the items i have trouble with , several never came and paypal were a pain to get the money back .
neutral	too risky on the whole to use .
neutral	good choice of business phones , though tends to be pricey .
neutral	initial marketing suggested that i would be contacted if service was an over - provision : no such contact occurred .
neutral	when my phone needed repair , it was astonishingly expensive , and my queries about why were ignored .
neutral	i won_'_t be going back to o0 at the end of my contract .
neutral	delivery was great however , flowers received could have been a better arrangement considering it was a small gift bag - disappointed !
neutral	villa rudi , cala d ' or
neutral	on a plus note the outside of the villa was beautiful and well maintained , and the views were lovely .
neutral	and the resort was stunning and clean .
neutral	unfortunately when first entering our villa our opinion was of disappointment .
neutral	there was a very unpleasant musty smell .
neutral	we appreciate that the humid heat does not help .
neutral	but surely you should be used to this and deal with nasty odours ’ accordingly .
neutral	the inside of cupboards , wardrobes and drawers all had the horrid smell , so had to be left open for days .
neutral	i ' m_sure many of them are not used and left empty , in this case they should still be cleaned and dusted inside regularly to avoid nasty odours .
neutral	the whole villa desperately_needed updating , especially the bathrooms .
neutral	they felt grubby and dated , especially the stained shower curtains and the thick dust on top of the mirrors .
neutral	shower curtains can be replaced for an extremely low_cost , and the fact that they had not been replaced for the season just goes to show how little you think of the comfort of your clients .
neutral	the dishwasher was diabolical , it run for approximately 0 and half hours and the dishes were still not properly clean .
neutral	it was in a bad state of disrepair and needs to be changed .
neutral	the tap in the utility room needs changing , it fell_off on use , and i got drenched !
neutral	the sofas were very grubby , we could not sit on them without towels .
neutral	again they need replacing .
neutral	our rep . sally was efficient but i found her unfriendly and uptight .
neutral	most reps . are usually cheery and friendly .
neutral	she spoke very rapidly and seemed as if she just couldn ’ t wait to deal with us and move on .
neutral	it just made us feel very undervalued as clients of yours .
neutral	maybe she was just having a bad day !
neutral	also , you need to make it clear that we are supposed to pay extra and book our own seats for the flights .
neutral	my husband and i are very used to doing this , being frequent travellers .
neutral	we did think about doing it but there was no obvious link ?
neutral	so we assumed that villa_plus had carried_out this task .
neutral	arriving very early at luton , after little sleep and being told that our 0 year_old had to sit on his own with strangers , was not a good
neutral	start to our family holiday .
neutral	a hire_car was arranged through avis , we only had around 0 people in the queue in front on us but the wait was still well over an_hour .
neutral	we arrived on the 00th_july but the queues were much longer the following saturday when we dropped the car off .
neutral	friends of ours have stayed in your villas and been happy , but obviously for some reason you do not have the same standards in all your villas ?
neutral	we came away feeling sorry for the next family who had to endure the inside of this villa .
neutral	my husband and i are desperately trying to put it down as a bad_experience , and are trying to just forget about the villa .
neutral	i have been trying to source a ford mondeo , and i was offered the details of four main dealers with , give - or - take , the car i was seeking , but none of the four has actually been able to say if they actually have that car - or even if or when they will be able to obtain it .
neutral	users of the site need to be aware that ford dealers are all fishing in the same pool and may offer a vehicle which they simply hope to be able to obtain for you at some point in the future .
neutral	it seems to me that this is a potential weakness in an otherwise promising model .
neutral	flowers look good , but was expecting more having paid extra for the ' deluxe ' version of the bouquet .
neutral	delivery driver ditched the bouquet at the front_door , rang bell and drove off instantly leaving flowers to be stolen if nobody was in .
neutral	i received my watch today .
neutral	it was delivered very quickly and i was impressed by that .
neutral	as far as the watch is concerned that is ok but i was disappointed to find the dial was a dull grey colour compared to how white it looked on the website .
neutral	my main gripe though is the bracelet !
neutral	it did not fit me , i needed to make it bigger but there were no instructions in how to do that .
neutral	i have now got to drive all the way into_town to find a jeweller who can either make it bigger or supply me with one that fits .
neutral	we use aldi quite a lot for generally a good standard of products at a fair price , but get annoyed when basic products just disappear for a few_weeks ( or longer ), sometimes being replaced by an inferior recipe .
neutral	one at present concerns fruit teas .
neutral	the diplomat berry fruits tea rightfully won some awards and has_been my brew of choice for several_years .
neutral	recently after a brief absence this reappeared in a new , slightly_larger box , and the new product tastes frankly awful .
neutral	a sweet , chemically nothing , with no " berry " flavour .
neutral	a quick comparison of ingredients shows a considerable reduction in the good stuff , which probably explains the lack of flavour .
neutral	i will return the rest of the box , and look_elsewhere for a replacement
neutral	the hamper arrived beautifully boxed but the granite slab was unprotected in the hamper and arrived broken .
neutral	i found contacting the help_desk very difficult and confusing .
neutral	the help_desk needs to tell customers when an entry has_been updated .
neutral	it seems odd to get an_email to confirm that i have just signed for delivery , but issues reported to the help_desk do not create progress emails .
neutral	the problem has now been resolved to our satisfaction
neutral	it '_s good , quick , convenient , etc .
neutral	but expensive - not value for money really
neutral	if i could be bothered to shop around , i ' d probably get a better deal .
neutral	i think my health issues are pretty minor but they bump up the premium .
neutral	the option in previous years to exclude them from cover has_been removed .
neutral	i renewed with wft because i ran_out of time to shop around .
neutral	this will probably be the last_year i use them .
neutral	the people on the phone are excellent .
neutral	the cover is good and the documentation is clear .
neutral	given that i use the cover for winter sports , there '_s no easy " card " or single sheet of paper that i can carry around when i ' m out .
neutral	other_providers offer this .
neutral	i recently bought a new camera through jessops website .
neutral	knowing nobody would be home to receive the package during the working week i opted for a so - called guaranteed saturday_morning delivery and paid the extra fee .
neutral	the package never showed up on saturday .
neutral	on enquiring with jessops i was told that the package was in the hands of parcelfarce - had i known this at first , that would have been enough to make me take my custom elsewhere .
neutral	as it was , it was several days_later when i finally got my goods , having wasted a whole saturday at home being assured by jessops that the parcel would arrive and having had to ask someone to wait at home the following week rather_than risk the package disappearing into the black whole known as parcelfarce .
neutral	i '_ve still not received a refund for the extra postage they robbed me of .
neutral	would i buy from jessops again - no !
neutral	had a delivery just before_christmas 0 items missing , got a refund and a voucher for a free delivery in the future .
neutral	would have been nicer to have my delivery cost refunded as i had to go out to get missing items , havng a delivery is to avoid going out so delivery was a waste of time
neutral	easyjet ... cheap flights ... you get what you pay for ... small seats , & fast turn_around ... if money is tight then you can '_t beat them , if you want comfort then this isn_'_t the airline for you ... they do " what it says on the tin ", nothing more ... having said that crew were bright & chirpy , & helpful .
neutral	bugbear : i wish all families with babies were put in the same area of the plane , so those of us without children don_'_t have to endure ( bit harsh ' endure ' but can '_t think of another word ) ' surround_sound ' baby crying ...
neutral	acceptable experience , but not desired quality ....
neutral	great for keeping in touch and finding old friends but the changes without my choice are annoying , why cant the new styles just be a choice ?
neutral	plus each time i have to reset my privacy settings , they should just stay the same .
neutral	i bought 0 lap tops roughly within a month of each other primarily for work purposes , one as a back up . the first machine has worked superbly and is faultless , the other the complete opposite .
neutral	whilst the first laptop has worked as i would wish after purchasing the 0nd as a backup i put it aside .
neutral	when it was called into action a few_months later it failed in the first day so was returned .
neutral	on its return it again failed the first time it was used so again returned .
neutral	this time on its return it refused to switch on !!!!
neutral	it was returned this time using the priority option - it took an unimpressive week to be returned .
neutral	in between times the delivery guy called on the wednesday to coleect the lap_top , as i pointed_out to him he had already picked it up 0 days earlier , he looked at his sheet , shook his head apologiesed and left .
neutral	rpm to thier credit had left me with a freeback up in the meantime ..
neutral	when they returned it again i was charged nearly_£_00 to fix a problem that had been there since ithe lap tops earliest days under warrantty .
neutral	to be charged for a problem that started whilst the laptop was under_warranty is very unimpressive !
neutral	i will use rpm again for perriferals , as for hardware that will require a lot of thought !!
neutral	very much the good and equally the bad in my experiiences .
neutral	would really like to mark the stars at the top 0 . 0 / 0
neutral	animed delayed my order due to the otodex cream being out of stock , they should have refunded me straight_away for this item so that the cimicat kitten milk i also ordered could have been sent straight_away , i had to contact them a week_later to find out why my order still had not arrived , it was only then that they refunded me and sent the milk .
neutral	i sent my sony xperia z to gadget_panda only to receive an_email_saying they couldn_'_t accept it as one of the water indicators had changed color .
neutral	i was shocked to hear this as i hadn_'_t even tested the waterproof capabilities of the phone and it had never even been anywhere_near water .
neutral	when i received the phone back i along with my wife opened all the flaps covering the ports on the phone and all the water indicators were still white .
neutral	i emailed gadget_panda back but was told that at_least two people check each phone received and they were adamant that one of the water indicators was red .
neutral	they suggested i check again which i did and they are definitely all still white .
neutral	i again emailed and was told that as they no_longer had the phone they could not verify this .
neutral	so i wasted money on postage sending my perfectly ok phone to gadget_panda only to be told a lie as to the received condition .
neutral	something has obviously gone wrong with their checking procedure and now they are insinuating that i have dodgy eyesight or that i haven_'_t checked all my phones ports or that i am lying .
neutral	this whole_experience has_been a waste of time and effort and i have paid postage_costs for no reason .
neutral	i am not happy and am in the process of finding out what my rights are and taking this matter further .
neutral	after various emails i have had my postage fully refunded and i thank gadget_panda for that .
neutral	as a follow_up to response to my last rating : there was no apology , and there was no offer of a refund .
neutral	instead , a clear statement that " all you could do was send out a new one ".
neutral	in fairness , i did receive a very polite email from the company , today , which returned my money to my account .
neutral	it '_s a shame , though , that this had to happen as they were out of stock of the unit ordered and the next best unit of its type so were not actually able to rectify the problem
neutral	in a speedy manner .
neutral	thank_you for returning the payment and for the polite update .
neutral	i '_ve booked several_times with alpharooms and my only complaint is with the the shuttlebus service .
neutral	just come back from benidorm booking with alpharooms .
neutral	landed at 00 . 00 , got cases , 00 . 00 booked in with alpharooms for transfer and arrived at our hotel 0 . 00am , now i think this is unacceptable for what should be a 00 min journey .
neutral	the same thing happended back in may .
neutral	went to benidorm again with alpharooms , booked transfers again , it wasn_'_t too bad on arrival , but our home journey , we were on the coach just over an_hour and passed one street away from our original pick - up point !
neutral	we were picked_up at 0 . 00am and arrived at the airport just before 0 . 00am !
neutral	now i appreciate you have pick - up '_s to make and someone has to be 0st and someone has to be last , this i can accept , but i think being on a coach or hanging_around for over 0 hours on what is in fact a 00min journey is unacceptable , so sorry , having serious thoughts abouth booking again because of this problem , so look into this alpharooms and i will_definitely be booking again .
neutral	always helpful always there when you need them but charge a bit too much to advertise products
neutral	i used boiler_juice several_times now , i use it simply cause its the easy way to get fairly cheap oil ... i know by ring around i can get it cheaper .. but normally with group discount etc it works out about the same .
neutral	normally the delivery side is speedy , but this time boiler_juice choose a different supply , they texted me a date , this day came and went ... no oil ... in fact they delivered late pm two days_later than their text ,[ edit .. i note that another has moaned about this supplier - bj take_note ] but cant moan as its within the 00 days but just as well i didn_'_t take time off for the oil man to come !
neutral	will i use boiler_juice again ?
neutral	... probably but if this happens too often ill be ringing around ....
neutral	good workers friendly & helpful , let me know how things were going .
neutral	but the down_side was the first guy that was sent out with just a plunger couldn_'_t unblock the toilet , the second guy sent out the same day with a jetting machine couldn_'_t unblock it ( but he had a remote_control ) the next_day sent billy who was the best but was limited as the equipment that he had wasn_'_t as good as the second guy & had to jet from the drain to the toilet .
neutral	this caused the toilet to overflow as he couldn_'_t see what was going on ............. if he had a " mate " with him or a remote_control it would have avoided this ........ after having to sleep on the settee for 0 nights with the smell , a contractor came around ( rentokil ) too remove & sanitize the floor .
neutral	another subcontractor had to attend on 0 occasions too address the problem & remove with digging the drain rods in the collapsed pipe .
neutral	i ' m left now without carpet in the bedroom or en - suite but do have it working !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	it has cost me 0 days from work , but they have paid for the carpet + vinyl covering for the en - suite , so at_least they have been fair , but if there guy '_s had the right equipment we all wouldn_'_t have had this drama .
neutral	for the price , it was fine .
neutral	the in - flight staff were extremely pleasant and more than helpful .
neutral	i would fly with this outfit again .
neutral	having the facility to leave delivery instructions was great - my vw bits arrived within 0 days , left in a secure place as requested .
neutral	well_done jk and interlink_express .
neutral	bit_slow at start but item eventually arrived ok
neutral	not my first choice but value for money is not bad at all .
neutral	the stores can be dated and tired looking .
neutral	i love looking around poundland but sometimes wonder about the sources of their merchandice .
neutral	i had a very mixed experience with serenata_flowers !
neutral	my first impression was honestly i would not touch them again with a barge_pole !
neutral	their lack of any phone customer service is hugely frustrating , especially as i had moved and the website would not allow me to change any details , although i tried five times !!
neutral	so my delivery was not delivered on the day i wanted and then i was told there was a mistake and it had gone to the wrong delivery depot .
neutral	i sent three emails and none were replied to .
neutral	however , when they eventually did wake_up to the fact that i was getting desperate , they were efficient and the flowers arrived when they said they would !
neutral	well_done for redeeming yourself serenata .
neutral	i bought the blind form the excellent website and this was duely delivered reasonably promptly a week or so later .
neutral	the fabric is very good quality , the problem is the mechanism .
neutral	the drawstring pull pulls from the " wrong side " of the blind and this makes it somewhat difficult to use !
neutral	this is a design fault and shlould be brought to the front of the blind .
neutral	secondly the double hook is too small for winding the drawstring onto and should be higher quality for the price - brass or stainless_steel .
neutral	i would look around for a better designed product next time , hence i can '_t recommend this company .
neutral	tenerife , sol princessa dacil .
neutral	i have just returned from 00 days with low_cost holidays and wanted to say i had a very clean and comfortable room .
neutral	room service was very good .
neutral	the meals were enjoyable with a variety of choices each day .
neutral	the pool was excellant .
neutral	fantastic view from the balcony , mountains one side , the sea on the other .
neutral	with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distant .
neutral	i would return for another holiday .

neutral	point 0 - users who provide a 0 star good review actually results in your overall score being downgraded .
neutral	matirx should be 0_stars neutral , 0_stars increases your score and 0 , 0 , 0 downgrades .
neutral	most users expect a decent business to provide a fast service .
neutral	the days of next_day delivery after despatch being a " wow " factor is over .
neutral	all decent retailers can do this now and it is now expected .
neutral	so to get a 0 star review based on user getting an item super quick is harder as we , as good retailers do this in our sleep .
neutral	trustpilot should accept this and in some ways take some accolades for it , as they have helped true retailers raise the game but to punish the retailer with a reduction in score for being good is stupid .
neutral	point 0 - no understanding of business
neutral	trustpilot uses a system to allow retailers to request a review guideline and in the interim period not show the review .
neutral	this is flawed beyond_belief .
neutral	a .)
neutral	if the review has the slightest mention of a service complaint , the review stands , even if it is illegal or just wrong .
neutral	we have exmaples , albeit few , of low reviews for products we do not or have ever sold ..
neutral	how does this end up on trustpilot ?
neutral	in our case we did supply the reviewer with goods , but the user obvoulsy ordered something_else from elsewhere and got mixed up .
neutral	no problem we thought ., we submitted the review for evaluation and explained that we do not sell that product and suggested the above scenario .
neutral	they came straight back and said the user provided an order number and the review stands .
neutral	well he would have had one from us , and one form the other supplier .
neutral	but there is no common_sense in trustpilot .
neutral	there lack of business understanding means they cannot get their heads around what can sometimes happen in business .
neutral	other than no one to answer the telephone ... not too bad !
neutral	i would not have bought from datakits if i had seen all the bad_reviews beforehand , but my experience was not bad .
neutral	i bought a mobile case and received a case the next_day ( very good ).
neutral	however , the case was not the case advertised being a cheaper alternative ( not good ).
neutral	i emailed the sales_department and received a prompt reply ( to my relief ).
neutral	after a couple of more emails , both of which received prompt_replies i decided to accept the product sent me and datakits ' offer of a partial_refund , which was in line with the price i could have got it elsewhere .
neutral	there was a bit of a delay in receiving the refund but after a reminder from me i received the refund via_paypal .
neutral	the plus point is that i have an acceptable mobile case at an acceptable price .
neutral	the negative point is that datakits were descrbing a product they didn_'_t have .
neutral	but at_least they did resolve the problem promptly .
neutral	in the last few_months we have used fastrac and airporter - several_times .
neutral	services are great , but both my wife and a friend did three circuits of the airport before finding the airporter car_park .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because the signs run out and you have to guess that you have to follow " authorised vehicles only ".
neutral	takes the gloss off somewhat .
neutral	sometimes you win - i '_ve no_problems with yodel , i live on the edge of civilisation in scotland and have to have to lot of stuff delivered .
neutral	they know us and stuff turns up ok . pixmania are conservative in their delivery promises and usually beat their date .
neutral	i bought a netgear wireless range extender .
neutral	the reviews warned that it comes with a continental plug and converter - it did , a bit oversized , but it '_s easy to cut the plug off and fit a uk one .
neutral	the reviews also warned the instructions for set_up were in french - they were .
neutral	the reviews also said they were rubbish even in english , and some helpful person explained how to do it .
neutral	i wish i ' d printed that off , because in the 0 or 0 days it took to arrive ( i was out first time ) the whole entry - product and reviews - had disappeared from the pixmania website ( or at_least i couldn_'_t find it - nor could the history entries in my browser ).
neutral	i spent an unhappy hour strugging to find another source of help on the internet .
neutral	pixmania overall - sometimes they ' re cheaper_than other_sites , but all the extras they try and add in automatically mean i avoid them otherwise .
neutral	they made a big deal about their "£ 00 for our 00 - week plan " offer .
neutral	only after accepting it did i realise the £_00 only covered the first four weeks , and the remaining eight_weeks would cost an additional £_000 !
neutral	i cancelled as soon as i had the first four week '_s worth .
neutral	so far , it all tastes nice enough , and i feel that i got my money '_s worth , but there '_s no way that three_times as much would be worth £_000 .
neutral	at_least there was no problem cancelling once i ' d discovered the real pricing .
neutral	it is good at picking uphair and bits .
neutral	but it is so noisy and sounds rattly . i do not usei t as oft en as i like as of the noise . also wish charger cable was longerlthankyou
neutral	i ordered 0 items on april 0 and eventually received second item today ( 0 / 00 ).
neutral	this situation caused a lot of inconvenience to my disabled father .
neutral	the company was very apologetic about the situation and i hope they will improve their customer service .
neutral	the items seems to be of a good quality .
neutral	ordered friday and delivered monday .
neutral	company agreed to change bundle to meet my requirement .
neutral	only one small drawback concerning somewhat difficult to contact sales staff .
neutral	otherwise would recommend .
neutral	i ordered gold envelopes and was surprised to see that they arrived in a very nice gold bubble_wrap envelope only to find that the contents were not gold at all .
neutral	in fact the colour was closer to yellow !
neutral	can '_t be bothered to return them , but wouldn_'_t order again .
neutral	i purchased an electrolux chest_freezer the delivery was quick and on time , but when the driver and his assistant arrived because of the packaging it would not go through my door so they asked for £ 0 to remove the packaging as we didn_'_t give them the £ 0 they just left the chest_freezer on the pavement for me and my husband to take in ( we are0 pensioners ) when we got the freezer in we noticed the wheels was missing so i contacted 000 electrical to be told that they could not help and to contact electrolux and they would send me the wheels , i was not happy as i paid 000 electrical £_000 and they did not help me , its now 0 days since my freezer was delivered and still can '_t use it as the wheels have not arrived .
neutral	so not at all impressed
neutral	price was good for insinkerator but until i ordered i was given every indiction that delivery would be amost immediate but once you had my order them i was informed that item was a manufactures order and i would have to wait .
neutral	fortunately for you the plumbing was delayed otherwise i would have gone elsewhere and cancelled my odrer .
neutral	since others had this common item in stock i am surprised that an oganisation as big as yours did not .
neutral	the original date could not be met since it was a bank_holiday but fornately they were able to deliver a day early .
neutral	ordered item for a christmas_present .
neutral	was delivered within 00_hours however as this was a gift it would have been nice to have packed the item rather_than just putting an address_label on the outside of the box so the contents were shown .
neutral	box got wet in the rain and became tatty
neutral	if you want anything from iceland go to the store , i have had three online deliveries and only one did i get everything i ordered , on one 00 items were out of stock but my local_store had them all , i ordered 0 packs of warburtons 0pack crumpets for a pound each the sent me 0packs of kingsmill one which they sold two for a pound and only had 0 crumpets which they sell two packs for a pound but charges me a pound a pack also i ordered three two litres of semi skimmed milk , which one had a hole in the bottom and was squashed which covered the fridge and the floor with milk , if you want shopping from them go to your local_store then whatever you put in your trolley you know you will get ...
neutral	mixed feeling here ................
neutral	good for buying if you know your prices .
neutral	bad for selling because of ebay rules which are highly stacked against you , you need a lot of luck with your buyers as i can tell you that all of the idiots in the world also go to ebay just to mess things up and because that you do need a lot of luck not to be dealing_with one of them and if you do you cannot rely_on ebay to help you out .
neutral	i was promised the toilet_seat by the next_day .
neutral	i ordered before 0 :_00pm and your site said i would have it by the next_day .
neutral	it took order day plus 0 .
neutral	if you cannot deliver in the time you say , you should change the offer .
neutral	i was not satisfied with your service .
neutral	received everything thing but one item , which i had to email several_times to get a reply for .
neutral	to be told it was with ups .
neutral	when i checked with ups they informed me not had to order .
neutral	and sent me proof to say was cancelled .
neutral	0 emails later i get informed will look into it .
neutral	now its apparently back with ups .
neutral	so will see if it arrives .
neutral	but other than that good .
neutral	need items for tuesday as it for a birthday_present
neutral	my parcel was delivered very speedily , but after ringing the doorbell on our three - storey house , the delvery driver hardly gave my husband any time to get down the two flights of stairs from the top floor ( which he did immediately on hearing the doorbell ) before he had taken the parcel to a neighbour '_s house .
neutral	my husband then opened the door to find his parcel being handed_over to a neighbour with no wrapping on it , so that everyone could see that it was a sad daylight therapy lamp !!
neutral	as he is unwell , and would not have wanted people to know that this is what was being delivered , he was very upset that the package had no wrapper .
neutral	why did this happen ?
neutral	delivery and follow_up not good enough .
neutral	there appears to be a reluctance to help once the money has changed hands .
neutral	i ordered a pc which was delivered next_day ,
neutral	great comms even a text_message giving a time it would be delivered .
neutral	after 0 days the pc developed a fault ( no fault of box . co . uk ), collection was arranged for the next working day .
neutral	this is when comms slowed down and it would take upto 0 days for a reply , as the pc was out of stock i opted for a refund which took 00 days after chasing up .
neutral	may be i am one of the few dissapointed customers on this occasion .
neutral	i am happy with their phone system they know who the customer is by caller id .
neutral	will consider purchasing again in the future .
neutral	prices ok , but let_down by needlessly slow delivery .
neutral	will not buy from again .
neutral	the stuff we '_ve had from graze is ok , no_complaints about quality .
neutral	but when you realise you '_ve spent £_00 in the last month for four weekly boxes , it is just too expensive for the tiny amount you receive .
neutral	for people who consider eating a couple of nuts and a sultana a day a " snack " they may be ok .
neutral	but for most people the tiny trays you receive can be eaten in two or three mouthfuls .
neutral	but that '_s the idea .
neutral	to get you to order more boxes and spend more money .
neutral	i also found the overly matey attitude they assume very grating .
neutral	they ' re a business , in it to turn a profit .
neutral	they ' re not my " mates " and they ' re not doing me favours .
neutral	they ' re selling a product .
neutral	it '_s a good idea , but the " sell ' em a tiny amount so they '_ll buy more " ethos they seem to have is too transparent .
neutral	i ' m not really sure what i expected from ready - prepared food .
neutral	its only something i ever use in an_emergency as all meals in our house are home cooked from scratch .
neutral	my husband , who has coeliac disease , took the opportunity to try one of the chicken dishes while i was away for a couple of days .
neutral	that '_s the best way he said he could describe it - ok but nothing special .
neutral	he felt that it lacked something - a bit bland in fact .
neutral	he has several others to try which i purchased for him , but he is very discerning about food , more so since he has had coeliac disease .
neutral	i honestly do not think though that he would want me to buy this product for him again .
neutral	giving people a chance to win what can be a huge expenditure for some people
neutral	on the whole , disappointing .
neutral	i have bought items from this site and the quality , fit and availablity leave a lot to be desired .
neutral	the sizing sucks , theres never anything decent for anyone a 00 or over and anything i have managed to get into didn_'_t last long once washed and the shoes have worn out quicker_than the wind changes direction .
neutral	definitely a get what you pay for site ..
neutral	my order was sent to milton_keynes rang them up i had to post there order to them and they sent mine to me , not what you want 0 days b0 xmas , thankfully we were honest poeple , not what you pay for ,
neutral	placed the order for a schuberth helmet and a blue mirror visor - the visor arrived in 0 days .... the helmet was noted as coming from the chichester branch .... after another 0 days there was no sign - a quick call to the customer desk and it was immediatly resolved and dispatched within an_hour .
neutral	so points off for forgeting to send the helmet and for me having to intervene - but happy to give 0_stars as it was very quickly dealt_with and they were genuinely apologetic .
neutral	its not put me off using them again ....
neutral	was dissapointed that the toilet_seat was rather on the small side and also no instructions with it but the money it is good value and comfortable .
neutral	if i have any comment to make about ebay , it '_s that they are forever fiddling - adding new things , changing old things .
neutral	fine , there '_s always room for progress , but in the case of ebay most changes generally seem to be worse_than the original .
neutral	the crossing was very good would like to see them start there sailing a little earlier each day , the food on board was very good hot and fresh if i have one complaint is we arrived at the port for our 0 . 00 sailing but due to the boarder agency only have one lane open we were late getting to the berth but the ship was still in but were not allowed to board so we had to wait_till 0 . 00 for the next one .
neutral	personally i don_'_t think they will last if they don_'_t sort_out there loading times as most of there ships leave ten_minutes before the booked time .
neutral	as i run a group called forgetmenotwargraves on the battlefields of europe we need to be there at times only the other operators can offer so we tend to go with p_& o but saying that we would become regularly travellers with myferrylink if there ships were to operate at early times .
neutral	but i wish them all the best for the future .
neutral	it would be more likely that i will use dialtosave if i could just press a key ( e . g .
neutral	star or gate ) to make another call after finishing with the earlier one .
neutral	having to re - dial the access number , plus the long pin code , then the number you wish to dial is really a pain .
neutral	having the repeat all the above when i try to dial another number , or the number i was dialling was engaged or with no answer , this really gets my nerves .
neutral	i felt that the quick and slick delivery and keen_pricing was part of always riding ' mantra ', unfortunately slow delivery of the maglia rosa book ordered , meant a late birthday_present
neutral	very good and friendly service
neutral	just , 0 next_day delivery split into 0 at delivery .
neutral	needed additional time off to retrieve the additional delivery .
neutral	part of the delivery cost has_been refunded .
neutral	recieved our order within two days .
neutral	however was very dissapointed as one of the mascarade masks was damaged , due to poor packing .
neutral	customer_services were helpful but still had to take the time to pack it up and send it back before getting a replacement .
neutral	of which im still_waiting .
neutral	we are looking_forward to useing your masks on our special cruise on cunard .
neutral	i have a love - hate relationship with damart : their goods are excellent quality but the service is really bad .
neutral	in spite of myself , i keep shopping online with them although i know i will have problems with delivery .
neutral	goods are late or get lost ; damart doesn_'_t tell you whether items are in stock or not ( or the info is wrong ); they don_'_t send a message to tell you that goods or dispatched or when you can expect them .
neutral	in brief , you order and then you wait ... one week , two_weeks , three_weeks , four weeks ... and the goods might suddenly appear .
neutral	the call_centre cannot answer any questions about delivery .
neutral	so unfortunately damart really does not meet standards online shoppers expect : tracking , fast delivery , accurate stock info .
neutral	but damart sells good stuff !
neutral	if only they could update their website and improve their distribution !!
neutral	!
neutral	helpful advice from o0 shop in seeking mobile_phone tariff reduction based on review of my usage history .
neutral	excellent except when they close your account for security reasons when there is totally no reason .
neutral	to get back is a nightmare !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a samsung monitor from pixmania and although the monitor is great and i had no_problems with delivery etc , the power_lead was european and , like other_reviewers on here , am miffed that i am ordering on a uk site that is actually not uk .
neutral	this company is only going one way and , unfortunately , it is receivership , so beware .
neutral	but they have lost the original reason they set it up in the first place .
neutral	no they are just trying to rule the internet , mobile ...
neutral	turning into another tesco .
neutral	sales knew the product from my description without a photo .
neutral	it '_s a shame that the delivery company you use delivered it to the right number wrong street .
neutral	it '_s never happened before in the 00 years i '_ve lived here so it was carelessness on the driver '_s behalf .
neutral	luckily the owner of the other house knew me and hand delivered the product .
neutral	i ordered a fleece jacket from sportpursuit on 00th_november for my husband '_s christmas_present its now 00th_december and its still not come .
neutral	the money came out of my bank accound on the 0nd december .
neutral	i can find no number to ring on the website to chase it .
neutral	i emailed on 0nd december to find out what was happening only to be told it could take up to 0 weeks .
neutral	-- since complaining i have been rung personally and my present arrived promptly so that i could give it as a christmas_present .
neutral	i am now happy with sportpursuits response to my problems .
neutral	the price including delivery was the best that i could find anywhere for my savage gear dropshot rod ( which i highly_recommend ).
neutral	i received a phone_call the day after_placing my order to say that the rod in stock was damaged but i was assured that i would receive my newly ordered rod by the end of the following week at the latest which i was still happy to wait for and i did appreciate the phone_call to let me know .
neutral	the downside was that the rod didn_'_t arrive in the time that was promised and it was quite some time after when it did eventually arrive .
neutral	when the rod did eventually come in to stock the actually delivery side was very good as i received an_email to let me know that it would be delivered the following_day and i was given a number to check with the delivery company so that i could get a time as well .
neutral	overall it would have to be price that bought me back as after_reading other comments i suspect that many more_expensive items that are advertised as in stock are actually only ordered from the suppliers after receiving payment from the buyer .. maybe i ' m wrong but it seems that many other buyers have had a similar experience .
neutral	personally , if i was told at the start that the items would be ordered in and that it would be about a month before delivery but the price was good then i would probably still buy quite happily as i would have known from the start before ordering but to be assured of one thing and then for it not to happen rather damages my future trust .
neutral	topcashback appears to have better rates than [_external_reference_].
neutral	however , [_external_reference_] pay our automatically which makes_life a lot simpler
neutral	these keys are shorter than the one i have and don_'_t quite fit in the window but with a bit of effort they do sometimes work - thanks anyway
neutral	this mouse was not as it appeared in the advert , it was so small .
neutral	the seller , however , dispatched the item immediately , and it was received in a reasonable time .
neutral	that was fine , but i wasn_'_t happy with the mouse .
neutral	the most_recent item i have purchased , a side table , i asked if it could be delivered to the fulham road store .
neutral	i was told by the girl in the store it would be ready for me to pick it up on a particular day when in fact it wouldn_'_t be there until 0 days_later .
neutral	i never received the promised call to tell me the item was ready for collection but had to call a couple of times myself .
neutral	if these sorts of issues could be ironed out then i would have given a higher rating as i love the products .
neutral	glasses came in a couple of weeks which was so much_better_than last time i used them which was months .
neutral	all this nonsense about " lost in the post " " chinese ny " doesn_'_t cut it .
neutral	in summary , products seem fine and cheap .
neutral	delivery is poor .
neutral	i paid extra for two day delivery .
neutral	delivery took four days and the promised emails concerning date and time of delivery were not sent to me .
neutral	the packing note that came with the delivery implies that the paid for two day delivery had not actually been implemented .
neutral	the bird box was of poor quality and had some damage .
neutral	an very similar item could be purchased elsewhere for a much lower price .
neutral	the camera mounting bracket will need to be removed before the camera can be fitted to the bird box .
neutral	the impression is given that this is just a set of items designed and intended for other purposes being collected together and advertised as something_else .
neutral	further to the above apparently negative_comments : an unsolicited refund of the additional postage_charges has_been received .
neutral	the camera has_been installed in a bird box without too much difficulty - it was necessary to remove the mounting bracket , mount the bracket onto the underside of the bird box roof piece , then reattach the camera and fit the roof piece .
neutral	it was purchased as a birthday_present for my wife .
neutral	she is really delighted with it and all that is needed now are some birds !
neutral	ordering was simply , delivery was speedy and on time .
neutral	build_quality could have been better base was out of square i had to true it up and trim the board ends , both side panels where build poorly with un even overhang for joints .
neutral	the window was very poorly built and had to be replaced .
neutral	although the price may seem cheep the build_quality can be maintained , regardless of this i would probably purchase again .
neutral	lovely clothes for children and women , if a little overpriced .
neutral	mens range is awful though .
neutral	a great idea , however , every time i visit this site i never manage to find a hotel or holiday that is any cheaper_than usual ?
neutral	good package holidays , more destinations would be nice though .
neutral	item arrived quickly and price was acceptable
neutral	order tok rather longer to arrive than i expected based on what was said on website .. was moved to priority after i spoke to someone on live_chat .
neutral	when it arrived it was well_packed and there was no damage but windows 0 would not load after several_attempts so i had to do a clean install . since then things have been fine .
neutral	so i thought i would put it on here as i have read their guidelines and still can '_t understand_why it '_s been rejected .
neutral	i shall not waste any more of my time trying to leave what i think is a fair review of the product .
neutral	they need to get their act_together i think .
neutral	bjorn recliner chair and footstool :
neutral	" we saw these in the shop and after sitting in them decided they would be great for our new tv room .
neutral	in the sale they were £_000 each .
neutral	having_read the reviews it was obvious that it would need a little patience and two of us to assemble them .
neutral	we started with the footstool first which was a doddle .
neutral	then we followed the instructions for the first chair - all pretty straight_forward until it was time to fit the arms .
neutral	it '_s at this point that you need four hands and a little patience as lining up the holes is a bit tricky .
neutral	leaving the screws loose certainly helps at this stage .
neutral	first chair and stool took 0 . 0 hours .
neutral	second chair and stool 0 hour even_though we struggled a little more with the arms on this one .
neutral	all in all good value at the price we paid .
neutral	they fit perfect , the leather is lovely and soft and they are very comfortable .
neutral	we watched a film last_night and i almost dozed off !
neutral	if you are ok at putting flat packs together you will be ok with this ."
neutral	bought a pair of north_face mittens .
neutral	postage was £ 0 . 00 tracked courier guaranteed delivery with an_hour_window .
neutral	was told they would be delivered on 00th_jan but they never turned_up .
neutral	couldn_'_t get any answer by ringing or by email from e_- outdoor .
neutral	got an_email this morning to say the courier would come today which they duly did , but yesterday was a totally wasted day when it needn_'_t have been .
neutral	so a tainted first experience .
neutral	could get a better deal somewhere_else .
neutral	the staff no customer friendly .
neutral	you will have to chase them .
neutral	this is a good site but not suitable for the non - technical .
neutral	i wanted to be able to update everything myself but still have to employ someone to do the jpegs and links .
neutral	well a tale of two properties here .
neutral	the first was simply awful and i have an issue with the way in which the property was advertised by blue_chip , this will be followed up under another framework .
neutral	when blue_chip heard about our problem the moved fast ; we had two small dogs so the options for another property was low .
neutral	they did find us something although not in torquay but in paignton .
neutral	this property itself was much much_better and very clean but the area was totally different - ' bungalow land '.
neutral	we did get a follow - up service call from them .
neutral	this event did spoil our holiday .
neutral	the process was fairly_straightforward if a little longwinded .
neutral	you get e_mails saying your goods have arrived , then they ` re being checked ( and if any are not acceptable - they don ` t return them or let you know , you have to check yourself !).
neutral	the prices they pay are not mega but if you want to get_rid of stuff and actually earn some money for it then it `_s ok .
neutral	placed my order from tribal six days ago , gives a . co . uk web address .
neutral	items are beefing sent from hong_kong , they only posted them today according to dhl for delivery tomorrow !.
neutral	this should be interesting as its about a 00hr flight to here .
neutral	will my parcels arrive before_xmas ?
neutral	well they ' d better .
neutral	site stated dispatched in 00hrs and items were in stock ?
neutral	so why post six days_later for next_day delivery ?.
neutral	if you '_ve ordered and been given 00hr dispatch then make your_own mind up , mine could be delivered tomorrow but i think that '_s pushing it a bit even for santa .
neutral	ordered goods ( no 000000 ) 00 nov . invoice received and card debited same day .
neutral	message from jack saying order processed and awaiting tracking_details .
neutral	so far so good .
neutral	on 0 december i send a query as goods not received .
neutral	no response .
neutral	today ( 00 december , i sent an e_- mail requiring status or i would contact my card company to cancel - i get as a response the identical e_- mail to that received on 00 november .
neutral	i leave to go on holiday at the end of the week and looks_like i will have to find an_alternative christmas gift .
neutral	avoid this outfit .
neutral	update - following this post , i was contacted by a helpful sean who gave me a tracking_number for the item which shipped 0 december and is en - route .
neutral	reasons for poor communications given as hectic holiday season buying - not really acceptable but good on them for making contact .
neutral	update 00 / 00 / 00 : i have reviewed my rating after having finally received a phone_call from a senior_member of ballicom .
neutral	this issue was resolved amicably however there are still some clear training issues required in customer service to avoid the initial fiasco .
neutral	[ original review ]
neutral	ballicom offered the best price but the worst returns_policy i have ever_encountered .
neutral	i purchased a pc which failed after two_weeks .
neutral	not only have i had to pay the return postage i now have to wait for them to return the pc to the manufacturer .
neutral	they have also ignored written communication .
neutral	so far they seem to have complete disregard for any consumer_rights or law .
neutral	i am now stuck having to wait for the manufacturer before ballicom will provide any replacement and that could take 00 days !
neutral	i will make no further_purchases from ballicom .
neutral	i bought a refurbished lenova thinkpad from them .
neutral	it arrived very quickly and is like new condition .
neutral	i paid extra for upgrades of ram & the hard_drive to a ssd drive .
neutral	it '_s really fast and a joy to use .
neutral	i '_ve had an old ibm before and they are bullet proof build_quality - the old machine was on xp and getting very tired hence my purchase of this one .
neutral	i '_ve only had 0 problem - i could not get it to allow me to make a recovery disc - it said the a copy had already been made & you can only make 0 copy !
neutral	so who made and kept the copy ?
neutral	?
neutral	microdream did not supply one with the machine so i phoned their support , the guy said he couldn_'_t help & that i would have to contact lenova to buy a recovery disc .
neutral	considering i ' d spent £_000 on this machine i was rather peeved that they didn_'_t want to know about helping sort this problem .
neutral	eventually lenova supplied me a pair of discs but it cost me £_00
neutral	hence only 0_stars because of their disinterested customer support
neutral	furniture arrived a day late , which cost us two days in time .
neutral	the dressing_table stool , has now fallen to bits .
neutral	all of the fixings in the legs have pulled_out , and it is now unusable .
neutral	very poor construction , and looked weak before assembly .
neutral	very very disappointing , i '_ll buy from a good old_fashioned shop in future .
neutral	the dressing_table and bedside_cabinets , were in a thousand bits , and took forever to put_together .
neutral	the paperwork says twenty_minutes , ha_ha !, no chance !
neutral	these did look very good when constructed though , and i am very satisfied with these .
neutral	however , prior to ordering , i did contact world_stores by phone , to ask about the amount of self_assembly there would be on these items , and he said " there is an element of self_assembly ".
neutral	this is a very misleading sales technique , and in fact not true .
neutral	it is a complete self_assembly , the like of which i have never seen before .
neutral	i am fairly skilled being a shop fitter , but anyone with minimal skills would struggle .
neutral	i may report this as mis selling .
neutral	...
neutral	but the help line ( i rang them twice on this matter ) could not explain in simple english one of the most fundamental questions : what exactly the " settle " button does and how do we know the figures it gives is correct - yet every night we are told to press it , print it and throw_away the report it creates .
neutral	what is going on - does anyone really know ?
neutral	saying it pushes the payment to the bank - so what ?
neutral	why do i need a report for that .
neutral	why are there so many breakdowns in the printout ?
neutral	why is the settle figure different from the z ( end of day ) figure ?
neutral	something bigger is going on and i am exasperated that i have no understanding of it .
neutral	its my money and i want to know !
neutral	the ordering_process was excellent and being_able to configure an all in one pc to a very high specification for the price was a big plus .
neutral	i chose to have a blank pc with no os as i had some spare windows 0 pro licenses .
neutral	i contacted pc_specialists 00 working_days after my order as it was not even registering as in build .
neutral	i was informed that they had a problem with a batch of chasis and they were meant to be in tomorrow ( thursday ) the guy said he would rush the build due to the wait and put the pc on special saturday delivery if it was ready to post on friday .
neutral	it had been quite a long time but i was happy with the response .
neutral	i got an_email it had been posted friday but delivery was not on saturday as promised but on monday .
neutral	when the all in one pc arrived i was very happy with the quality for the price , the only
neutral	problem with it at all was they had installed windows 0 home version , so just made installing my version take a bit longer , i am not sure why they give a no o / s installed version then install one .
neutral	but as the title states i would rate the actual kit and price as 0_stars only gave three due to timescales , being told i would get free saturday delivery and not and being told no o / s would be installed when it was but overall very happy and would reccomend them if you do not mind waiting a month .
neutral	never had a problem with the delivery before but after nearly a month the dog was wasting away without his food .
neutral	apparently it came out for delivery , went on a journey and returned without getting to me !
neutral	hastily rectified though when i rang the customer_services team and it was delivered next_day !
neutral	i am reviewing the post_office here today .
neutral	never had any complaints with letter deliveries nor parcel deliveries before .
neutral	but setting foot in wythenshawe post_office , manchester and having committed the apparent mortal sin of putting a couple of staples in a bubblewrap envelope i certainly would never ever go in there again !
neutral	so this is for the assistant_manager at wythenshawe post_office :
neutral	" hail mary full of grace .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	amen " i '_ve said it ten times along with 0 our fathers and hope my soul has now been cleansed !!
neutral	:)
neutral	i have had a co - op bank credit_card now for many_years .
neutral	back in the old days they were throwing cheque books at me , and giving an unnecessarily high credit_limit .
neutral	i reduced my limit voluntarily to £ 0 , 000 .
neutral	this week i have a payment and security deposit on an enterprise hire van declined .
neutral	guess why ?
neutral	because the co - op reduced my credit to £_000 .
neutral	no postal communication was received .
neutral	( how is it letters from other banks seem to arrive ok but not the co - op ?
neutral	it leads me to believe they were never sent in the first place ).
neutral	i am 00 years old , a property owner , with above national average savings .
neutral	so as far as i ' m concerned my credit worthiness is rock solid .
neutral	or is it ageism you are now applying co - op ?
neutral	i wonder .
neutral	i understand the co - op has quite_frankly ended_up in the creek .
neutral	they are going to make thousands redundant .
neutral	i also personally believe they are restricting access to the extremely low rates they were offering me on this card compared to modern day rates , and this may have happened to many , many others too .
neutral	whatever the case i do most strongly object to submitting a card to a van hire company and having it declined and having to use my daily shopping lloyds card instead !!
neutral	my credit_limit was £ 0 , 000 .
neutral	i didn_'_t even have £_000 used out of this , and to top it all i pay regular amounts throughout the month by lloyds fast payment into the co - op to keep my bills down .
neutral	update november 00 : and here we are , coming up to a month later and no reply from co - operative banking .
neutral	need i say any more ?
neutral	the hotel was easy to find and would be ideal for anyone arriving by train although there was also ample free car_parking .
neutral	there was not as much noise from other rooms as we have experienced in other budget hotels which was good .
neutral	the bed was comfortable but a bit short and there were hard and soft pillows .
neutral	the room was very clean but the general areas were shabby .
neutral	the worst part was that the smoking area was right outside the entrance so we had to run the gauntlet of smokers to get in / out - not what you want in your best clothes .
neutral	there is a nice little seating area by the river but this too was colonised by smokers so not pleasant for non - smokers .
neutral	there is also a little garden just for residents that we liked .
neutral	the staff seemed keen that we did not use the restaurant for dinner or breakfast which was odd .
neutral	presumably they get overly busy .
neutral	there is a tesco express near by so we got supplies from there instead .
neutral	although there are a lot of night clubs in the area it was well policed so we felt safe .
neutral	gardens0less is a great site for some of the greatest deals you could hope for , supper fast delivery and great customer service .
neutral	but
neutral	if the site would allow you to open an online account it would save all the hassles of entering all of your details everytime you purchase from them .
neutral	that one small item makes the web_site long behind the times .
neutral	i have placed an order and this has_been acknowledged by an_email_saying the the table is expected to be available from 00th_may and that i will be contacted shortly thereafter about delivery / collection .
neutral	as i have paid £_00 . 00 for delivery i expect this to be method chosen .
neutral	until the table arrives i am unable to comment further on the service .
neutral	mobile is just about acceptable
neutral	i have been a member of my local costco since it opened many_years_ago and i have been a regular customer and a huge_fan .
neutral	two years_ago i would have given them 0_stars without_hesitation .
neutral	recently however i have found their pricing much less competitive , so much so i am beginning to question if my membership is value for money .
neutral	for example :
neutral	books are cheaper on amazon ( with free delivery )
neutral	cameras are cheaper in pc_world and argos
neutral	pcs are cheaper in pc_world
neutral	many foods are cheaper in asda .
neutral	many white goods are cheaper on line without the hassle of arranging your_own delivery , installation and disposal .
neutral	once you could almost take it for granted that if it was for sale in costco then you were getting the best price .
neutral	sadly this is no_longer true .
neutral	costco '_s buyers need a wake_up call .
neutral	it is all to easy for consumers to find the best price available .
neutral	it seems that they costco are just too slow to react to price fluctuations in the current fiercely competitive retail environment and if they carry on they will lose out on membership .
neutral	it appears to be a good policy but the proof is in the pudding .
neutral	how good are you at settling claims without haggle ?
neutral	i would like to see some reviews from customers who have had to make claims .
neutral	they should be the first thing you see on your web_site .
neutral	another small thing is that you say you have frozen prices since last_year but despite the loyalty_discount i still paid about £ 0 more than last_year .
neutral	how come ?
neutral	the loyalty_discount is almost an insult .
neutral	00_% would be a more realistic amount .
neutral	as i say the product appears to be good but i hope i never have to test your claims_procedure .
neutral	the confirmation slip said that amner oils would make the delivery but it was in fact emo oil who did so , i have not heard of this company before .
neutral	i have since been informed by boiler_juice that emo oil is a subsidiary of amner , but i am still a little uncertain about reassurances concerning quality .
neutral	found celebrity cruises much_better value for money and nicer shp
neutral	prices take the proverbial and often full of kids
neutral	received 0 tablets in a cardboard_box about 00x00x00cm with loads of paper packaging .
neutral	ridiculous waste , and i paid for it too with high p_+_p charges .
neutral	surely a graded p_+_p system could be introduced , rather_than a blanket cost ?
neutral	just a 0 tier system , say under 000g or over ?
neutral	i also ordered from zleeps and read on the website that my mattress_topper would be dispatched within 00_hours , however , after more than a week with no delivery i sent them a message via the website - the only way i could find of contacting them .
neutral	after_reading some of the reviews on here i was very nervous that i had been ' done ', and didn_'_t expect to receive either a reply or my topper .
neutral	however , i had a ' shipping confirmation ' reply the next_day , and my topper arrived the day after .
neutral	the topper itself seems to be good quality ( although it hasn_'_t been slept on yet ), and although the service was slower_than promised , i am now happy with my purchase .
neutral	so don_'_t give up yet if you '_ve ordered something .
neutral	perhaps i '_ve been lucky , but i suspect this company is fairly small and can '_t cope with the demand .
neutral	they need to change their website to be more honest about their delivery times , and make themselves more easily contactable so that they can answer queries ( preferably by telephone ).
neutral	being hard to contact suggests to customers that there is something dishonest going on .
neutral	thank_you for my topper zleeps , and good luck to everyone_else who has ordered - you may just need to be patient !
neutral	the new check - in is a great idea if only it worked !
neutral	there are many_times when i try to check - in when in a store only for the dialogue box to come up " you must be in the store to check - in " but i am !
neutral	it also states " try going outside the store to check - in " - make up your mind please !
neutral	it takes_ages to connect and quite_frankly i don_'_t have the time to stand about or going in and out of the store trying again and again to check - in .
neutral	otherwise i like quidco very much - getting paid for doing your usual shopping , it '_s win , win .
neutral	cheap but too
neutral	many extras
neutral	ryanair were far too forgiving of the passenger who kept marrakech to edinburgh flight 00 00 . on the tarmac for an_hour .
neutral	it missed its slot and i had a large taxi fare as a consequence . empty any hold luggage , let them stew .
neutral	after my comments on here i swiftly received a call from o . f . l .
neutral	apologising and offering to make ammends to the way i was treated by there p . r customer team .
neutral	a new table leg was duley dispached and an engineer fitted it yesterday .. my table looks stuning now and im over the moon with it .
neutral	id like to thank alex preston for his help and phone_calls , he did a brilliant p . r .
neutral	job and totaly restored my faith in o . f . l .
neutral	i can only hope valuable lessons have been learnt by o . f . l . s telephone cutomer relations team and that this dosent happen again .
neutral	after all i still think o . f . l .
neutral	productsvs are top_notch value for the money and theres_nothing compares on the high_street .
neutral	!
neutral	i ' m sorry to have to submit the lowest rating so far , but i must be truthful in my opinion .
neutral	i came_across the tradeworks website when searching for a specific 0 - way tv amplifier to replace one i ' d just broken in my motorhome .
neutral	my requirement ( for several reasons ) was for an identical replacement and there were several such items on the web including some cheap new ones on ebay , but i chose the tradeworks item as i could get it quickly and with ( or so i thought ) the 00v power cable and adapter included .
neutral	the website said the stock quantity was " plenty ".
neutral	i paid extra postage to get the item quickly and it duly_arrived within a couple of days , however , when i opened the package i discovered that i ' d been sent an equivalent item of a different brand , and there was no sign of any power_supply cable or adapter , i wasn_'_t happy !
neutral	why wasn_'_t i contacted and advised that they didn_'_t have the correct item ?
neutral	had that happened i would have immediately requested a refund and gone elsewhere as it was an urgent order , but now i have to wait several days for them to get the correct item back in stock and then send it out , and it '_s only an estimate when they '_ll get some more in stock .
neutral	the guy i spoke to on the phone was polite and apologised for the error , hence me awarding 0_stars instead of 0 !
neutral	as i said above their website stated that they had " plenty " in stock , which was obviously wrong , and i ' m not sure the correct item will come with the power_supply cable as the website doesn_'_t give any indication of this one way or the other .
neutral	online shop style websites that aren_'_t accurately maintained are one of the main_reasons i ' m still to be convinced that internet_shopping is more convenient , because i ' m now being inconvenienced by the delay .
neutral	i ' m sorry once again for giving the lowest rating so far , but had the guy on the phone not been as polite as he was , it would have actually been lower !
neutral	my first dealings with parcel0go and so far my parcel hasn_'_t been picked_up .
neutral	it '_s been three days now for a next_day collection .
neutral	the driver went to the wrong house and i ' m not very impressed .
neutral	0 - 0 is a very big window too ... lot '_s of waiting in the house .
neutral	however , the company '_s reputation is almost saved by the live help , very professional people , all female so far , who have all been helpful , friendly and done their absolute best in a clear and efficient manner .
neutral	people like andrea today who instantly understood the problem , was intuitive about my dissatisfaction and made a beautifully timed upgrade gesture to smooth things .
neutral	these are the people on the front line so thank_goodness they are solid , it is so often not the case !
neutral	let '_s hope the driver can find my house now !
neutral	no comment but wont use again
neutral	we took_advantage of a brilliant cheap 00 hour return deal to see some of the countryside and beaches near calais .
neutral	the ferry was a little late going out but we didn_'_t mind that .
neutral	with a crossing of only an_hour and a half we were happy to sit and read until land was in sight .
neutral	driving off the ferry and onto the road south was easy .
neutral	we had a real problem on the way back though with finding our ferry boarding point in the huge calais terminal .
neutral	we missed it completely , eventually realised we had gone too far and had to turn_round and drive back .
neutral	we only found it in the nick of time .
neutral	apart_from that slightly unnerving experience it was a great trip and terrific value for money .
neutral	i bought two_pairs from glasses_direct , i have one pair with normal lenses with a blue tint , and another pair with the dark green sunglasses lens fitted .
neutral	i had to return the sunglassses pair after 0 months due to the outer surface coming off away from the lens , and glasses_direct brilliantly honoured their guarantee for these glasses and they were duly returned for repair .
neutral	oh_dear !!
neutral	the glasses returned to me had the blue tint not the dark green sunglasses lens i had returned , so i am now six_weeks without these sunglasses , thank_god the english weather is so crap , rain rain rain .
neutral	so basically you pays your money , you takes your chance .
neutral	recently made a purchase and everything was of good standard until the carrier took over - city_link - and delivered my parcel to another house over 0 / 0 mile away .
neutral	thankfully we had included our phone number in the purchase procedure and that was showing on the box and allowed the recipient to call us .
neutral	so in summary - everything_went well and swiftly until the delivery company made a complete mess of it .
neutral	excellent product ( not an import -- at_least in my case ) and excellent price .
neutral	and it arrived in time for christmas .
neutral	but i had no confirmation of my order for a week and i could not get any response by email or phone .
neutral	this needs to be addressed !
neutral	for an expensive product ( over £_000 ) the packaging ( just a plastic_bag ) was not really sufficient , but it arrived_safely .
neutral	i always check wickes first because they are always cheaper_than homebase and b_& q .
neutral	i have had a lot of building items delivered , timber , flooring , tiles .
neutral	usually it is all fine and that one time it arrives bashed up and the driver thinks its fine ?
neutral	likewise in store , a few of the staff have been helpful and polite , but my do they have more than their share of staff who really do them no favours .
neutral	i have heard staff aggressively effing and blinding on the shop floor without a care that customers are walking around .
neutral	till staff are often straight out of school vicky pollards .
neutral	the managers and directors really need replacing with someone who_cares_about making the business healthy .
neutral	i find my nearest three stores , twickenham , hanwell , ealing , dull and dreary to walk around ( poor lighting ).
neutral	it '_s just not good business all_round .
neutral	that said , i will always check them out first because they are usually cheapest ( need to check quality sometimes though ).
neutral	but for price , i would not go near them .
neutral	i ordered a samsung camera as a gift for christmas and it arrived within the specified lead time ( shipped direct from hong_kong ) but with the wrong plug on the battery_charger - it had a european plug instead of the uk one .
neutral	after several emails , a travel adapter was sent out which is not the perfect solution but does not mean that my husband can use his camera !
neutral	initially sent without fittings or instructions .
neutral	fitting instructions poor , one a0 sheet of paper which only a fitter would be able to decipher .
neutral	bought tuin grande gazebo , oringinally quoted £_000 fitting by the company which fitter increased to £_000 ( price confirmed in text ) when it was identified that the gazebo needed concreting into the ground .
neutral	however , this rose to £_000 on the day .
neutral	i challenged the fitter on this and he mumbled something about some other item purchased but which he had no receipt for .
neutral	this price was not including the £_00 cost of sand and cement that i had to provide .
neutral	beware of fitting costs when buying one of these products as it bumps up the price of your purchase .
neutral	if i had known cost of fitting initially , i would have had second thoughts so be warned .
neutral	over the years purchased many things from oka .
neutral	they are expensive but i like their designs albeit finishing on some furniture has_been disapointing .
neutral	in the past things have arrived damaged but have always been replaced without_question .
neutral	price great , delivery great , but touch pad didn_'_t work on acer laptop .
neutral	trying to get hold of returns manager very difficult , put on hold for 00mins after manager failed to return my first call previous day .
neutral	got wait to they look at laptop before i can have a replacement .
neutral	makes you want to got to the stores and buy a laptop knowing you can get it replaced straightaway
neutral	i found this very difficult to give to one of my cats .
neutral	the paste went everywhere but in the mouth !
neutral	she clearly hated the taste and was just not having it anywhere_near her .
neutral	my other cat was much_easier as i mixed the paste in with his traets and he ate them all up , no problem .
neutral	still not sure if it has worked though .
neutral	the one that hated it is still really thin and is off her food , this is now 0 days_later , not sure how long it takes to be effective but i think i should take her to the vets as it may even be something_else .
neutral	phoned up , asked if my details were still on their system .
neutral	answer was yes .
neutral	was put on hold for 0 minutes .
neutral	was told that the last address would be where the new tyre would be put on .
neutral	said i had a discount_code .
neutral	harassed customer service person was rushing me .
neutral	got my discount .
neutral	turns_out that it wasn_'_t the last address where the replacement would be done , it was the other address and i wasn_'_t there .
neutral	phoned the tyre replacement technician who had kept in touch throughout .
neutral	worked it out between us that i would get the tyre done at my home address ( which the call_centre said i was out of the postcode zone ).
neutral	more time is needed at the call_centre for the customer '_s preferences to be given priority .
neutral	only thing was checking out .
neutral	wasnt easy paying the discount price .
neutral	would need to use the site a couplke more times .
neutral	really handy .
neutral	normally find what i am looking for pretty quick .
neutral	why would your site not let me edit the email address for the company i reviewed , why would it assume the email address was info @ nep . com just because the company is called nep why would any web author make assumptions like that ......
neutral	also why not a link for the companies web_site as well .
neutral	why cant i rank companies by location , reverse review rating , etc
neutral	methinks you need to review your_own product .....
neutral	having_read these reviews for trustpilot . co . uk , at_least you have the cahonas to review yourself , but the main flaw of fake_reviews does not seem to be answered .
neutral	it is too easy to screw with a companies rating both positively and negatively .
neutral	( am not looking for an answer , this is just feedback for you )
neutral	i have signed_up to topcashback , the idea is good but i can not find any offers worth taking part in .
neutral	the cashback rates are generally low and full of terms and conditions , and i can not find anything worth purchasing from the traders taking part in the scheme .
neutral	if there is a special_offer on with one the traders your cashback is severally reduced or eliminated altogether .
neutral	i would like to purchase an ipad_mini from a retailer which will cost me £_000 . 00 and the best cashback deals works out at just £ 0 . 00 !!
neutral	!
neutral	none of the people i recommended to sign up thinks it is worth it .
neutral	would someone explain how you can get even £_00 . 00 back without spending £ 0000 '_s
neutral	mark bowles
neutral	ordered tickets from this website even_though i had found them £ 0 cheaper elsewhere , but i wanted to pay with paypal and this website offered this service .
neutral	wish i had waited the very next_day they had a flash sale that would have saved me £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i understand that they had no obligation to advise me if i waited 00_hours i could have taken_advantage of the sale , but it would have been good customer_relations .
neutral	beware if you buy tickets from this company as they may be cheaper 00_hours_later .
neutral	bt should learn that customers don_'_t want to wait hours trying to speak to someone in india !
neutral	we all have enough frustration in our day to day lives without getting it from bt .
neutral	fast delivery but i thought the product was a bit over priced .
neutral	can '_t complain_about the price of the arran jumper i bought for my husband , but the website said that it was 000_% wool and the label in the jumper says 00_% wool 00_% nylon .
neutral	woolovers tell me that this is why it was a ' second ' but that '_s not what the website says !
neutral	makes me wonder what the fabric content actually is ?
neutral	used to be my one - stop - shop , but since the kingfisher ( b_& q ) takeover prices have gone_through the roof .
neutral	guess they don_'_t want to take business from b_& q .
neutral	on the upside , service is still good , but now it '_s always worth_checking toolstation et al as someone_else will usually have the same thing cheaper .
neutral	solid but evil on pricing
neutral	strings_direct are good for mainstream stuff - i need bespoke and these_guys can '_t be doing with the faff .
neutral	oh well
neutral	great delivery and all that and good communication , but having looked at what we got - in the flesh - for the money we paid (!)
neutral	- a ' designer chiminea ' i would say its a rip_off basically .
neutral	we paid £_000 for something really worth £_00 in my obviously subjective estimation ): trading on the idea that its cheaper on line i suppose ; don_'_t be_fooled .
neutral	go to a shop .
neutral	i ordered the " this works " travel set on the 00th_april and chose the uk saver premium delivery and it did not turn_up in time for my holiday on 00nd .
neutral	i was very disappointed as i am addicted to the this works products and find their cleanser the best i have ever used .
neutral	still i have my little bag of goodies for my next trip .
neutral	i will change my delivery instructions next time .
neutral	i have used wheelspin_models a lot in the past and they are normally very good but i have not received my last order .
neutral	first time i '_ve used this company - it was the cheapest on the web for husked sunflower seed i was after .
neutral	delivery was exceptionally quick .
neutral	next_day if i recall correctly .
neutral	quality was mixed - i order 0 separate bags of the largest size .
neutral	the first was very dusty ( more than i would normally expect ) but the sunflower seeds it contained were fine and , ultimately healthy and usable .
neutral	the second was the same quality as i would expect from any other bird_food supplier - that is with little dust and healthy sunflower seeds .
neutral	not sure if the dusty one was just that - a one off - but would consider_using again to test .
neutral	can be a bit too pricey .
neutral	there was nothing wrong with the service or the flowers i ordered .
neutral	i got a text at 00 :_00am saying " your flowers have left the building ."
neutral	cute .
neutral	nice_touch .
neutral	thank_you very much .
neutral	they arrived at around 0pm .
neutral	by that point i was starting to think they hadn_'_t just left the building but they ' d gone to las_vegas to take up residency at caesar '_s palace ( like elvis in 0000 , in case i '_ve lost you ).
neutral	they were delivered by yodel , and came in a box .
neutral	i don_'_t like flowers being delivered in boxes .
neutral	it '_s not right - they should be delivered by a florist ( not a courier ) and should be open to the light and the air .
neutral	all - in - all , not much to complain_about .
neutral	but i won_'_t be buying again .
neutral	took a while to understand all the rating marks on the tyre , but overall happy with the tyres i have chosen .
neutral	will wait and see when fitted as to how good they are .
neutral	have bought from this site and found the good '_s suitable for the older members of the family , nice stuff though , postage fast and return '_s are no problem .
neutral	re booked insure and go travel_insurance recently , checked prices on comparison_sites and insure and go website .
neutral	prices apear cheaper on comparison_sites but level of protection advertised does not see to tally up with any schemes i found on the companies own web_site .
neutral	i have insured with them ( claim free ) for many_years now and dissapointed that there is no form of recognition when you renew with them and no no claims discount scheme available .
neutral	spent £_00 on flower & gift package .
neutral	order was delivered on arranged day , but was unfortunately left by a secluded door , with no note of the delivery through the main door of the address .
neutral	the gift was not received by the recipient until 0 days_later , after i ' d phoned to check she had received it .
neutral	the flowers were fortunately still in good condition .
neutral	phone_calls were dealt_with well , and sender agreed to replenish order if flowers not in good condition after 0 days .
neutral	sender also discussed issue with the delivery firm .
neutral	0_stars to imogenstone .
neutral	you can go to the site and find lots f ideas for water saving - awesome !
neutral	emma made this happen for me in terms of getting the item delivered - she gets 0_stars .
neutral	prices are great - definitely 0_stars .
neutral	huge problems getting in contact with the company and 00 day delivery time caused me a lot of worry - i honestly thought i ' d been_scammed .
neutral	the goods delivered were perfect and exactly as ordered .
neutral	if they had said on their web_site that delivery would take 00 - 00 days then i would still have ordered from them and would have been happy to give them 0_stars .
neutral	broadband_speed rating found talk_talk slower_than virgin_media but much much_cheaper and easier to understand billing process having been with virgin for a number of years desided to swap as virgin was getting very expensive to use .
neutral	cost of phone_calls line_rental etc .
neutral	talk_talk much_cheaper . and better customer service too .
neutral	too many hidden_charges in virgin usage not told until i told them i was switching then tried to offfer a deal , but could , nt match the savings that talk_talk allowed us to make .
neutral	initially i was told my htc one would be a couple of days , then 0 days , then looking online it said order for 0 days delivery .
neutral	my telephone enquiries , twice , to a friendly natalie ( there are two natalies there apparently ) who , despite_being friendly , " couldn_'_t " get any information from the suppliers about delivery timescales .
neutral	i didn_'_t have any major complaints about the time taken to get through to someone , about 0 - 0 minutes each time i called .
neutral	no worse_than anywhere_else .
neutral	i did actually email to cancel my order , as i ' d found one " in stock " elsewhere , only to find out it wasn_'_t in stock by the time i ' d had my order processed .
neutral	ironically , my cancel request hadn_'_t been dealt_with , and i got a dispatch email the same day .
neutral	phone arrived the next_day , and i ' m very happy with it and the deal .
neutral	good website , good prices .
neutral	but ....
neutral	i ordered 0 separate bouquets for 0 separate people .
neutral	only got one delivered on the proper day , the other 0 didn_'_t get delivered until the following g day , one without a card ( the recipient had to email to see who they were from !!!).
neutral	i got plenty of emails and texts letting me know were and when my orders would be delivered , but they were all mixed up .... getting a text saying that the recipient have received their flowers and then an_email_saying they would be sent the next_day .
neutral	first time using them , don_'_t think i will use again !!
neutral	!
neutral	since changing couriers the delivery has_been a nightmare , i am promised delivery but they just dont turn_up .
neutral	affordable_supplements to their credit do then act quickly by either refunding or using another courier .
neutral	bottom_line is they need to change the courier they use or will loose a lot of business mine included .
neutral	have used interparcel 0 times in recent times - first 0 times evryting went_smoothly , no hitches .
neutral	on the last occasion , experienced delays with pickup and delivery - required to complete several custom forms in great detail , would have liked to have information on this beforehand .
neutral	overall would recommend , but do your_own research on what is being sent .
neutral	managed to get a great deal on a return ferry trip dover to calais .
neutral	lucky that ferries ( both_ways ) were relatively quiet , so plenty of space to sit and get around .
neutral	but onboard costs were very high .
neutral	and service was poor too .
neutral	for example , there was no queue in the restaurant , so we went for some food .
neutral	asked what was available and were told that only breakfast items were available .
neutral	not happy , but ordered 0 breakfasts at a stupid cost .
neutral	we paid and sat down .
neutral	immediately behind us , the next people sat down with fish and chips !
neutral	what happened to ' breakfast only '?
neutral	doesn_'_t seem useful to me and when i had an account there i had troubles writing those short messages .
neutral	not useful to me , sorry , but i like the logo alot .
neutral	:-)
neutral	the front page looks very spammy , i can not even check my emails or use the search without reading about the latest robert pattinson trash .
neutral	too bad , as i made my very first email account with yahoo :-(
neutral	somehow i don_'_t seem to have luck with internet providers .
neutral	always having problems with the connection and customer service .
neutral	same with 0 & 0 , sometimes i have people on the phone that are trying very hard , and sometimes they are just rude .
neutral	the company should really check who they are putting on the phone because this gives me a bad image of the company that really doesn_'_t have to be .
neutral	i flew with lufthansa 0 times already , two times short and two times long_distance .
neutral	the long_distance flight was awesome : excellent service , nice & experienced staff , great media centre with lots of movies to pick .
neutral	the short distance flights were both delayed and the boarding was very weird , at first i thought wow this is superquick but then everybody was cramped in the dark tunnel in front of the plane and standing around for at_least 00_minutes instead of still staying in the boarding hall and doing it properly , with back seats first and so on .
neutral	i have mixed feelings about this airline , i would need to fly with it again to see in which direction it is going .
neutral	but unfortunately most of the times its a very pricey option , although they land at the most convenient airports .
neutral	let '_s see !
neutral	i think the fees on ebay are way too high ( 0 %!!!
neutral	), while prices go up for the sellers , it '_s good for buyers .
neutral	i sell alot of my clothes on ebay ( or at_least try to ) and most of them go away for a way too cheap price .
neutral	somehow people seem to have lost interest on bidding and ebaying .
neutral	it '_s really not the same as it used to be , i dont enjoy it as much as i did before and i am looking for other_sites to sell my perfectly new clothes now .
neutral	:(
neutral	i have bought some excellent items from wowcher which were delivered speedily and of good quality .
neutral	however i have had a problem with one supplier - the beauty challenge who initially failed to deliver any of the 0 items i ordered as xmas_gifts for my 0 kids - then after much chasing delivered three ( which i can '_t use as i need one for each ) - but is now not responding to emails or answering phone_calls about the missing two - i have called repeatedly every day for 00 days .
neutral	i have emailed wowcher twice - just had an acknowledgement but no action .
neutral	i then called wowcher on the phone and was told to wait for the other two to arrive as they had been redeemed on different dates - they weren_'_t !
neutral	am now fed_up waiting - and am thinking i should contact my credit_card company and paypal to dispute the charges unless i get a response .
neutral	i have not opened the products - but although they are advertised as original selling pice £_00 . 00 - sale price £_00 . 00 they look cheap - and are much smaller than they appear as advertised .
neutral	i also suspect they are not mains operated as_described , but won_'_t know until i open .
neutral	in addition i have spent an exorbitant £_00 . 00 on postage for three featherlight boxes crammed in one a0 envelope .
neutral	( max £ 0 postage ).
neutral	update - i received an_immediate_response from wowcher after my review asking me to contact them - which i did .
neutral	i then received a copy email wowcher sent to the beautychallenge a day or so later - which asked the beauty challenge to contact me .
neutral	needless to say beautychallenge have not done so - nor have the missing items appeared .
neutral	i would now like a full_refund - can wowcher confirm how they would like me to do this - given that their merchant does not respond ?
neutral	i would also like wowcher to say what they propose to do about merchants who fail to honour their commitments and then fail to respond to either the customer or wowcher .
neutral	i cannot be the only one fleeced in this way - the beauty challenge customer service department answered no phone_calls from any of the various numbers i called from in the 00 days prior to christmas - why was that ?
neutral	nor did they reply to emails .
neutral	update
neutral	heard from wowcher who have now processed my complaint and given me a refund .
neutral	thank_you to kerry who responded to my last email within 00_hours - i have given three stars because of problem with merchant - but would have given more for wowcher if just rating them - as they did do the decent thing once it became_clear merchant was not going to respond .
neutral	have purchased a very large item before from them and charges were minimal , but they wanted 00 quid to deliver a fairly small item to me , it was only 0 . 00 to get it delivered to glasgow .... i do not live in a remote or island location !
neutral	!
neutral	i used to use pharmacy_0u for a lot of my online purchases because historically they never used to charge for delivery .... but now that they charge for delivery they are just the same as any other online pharmacy !
neutral	i ordered a pure radio through go - electrical as they seem to be an independent and at the same price as john_lewis i decided to support a small business .
neutral	their website indicated the item was in stock and so i ordered .
neutral	upon chasing a delivery date i was informed that they were awaiting the item to arrive in stock .
neutral	i did not receive a response to my subsequent email .
neutral	bit disappointing considering the great feedback given through the trust_pilot site .
neutral	i ' m often seduced by the products offered but invariably disappointed .
neutral	delivery is often slow and items not always of the best quality .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i took my daugthers car in for a " half price full service " at the wolverton branch and found that the car had lots of " recommendations "
neutral	for example , the rear drum / shoe brakes needed cleaning and adjusting for £_00 which i thought should have been in the service - after all they would have already taken off the drum to " inspect " them as per service schedule - surely all the dust would have fallen out !
neutral	just requiring a quick squirt of cleaning fluid ?
neutral	i also found that whoever dealt_with me was rather condescending - correcting me and treating me as if i knew absolutely nothing about cars .
neutral	i think that this half price offer draws you in and then they find all the faults they can - in fact i got a scare story about the radiator having lost all its fluid too !
neutral	when i asked further , i found out that it was " showing signs of a leak "- which i have not seen at all - even today .
neutral	but they are still probably ok value - i guess you pay for what you get .
neutral	you get what you pay for .
neutral	this company offers a very good selection of products at good prices .
neutral	i waited three_weeks for delivery but hope thats just a one off .
neutral	if you are running low order well in advance taking into account you might not receive in time .
neutral	would like to see a better service where you are advised without asking that your order has_been delayed_due to stock .
neutral	would use again though .
neutral	low brow sales .
neutral	talkative woman , the type to overtalk you .
neutral	i expressed a need to know more about the quote for a 0 camera system .. she took it as an indication i couldnt afford the system .
neutral	when i asked what the system recording make and model was she couldnt justify why she had quoted me that particular unit at all .. " its because its a good one " came the reply ...
neutral	so i asked , do you sell others ?
neutral	she replied yes , so i asked why offer me this unit ?
neutral	all i got was sales bluster and zero technical_knowledge .
neutral	the warranty they offered on parts was 0 year , yet the manufacturers_warranty on new product was 0 , upon querying she didnt know why that was .... selling refurbished product perhaps i suggested ... hmmm
neutral	poor service all_round .
neutral	sales simply not competent enough to listen and deliver the correct information .
neutral	it would be unfair of me to write anything as the deal didn_'_t go_ahead due to the high cost of postage to the channel_islands .
neutral	nobodies fault
neutral	fast delivery nice wheels and a good price but the £_00 . 00 pounds per_tyre service to have them fitted at a designated tyre centre is a massive rip_off i went independant and was charged £ 0 . 00
neutral	recently travelled economy to dubrovnik in croatia and whilst the flights were bang on time both_ways , the stewards and the food were not .
neutral	early flights meant miserable cabin staff , the return in the afternoon was like being with a different airline .
neutral	mediocre meal going out and just a sandwich on the return .
neutral	glad i ' m going with croatia airlines next time as their flights are consistently good .
neutral	sorry ba despite your recent pr exercise on sky in truth it '_s still not what you expect from britain '_s premier airline .
neutral	racking seems ok but :-
neutral	first lot of shelves - some the wrong depth and all damaged by courier .
neutral	second lot of shelves - not damaged but still some wrong_size .
neutral	had to get my carpenter to cut down .
neutral	cheaper_than getting him to come back yet another day .
neutral	big_dug gave us a small credit towards this inconvenience .
neutral	ordered items on line over bank_holiday weekend , 00 . 00 tuesday_morning i received a call to tell me the items were not available .
neutral	this gave me time to find alternative .
neutral	would use them again when i need anything_else .
neutral	they did go downhill for a long time , now on their way back up , but still expensive
neutral	every time i go to tesco their prices go up , what happened to this new scheme on prices they are advertising , or is that just in larger stores ?
neutral	?
neutral	everybody uses social_media now , its becoming boring , especially when you don_'_t know half the people that connect with you !
neutral	!
neutral	be careful , be very careful .
neutral	it has it uses but it has its down sides also
neutral	be warned that your account can become limited by paypal at their discretion then when they want more info to lift the limitation it can get very irritable when they keep wanting more and more although you provide what they want
neutral	be warned , paypal is never as easy as they say it is !
neutral	!.
neutral	received a text and e_- mail at 00 . 00 saying it would be delivered between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
neutral	so the parcel arrived at about 00 . 00 !
neutral	driver knew nothing about the timings .
neutral	can '_t see why they give a time_slot if it '_s purely fictional .
neutral	just annoys the customer !
neutral	ordered online on the 00th_december for delivery to a collect_plus location the next_day .
neutral	received email with tracking_number stating goods had been despatched .
neutral	tracked parcel the next_day ( 00th_dec ) which was the delivery due day and delivery site just said goods in transit !
neutral	tracked parcel the day after ( 00th_dec ) to find that the goods had been refused by addressee and returned to sender !!
neutral	checked with my collect_plus store to find out why goods had been refused to find out that no deliveries had been attempted in my name !
neutral	i have a lot of parcels go to this collect_plus store and the owner said he would not have refused a parcel in my name as he knows me !
neutral	emailed superdry customer service to let them know ( 00th_dec ) and request a replacement immediately as this was required for an xmas_present , and to date i have received no goods and had no reply !!
neutral	i am not impressed !
neutral	update - after posting this review my issue was quickly resolved - so thanks to the team for jumping on this .
neutral	perhaps the lessons learned will improve the service .
neutral	despite_being in all day , and my partner being in and out ( in her car ) all day , i was sup prised to read on the tracking website that the yodel driver ' could not gain_access ' - were they in a jumbo jet ?
neutral	to make_matters worse - there is absolutely no phone number to call in order to speak to anyone - and the depot ( once i googled their number ) have obviously lost the ability to pick_up the phone .
neutral	worst customer service ever .
neutral	sorry to say i work for a major manufacturer servicing millions of customers per year - we use yodel - won_'_t be for long .
neutral	i would to hate to think one of our client getting this treatment .
neutral	flights with easyjet are exactly as advertised .
neutral	they will get you where you want to go , no_frills unless you want to pay extra .
neutral	ideal for budget - conscious travellers , but don_'_t use them if you are one of life '_s moaners and complainers .
neutral	i found the services i paid for were perfectly adequate for my needs , the staff helpful and polite .
neutral	was pleased with the fact that i managed to get a delivery by the day .
neutral	flowers were ok not outstanding .
neutral	paid extra 0 . 00 for a cake .
neutral	absolutely mortified when my mother in law sent me a pic of it !
neutral	no bigger than a coaster !
neutral	wont be ordering fro here again !
neutral	complete rip_off !
neutral	please read all reviews before ordering and make your_own mind up !
neutral	write_why you did not find the experience particularly good .
neutral	for instance_:
neutral	i finally received my item but after a lot of correspondence back and forth .
neutral	the company obviously did not have the item in stock and would return the money to me .
neutral	the item is ok .
neutral	as above when i have used the site i will look_forward to seeing the changes if there is any
neutral	we all make_mistakes and i made a mistake by sending an unedited print to pixum for printing .
neutral	the two photos i had on my desktop were similar and it was my fault that i clicked on the unedited one for sending .
neutral	i noticed it immediately after i sent it and quickly emailed them to tell them of my mistake .
neutral	i got an_email back the next_day to say once you send the order it cannot be cancelled .
neutral	i would imagine local trading_standards would have something to say about that .
neutral	fortunately , it was only 00 pence but it could have been a more_expensive canvas etc .
neutral	therefore beware , make 000_% sure you send the correct images or you will still be charged .
neutral	apart_from that the quality of the product is very good
neutral	emailed and checked that the replacement cd_player i was ordering was a straight swap / fix .
neutral	assured it was so purchased .
neutral	first prob .
neutral	came when car audio insisted it was dispatched but heg parcel co . insisted it was not .
neutral	car audi ignored emails , unavailable on phone .
neutral	eventually got through by phone , told not despatched as awaiting final parts - why then email me saying it was with a tracking no ?
neutral	finally arrived , problem it is compatible but in order to use it needs a ( large dia ) cable running from boot to console as uses non vehicle std din connections cannot not use existing cable .
neutral	to be fair spoke to car audio fitters ( none local ) who very helpful , said its not that difficult , again a but , am still trying to get sensible quote from local fitters for doing it , they all say it is a big job .
neutral	great price given for an old bada os samsung wave , however it took 0 - days to acknowledge receipt of the phone by c0p and another 0 - days for payment by them into my bank_account .
neutral	far better enjoyable_experience in my opinion .
neutral	although i can accept budget_airlines have to strip cost out of their operations to make profit , at_least easyjet show some civility and expertise in their dealings .
neutral	i would much rather travel easyjet than ryanair anyday , but unfortunately their ' cheap as chips ' competitor seems to have the edge on providing the flying public with more destinations to the sun !
neutral	at_least easyjet make me feel like a human_being rather_than an animal being hearded in a cattle pen !
neutral	came quickly but box badly_damaged .
neutral	luckily items were ok .
neutral	the ship , and the crossing itself , were trouble_free ....
neutral	my ' gripe ' is that when we started the booking , the ' fee ' was £_00 approximately ... partway through the booking , the fee escalated , with no
neutral	reason being given , to £_00 approximately .. if i hadn_'_t been in such a need to book this quickly , i would probably have looked elsewhere ... the
neutral	fee should have remained the same as at the start of the procedure ..
neutral	i ' d ' like ' a refund , and may well pursue this with ' aferry ', unless of
neutral	course ' you ', ( as in ' this ' survey ) can forward my thoughts to them , and ' they ' will contact me .. ?
neutral	mike crook .... 0000 000 0000 or 00000_000000 ... any day , anytime after 00 . 00 am please ......
neutral	one of my parcels arrived with no bubble_wrap , the boxes of stronghold / frontline were crushed inside , the second order can fully wrapped but after a telephone_conversation with them they said i could have more advantix / stronghold [ which i was told was left on my perscription ],, then viovet telephoned to say ther was a mistake and i couldnt have anymore perscription order , i had a lengthy conversation with them , viovet need to shake themselves up or they might loose customers .
neutral	whilst i have received payment via bank_account for transactions without_any fuss , i was very surprised that you are more than twice as long in acknowledging , processing and paying out than webuydvds .
neutral	it was a really lengthy process and i whilst i would recommend you to people who could_afford to wait longer , as you pay slightly_higher amounts overall ( not always ), if they want their money quicker and are prepared to forgo a few_quid , i would recommend they use webuydvd who '_s two cheques were with me before you had even finished processing my first order and they were collected only 0 day before yours .. so 0_stars from me .
neutral	room for improvement in your processing times .
neutral	the receptionist where my sister works received a box and emailed my sister to say she had a parcel .
neutral	when i didn_'_t hear that my sister had received the flowers , i phoned the receptionist and she said she was not aware the box contained flowers .
neutral	so my sister hadn_'_t realised it was urgent to collect the box and give the flowers a drink . the box obviously needs to make it obvious there are flowers inside !
neutral	i saw the flowers and they were lovely .
neutral	very pushy with insurance_cover sales staff need to know no means no .
neutral	good selection of items
neutral	i created a problem - lost log in details and change of email address .
neutral	eventually found email address to contact you .
neutral	first time completed your questionaaire - was returned not enough information askd to complete it again .
neutral	cut and paste previous one accepted .
neutral	i appreciate electronic communication gets rid of the pesky customer but sometimes a conversation is needed .
neutral	why do you need my email address below .
neutral	you sent me the bloody email in the first place .
neutral	all nearly went swimmingly , the site is easy to use and i was very happy with the final_result .
neutral	two things spoiled it : firstly , having chosen an agent where a " printer not necessary ", since i was asking for a parcel to be delivered to me , i was asked to print a label and stick it on the parcel !
neutral	( i ask you ): and , secondly , the parcel arrived a day earlier_than stated .
neutral	( a good job my wife was at home , though only by chance ).
neutral	all ok except 0 + weeks delivery .
neutral	this is far too long .
neutral	perhaps will try again ' cos jumper great for price !
neutral	i have bought 0 beer kits , very pleased with the price , but order took a little longer_than_expected , i didn_'_t get an e . mail to tell me the order had been dispatched , and when it arrived ... even_though it was well_packaged , sadly one of the cans was dented , i will try again though !
neutral	the product itself is a christmas gift for my daughter , i was surprised that there are not extensions to the return period in view of this .
neutral	still only have 00 days to return , so i hope she likes it more than i do .
neutral	my name is not caroline henry and i am confused how you can send to the correct email address but use an incorrect name .
neutral	fast efficient service but unfortunately wrong shirt sent it didn_'_t even match the shirt on the delivery note .
neutral	await delivery of the correct one .
neutral	struggled to get the aeg fridge_freezer that we were after , and kitchen_appliances 000 were helpful when taking the order where others weren_'_t .
neutral	it was a good price , although not the cheapest we found on the web , but we thought it looked a professional outfit , and assumed that aeg would vet suppliers .
neutral	there was a bit of a delay as it was coming from germany , although communication was always as a result of us prompting for updates .
neutral	about three_weeks after paying the fridge_freezer , which actually requires some on site construction , was delivered and assembled by a separate courier company who could not have cared_less ( amazing for such an expensive product ).
neutral	clearly used to just dumping items and clearing off .
neutral	screws went in threaded ( in a couple of instances so they actually scratched the doors on opening and closing ), units not lined up , doors not lined up , one foot bent in the process , and the top panel scratched due to repeated sloppy attempts to fit .
neutral	having compiled a pdf of fitting disasters and sending onto kitchen_appliances 000 we are still_waiting for a response .
neutral	we have given up on the courier company .
neutral	have taken it apart and refitted ourselves so that we can turn on and get using the thing that we paid for fives weeks_ago .
neutral	all in all a mixed experience .
neutral	i ordered a yamaha keyboard for my daughters_birthday .
neutral	i gave plenty of time i was getting worried as the order hadn_'_t arrived , i emailed them they told me they would have the item on the 0st of may .
neutral	then i emailed again as my daughters_birthday was the 00th_may .
neutral	then then told me a 0 - 0 week wait i had no choice but to upgrade and pay the extra .
neutral	the delivery was then very fast , and the keyboard is excellent .
neutral	when i did a bad review on trustpilot it did get a reaction from mighty_deals but only for them to lie to me or totally ignore me .
neutral	it would be nice if i could get a positive response .
neutral	having_read the reviews went_ahead and ordered a canvas_print on 00th_august_0000 and paid extra for next_day delivery .
neutral	didn_'_t receive an_email next_day so emailed them enquiring as to when my order would be dispatched as i needed it for a client .
neutral	no response so phoned .
neutral	spoke to a chap_who said i would receive it today , 00th .
neutral	now 0 . 00 , no delivery , phoned number on website 0 times , no reply .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	went_onto facebook and no updates this year , which raises further concerns .
neutral	wondering_if i will see my canvas at all now .
neutral	p . s .
neutral	didn_'_t arrive , now have to go to client without the canvas i ' d hoped to give them .
neutral	let_down badly by canvasprints online , i '_ll be looking for my money back .
neutral	pps arrived on 00th , well - packaged and good quality , so i will amend my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
neutral	the lack of any customer service , delay in canvas arriving despite paying the extra for next_day delivery has taken the edge of my first experience with this company .
neutral	next_day delivery as requested and paid for of tub chair and bar_stools did not happen .
neutral	i was left to speak with the courier company only to find that my contact telephone_number had not been passed on .
neutral	dpd the couriers tried to deliver to the wrong street address and would not attempt delivery on day despite their mistake .
neutral	managed to secure next_day sat delivery and once had contact details were able to communicate effectively with expected delivery times .
neutral	order received was incorrect .
neutral	unable to contact lakeland on sat morning .
neutral	sent email on saturday and got no reply until tuesday pm only to be told that fri would be next available delivery day .
neutral	after some to and froing and significant delays in mail responses this was accepted but far from the original next_day delivery expected !
neutral	dpd turned_up at the wrong street again but at_least on this occasion could contact me so could rectify mistake .
neutral	products good quality but service let_down by not taking ownership of the mistakes made .
neutral	good or great service can only be measured on company ability to deal with things that go_wrong .
neutral	average service on this basis
neutral	hope they are still trading can access the site today !
neutral	use an amazon local voucher tyo buy flowers , but on the checkout page you have to enter payment details even for a zero balance !
neutral	if you use a paypal_account to do so , the system crashes . doesn_'_t inspire confidence .....
neutral	i found the cover set i wanted but the postage was nearly as much as the item .
neutral	they do say you pay the same postage for whatever you order but i find this a bit of a cop out as most people i suspect do not want anything other than the item they are looking for .
neutral	if i had been able to find this anywhere_else i would probably have bought it elsewhere .
neutral	it was small enough and light enough that properly packaged it could have gone large letter at about half the price .
neutral	the service was fine and the product arrived within a few_days so i have no complaint there .
neutral	the item was exactly as i expected .
neutral	the prices were better_than any others that i could find quickly , and they delivered in 00_hours .
neutral	however they did not require a signature and left the goods visible in my front porc even_though i was in the house !
neutral	good service backed_up with a one to one telephone contact .
neutral	i was surprised that having a uk company address the camera came from the states , but it did arrive quite quickly and in good order .
neutral	however , the second battery purchased with the camera was an after - market copy ( not nikon ) and in - spite of its price ( not cheap ) didn_'_t work .
neutral	also , there are cheaper sd_cards available in the uk on the internet .
neutral	so overall the shine was taken off the new toy by a poor product but i can '_t complain_about the service .
neutral	talk_talk get a lot of flak but other than changing my contract without telling_me i have found their service ok
neutral	i would say the service is excellent , in speed & applying the credit .
neutral	although the networks can be far from acceptable , i have had many wasted calls whereby repeat calls have been necessary to achieve a decent conversation .
neutral	( i . e loss of speech / crossed lines , interference etc : at times the calls just cut of randomly .
neutral	on other occasions i have connected to the same number i always ring 0000000 ** 00 ** 0 , & an auto attendant then some prostitute chat line on many occasions telling_me what bikini she had on , & what she was prepared to do to me ..!!?!
neutral	numerous attempts later & lost credit & finally reaching my dialled destination .
neutral	i intend to try elsewhere .
neutral	good idea and easy to use website .
neutral	just it seems very slow to be able to collect your money and also there seems to be a lot of problems with merchants not giving you your money ... staff seem very friendly and helpful ... i probably will not bother any more after i get my money this time .
neutral	i ordered a watch from iconic_watches as advertised on their website i paid my deposit and received an_email_stating 00 - 00 days for delivery i anxiously waited 00 days then got in touch with iconic_watches to find out what was going on .
neutral	i received a reply that they were going to get in touch with their suppliers and would be in touch .
neutral	i then received a further email_stating that the watch is no_longer available .
neutral	in iconic_watches favour a refund of my deposit was promptly paid but why o why do they advertise watches they do not have and cannot obtain and still take a deposit .
neutral	i could of at the time of placing my deposit with iconic_watches obtained the exact_same watch from an other company guaranteed in stock albeit at a cost of £_00 more but in hindsight £_00 on a watch costing over £ 0000 would have been worth it .
neutral	my experience with iconic_watches has therefore been a negative one and i would have second and third and forth thoughts before i place another order with them in other words never again .
neutral	i have used holiday_autos for many_years and have always been very satisfied .
neutral	but this year one of their rental providers ripped me off with this new fuel_policy that some are using .
neutral	instead of returning the fuel_tank full they now want it returned empty and then to charge you way over the odds for a full_tank .
neutral	they said they were going to charge my credit_card 00euros but the bill came through a few_weeks_later as 00euros .
neutral	the tank size was only 00 litres !
neutral	so they basically charged me double .
neutral	if that ’_s not a scam then i don_’ t know what is !
neutral	returning a car with no fuel is a horrible experience .
neutral	i got lost driving around lisbon and the fuel gauge went to zero .
neutral	it was a very stressful last day of my holiday and left me feeling very bitter about the car_hire experience .
neutral	unless holiday_autos start indicating which cars are from a fuel scam provider before i book , then i won ’ t be using them again .
neutral	service very good and prompt , however after purchasing over £_000 of balloons / goods and whilst awaiting the helium ( one week before the party ) only to be phoned to say that there is a shortage of helium and consequently my order could not be fulfilled .
neutral	the first enquiry to a googled helium supplier and my request for helium from a competitor was met , they had not heard of said shortage !
neutral	very happy that i was let_down in time so that i could purchase the gas from elsewhere .
neutral	apart_from the helium incident very good service , nice website and helpful staff .
neutral	play are competitive but are slow on the sending out of goods , never expect a product if preordered to arrive on release day !
neutral	this is play '_s fault .
neutral	free delivery fine , game etc do the same butt game send out 0 days beforew at 0st_class , whereas play send out 0 days before and we still dont get it for 0 - 0 weeks !
neutral	be prepared to wait for goods off play , at_least 0 - 0 weeks .
neutral	it would be easier to deal with 000vet if they accepted scanned copies of prescriptions by e_- mail , which some other_suppliers are doing now .
neutral	instead you have to post the prescription to them and wait for as long as it takes for the prescription to arrive before they send out the medication .
neutral	as i proceeded the system logged me out , when i got back in everything was still there except free delivery had been changed to £_00 . 00 next_day delivery , extra .
neutral	took a long time to get the system to change this back to 0 - day free delivery .
neutral	almost gave up ....
neutral	sadly , the last time i used herbert woods , the handover of the boat was sadly lacking and we were late setting off .
neutral	my party had arrived early and did not necessarily expect to take the boat early , but it was already moored and available for any maintenance .
neutral	we completed the necessary paperwork and went off for lunch and a pint .
neutral	on our return there was limited work being carried_out on the vessel , but that dragged on way past the appointed handover time , and with no direct communication from anyone about what the problem was .
neutral	this was late october and it was nearly dark before we got away , severely restricting our activities that day .
neutral	otherwise , things went pretty_much smoothly and we enjoyed our late break on the broads .
neutral	however , with the increasing prices , i really do expect the vessel to be ready on time .
neutral	i ordered a couple of bottles of torres 00 , my favourite brandy , and the experience was satisfactory , more or less as i would have expected .
neutral	nothing outstanding , either good or bad really .
neutral	the package was delivered by parcelforce and they allegedly have a tracking_system , which rarely told me anything more than ' in progress ', but it was delivered in around the timescale i would expect
neutral	delivery was quick but asked for delivery to a different address as per order form .
neutral	however failed to follow the instructions and the item ended_up being sent to billing_address .
neutral	i wanted to point out as a matter of feedback that a karcher window cleaner should not be sold the way you sell it .
neutral	i bought the cleaner from you and paid for delivery . having_read the instructions i saw that you had to buy cleaning fluid to use the machine and it could not be used with any other products . your website should be designed offering the detergent as an optional extra and it was ridiculous having paid for delivery that i then had to go to the store to buy the cleaning fluid . the operator kept on repeating the same information as_opposed to taking it on board and advising your buyers and website .
neutral	it is unfair that late charge fees are put on to the account even if you are 0 day late .
neutral	it is just an extra way of making money .
neutral	i usually visit subway outlets whenever i go to london .
neutral	i like subway sandwiches but they are overpriced .
neutral	i still prefer visiting subway for their quality of food and good service .
neutral	my only complaint with lovefilm is that they say " unlimited ", but it is actually limited by their poor turnaround time .
neutral	i am waiting at_least 0 days inbetween sending back a dvd and getting the next one delivered , but its more like a week .
neutral	we were sold a sofa and talked into fabric care ( which they gave my friend free !!!!)
neutral	and insurance that we didn_'_t want - tried to cancel no luck .
neutral	told them in store we needed a 0 hour_slot for delivery in order to book time off - told certainly however no chance you have to wait in all day - in my opinion we were thoroughly misled - would i recommend - no not unless you have your wits about you
neutral	i only wanted 000_litres of oil but the tanker only had 000 liters and this was 00 . 00 so why didn_'_t the tanker have enough oil at that time of the morning .
neutral	to make it worse i have been charged for the amount i ordered .
neutral	i think boiler_juice you need to get your act_together ..... refund please in the email you promised but that did not arrive .
neutral	having said that , this time the price was good and so was the delivery time .
neutral	the national_tyres site is easy to use and appears to offer a greater selection of tyres than other national chains .
neutral	i was actually happy with the price quoted for 0 dunlop_tyres only to be left with a sour_taste after clicking the accept customer survey button after making my purchase .
neutral	i was offered a £_00 off thank_you voucher off my next purchase !!!
neutral	as if i am going to buy more tyres or an exhaust in the near_future .
neutral	why can '_t they take it off the price i have already paid for my tyres ?
neutral	in my opinion it is a very empty thank_you and left me feeling out of pocket .
neutral	best not offer anything at all !
neutral	apart_from the following remarks the service was fine .
neutral	like many living in scotland i suffer from an iv postcode which means a postage surcharge when a courier is used even_though i don_'_t live in the highlands !
neutral	the distance to my address from yorkshire is about the same as the distance to cornwall yet that doesn_'_t incur this charge .
neutral	the post_office don_'_t charge extra so why not use them for the odd parcel to scotland and satisfy more customers .
neutral	very quickly delivered .
neutral	not all the photos i ' d uploaded were printed on the card , there were a number of duplicates also .
neutral	slightly disappointed with this , although appearance and quality of the card is very good .
neutral	been a customer of g0m for many_years during which time i have purchased guitars , leads , mixers , keyboards and many other music related items , the service use to be a good one - hence my remaining a loyal_customer , as of late i have found the service to be slipping .
neutral	october_0000 , i contacted them about a guitar i was interested in and brought to their attention that it was £_00 more_expensive on their site than other music stores on the web , on the plus side they reduced the price to bring it inline with the other stores i had seen it advertised on , i ordered the guitar ....... on opening the packagaing found the inner foam protective bag ripped and holed , on taking the guitar out found the protective_film on the pickups missing , body and headstock dirty and covered in fingermarks and dust , no protective_film on the scratchplate , and chips out of the paintwork .
neutral	having contacted them , they offered a further discount and apologised for the state in which it was sent out .
neutral	november 00th 0000 : placed an order for a number of items all of which were in stock , on taking delivery and checking the packaging found that they had sent a wrong item , so contacted them .... was told they would post a replacement out the same day ( this was on a thursday ) having not recieved the item in question on monday 00th contacted them again , said there had been a delay of 0 day and i should recieve it by wednesday 00st nov by 0nd class post - how many websites offering goods for sale use 0nd class postage ?????
neutral	?
neutral	00th_november finally recieved an_email from g0m stating i would recieve the item wednesday ............... wouldn_'_t mind so much but at the time of ordering they had 000 of the item i wanted in stock - its taken 0 days to post out something that should have been with me in one .
neutral	this is not the first time i have been sent wrong items , recieved goods in a second rate manner ( dirty and marked ), have suggested on each_occasion for them to have a word with the warehouse staff who do the picking .
neutral	item bought : korg microkorg synth
neutral	okay , first the good part of the review .
neutral	the price of the synth was very good , in fact the cheapest i could find at the time .
neutral	the ordering service online was easy and email information and confirmation of the order were prompt and useful for tracking my order .
neutral	my synth arrived when expected and was packed very well .
neutral	right , now onto the not so good part of the review !
neutral	on opening the parcel it was apparent that the synth had been in and out of the box because the box was not sealed and there were signs of light usage on the unit ....... may have been an ex - display_unit ?
neutral	although the synth functions perfectly i am not entirely happy as clearly i would have preferred a ' brand_new ' boxed item as this is what i have paid for !
neutral	i realise that i could return the unit but i am not taking up that option as the synth itself is not faulty or badly marked in any way ( ish !
neutral	).
neutral	i can only therefore give nevada 0 out of 0_stars and unfortunately i would urge caution and maybe a phone_call to them before making a purchase just to make_sure the item you are buying is not ex - display or demo .
neutral	update_: since submitting my review nevada have contacted me offering an_apology for this issue and as a customer i believe that shows an indication of their intent to remain focused on providing a quality retail service .
neutral	my review is however still valid but i feel it only fair to note nevadas response in order to highlight that they are prompt to offer assistance if a customer requires it .
neutral	i ordered a rose medley for my wife for our anniversary as she_loves roses , the first problem_arose when i received an_email_stating that the order had been delivered a day early as i had been at work all day i searched high and low for the flowers including asking my neighbours if they had taken them for me but all to no_avail so i rang iflorist ans was informed that the florist had hit the wrong button and sent the email by_accident , fair_enough . the flowers duly_arrived on saturday but though nice bore no resemblance whatsoever to the order made and only comprised of 0 roses and a lot of other stuff . i tried to contact iflorist using their appalling online_chat thing but all i got from ms menla was a standard generic load of waffle that took 00_minutes to deliver . so an not very satisfactory episode which is a shame because i have had excellent service in the past .
neutral	was very impressed with the speed of delivery and the response when i informed you the dehumidifier was not working .
neutral	it now works , but one of the reasons i bought it was for the ability of continuous use but we did not get the hose connection , was this included in the price or do we need to buy separately ?
neutral	unfortunately the descriptions are getting worse , loads of pretty words but trying to find the key information is useless .
neutral	an example , looking for an insulated screwdriver .
neutral	so the key points are : screwdriver , insulated , bit type & length .
neutral	then display the options , i ’ m not worried_about the make , laser tipped etc .
neutral	the first two options are fine but try finding a specific tip type is not something axminster think you need to worry_about ??????
neutral	obviously written by someone in an office who just thinks the colour is the most_important feature .
neutral	had to go_elsewhere .
neutral	i booked a speedy shuttle transfer from palma_airport to our apartment in puerta pollensa .
neutral	this was roughly three_times the cost of the shared shuttle on the basis that we would be dropped_off quicker after what was a long day with a 00 year_old child in tow .
neutral	in fact we waited in sweltering heat for about an_hour before we set off and received exactly the same service as if i had booked the shared shuttle .
neutral	resort_hopper is a decent enough company but you ' re wasting your money if you go for anything other than the basic serice .
neutral	i have bought a few appliances from applianceonline - but will not be doing so in future .
neutral	i am sick to death of the continual phone_calls before , during and after purchase ( which are alleged to be from them ) hassling me to buy additional warranties / insurance policies - although they will stress they are not insurance policies ..... but it will cost me extra money each month so work it out for yourself ......
neutral	despite me telling them i am not interested in taking out additional cover etc and never will be ( my father is a senior trading_standards officer so knows these things are an outrageous con ) they continue to harass me .
neutral	so buy from this company at your_own risk - once they have your details you will never be free from them .
neutral	review edited 00 jan ....
neutral	since submitting this review , appliancesonline have contacted me to resolve my complaint .
neutral	they have apologised for the phone_calls and acknowledge that i should not have continued to receive them after saying i wasn_'_t interested in their additional products .
neutral	my number has now been removed from their system and they promise i won_'_t get any more ... however , they say that customers details are used after purchase of an appliance in order to offer them additional marketing products and is part of their standard after - sales procedure .
neutral	i pointed_out that i am not the only reviewer who has submitted a negative_review because of this so suggested that should be made clearer for the customer on the web - site that this will happen , or that a tick box to opt out of marketing calls ( as is the norm on many other web - sites ) could be provided .
neutral	they have promised to look into this further ...
neutral	nevertheless , because 0 ) they are still a good company to do_business with ( i have no_complaints about the purchasing and delivery experience at all ), 0 ) acted swiftly to contact me and 0 ) have apologised , i am upgrading my rating from a 0 to a 0 .
neutral	order stuff from this company and it will arrive incomplete because they have to order from holland .
neutral	i have ordered at_least 0 times because the lighting they sell suits my needs , but god it is a messy business ordering and receiving .
neutral	and the stuff they sell is not cheap , i wish they would polish their act it is very frustrating waiting weeks and weeks for stuff to arrive when you hope it is going to arrive sooner_than later ....
neutral	have used stressfreeparking several_times in the past and have always been very pleased with the service i received .
neutral	this time when i got my car home and unloaded my luggage i went to put the folded - down seats back up and was a bit upset to find that someone had decided to put the seatbelts into the locks and this caused huge ridges in my seats .
neutral	why would this need to be done ?
neutral	was my car used ?
neutral	i made an_appointment to have my windscreen repaired the same day .
neutral	later that morning i received a missed call alert from my mobile_phone and listened to a message to call back .
neutral	i did this and was told that i needed to confirm my appointment for that day .
neutral	i did so and waited in for the technician who was scheduled to arrive at some time before 0 : 00 pm .
neutral	when he hadn_'_t arrived by 0 : 00 pm i called back to customer_services and after a short wait was told that the appointment would have to be arranged for another day because " the technician had called and could not get a response " and the customer support person stated " i called you at 0 : 00 and you did not answer ".
neutral	since i was at home , with my wife , the whole time i cannot see how somebody knocking at my door or ringing the bell would not get a response , especially as the room i was in faces my driveway .
neutral	i can only assume the technician went to the wrong_address .
neutral	as for the telephone_call , my mobile shows missed calls as well as providing the opportunity to leave a voice message .
neutral	my mobile was on the table beside me the whole time and no missed calls were recorded for the whole of that afternoon .
neutral	i can only assume that this claimed call did not take place .
neutral	notwithstanding this and my wasted day , i waited in again 0 days_later for a technician .
neutral	he arrived within the appointment period and carried_out a thorough repair and was professional and friendly throughout .
neutral	i was really pleased with the result .
neutral	the reason i am upset with the missed appointment is because my wife and i had decided to go to our caravan for the remainder of the week and wanted to get the windscreen repaired before we traveled .
neutral	the rescheduled repair meant that we couldn_'_t do that and so we missed out .
neutral	if a mistake was made it is much_better to admit that with an_apology rather_than try to blame the customer .
neutral	i ordered a sink and tap for a new_kitchen .
neutral	tap arrived but not the sink and it wasn_'_t till i chased that i found out a fault had been noted and they were getting a replacement .
neutral	quality issue would appear to be with manufacturer so no fault with taps uk .
neutral	e_- bay messages were responded to reasonably quickly and issue was resolved .
neutral	refund for returned sink took a while to appear .
neutral	unfortunately late but that was prob down to my local postie not knowing when valentines_day was
neutral	felt like_cattle in cattle class .
neutral	would prefer to pay more for a bit more luxury so won_'_t hurry back
neutral	all good just slightly worrying that the web - site booking gives no details at all of the room except that it is a double .
neutral	also , i know breakfast is served at the hotel but breakfast was not an option with trustpilot .
neutral	good initial price but then a booking_fee added .
neutral	if something is non - optional then please include it in the headline cost , cos you have to pay it .
neutral	easy website to use and order arrived promptly but oh boy !
neutral	what a difference_between the pictures on the website and the packet !
neutral	don_'_t think i '_ll be buying again .
neutral	not very happy with the service .
neutral	tried to cancel greeting card the day after l put my order in , but was not allowed .
neutral	i cannot_believe they used a courier to deliver the flowers , if l had known that l would have used interflora .
neutral	i was searching for accomodation for 0 - 0 feb , after finding what i thought was a good deal i booked .
neutral	after confirming my payment i realised the booking was for the next_day 0 / 0 even_though i had never changed any of my search dates .
neutral	as this was at 00 . 00pm i tried the manage my booking bit on the website but the booking wasn_'_t on there ( and still isn_'_t 00_hours_later ), i tried_phoning the customer_services number which was closed but did give an_emergency contact number which was also closed .
neutral	i then emailed them which i was told hadn_'_t been received and was then told that the email address i sent it to wasn_'_t monitored ( this was the email from the confirmation )
neutral	i finally got through at 0am the next_day , even_though the website says they are open from 0am to be told i would still have to pay as they will be charged by their suppliers but they didn_'_t seem interested in contacting their suppliers to look into this .
neutral	i was also told that bookings can take up to 00_hours to come up on the manage my bookings bit .
neutral	as they use hotelbeds as their supplier you may as well go direct to them .
neutral	we got a message from the customer_services team a couple of days_later to say that they were going to give me a full_refund and that has_been done so i have changed my rating from 0 to 0_stars
neutral	i still think they need to look at their 0st line customer_services as the standard answer is " it is in the terms and conditions " if they took the time to look into something i would have been happier even if it hadn_'_t have gone my way .
neutral	well , i know it is nearly christmas but i placed an order on 00th_dec . it was not dispatched until 00rd .
neutral	dec . and obviously i do not have it yet .
neutral	i will not receive this until well after the new year i guess ---- less expensive but too long in delivery -- this is a supplement i need to take regularly for a health issue .
neutral	interestingly the payment was taken immediately from my card --- not good enough i think !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a towel_radiator and straight ( inline ) thermostatic valve set .
neutral	delivery was quick - by 00 . 00am next_day so full_marks there .
neutral	sadly the rad had suffered damage in transit , being dented and scratched on the bottom rail and the packaging & tape was hardly pristine , suggesting it had done the rounds well and truly before reaching me ..... and the valve set sent was the angled variety .
neutral	didn_'_t bode well for a good experience on my first order from this company .
neutral	i reported this via their online foms , where it is possible to attach an image to show any damage .
neutral	doing that is not very intuitive and my image didn_'_t get attached to the form , resulting in a request to send it before they could deal with my query .
neutral	that delayed things by 00_hours but the end_result was replacements for both parts being immediately despatched for next_day delivery and pickup of the damaged / wrong parts by the same courier .
neutral	turned_out all right in the end and dealt_with politely and efficiently .
neutral	things can and do happen in transit but there '_s really no excuse for sending a wrong part in the first_instance .
neutral	if your reading this chances are your thinking of getting this company to do some home improvements of which , they offer many .
neutral	a note of caution then .
neutral	first lets get something very clear i have had 0 triple glazed windows fitted that were fitted to perfection and the units themselves i cant recommend highly_enough .
neutral	excellent quality .
neutral	so whats up then ?
neutral	i hope advanced read this and take heed because they could be a 0 star company and in there line of work that '_s rare and recommends are even rarer .
neutral	problems are lack of information no calls returned and worse misinformation .
neutral	problems started when in my order i picked a composite door was given a price and guide date of 0 weeks this became 00 and many phone_calls later and a threat to cancel the order the door was indeed ready .
neutral	the truth apparently advanced seen fit ti quote me on the thinking they could make it cheaper themselves by buying the machine that makes a composite door well the machine flopped and no one decided its prudent to me any of this , and into the bargain because of there failure to make it it would now cost £_000 extra to outsource i was offered a cancellation but no movement on price very unfair after some thinking and now 00 weeks_later i decided yes ill pony up the extra , was promised the door within a week still nothing after me chasing them and another cancel threat the door arrived and was duly fitted , is this customer service , !!
neutral	no its not its appalling its only 0_stars purly because of flawless fitting by mcdonald windows sub contractors from linwood totally professorial fitting , as for advanced its 0 star sort your customer service out
neutral	iv been using play for some time and watched it grow and grow it used to be excellent but now its just mediocre really delivery issues aplenty and call centers that are difficult to get through to , an ever expanding range of goods to choose from , one word of caution if you buy an item and it gets lost in our great postal system you have to wait two full weeks before you can report it to play as lost .
neutral	then you could in theory go through it all again .
neutral	although to be fair a free replacment is usually sent if this happens rightly so !

neutral	the tyres were delivered a day late causing a great deal of frustration .
neutral	when speaking to customer service it was obvious that they did not have a means of tracking order .
neutral	continually suggested that they would be delivered on the 0nd dec .
neutral	i was in the garage when the tyres were delivered .
neutral	all credit to the tyre_fitters as they had had a horrendous morning , where one had been involved in an rta .
neutral	i question whether i will use tyre_shopper again
neutral	phone_call 00 . 00 to advise delivery 0 - 0 , and duly_arrived 0 . 00 .
neutral	packed quite well but ripped where slight bulge in cardboard where bag of components were - no damage though .
neutral	took a screwdriver set and adjustable spanner only to find not sufficient , neccessitating a long round_trip to obtain spanner .
neutral	something in the paperwork to say whats required before opening the box , or a cheap spanner in the bag .
neutral	ok if you assemble every day you will be ok , but the instructions were poor but i did like the numbered bags to determine the correct fxings .
neutral	the handedness of the curved leg supports was not evident in the instruction .
neutral	however once assembled a good table for the money .

neutral	ordered radiator which was supposedly in stock .
neutral	confirmation of order but no dispatch note .
neutral	contacted after 0 days with great difficulty 0000 number - told not in stock awaiting delivery ( still showed in stock online ).
neutral	eventually got 00000000000 number ( why do amazon customers get an_alternative to the 0000 number ) and spoke to team_leader .
neutral	offered alternative which was delivered next_day .
neutral	you have suggested various_options which will provide a better service .
neutral	your recommendations are all rubbish since we are at the end of a bt copper wire about 0km from the exchange with no alternative optical or other cable .
neutral	it is therefore impossible for another service provider to offer a faster service .
neutral	you are providing misleading and false information
neutral	tesco have an offer on at the moment , buy a 00 pack of coke and get 0p off a litre of fuel , use up to 0 0p off vouchers per fuel transaction .
neutral	the wife and i bought 0 x 00 packs of coke and recieved just 0 voucher so we complained to be told " oh no you only get one voucher for with coke on each transaction !
neutral	so i had them credit me for two packs of coke and then bought them again in 0 transactions .
neutral	each extra transaction attracts a charge upon tesco from the card_issuer so they actually ended_up making less money than they would have done if they didn_'_t have the silly rule in the first place !
neutral	is it any wonder that this country is going down the pan ?
neutral	the price was good and included free delivery but unfortunatly the feliway was simply thrown into a bag in it '_s flimsy outer box .
neutral	by the time it arrived the evaporator had been damaged and the bottles of pheromones had leaked a little .
neutral	i didn_'_t return it because the cat was going frantic and i needed to get it in and working otherwise i would have done .
neutral	shame really as i would like to have dealt_with them again if only for the good price .
neutral	you find that argos i selling nowdays almost everything and they curtomer service is better as the have the rating system about the service you recieved , so they are all smiles ;))
neutral	you do find bargains but some ppl arent so friendly or reliable at all and becouse you dont get to try on the clothes / shoes , its a risk sometimes not worth taking
neutral	i ordered a top - of - the - range washer / dryer from electricshop .
neutral	they imply they offer a price match , but when i phoned since i ' d found it a few_quid cheaper elsewhere , i was told because they offer a longer warranty , they couldn_'_t price match .
neutral	bah .
neutral	but they had it in stock , so i ordered anyway .
neutral	but despite_being in stock , it still took a week to deliver .
neutral	when it arrived , it was in perfect_condition , and the delivery guys where helpful enough and arrived with a text notification before they got there .
neutral	overall not blown_away by the experience , but not that disappointed either .
neutral	would i recommend to a friend ; probably not , but only because i wouldn_'_t necessarily remember the lukewarm service .
neutral	i purchased an evic from joyetech and am very pleased with the actual ecig .
neutral	the control ring design is very poor , it is loose and dosen '_t always do what you wnat it to do .
neutral	it is slow to start when you press the activation button , the lcd is difficult to read and it seems underpowered .
neutral	i spoke to a customer service person and they didnt seem to know what they were talking_about .
neutral	delivery was later than initialty forecast - said 0 days then gave a range covering 0 days .
neutral	did actually take 0 days
neutral	not happy , because , i got less_than i thought for i - phone . it was damaged in transit while being posted . it was immaculate , when it left me . thanx . otherwise , i am happy .
neutral	i have bought lots of furniture from oak_furniture land and i must_say the furniture is lovely .
neutral	sales people great and delivery_men really good .
neutral	that '_s when things are going well .
neutral	so what happens when you receive a fault item ?
neutral	in my case i ordered a pair of tokyo bedside_cabinets , waited 0 weeks for delivery with some other items .
neutral	one cabinet was fine , the other looked like it had been dropped before being packed .
neutral	followed the procedure to raise a case on thursday of last_week and put a landline contact number as i was working from home .
neutral	got an_email on monday to say they had tried to call me on friday ( turns_out they decided to use a different number no_longer in use - why ?).
neutral	i have been working from home all of this week and so if they had tried harder to speak to me we may not have got to this point .
neutral	i work away mon to wed each week and i am now told that they don_'_t have any delivery slots available for thurs / fridays so can '_t tell me when i will get my replacement .
neutral	odd that when if i go online and go through the process of ordering a new cabinet , it offers me next friday as a named day delivery option if i pay £_00 .
neutral	maybe they don_'_t want to give that away to a complaining customer !
neutral	i now have to wait for the delivery guys to phone me to arrange some date in august .
neutral	they can '_t tell me when because apparently their system isn_'_t showing august dates yet !
neutral	it '_s only next week for goodness_sake !
neutral	it would seem to me that ofl work for the delivery guys rather_than the other way round and i just happen to be an annoyance in the middle .
neutral	why is the customer service department not authorised to make special delivery arrangements in cases where a complaint has_been made .
neutral	they need to wake_up and realise that we are the most_important customers to please if they want to prevent the many bad_reviews i have since found on this site .
neutral	the old cabinet is sitting in the way in my hallway and now looks likely to be there for another few_weeks .
neutral	i have today spoken to customer_services and they have confirmed there is nothing more they can do .
neutral	no customer service and i will not buy from them again or recommend .
neutral	update .
neutral	i received a phone_call from customer_relations ( cr ) about an_hour after i had posted my review on trust_pilot .
neutral	after a couple of weeks and a few more issues , i now have two lovely matching bedside_cabinets .
neutral	during this process i have spoken consistently to two case handlers from cr on a number of occasions .
neutral	if one was going to be out of the office , the other was fully_informed on the latest update .
neutral	they have both been very apologetic and i believe sincerely so .
neutral	this is a company that has_gone from being internet only to now having a very large high_street presence ( regrettably something many stores are moving away from ) and at times they are struggling with the extra demand this has put on them .
neutral	yes there are some problems with quality_control ( from the reviews would seem to be certain ranges ) and the end to end supply chain but i believe they are working to improve these .
neutral	since i raised the issue , they have already put some additional measures in place to improve sight of the delivery slots that customer_services can offer ( previously they couldn_'_t see the delivery slots showing as available to customers ordering online ).
neutral	i am also told that they have brought in specialist resource to look at improving the way they do things from a customers perspective .
neutral	in summary , if you get an issue , remain calm and polite , work with them and give these_guys a chance ( or two ) and some time , to put things right .
neutral	the furniture is lovely and worth the wait .
neutral	despite the problems , the way my case has_been handled has restored my faith in ofl and i will buy from them again .
neutral	we ordered the rump_steaks and they arrived on time and well_packaged .
neutral	however , the steaks were disappointing , in that they weren_'_t as tender as we had hoped .
neutral	i consider myself almost an expert at cooking steaks , so i don_'_t think that it was the cooking , rather_than the steak itself .
neutral	we ate 0 of the steaks on the day that they arrived , so we still have 0 more in the freezer .
neutral	not sure that we ' d order them again !
neutral	order agreed and dispatched on schedule , but the week end intervened - they tried to deliver on a saturday , no one in , so no delivery .
neutral	today , spent over 00_mins at various time trying to get through on the telephone - without an answer .
neutral	sent email requesting re - delivery ; no answer there either .
neutral	finally got through on phone in late_afternoon monday , and the delivery is rescheduled for tuesday 0 - 0 : 00 ( which is really good ) but i didn_'_t know .....

neutral	like ed , i ordered my battery ( sony vgp - bps0 ) before i saw the reviews and assumed i ' d thrown my money away .
neutral	however , eleven days after ordering , the battery arrived , fits_perfectly , was recognised by my lap - top , and so far , works as it should .
neutral	hopefully it will_continue to do so .
neutral	i decided to check the reviews when pay_pal confirmed that my payment had been made to a xianghua luo , rather_than a british company as i was expecting .
neutral	their e_- mail address is a uk one and they display a post_office symbol on their home page .
neutral	( the gpo did provide the final leg of the journey .)
neutral	the company is in fact based in singapore .
neutral	the web_page from which i ordered my battery shows a picture of a sony battery and i did think i was ordering a genuine sony product .
neutral	when i went back and read the small_print , as i should have done at first , it was clear that this was not so .
neutral	given the price , i decided to sit tight and hope for the best .
neutral	the battery is made in china , appeared to be new , was well_packaged and as i '_ve said , so far so good .
neutral	however , if this company wishes to achieve as they themselves say , ' 000_% customer_satisfaction ' they need to be far more open and honest about who they are , where they are , and exactly_what the product they are selling is .
neutral	in view of this , despite my apparent success with them this time , i should be very wary of trading with them again .
neutral	but you don_'_t allow two letter names !
neutral	why ?
neutral	oz
neutral	ease of on - line ordering and price highly competative .
neutral	contact from mattressonline re discontinued mattress_protector ordered was solved with an upgrade at no extra_charge .
neutral	however i informed about the restricted access to the cottage with limit at a luton van size vehicle .
neutral	no one read the notes and on the morning of delivery as we were waiting , a phone_call informed us that the van arranged was too big to come .
neutral	further communications from delivery company poor , leaving us to chase up via mattressonline .
neutral	early morning call with phone number to contact , connected to a message which said office now closed .
neutral	delivery finally came next_day , but plastic mattress cover very dirty and torn and new mattress had dirty patches .
neutral	on purchasing the bass_guitar , the guitar itself was what i wanted and good value , however the included amplifier was not up to the job .
neutral	i was poorer than a low power guitar amp purchased a long time ago .
neutral	one of the problems i have which is not unique is a neck size which is large 00 " and a body rather smaller so when i received the dinner shirt i ordered the body was massive but the collar fitted well .
neutral	as the shirt is usually under a suit or dinner jacket i have not bothered sending it back but the ' niggle ' is there when i wear it .
neutral	the ordering was easy and the delivery at the expected time .
neutral	the packaging was a black polythene bag with the shirt inside in a cellophane bag which had been ripped open in order to put in a bow_tie i had also ordered .
neutral	it therefore looked scruffy , not what i expected and the overall experience was disappointing which was a pity as i am sure the firm are usually better and will also be disappointed with my comments
neutral	having made my order i was then informed that glasses i had ordered were no_longer instock and should not have been showing .
neutral	the only other glasses i like were £_00 - 00 more in cost of which i was somewhat unhappy having to pay full cost .
neutral	please ensure correct information is showing and not having to re - change order at extra costs .
neutral	si hughes
neutral	you will never pay the advertised price .
neutral	when you go through the booking process the extras start adding up . get what you pay for and sometimes a bit less .
neutral	everything used to be in stock , but just recently many things i needed were not available .
neutral	in the past you could rely_on argos to have everything in stock .
neutral	would still use them though .
neutral	staff at local shop are very helpful .
neutral	i am very satisfied with the products from whittard .
neutral	i enjoy tea from whittard every day .
neutral	the web shop is user_friendly .
neutral	my order was shipped very quickly , and i received it in norway a couple of days after i placed my order .
neutral	but the super - fast shipping has a price .
neutral	it is very expensive .
neutral	i wish whittard would offer some kind of low - cost shipping .
neutral	i would give five_stars to whittard , if the shipping cost to norway were lower .
neutral	simple to navigate website and quite intuitive to work through .
neutral	simple navigation ( and helpful reminders in case you miss something !
neutral	).
neutral	unfortunately i couldn_'_t get my purchase to work on my ipad so had to reprocess it on my pc ( due to the online help being offline ...).
neutral	i always send flowers to my lovely auntie and they always make her smile and that smile lasts while the flowers bloom .......... her smile didnt not last long with your flowers sad to say wont be sending flower this way again .
neutral	i purchase often online around the planet but first time with forzieri .
neutral	keen to get your sale .
neutral	i purchased a suede men '_s jacket & was duly told of a 0 week backorder .
neutral	i emailed twice but received no reply .
neutral	then 0 weeks_later received a shipped email with dhl .
neutral	0 days_later it arrived , beautify packaged .
neutral	and it is a quality garment superbly made , fits 000_%, is quality material & looks the part .
neutral	i would like to give 0_stars but can only give 0 ...
neutral	these days it has never been easier to communicate with anyone around the globe so there is absolutely no excuse for not replying to my email .
neutral	i will buy again but check on stock prior to pushing the buy button .... if possible to get such an answer ...!
neutral	i contacted many properties with sunny_rentals .
neutral	some replied , some didn_'_t .
neutral	their reply was quick and accurate but many replied in their own language which i found hard to communicate with .
neutral	overall i would try them again if i was looking to rent again .
neutral	when it comes to physical items that are sent by mail , paypal continues to be my first service .
neutral	when it is about virtual items ( in game items etc .
neutral	), paypal seems to regret to support a dispute .
neutral	this means the seller can easily get away with my money , without delivering anything and with paypal not able to take any meaningful action .
neutral	i have ordered much over the years and will again , but i am miffed that i ordered a guitar for next_day delivery , and then tracked the order to find it will arrive in two_weeks .
neutral	i have had other issues with late or never arriving gibson guitars .
neutral	ordered mugs on 0rd no mugs by the 0th .
neutral	phoned and was told someone would get back to me .
neutral	two hours_later no one phoned i phoned again to be told " we are waiting on the warehouse so i have nothing to tell you " where is the warehouse china no cant be i have had items delivered quicker from america .
neutral	will never use or recomend them .
neutral	facebook a good place to start !!!!!
neutral	have just had a phone_call from the sales manager who i have to say was the total opposite very polite and offered a full_refund plus free mugs so for this reason i will make it 0_stars and when all goes through will make more stars .
neutral	good selection and economic trophies , but £ 0 . 00 p_&_p on a £ 0 trophy is a rip_off .
neutral	delivery of 0 to 0 days is unacceptable in these days of next_day delivery .
neutral	i shop at aldi in shipley bradford every now and again and love the surprising extra one off items you can find .
neutral	however the cheaper shopping_experience should not out way a friendly and welcoming staff , i know they ' re busy and want you through asap , but being rushed by unfriendly staff will put me off returning .
neutral	review removed so i can get paid !
neutral	we booked the best room ( 0 ) in a hotel with a great location .
neutral	other rooms were small with tables and chairs next to the pool or with terraces walked through by other guests .
neutral	we did our research and got the best room - at top of hotel with a private terrace with sun beds .
neutral	a table and chairs and a jacuzzi .
neutral	hotel was spotlessly_clean .
neutral	breakfast was very good - maybe over ambitious for the space available .
neutral	amazing selection of greek appetizers each morning but they were served cold - chilled not just tepid - which although disappointing for me was correct from a food safety point of view .
neutral	who does eat cold poached eggs ??
neutral	?
neutral	the staff were fantastic - so friendly and nothing was too much_trouble .
neutral	the hotel was really busy - lots of people staying just a night so cleaning was really important - and they did it well .
neutral	lovely pool - just a little cold but that was a challenge .
neutral	only one whinge .
neutral	0 young girls turned_up and used the pool area each day .
neutral	clearly relatives of the staff .
neutral	they were often noisy and monopolised the small pool when guests wanted - or i wanted to use it .
neutral	it is a family run hotel but the children were a nuisance with their screams at sunset .
neutral	the sunset views were amazing
neutral	we only saw the olympic rep once - she showed us the transfer mini_bus and left us - pretty useless but we didn_'_t want a rep and welcome drinks and all that stuff
neutral	of late delivery failure after delivery failure .
neutral	given a time and date then delivery people ring to say it has not arrived at their depot can not deliver .
neutral	also lots of items supposedly in stock only to then be told after order accepted not available any more .
neutral	not as good as it was going down_hill fast , bring back the old crew please at_least they were polite and helpful .
neutral	am seriously thinking of stopping once i have finished paying what i owe
neutral	had my son on as a person to speak on my behalf for over 0 years then all of a sudden he is taken off and i have to fill all the paper_work out again .
neutral	beware when renewing your credit , do not just buy credit or it gets used up in no time !
neutral	make_sure you buy a goodybag when you renew your monthly credit !
neutral	i did not feel this was made clear enough as a new customer and cost me £_00 worth of ' credit ' in a week !!
neutral	when goodybag is paid for then all seems to work fine .
neutral	i had a question today which was answered within about an_hour max so not too bad .
neutral	another day may be different i do not know ..
positive	this is a company that takes customer_care seriously .
positive	we received really impressive service when we contacted the company .
positive	advice was free and plentiful .
positive	the goods arrived ahead of schedule and were as expected .
positive	regrettably one of the items had a manufacturing_fault which was only discovered after four weeks .
positive	they quickly agreed to collect the item and replace it .
positive	i remain impressed .

positive	provides a quicker , responsive and value for money service .
positive	the service provided by this company is exemplary .
positive	it '_s prices are very competitive and are underlain by a professional attitude to delivering its products quickly with little fuss and no bother .
positive	this suppler provides a fast and ost effecitive serives .
positive	its prices are compeitive and it is proactive when making_sure its customers know where their order are at all times .
positive	i '_ve used this company before .
positive	it '_s staff are friendly and helpful .
positive	in addition , its prices are comparable with the cheapest ( for genuine goods ) on ebay .
positive	the spd lugs seem genuine and great value even in comparison prices on ebay .
positive	for the price i paid for those ceiling lights i did not expect them to be as good looking , well made or packed so well and delivered in a flash as they were .
positive	i reckon i got a great deal more than i paid for .
positive	the site itself has a fabulous range of goods , is easy to navigate , and easy payment .
positive	i knew_exactly_what i wanted and very lucky for me google took me to castlegate .
positive	next door love them as well , he said " oh so much_nicer_than them other old ones ", which were way , way , over the cost of these .
positive	never again will i use an overprice well_known high_street diy_store .
positive	you got to see for yourself , here borrow my computer while i make us a cup of tea .
positive	the dewalt drill has made erecting my new shed an_absolute pleasure .
positive	one battery lasted a full 00_hours of working and then some .
positive	two batteries are even better , especially when they recharge in only an_hour ...
positive	the drill itself has plenty of oomph for those tough jobs , though maybe a little on the heavy side .
positive	price wise it '_s great value .
positive	i am a excellent and avid diyer and it '_s going to be amongst some of the best tools i have .
positive	delivery could absolutely not be_faulted .
positive	delivered on time and by very pleasant driver .
positive	website lovely and easy to purchase and very good feedback re progress of order and delivery .
positive	i shall return .
positive	i purchased from another well_known supplier a saturn back to wall toilet and installed it earlier this year .
positive	the soft_close never worked and toilet_seat broke within 0 months .
positive	decided to get new seat from different supplier .
positive	package arrived in excellent shape , and wonderfully fast .
positive	now my seat is comfortable and safe .
positive	great customer service ( rare in this day & age ).
positive	i ordered the wrong adhesive but was quickly able to modify my order (& they followed up with a confirmation_email so i felt secure that the change had gone_through ok ) delivery was really quick .
positive	i needed a replacement pair of crocs cleo sandals after someone '_s dog chewed mine .
positive	they are exactly_what i wanted and they were delivered as promised .
positive	we needed a replacement for a dated mira_shower fitting and ordered this one afternoon and it arrived the next .
positive	it was perfect for what we wanted and we are delighted with it .
positive	as above .
positive	as above .
positive	very easy to order .
positive	i always check prices with the competition before ordering .
positive	so far on all my orders since using viovet , the company is always slightly_cheaper , when the free delivery is taken into account .
positive	my last order was made on a thursday and was at my door the very next_day .
positive	fantastic !
positive	in the last 00 days , we have ordered and received 0 electrical items .
positive	each time , not only did they come exactly when advised , but was text the day before , was advised in the morning what time it was due to arrive and they did .
positive	the delivery_men mobiled when they were at the end of the road and they were courteous and helpful on arrival .
positive	thank_you for all your input , which sometimes is not always there with other_companies .
positive	the slate house name received this week was as good as we had hoped , the white word depth was better and deeper than_expected .
positive	we hav ' nt fitted it yet , but as an electrician i will have no trouble ( they even supplied the plugs and screws )
positive	we will_certainly praise your product and the way you kept us informed during the purchase time to the time it arrived here at the shires .
positive	once again , thank_you for an excellent slate sign .
positive	kind_regards .

positive	we required a dimplex controller urgently , after contacting jay at fastlec
positive	we were very surprised he had them in stock , as promised , the controller arrived the next evening at about 00 . 00hrs .
positive	on the afternoon of the arrival , we received email_confirmation of the approx time of delivery .
positive	well_done , fastlec .
positive	i have been in the electrical contracting business
positive	since 0000 and at last i have seen what can be done , by good people
positive	had the head of a excellent company .
positive	i have never used this method
positive	of praise before , so like good business practice there is a first time for
positive	everything and everybody .
positive	thanks again , jay and all the best to you .
positive	order curtains friday recieved them on monday . great quality just put them up and they look great would recommed highly .
positive	order my new mattress on the monday arrived by 00 . 00 on tuesday excellent product would recommed matttressman highly .
positive	brought two floor runners and im very pleased with them .
positive	the rubber backing stop '_s them moving even with two dogs running about :-) have wash one already and has washed realy well would buy from these again .
positive	brought this easy leader for my dog .
positive	very good product would defo recommend no more pulling .
positive	service very good came within 0days :-)
positive	the best competition i found had the same products with free shipping , but i saved $_00 on 0 items and only had to pay $_00 in shipping , netting me $_00 in savings on a $_000 order .
positive	same exact products locally would have cost $_000 . 00 including tax to buy them in person .
positive	my search for a new mattress came about as a result of a bad previous decision and a very poorly back .
positive	this time i tried every bed , in every shop , at every price and then i did my internet research and was actually intrigued by a negative_review ( on another site ) which looked out of place when i found the website and read the entire thing , and got in touch with my questions .
positive	the service was excellent .
positive	this company is really knowledgable , really polite and really informative .
positive	they recommended a mattress and i took the plunge - after all , why on earth would i buy a mattress i can test for two minutes in a shop , surrounded by onlookers , when i could love it or return it within a month ?
positive	the company called after i made my order to check that i ' d made the right decision , they then called a few_days_later as the mattress was ready !
positive	it was delivered on time , unpacked and put on the bed for me , and away we went .
positive	by night 0 the backache had gone , by night 0 we were sleeping for hours at a time .
positive	just to make_sure we '_ve revisited those bed shops and checked our short list again and this mattress is by far the most comfortable of all .
positive	if we ' d paid three_times as much it wouldn_'_t have been this comfortable .
positive	so , thanks to the negative_review ( from someone who was unlucky_enough not to purchase from john_ryan ) i found one of the best , british made mattresses and one of the nicest , most knowledgable companies to do_business with .
positive	highly_recommended to all my friends .
positive	fine as usual , they didn_'_t have my tyre in stock so allowed us a free upgrade and fitted them the next_day .
positive	pretty good for the isle of man .
positive	will use again soon .
positive	thanks
positive	most efficient organisation , descriptions are accurate , value is good and delivery is extremely fast - couldn_'_t ask for more !
positive	all previous parcels , including international ones , have been arranged online with no_problems whatsover .
positive	in fact i even ' like ' them on facebook .
positive	this time i got baffled , clicked on online help , and catherine not only sorted it out but sent me links to the right spot in the order process .
positive	so no wrecks , just one very satisfied customer .
positive	gold star .
positive	i was completely_satisfied with both the offer and service i received from mazuma .
positive	they did exactly_what they promised and paid me promptly , pretty_much by return .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in both recommending them to my friends or using them again to sell on a no_longer needed phone .
positive	i would sell my old iphone 0 but it is too useful as an ipod
positive	i always buy from refreshcartridges .
positive	delivery to ireland within 00_hrs great product thank_you ( a refreshing way to do_business )
positive	all my shopping_experiences with viovet are fantastic , if i want just one small thing or a large order !
positive	no problem too small or too large .
positive	it is such a pleasure_dealing_with a company who are always polite , no matter who i speak to or contact .
positive	i save so much money with them with veterinary prescriptions which is brilliant ; as that is a must with 0 dogs and four birds in today '_s economy !
positive	i love my pets as much as the next person so i want the best for them .
positive	dealing_with viovet is a pleasure always , i get the best service , best products and feel that i am a special customer which makes all the difference to me .
positive	if i do have a problem which is a rarity then it is cleared up normally within the hour , fantastic !
positive	what can i say if you have a pet and your looking for a fantastic , service , tips , products then look no further this place is the best !
positive	!
positive	il be back . used you for a few_years now .
positive	thanks
positive	no problem , delivered in two days .
positive	ordered online one day got it the next .
positive	excellent service and prompt deliver - the product descriptions are very good and give confidence to buy on line .
positive	was very impressed with the speed of delivery .
positive	there is a huge_variety of items to choose from , but my son chose for 0 of his friends for his d of e . he said the food was very good plus the snacks were tasty and there were lots of useful items in there as well .

positive	if there is a problem , i am confident ch0000 will back me up .

positive	i have purchased toppers before so i feel qualified to comment on this one .
positive	the speed of delivery was superfast and the topper was very well_wrapped and packed , had there been any damage it would have been very easy to see before opening the inner packaging .
positive	there was no smell at all once it was unpacked and having arrived fairly early in the morning i was able to lie it on top of my bed for the rest of the day .
positive	early evening i put it on the bed as it was almost ready but certainly enough to sleep on .
positive	by the following evening it was as it should be and very , very comfortable indeed .
positive	the cover having a ‘ rough ’ surface underneath , stops it from slipping and having had it now for a week or so it has not moved at all .
positive	the free pillows that came with it were a real_bonus as although i already had similar pillows they were not such good quality as these and certainly they are far more comfortable as they are a bit softer to lie on .
positive	i would recommend this company highly to anyone as the service and product are exceptional .
positive	there are many firms selling toppers on the internet so thank_goodness i found this one as not only is the product and service first_class , the price was very , very competitive .
positive	thank_you .

positive	some of the places have been very good and very low_cost
positive	as above will use again
positive	we had an incredibly good value holiday in the algarve .
positive	when we booked it there was a slight_hiccup on the booking site - not at dealchecker - and i had to speak to an agent .
positive	she said the deal was the best she ' d ever seen in her twenty year career ! the hotel was superb and we still_haven_'_t got over what a great deal we got .
positive	would definitely_use dealchecker again & again ....
positive	after another shop let me down with no stock , taunton_leisure wer able to confirm that they had stock and i got my new boots 0 days_later .
positive	i needed a new fire door .
positive	although the website said delivery 0 - 00 days , topclass were able to find one at one of their stockists and get it delivered the next_day .

positive	0st_class service
positive	0st_class delivery
positive	this is the only online comapny i deal with now !
positive	use them and you will see why ... customer service as it should be 0st_class .
positive	no waiting in all day for delivery @ £_00 ... theirs is free and with a 0 hr time_slot ... other company '_s should take_note .
positive	cheapest prices and great service ... you have your business plan spot on ... well_done
positive	why would anyone pay full price from petshops when you can buy direct ... delivered to your door and at a fraction of the cost
positive	did internet order ... then changed my mind ... then had to add something i had forgotten ... then cancelled something ... poor people ... their service and refund were first_class
positive	yes £ 0000 back in 0 years ... what ever i buy in the internet ... be it electrical or insurance ... i always check through quidco first
positive	edecks were recommended to me you know , i thought that they would be just like any other on - line company , mediocre and failing to deliver on their promises .
positive	but actually no , that was not the case ; i was really pleasantly_surprised by the way i was dealt_with , the on - line buying process was as easy as it could be and delivery , following the security_checks , was made to me almost the next_day by a very helpful chap_who knew_exactly_what he was doing .
positive	you should try them for decking or other supplies , they really do offer an outstanding service .
positive	all i would say is that if you did not deliver an excellent service , i would not keep returning to your site .
positive	i have made countless purchases through lenstore and that is testament to how good you are .
positive	this is exactly_what i wass looking for and delivered very quickly , so i was not left_hanging_around waiting for my order .
positive	i am new on this site but certainly i have enjoyed some good time here cause meeting is easy and fun .
positive	you meet the real people at the right time .

positive	my daughter and her half - wit boyfriend loved the portrait .
positive	cheers .
positive	we ordered the samsung clp 000 colour_laser_printer .
positive	the service from printerland was excellent , the printer was delivered the next working day .
positive	to sum up they have a good website and offered great service .
positive	so far the samsung laser_printer ordered seems good .
positive	excellent printing speed and excellent quality printing .
positive	the only negative point is the alarming speed at which we used up the toners supplied with the printer .
positive	we are now ordering the high capacity cartridges and will see how long they last
positive	item delivered when promised ; hifi_tower sent useful dpd parcel tracking link which announced arrival to a one - hour_window .
positive	great speakers , well packagesd , exactly as_described and good value

positive	thanks quick delivery
positive	my contact was lee .
positive	firstly i bought a pair of focal cms00 studio monitors at a price which was £_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else i could find .
positive	a couple of days_later i rang lee again to ask about a sub - woofer , i could not afford the matching focal sub so asked lee for advice on alternatives .
positive	he made some calls and got back to me with a price on the focal cms sub woofer which was £_000 less_than everyone_else .
positive	there was no pressure from lee but it was an offer too good to miss .
positive	what can i say , music matter were fabulous and lee was terrific .
positive	i have purchased from golfbase before so i was aware of their top_class service .
positive	the items i bought were keenly_priced and were delivered very quickly .
positive	pc_specialist was recommended to me by a good friend who purchased a desktop_pc a couple of years_ago and was able to give me the benefit of his experience with pc_specialist .
positive	my son andrew knows quite a bit about computers , unlike my self , and when i told him i wished to buy a good laptop for his mother '_s 00th_birthday he also recommended pc_specialist .
positive	andrew was able to sit with me and together we agreed a specification for the laptop .
positive	the whole_experience to date with pc_specialist has_been very positive .
positive	the information provided on the website during the build process , the quality of the e_- mail communication and the speedy and accurate delivery have all been first_class .
positive	i hope i don_'_t have the need to contact pc_specialist with problems in the future , but if i do , i am confident that the firm will do all they can to help .

positive	i always get good value for money and free delivery from pet_supermarket , its great .
positive	i would reccommend to everyone .
positive	i received excellent service in my recent_purchase of james_wellbeloved puppy food .

positive	many_thanks for a all_round brilliant service
positive	ordered many_times from animed .
positive	even_though transaction is made online , there is a feeling that the people behind animed cares_about what they are selling and helping us find the right product .
positive	price is good and competitive , and really appreciate free shipping so they are the only online vet retailer i will go back to .
positive	some work can be done on website though , check out is sometimes tricky ; when i click out of checkout to find another product i need my basket look empty !
positive	have to click onto homepage then go back to check my basket again then i can see the products i picked .
positive	can be daunting on new customers , so best to look into any glitches and not get complacent .
positive	i have always used collectplus to send returned items back , never an issue .
positive	decided to try them for delivering an item to customer ; my delivery reach my customer within 0 days .
positive	well pleased .
positive	hope collectplus will keep and maintain their service as i will_definitely_use them again .
positive	product was best price here and arrived within a few_days of order .
positive	the company kept me informed of progress and delivery by email which was really useful .
positive	i would definitely_use them again .
positive	i bought a wedding_ring from diamond_geezer , i was initially a little_concerned with buying online , but the experience was a very positive one with help easily obtainable & a returns_policy if required .
positive	i was unable to purchase my chosen style from a high_street jeweller unless i had it custom made but with diamond_geezer there was a wealth of choice to suit all needs .
positive	good website easy to use .
positive	prompt delivery of order .
positive	i have used cpc for the past 0 years having previously used ard who they took over .
positive	there accounts_dept , sales staff have always been extremely_helpful and resolved the few minor problems i have had .
positive	the one miinor thing that is not very good is when they send orders by royal_mail over whom they have no control and who are particulary bad in my area .
positive	all in all i would class their service and stock availabillity as excellent and give them a score of 0 out of 00 and have no_hesitation in recommending them to everyone .
positive	one little gripe , although their new trade counter is superb i find the queing system tedious and time_consuming .
positive	bert morris
positive	very satisfied customer
positive	bert morris
positive	just taken deilvery of a new vauxhall and cannot thank them enough for the exemplary service extended to me from point of order to date of delivery , they have been patient , caring , and understanding , the service i have had from them in every department is second to none and i have no_hesitation in recommending them to everyone .
positive	bert morris
positive	thanks very much for your superb , and extremely professional service .
positive	i consider everything about your company including your web_site , sales and delivery staff to be outstanding , all are true professionals .
positive	the furniture arrived today exactly as promised and before your estimated date . it exceeded my expectations both in value and quality .
positive	from start to finish your company is a at the very least a 0 star organisation in every_aspect , it has_been an_absolute pleasure to deal with you and i hope to again in the future .
positive	many_thanks again regards paul morris
positive	thornton cleveleys
positive	contact information : order number :
positive	ccc - 000000
positive	got in a muddle for the second time and chatted to sarah_hayes on both_occasions and she sorted things out and helped_me fill the form in , 00 / 00 , will use p0p again in the future :-)
positive	i ordered a pair of north_face trousers which arrived within 0 days , unfortunately i ordered the wrong_size , sent them back and not only did the replacement arrive by return post , a very helpful member of staff phoned me before despatch to check i was sure of the size i wanted .
positive	well_done .
positive	the guy found our house ok , even_though we share the same postcode with around 00 other properties scattered around this very rural_area . he was friendly and efficient , many_thanks .
positive	they always have great offers and booking is painless .
positive	customer service is also good , though once booked , the hard work is being done by the company you book with .
positive	we stayed at the kresten royal at rhodes for a week in early june_0000 and had a fab time .
positive	the hotel is very nice , it has have 0 swimming pools , both with bars .
positive	one of them only serves drinks , the other serves food as well .
positive	the one nearer the sea is large and has varying depth , the smaller one nearer the reception is about 0 . 0m deep all around .
positive	both have crystal_clear waters .
positive	we stayed in a superior sea - view room , which was very large , very spacious , big balcony too .
positive	comfy bed , the bath had jacuzzi in it with quite powerful jets as well .
positive	we had the ' all_inclusive ' deal , which was really worth it .
positive	it really means all_inclusive , drinks as well ( perhaps not alcohol , but we don_’ t drink alcohol anyway ), and hot food is served in one restaurant or another almost all day long .
positive	the hotel has 0 restaurants , the main one always serves buffet style food with wide and varied_selection .
positive	i actually prefer this style as_opposed to having to sit down and wait to be served .
positive	there is an italian restaurant and a greek one as well .
positive	in the ' all_inclusive ' deal you can opt to go one evening to the italian and one evening to the greek for ‘ free ’.
positive	the hotel does not have a sandy beach , but it does have a little cove where they put out sun beds and there is a changing cubicle .
positive	otherwise there is an area cut through the rocks that leads to flat rocks where you can jump into the sea safely .
positive	again sunbeds were provided here as well .
positive	as i am a keen snorkeler , i find rocks and some wild life more interesting than a flat sandy beach so i was happy with this .
positive	the holiday rep , mark , was very friendly and knowledgeable , nothing was too much_trouble .
positive	the staff was also friendly , especially agnieszka at reception , who was very helpful .
positive	again , nothing was too much_trouble .
positive	the hotel is near rhodes town , only 00_minutes on public_transport .
positive	well_worth the visit .
positive	few things that could perhaps be improved upon :
positive	0 .
positive	no wi -_fi in the room , but there is ethernet .
positive	fortunately i always have an ethernet cable with me when i travel .
positive	0 .
positive	the large , spacious rooms were quite sparse , a bit soulless and they also echoed a lot .
positive	perhaps some rugs , maybe pictures or something ….
positive	0 .
positive	for some reason you do not get foam bath or bath salts , only shower_gel and shampoo .
positive	bit surprising for a 0 star hotel .
positive	0 .
positive	tv was pretty small for the size of the room and the sounds was so faint that we could hardly hear it .
positive	you get only cnn and bbc world news in english .
positive	not a huge issue … one does not go on holiday to a sun - drenched country to watch tv .
positive	having said all that , we had a really good time , enjoyed it very much .
positive	the points above did not bother us at all .
positive	we can thoroughly_recommend the place .
positive	i was worried_about something and asked a question via the web_site .
positive	i received a prompt and courteous response , but also pointing it out that the answer was on the web_site .
positive	it must be boring / annoying for them to have to respond to questions that have answers in their faq .
positive	still , they were polite :-) .
positive	my order arrived in record time .
positive	great fun .
positive	reasonable_prices , smooth_transaction .
positive	no issues .
positive	i bought it for a more_expensive hansgrohe shower_head set as they discontinued this line ( and the one i did find that may have fitted were very expensive ).
positive	the tube diameter was 00mm , so i thought i '_ll chance it .
positive	at this price , even if it did not , it would not have been too bad .
positive	but it did fit after a little fiddling and was very snug .
positive	it would not be much good if you frequently needed to adjust the shower_head up or down , but if it can stay mainly in one position , it '_s perfect .
positive	item arrived very quickly , well_packed , and met my quality requirements .
positive	the gun case was as i hoped , and it was packed very securely in bubble_wrap and corrugated cardboard , so arrived in perfect_condition .
positive	i visited a store in brecon at the weekend and was impressed by the competent staff and good range of products .
positive	i anticipate that the online experience will be just as positive .
positive	i was sceptical at first , but i ' m_glad to say i was pleasantly_surprised by how good panamoz was .
positive	they had a stock shortage on the lens i ordered which they quickly told me about - they did everything they could and i only got the lens a couple of days_later than_expected .
positive	delivery was fast and everything was in good order , for an excellent price .
positive	i paid by_bacs to get a slightly better price and had no_problems .
positive	they do seem to have stock issues , but that aside , i ' m just waiting now for another lens to come in stock so i can order again !
positive	we purchased the veloped recently for my husband who suffers from progressive neuropathy meaning that he cannot walk unaided as he has no balance .
positive	a walking_stick was affecting one hip and he still needed to hold my hand with his other hand .
positive	we tried a four wheeled rollator which was fine in the house and in town where it was smooth but useless elsewhere and had to be lifted over kerbs and door threshholds , not the best for someone without balance .
positive	as we live on a farm it still left him unable to get any essential exercise .
positive	the veloped is very sturdy and inspires confidence , it is larger than a four wheel rollator but you do not feel it will tip forward and feels much more stable .
positive	it has very innovative design features , wheel removal , handle bar adjustment and folding mechanism are just one click operations .
positive	the dual front_wheel is easily altered from the kerb and doorstep climbing position to country walking where both wheels travel on the ground reducing wheel wander .
positive	the sliding seat is comfortable and the handle bar backrest makes one feel safer , this is a boon as my husband needs to have plenty of rests .
positive	the build_quality and finish are excellent and in - hub brakes are very effective and easy to adjust .
positive	my husband is delighted with his veloped as it will help him maintain some mobility much longer , he feels ' bjorn ' again .
positive	thankyou stefan .

positive	can '_t fault the service , my camera arrived today as did the accessories .
positive	the internet site is very user_friendly .
positive	you also get a clue as to what else you might need to order or what you may have forgotten to order .
positive	that '_s because of the ' other people who bought this also bought these ' prompt that shows during the ordering_process .
positive	products are reasonably_priced and the item arrived in no time at all .
positive	great service and i will_definitely check on this site first in future .
positive	fantastic really pleased with both pairs of rayban 0000 glasses .

positive	many_thanks .
positive	searching online for the cheapest place to buy a particular catflap , brought up ' easyanimal . co . uk '.
positive	having not heard of them before , i was a bit_hesitant about ordering , but went_ahead and did so anyway .
positive	i am glad to report that i had absolutely no_problems at all with ordering , payment or delivery - which was swift and on - time .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in using easyanimal again , or in recommending them to others .
positive	i have used viovet on three or four occasions over the last_year and will happily continue to do so .
positive	orders are easy to place and delivered quickly and they keep you informed by email with each_step of the process .
positive	they also have an optional handy ' reminder ' service which you can set to your requirements and subscribe to .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in recommending viovet .
positive	have used dapw on a number of occasions and have never been disappointed with their service or the quality of their goods .
positive	most_recent_purchase was an absolutely_beautiful mulberry silk throw in taupe .
positive	i was wary of ordering without knowing the actual measurements of this item - but the blanket is a good large size and lovely quality .
positive	in fact , i have ordered two more !
positive	i have also ' invested ' in some of their ultimate 0000 thread count bed_linen - yes , a bit_pricey , compared to other options - but absolutely worth the outlay for such fine quality cotton .
positive	now i am saving up for some of their goose_down pillows !
positive	ordered a petzl attache 0d carabiner .
positive	arrived within a couple of days .
positive	great product , great price & good service .

positive	give them a try .

positive	quick and easy

positive	grab a bargain
positive	i have bought a few items from webtogs over the last 0 years .
positive	the last time i ordered they were discounting some lines quite heavily .
positive	in addition they were offering a one off further discount if you entered a promotional code .
positive	i messed_up entering the code and was therefor charged the pre promotional rate .
positive	when i realised my mistake i emailed them on a saturday_night .
positive	by the time my boots had arrived ( very quickly ) they had credited me with the extra discount .
positive	great service , good value .
positive	order placed i sat and waited , email arrived a day later telling_me items had been dispatched .
positive	very impressive i thought , then a text and another email_telling_me the date and time to expect my goods and that if this was not convenient please arrange a different time .
positive	by now very impressed and the order was delivered within the specified period .
positive	would recommend you to all my friends .
positive	hopefully will not need another bed for a few_years but would go back to dreams if i did .
positive	didn_'_t realise buying a bed could be so much fun .
positive	excellent goods , and excellent service .
positive	goods have always arrived so quickly i have never been disappointed .
positive	until i found simplysupplements i was suffering regular periods of ibs , in fact it had started to happen 0 - 0 times a week which curtailed my life no end .
positive	but since using the probiotic max for the last 0 months i have found that the episodes have reduced to about once or twice a month , so much_easier to cope with .
positive	would recommend them to anyone , in fact have been doing just that and will_continue to sing their praises to all who will listen .
positive	have investigated other_suppliers but the cost with simplysupplements is so much less and without losing any of the quality .
positive	so do not_hesitate order now !!
positive	!
positive	love this site , it '_s service is quick and efficient and also a lot_cheaper_than vet '_s prices .

positive	perfect meals for one with fast delivery thrown in !
positive	i recently ordered some frog health from viovet , and as usual i experienced excellent service , good price for the product and very speedy delivery .
positive	couldn_'_t be_happier and will_definitely_use them again
positive	i have used appliance_planet many_times .
positive	they are always cheaper_than other online_retailers and delivery times are exceptional , often next_day .
positive	can '_t recommend them highly_enough
positive	excellent service .
positive	was kept_informed by text and was able to track my order from 0am on morning of delivery and was kept up to date with the time slots .
positive	delivered exactly in the 0 hour time_slot .
positive	ordered on tuesday for delivery on friday unfortunately goods were not delivered from manufacturer until friday so order was delayed till the saturday but that was suitable anyway .
positive	no_problems whatsoever but would like if delivery slots were available for convenience .
positive	i would recommend and definetely use again grippy . co . uk to change any tyres .
positive	they are a quality fast clean professional friendly service .
positive	we were kept up to date with the status of the order and given a delivery date .
positive	as we were unable to take delivery that day we selected the option from the email to choose another convenient date .
negative	each week they advised a shipment was due but then apologised because it didn_'_t arrive !
negative	i arranged to collect my ipad but was told that i would still lose £ 0 . 00 for delivery because that '_s what it says on their website !!!!
negative	still_waiting for a refund - i would definitely check reviews of a company before i use them in the future - this company is using false_advertising my saying they can repair your item within 0 days !!!!!!
negative	do not use them if you want your device repairing quickly - or not repairing as was my case !!!
negative	i am a genuine customer of repairs0 - and have documented emails to prove their inability to repair my ipad .
negative	every year , for the past eleven years , i have paid my water bill over a few_months .
negative	every year united utilities have sent me dozens of threatening_letters and made dozens of threatening phone_calls .
negative	i have written to them and phoned them , but i get nowhere .
negative	this year will be no different .
negative	why can they not communicate ?
negative	why have they no email address ?
negative	why do they waste so much money ?
negative	we bought a camera from pixmania .
negative	we sent it for repair just out of warranty .
negative	this took five months , not helped by emails in ' franglais '.
negative	the ' safe and secure ' payment website is a nightmare and kept saying payment failed .
negative	we tried 0 times and gave up only to find later they had processed the payment of £_000 three_times but can only get one refunded !
negative	so a repair of a screen ( which retails at £_00 by the way ) has cost us £_000 .
negative	be warned - avoid extreme frustration and expense - do not deal with this company .
negative	sorry pixmania but the world has to know how you treat some of your customers .
negative	outrageous price £_000 just to change a name on a ticket , would be better for them to charge a sensible price as on that principle i will not cancel my flight to allow them to get another lot of money for flight
negative	virgin_media helpline - spent 00_minutes with operator who was unable to help and so transferred me to customer service , then 00_minutes on hold before being told that customer service had closed at 0 .
negative	on hold again .
negative	phone has now run out of batteries .
negative	vm used to be ok with their helpdesk - not any more !
negative	ordered an item on the 00rd jan , on a three day delivery , told it was instock , did a track on this item on 00th_jan only to find that the delivery date was now up to the 00 feb . no email from littlewoods informing_me of this delay or why .
negative	when i phoned up to find out what was going on i was told by a uphelpfull disinterested customer service person " thats how it is " more or less take it or leave it .
negative	if its out of stock or low stock when you order it tell us don_'_t leave us expecting delivery when it its not going to turn_up when you expected it .
negative	totally dusgusted with the service .
negative	i '_ve gone elsewere and got a guaranteed delivery for wednesday 00th_jan .
negative	the only reason bt still exists is i suspect based on it monopoly roots .
negative	the services are relatively expensive and not as customer friendly as they would have you believe .
negative	the policy of the company towards its customers is and still remains legendry .
negative	their products outside the foodhalls are however mainly from china and that part of the world .
negative	not even my pants are now made in the uk .
negative	for a flagship british company this is very dissappointing
negative	if there is a gutter in communication , facebook is right there .
negative	for absolute tosh & brain dead excremental communication this is the place to go in 00_% of cases .
negative	i was with the company for nearly 00 years .
negative	for the first 0 it was good although dealing_with overseas call_centres was a bit of a pain .
negative	ii was so pleased that i had several members of my family sign up to talktalk .
negative	after then unfortunately it just got worse & worse culminating in a service promise & contract that they even put in writing yet still manage to get wrong and not fix for over 0 months .
negative	i lost track of all the staff i spoke to and it was obvious that no one really knew what was going on with nearly everyone promising and rarely delivering .
negative	i call it a flamingo syndrome - similar to a cock - up but just a lot bigger
negative	after a confirmed and paid for order , they called 0 days_later to tell me the item had been damaged and they had no other stock .
negative	they lied and told me they had tried to contact me the day i placed the order .
negative	when i tried to complain , they lied again and the person i spoke to claimed he was the sole director of the company and he was the only one i could complain to .
negative	after checking , it turns_out this person is not one of the directors of the company .
negative	it is a criminal offence to impersonate the director of a company .
negative	basically , they sell items they don_'_t actually have , and the lie to the customer before trying to up - sell another item or process a refund .
negative	ordered filing_cabinet that is described as 00 day delivery ( as non standard colour ) 00th_september , preferred delivery any thursday / friday notified at time of purchase .
negative	i was contacted to advise longer lead time and delivery early november .
negative	during a six week period from 00th_september to date this has not changed and has_been advertised online by ofo and still is as 00 days .
negative	i was willing to wait as not urgent .
negative	contacted ofo after 0 weeks , 0th_november .
negative	advised in email should be delivered w_/ c 00th manufacturer will contact you to agree delivery date .
negative	manufacturer not retailer who i have contract with .
negative	we will deliver monday 00th_november , i advised as the customer sorry this is not possible no one available monday .
negative	now dictated to , take delivery on monday 00th as we are in the area or cancel order and pay 00_% cancellation_fee .
negative	i would suggest ambiguity and unreasonable behaviour by supplier ( s ), i do not have a contract with manufacturer but retailer .
negative	i '_ll let you guys think about whether this is the sort of company you want to do_business with , i know i ' m going viral with business contacts , friends and family educating them to the service i am being subjected to .
negative	beware food ordered and paid for did not arrive .
negative	could not use live_chat on just eat as too early in the evening .
negative	drove to the takeaway which was closed .
negative	when i contacted just eat they did appologise and told me that the money requested from my bank_account for the meal would be put back within 00 days and any concerns should be taken up with the take away .
negative	likewise the take away told me to take the matter up with just eat .
negative	unbelievable i will not use again .
negative	have been waiting a month for my glasses although they tell you that they are dispatched within 0 to 00 days .
negative	have sent several emails and they do not have the decency to reply .
negative	not impressed at all , absolutely unacceptable and very bad customer service overall .
negative	we all know these company '_s produce cheap tack but even i was shocked at how cheaply the 0 costumes i ordered on line were made so sent them back .
negative	you have to return them 0st_class recorded delivery and have a tracking_number , this cost me nearly_£ 0 . 00 , why i don_'_t know as you cant speak to anyone regarding returns and they don_'_t respond to enquires through email .
negative	0 weeks_later and still no refund or response and yes we know its halloween and they are busy .......... but its a " costume company " racking in the money at their busiest time off the year which they should be totally geared up for .
negative	go to a local shop for an outfit or make one as this company is run my monkeys and the outfits are rubbish , stinks of cheap labour from manufacturing to sales ..
negative	the only thing ' supa ' about this company is the speed at which they took my money .
negative	i have been defrauded out of £_00 . 00 !
negative	they have refused to send the 0 perfumes that i ordered , stating that they are awaiting dispatch , ( they '_ve been waiting dispatch since 0th_december ) and will not refund the money after three_times of asking .
negative	if anyone is interested in joining me in contacting watchdog about this second - rate , shoddy outfit , please do so .
negative	don_'_t let them get away with this appauling level of ' service '.
negative	under no circumstances should you part with your hard_earned cash with supaperfumes .
negative	update_: the day after this feedback was left at trustpilot , supapefume gave me a full_refund .
negative	this just goes to prove that if you complain loudly enough and publicly enough , your voice will be heard .
negative	thank_you trustpilot for the forum .
negative	other dissatisfied_customers please take_note .
negative	we went for a sight seeing weekend with our two children .
negative	yes it was raining but there was no excuse for health and safety issues , the staff were cramming people onto the bus even_though there were no seats or safe standing areas left , people were allowed to stand on the stairs which left you having to come down on the narrowest of stair area .
negative	prams were put against doors so you could only enlight from the front doors next to driver .
negative	i have written to the company but feel as if i was just dis regarded and have had no reply back off them on my second correspondence to them .
negative	i would never use this company there are other_companies that do exactly the same .
negative	they were not packing the customers on and there were more buses for certain other_companies so if you are considering using the bus service do not use big bus tours .
negative	they take money and don_'_t deliver or refund at all .
negative	ripping off people beware
negative	rebooked with citylink 00 at parcel0go sams ' suggestion after 0 days of failed_collections from yodel .
negative	told by sam not to relabel as citylink would do it .
negative	bad advice .
negative	morons in city_link ( or deliberately malicious ?)
negative	put the wrong labels on the two parcels .
negative	now 0 weeks_later , one has_been returned to me clearly showing mislabelling by citylink and one appears lost .
negative	thanks a bunch parcel0go , 00 years to get 000_% 0000 + feedback and then i suffer this incompetence .
negative	hours spent on 0 chats to different operators and to add_insult to injury , my refund has_been rejected ??
negative	parecl0go need to up their game as opposition is now better .
negative	now using ipost and cut out these middlemen with numerous failed_collections .
negative	i bought 0 pcs together which was very fortunate because it enabled_me to compare them before turning anything on .
negative	there were fundamental errors in the build of both of them .
negative	0 .
negative	usb plugged_into ieee port on the motherboard which would if used have caused damage to the motherboard .
negative	0 .
negative	mini speaker and usb 0 card not fitted to one motherboard just left in the packaging .
negative	0 .
negative	one pc had a plastic_bag of screws loose inside the box .
negative	if that had been left in there and the plastic had melted the metal screws would have fallen all over the internal components and shorted various items out .
negative	items 0 to 0 have now been resolved by the company .
negative	i have submitted photos to pc_specialist to back up these points and i am told they are being referred to the build manager .
negative	the upload photo feature is not working otherwise i would have included them .
negative	0 .
negative	one pc has_been cloned incorrectly such that it thinks that all data should be assigned to the d drive but that is the one assigned to the optical drive .
negative	we have suibmmitted a request for advice on this issue and are still in talks to resolve it .
negative	packaging , despatch and delivery service all of a high_standard .
negative	tesco lakeside is filthy and i often shop late at night to see and smell 0 or 0 members of staff smoking in the doorway at 0am
negative	i had an honest review on scs sofas removed for adding " avoid these_crooks " at the end which is neither offensive or obscene trustpilot seems to kow tow to the companies being reviewed !
negative	they have admitted to seining out fake solicitors letters and charged their customers for them .
negative	shame on wonga !
negative	£ 0000 reclining sofa delivered with a damaged motor .
negative	was told someone would be in touch but nobody contacted me and i had to call their 0000 phone number after 0 weeks of silence to be told nobody would even come out to look at sofa for 0 weeks .
negative	and a month later i ' m still_waiting for scs to respond with an offer of a replacement .
negative	have bought a couple of hotel breaks , when i have tried to book them , there have not been any suitable dates ( if any ) left .
negative	save your time and energy book through a hotel booking site and save_yourself a lot of hassle .
negative	probably the worst online company i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
negative	they don_'_t have the courtesy to inform you if they can '_t fulfill an order .
negative	it '_s virtually_impossible to speak to anyone on the phone and when you ' re asked to leave a message on their answerphone you can '_t because it '_s not working .
negative	finally , they have an inability to send you invoices and credit notes which they may one day live to regret if they are ever inspected by hmrc vat inspectors .
negative	ordered a full set of kit from them ( amp , tuner , picks , lead and a stand ) and eagerly awaited their arrival .
negative	after about 0 months of hearing nothing and when i contacted them being met with confusion over what i ' d ordered what they had received from the supplier and other issues i decided to cancel the order .
negative	this bit they were most efficient at .
negative	if they ' d shown the same level of organisation dealing_with my order maybe we could have done business .
negative	a most unsatisfactory experience and i won_'_t be ( not ) doing_business with them again .
negative	i would like to add that the individual people i spoke to were very nice and were not in any way difficult to deal with .
negative	the star_rating system does not allow for that distinction .
negative	it is rather a blunt instrument which assumes if you '_ve had bad service it was poor customer_relations .
negative	here it was just useless service but the staff were very nice about it !
negative	absolutely the worst internet experience of my life ..... avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	received goods wihtin 0 days .... goods turned_out to be faulty ... i sent it back at my cost ... they re - sent me the same item sprayed up ... which had the same fault as before .... avoid at all costs ... utter_rubbish rip - off merchants
negative	first i had to remind them that i put a order in after a week of waiting , then when my order was sent out it was not pack it was just trong in a box so when i open it there was not packaging just the good and part of the order the snorkel was damage ,
negative	i have not sent the snorkel back yet i will have to just write it off and buy i when at site as i do not have the time to wait for them to sand a replace out before my hols
negative	in december_0000 we purchased 0 leather recliners from this company , also purchasing an extended 0 year_warranty , for several months we have been experiencing back pain when using them which is obviously here the stuffing / padding is breaking down .
negative	as we had the warranty we contacted them , only to be told , not covered , read the small_print .
negative	i would advise people not to go_anywhere_near them , as there products are no good .
negative	we changed to first_utility in november_0000 on the basis that we could submit monthly meter_readings and monitor our usage .
negative	since then we have been unable to submit our electricity readings and have had to send them through via the ' contact us ' facility .
negative	we have been unable to monitor our usage of electricity as they don_'_t enter our readings onto our on - line account and , as a result , we haven_'_t been able to view any bills .
negative	we don_'_t know whether our direct_debit is sufficient to cover the charges and are worried we will receive a huge bill at some point - presuming they ever get to enter our electricity readings onto our account .
negative	we have tried_phoning their premium_rate number but are left_hanging on for over half an_hour and we eventually give up .
negative	the problem seems to be that we have an old ' economy 0 ' meter that gives two readings ( day rate and night rate ) and their website does not appear to be able to handle two readings .
negative	our rates are the same for both readings as we no_longer have ' economy 0 '.
negative	i have suggested by email that i add both readings together and enter them as a single reading but have had no response from them .
negative	they are totally_incompetent and appear to have no experience or skill in the energy industry .
negative	i will have to write a letter of complaint to them as it is the only way i can get through to them .
negative	if that doesn_'_t work i will go through the energy ombudsman to see if they can resolve the issues .
negative	do not go to them unless you are confident your situation is straightforward and they can '_t mess up .
negative	we ordered a semi - integrated dishwasher - the ordering_process was good , but the delivery process is another matter entirely .
negative	we organised delivery for the saturday of the jubilee bank_holiday .
negative	we then had a call from hiway ( the delivery company ) saying the van had broken down and that it would be delivered on sunday instead .
negative	i was frustrated at the breakdown , but impressed with the offer of a sunday delivery .
negative	come sunday and hiway calls again , " sorry sir , no delivery today as appliancesdirect didn_'_t actually send us your dishwasher , so it '_s not on the van ."
negative	i call and am told that customer service will be in at 0 on monday and can help .
negative	i called at 0 and am now told they ' re only there at 00 , does anyone at this company know what '_s happening ?
negative	so right now i have four things
negative	0 .
negative	a hole in my account balance having paid for a dishwasher
negative	0 .
negative	an appliances_direct website that claims said dishwasher is out for delivery
negative	0 .
negative	a delivery company telling_me that the dishwasher never arrived with them in the first place
negative	0 .
negative	a wasted four day break
negative	grrr
negative	in october_0000 , we found ( we thought then ) the furniture that we had been searching for ; reviews of ofl led us to feel that placing an order of £_000 + was worth taking a chance .
negative	a mistake we will not repeat elsewhere and most certainly never again with ofl .
negative	do not buy from this company .
negative	the after_sales care is non - existent .
negative	this is a reusme of what we experienced :
negative	order placed 0st november_0000 ; a delivery time of 0 months was given which we felt was a long time but the furniture was just what we had been looking for so we decided we could be patient a little longer ; after 0 months , we received an_email from ofl saying they had tried to phone us – a stupid lie when our phone displays missed calls and has an answer phone facility ; i called ofl , who advised me of a delay of about a month – no reason given .
negative	a month later , no contact from ofl – i called ofl ; they reported that they had no news on my delivery and would look into it .
negative	no phone_call was received .
negative	i also sent an_email requesting information ; i never received a reply .
negative	i went on to make 00 calls to ofl and was given a variety of excuses about the delay to my furniture , including : ‘ we ’ ve been badly_let_down by our suppliers but we are sourcing another_provider ’; ‘ its been put in the hands of the managers , they will call you ’ ( they never did ); ‘ we ’ ve got the bookcase but not the bureau , we wouldn ’ t deliver a part order ’ ( fair_enough except that in the end , neither item was delivered and i was told the book case had disappeared from the system ); ‘ the order is being shipped from china so it ’_s difficult to give an exact arrival date ’; ‘ the ship ’_s been delayed ’; ’ the warehouse is being relocated so the system isn ’ t showing what stock is available ’; i was even ‘ guaranteed ’ a despatch date at one point by one assistant , a statement which was described as ‘ inexplicable ’ by another assistant as ofl hadn ’ t received the furniture at that point .
negative	refunds were offered at various points but at the same time as suggesting the furniture we wanted was within sight which persuaded us to keep waiting ; an error in hindsight .
negative	we were finally told , 0 months from the original order , that the furniture had not been on the ship from china .
negative	the assistant made a great show of saying this was not the information he had expected and apologised – then had the audacity to ask if there was anything_else we might be interested in from the company .
negative	ofl seemed clueless about the progress of delivery and appeared chaotic in their administration and communication .
negative	i am staggered that i received only one phone_call from them yet made 00 .
negative	i am staggered that i received no letters or emails from the company of apology or explanation .
negative	the casual indifference of the staff made us think this was a frequent occurrence .
negative	the refund slip posted to us attached to an unsigned compliments slip says it all .
negative	they didn ’ t care .
negative	bought a brand_new jag xf ( great car ).
negative	staff at the lye dealership were friendly , smiling , warm and approachable when i was buying .
negative	when i had to sell back to them ( due to personal circumstances ) they were the exact opposite .
negative	cold , unhelpful , rude , and didn_'_t ring back x0 .
negative	instead they advised us to go to " their own " website and putt in the car details and we would be given a price .
negative	on completion and discussion with statstone lye they said " that quote is for an excellent condition car " and went_onto say in a particularly arthur daly fashion " who can say what excellent means ".
negative	needless to say they did not honour the website offer and made an offer far below the website quote .
negative	unfortunately we had to take the offer ( no choice ).
negative	xf good car - stratstone jaguar lye very poor customer loyalty and care - very dodgy website .
negative	beware of stratstone jag lye !!!
negative	!
negative	also contacted pendragon plc - what a surprise - no reply !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve used dpd in the past and have had nothing but first_class service .
negative	but how wrong can you be huh ?
negative	i ordered goods on friday_afternoon expecting it today .
negative	i even got an_email from my retailer confirming today '_s date .
negative	i usually get a text in the morning of delivery from dpd giving me a rough estimate within the hour of when my delivery was going to arrive .
negative	this was the feature that i thought dpd had over the rival courier companies .
negative	however entered my tracking_number online i noticed that my delivery was in the york delivery depot to be delivered tomorrow .
negative	after contacting my retailer about this they informed that my delivery had in fact gone to the wrong depot and that it is out for delivery tomorrow .
negative	dpd couldn_'_t even be bothered to inform me of their error .
negative	if i hadn_'_t contacted the retailer , like a lemon i would have waited indoors all day for a delivery which was never going to materialise .
negative	i cannot_fault the retailer and the after_sales service which they provided was very useful .
negative	just one final note .
negative	unlike_other courier companies , i discovered that i could only contact dpd via their email enquiry form .
negative	there is no contact number to talk to a real life human_being .
negative	in future i will be thinking twice on which courier company i wish to use .
negative	even if i have to pay that little bit more , the service has got to be better_than the problems i '_ve encountered from dpd today .
negative	i recently ordered an internal compact flash card_reader for a computer i ' m building .
negative	i ' d never used bt shop before and was hesitant in my order being successful if it was anything like their telephone service .
negative	at the time i placed the order it was late at night so wasn_'_t expecting the goods to arrive for at_least 0 days .
negative	despite the product only costing_£_00 i wasn_'_t given an option of paying a premium delivery charge for a scheduled day to prevent me from imprisoning myself at home for a few_days until it arrived .
negative	that was the first detail which didn_'_t impress me .
negative	a few_days_later i received an_email to say that the product i ordered had been discontinued and that my order had been cancelled and no funds had come out of my account .
negative	in a panic i contacted my bank to confirm that .
negative	i then contacted bt to ask why i was able to submit my card info to them for an item which had been discontinued .
negative	they said , and i quote , " it was a mistake ".
negative	minutes after i ended that phone conversation i searched on google for an_alternative company to buy this card_reader and who in my search results do i see selling the same product ?
negative	that '_s right .
negative	bt .
negative	they haven_'_t even removed the product from their website .
negative	so from my first and last shopping_experience with bt , do not buy from them unless you want to end up being disappointed .
negative	despite ordering something shown as ' in stock ' on the website and payment being taken immediately , it '_s now been almost two_weeks and still no delivery .
negative	their customer contact is poor - only after i contacted them and they took several days to reply and promised to get goods to me but after another week still_waiting .
negative	have now cancelled order and asked vredit card company to take action to recover money .
negative	do not deal with these shysters .
negative	i orded a new iphone0 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 , waited 0 days for the delivery but nothing arrived .
negative	then i got a email from leslie grant asking to email her a photo copy of the card i used to order the goods , a utility_bill , my driving_licence , and my passport .
negative	i then got a email from her saying she had contacted her dispatch team to handle my order in a priority basis , but still no phone .
negative	since then money was taken from my account and still no phone .
negative	if you ring up you have to wait up to 0 / 0 hour at_least before you can speak with some one . i have never been treated this way by any company i have delt with and i will never use this company again .
negative	the customer is not king at this place and they use your money to finance their compay .
negative	i was introduced from topcash and switched to npower back in november_0000 no cash_back left a ticket for them to reply and they say that npower should send commision over to topcash , npower state they have done this who do i believe just want what they said they would do .
negative	all bills have been paid could someone from cashback please chase this up .
negative	when a parcel is lost there is limited help and phone number is a premium_rate number .
negative	i have used them a great deal in the past but now a parcel is lost when i need their help they just are not interested in contacting you with updates .
negative	in fact i have found they almost avoid contact and then make it very hard to speak to them without it costing you a small_fortune .
negative	if you book with a courier they at_least then have a free number and a person to speak to who will help .
negative	i would avoid parcel 0 go
negative	ordered a 0000l bunded oil tank and after 0 days made contact with bhl to be told there is a delay .
negative	they claim to deliver in a week but mine took 0 weeks to arrive .
negative	then on appointed delivery date guess_what no show !
negative	waisted whole day at home on advice of delivery that never showed ..... not great .
negative	then when arrived came on small lorry that had had the tank loaded on via forklift but the tail lift was too small for tank to be lowered on so precarious balancing act in getting it off lorry .
negative	driver did all he could but clearly no thought when loaded such a large item on a small lorry .
negative	did not buy one single item from argos this christmas as nearly every item seen on the website cannot be reserved for store pick_up as out of stock not good enough and i went elsewhere
negative	i ordered a asus x00ca of this company , which i was assured that it would be delivered today 00 / 00 /_0000 anytime up to 0pm .
negative	after numerous phone_calls to yourselfs and being assured by your telephone operators it will be here by 0pm at the latest today no sign of the said asus_laptop .
negative	i honestly think the laptop was never dispatched or even existed and this company and thier subsidiary companys are completely false and thier nothing but a bunch of shysters .
negative	my advice is forget about buying anything from them and spend your hard earn , t money , with a honest reputable company , mr n . s cheeseman basildon essex
negative	ordered canon_0d body from this god - forsaken band of rip - off merchants on the 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	cancelled on 00 / 00 / 00 due to no effective response to my enquiries and despite automatic email assurances and promises i am still_awaiting a refund .
negative	i have reported them to bbc_watchdog tv programme , trading_standards office , my credit_card company and will also report them to the police .
negative	if they are a legitimate setup then i apologise but please prepare yourself for great stress .
negative	as someone commented earlier avoid_avoid_avoid at all costs .
negative	we ordered from [_link_] in broadgreen liverpool .. our order contained meals and soups .. the food was not hot and the soup had burst open all over the bag ,, i rang to complain and was told more soup was to be delivered .. no apology ... and soup did not arrive .. poorly run business .. i would not recommend it to anyone !
negative	i love just eat but will choose a different take away outlet next time ...
negative	update ... tried a different outlet .. jalalabad in liverpool .. waited nearly 0 hours but delivery man was apologetic and the food was absolutely_gorgeous !
negative	we had set meal for 0 with lamb korma .. massive portions .. couldn_'_t eat it all in one go !
negative	i would definitely recommend the jalalabad !
negative	thank_you justeat as we got 00_%_off via your site :)
negative	needed new inks for my hp photosmart c0000 printer , ordered two a colour and black one , thought i would give them a try as nothing ventured nothing gained , after ages i got the printer to accept the coloured one as for the black after two days of trying the printer would not accept it , maybe i was unlucky i dont know as i am not a printer mechanic , but without me saying it you can guess where i will be getting my printer_inks in future , and if they ask me to return it as i am_disabled there is no way , i buy many different things using my computer , i will put it down to experience , as the saying goes you get what you pay for ...

negative	i bought a fully enclosed shower from them it cost over £ 0000 it had two doors when the plumbers were installing it they found they had sent two left doors i rang them uo and they said we will send you the right door in a couple of days so the plumbers came back a few_days_later to put the right door in and i had to pay them a extra £_000 for the extra visit i contacted b and q and after lots of phone_calls over many days i got £_000 back
negative	spent an_hour argueing that the item i wanted to return was not medication , and i wanted a refund .
negative	they refused , stating it was medication and thats the end of that .
negative	be aware consumers , to check what you order is refundable before you part with your money .
negative	0 days of use and the fabric split .
negative	the company said it was not their responsibility and washed their hands of it .
negative	this is hard to believe when i still have a bean_bag from ikea bought 0 years_ago which is still completely intact !
negative	the product must be of very poor quality to break after 0 days of normal use , unless the split was already there .
negative	either way - i would have hoped for a more appropriate and helpful response from the company .
negative	i would recommend that you look_elsewhere for your beanbag purchase .
negative	unless you prefer spending hours or even days sitting on your bum waiting and wondering , doing the will they / won_'_t they ?
negative	stuff ... don_'_t use these_clowns .
negative	i booked a collection with yodel00 ( 00 .. 00_hours .. this is a joke believe me ) for monday .
negative	i waited in all day , nothing , looked at the on line tracking and at 0 :_00pm it said " van not ready ".
negative	mmmm .. read in to this what you may , i substituted van with yodel .
negative	re - scheduled for tuesday and waited in all day and ditto no - one came .
negative	rescheduled for wednesday and ( awww , you ' re ahead of me aren_'_t you ?)
negative	ditto .
negative	three days sitting around waiting !
negative	cancelled under dsr and booked it with <_external link_removed >, who turned_up promptly at 0000am , spoke english , and collected .
negative	to anyone who has got angry with a supplier who uses yodel , please don_'_t get angry with them .
negative	they , like me thought they were dealing_with a reputable company , and have been mistaken , taken for a ride and lost money on it .
negative	take my advice , don_'_t use yodel ( anything ), they are the one '_s who deserve to go out of business not the people who use them !
negative	ps , it says under here inform yodel about my review .
negative	why ?
negative	do i think they will care ?
negative	the stock_levels are hopelessly untrue or not kept up to date .
negative	in common with a lot of others , i ordered an " in stock " item , only to find out it wasn_'_t a day later , then after a few calls i was told the stock was going to be in , in a couple of days .
negative	then when that deadline expired , in another couple of days , then , when that deadline expired , another week .
negative	at that point i cancelled the order .
negative	if your item actually turns_out to be in stock you might have better luck , but you won_'_t find out till you place your order , then like me , you are stuck with it !!
negative	i wouldn_'_t bother personally with this hassle , there are better on - line retailers , e_- buyer , pixmania etc .
negative	the telephone_number for this company has_been disconnected or discontinued according to the bt message .
negative	they don_'_t respond to emails .
negative	is the company still trading ?
negative	we are still_waiting for an order placed on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the money was taken immediately .
negative	have set a dispute in train with the credit_card company .
negative	try 0000 000 0000 they will answer as gardeners world but it is the smae receptionist for about 00 companies including hip furniture all operating frm the same address , the receptionist can put you through to hip furniture .
negative	the parent company is called huan co uk
negative	i have sent a personal review of a company ( a very good one btw ), but for some mysterious reason , trustpilot published it as if it was written by my company .
negative	the transaction i was reviewing had nothing to do with my business and i have no_idea how trustpilot got so totally wrong about it .
negative	be careful with that company .
negative	we booked many extras for our holidays such as indoor garage at the hotel and return taxi service from the airport .
negative	the garage was not available at the hotel and they never send our reservation to the taxi company .
negative	when we called them we got a message that they would answer us in 00 seconds to be told after waiting on the line that their office was closed .
negative	i place my order on friday for delivery on saturday .
negative	the flowers didn_'_t arrive .
negative	sent email on saturday_evening .
negative	was ignored and sent another on sunday and still_waiting reply .
negative	as my daughters_birthday has passed and i have sent a bank_transfer so she can get her own i no_longer require your services .
negative	refund is the least i expect , she stayed in all day till 00 . 00 waiting .
negative	thanks for making it the day special for her .
negative	what a let_down .. avoid this company at all costs
negative	i bought 0 silver necklaces for my daughters .
negative	one turned_up and was bent !
negative	the silver was so flimsy that the necklace had obviously bent in transit .
negative	i phoned groupon straightaway and was told to email the company , sivercraft design .
negative	i emailed the company ( a uk email address ) and got a response from , i believe , poland .
negative	basically , they would replace but not refund .
negative	i telephoned groupon to explain that my issue was about the quality of the silver and said that a replacement would still be of a poor quality .
negative	groupon informed me that they vetted all suppliers and that no one else had complained !
negative	really !?!
negative	as a token of goodwill they offered me a £ 0 voucher .
negative	i offered to send them the necklaces to look at the quality but they said they were a voucher company and did not wish to see the goods .
negative	so customer service at groupon is pure lip service - they have your money and they do not care about the product .
negative	i am now left with 0 necklaces that i do not believe are fit for purpose .
negative	i will not be giving them to my daughters as i do not believe that they are safe .
negative	i will never do_business with groupon again and say to anyone interested in listening , beware what you buy with this company .
negative	the only word i can use is unscrupulous !

negative	ref_: avis rental_agreement number 000000000
negative	rentalcars 000000000
negative	i am writing with reference to a very serious complaint i have .
negative	i believe that fraud and deceit may have taken place and i will stop at nothing until i have received a letter of apology , my money back , compensation and assurances that such practices will be reviewed and changed where necessary .
negative	i had to make a trip to the uk with my prime purpose to visit my mother who had recently been diagnosed with cancer .
negative	on this occasion i had decided that it would be easier to rent a car and not rely_on trains etc .
negative	i wanted to find a cheap hire_car that was situated close to the south_terminal at gatwick_airport .
negative	my criteria was simply to get the cost as cheap as possible , and for it to be convenient .
negative	i had also asked for air conditioning due to the hot weather .
negative	my usage was going to be fairly minimal as i was travelling to kent and back , that is all , not a great distance mileage wise .
negative	i went online and the best website and price appeared to be through rental_cars .
negative	i called them , and they were very helpful on the phone and said that the best deal was with avis .
negative	i was happy that it was a name i had heard of , and i paid for the car by debit_card over the phone and i paid a little extra to reduce the excess .
negative	i was , at this point happy with the purchase .
negative	i arrived at gatwick and went to the avis desk …. and from then on it ’_s been a nightmare .
negative	the man on the desk seemed stern but all i wanted to do was show my passport and licence details and get on the motorway .
negative	the avis person insisted he needed a few details , he then asked me if i wanted to get the excess reduced by paying extra .
negative	i said i had already paid for this online .
negative	then , suddenly he said he needed £_00 . 00 held on my card .
negative	i asked why and he said this was for fuel in case i didn ’ t return it with fuel inside it .
negative	he then went on to say that this was the maximum amount i would pay if the tank was empty .
negative	i was getting frustrated at this point and i asked why this was not asked for on the phone as i would have paid by card on the phone .
negative	he tried to put the card_details through but it didn ’ t seem to work .
negative	he then said it needed a manual authorisation and did i have another card i could use .
negative	i said no that was the only card i had .
negative	reluctantly i persuaded him to call the card people , and after what seemed like a lifetime they eventually spoke to me , asked me a few security questions and authorised the payment .
negative	at this point by now 00_minutes of time had lapsed , and the avis man gave me a small piece of paper with a number on it and a reference and he said they had asked me to call them at some point but that it was not urgent .
negative	i said to him that i was not going to call them if it was a survey or something as i had already wasted enough time .
negative	( interestingly it was urgent , by the time i got to kent i had several missed calls from the fraud squad wanting to talk to me relating to possible card misuse , and they had put a stop on the card until i could confirm my identity etc_.)
negative	i will of course be speaking to the card company to ask why they didn ’ t talk to me properly when i spoke to them at the airport , however i suspect they may have a recording of what the avis representative said and his “ excuse ” for taking £_00 . 00 .
negative	every time i asked about this i was told that this was in case i left the car empty of fuel and that it was a holding payment .
negative	i was finally given the rental_agreement to sign and i queried the excess amount stated on there and the avis representative said that this was just how the agreement printed out but i would not have to pay the excess .
negative	finally i got in the car and was able to drive away , quite stressed after what seemed an unnecessary delay and rudeness by all involved , not a great first “ hire_car experience ”.
negative	however the car given was a nice citroen , despite not being the car i had paid for and promised .
negative	two days_later i returned the vehicle , well within the time allocation , i had thought there would be a garage close to the airport , but i didn ’ t see one .
negative	i told the guy this when i dropped it off , but said there was still three quarters of a tank left .
negative	he said no problem .
negative	to be honest i expected at some point to see a £_00 /£ 00 charge for fuel on my bank_statement .
negative	on tuesday the 00th_august i noticed £_00 had been taken out of my account by avis .
negative	first of all i must stress that i deem this to be theft and fraud .
negative	i called avis immediately to a man called barry granderson .
negative	barry was not rude but very very unhelpful and useless .
negative	first of all despite me making it clear that i would speak to trading_standards , the fraud squad , your directors and the media ( i work for the media ), he insisted he would not be able to respond for five days .
negative	totally_unacceptable .
negative	he then went on to say that i had opted for the pre_- payment fuel option and that i should have returned the vehicle as empty as possible .
negative	he then said i had signed a contract and i also highlighted that many people signed ppi insurance forms but that didn ’ t prevent them being mis_- sold too !
negative	this is despite my rental_cars agreement stating :-
negative	what you '_ll need to know
negative	fuel_policy - the vehicle is supplied with a full_tank of fuel .
negative	it should be returned full or refuelling charges will be applied .
negative	this being completely contrary to what baryy granderson told me .
negative	seven_days have now passed and i have received no communication from anyone and i have not received any payment .
negative	today i will be taking the following action :-
negative	• writing to your chairman expressing my concern
negative	• alerting various media including rogue_traders and watchdog
negative	• i will be posting this letter and details on the web
negative	• i will be contacting gatwick_airport authorities
negative	• i will be contacting rental_cars
negative	• i will be forwarding details to your trading body
negative	• i will be making trading_standards aware
negative	• i will be contacting the card authorisation company to question what was said to them and advise them what i was told .
negative	i await to hear from you please feel free to email me at mike . huston @ ymail . com or you can call me on 00000_000000 .
negative	furthermore if i have not received a satisfactory_conclusion to this matter by tuesday 0rd september_0000 then i will pass the matter to my legal team and ask them to vigorously pursue action_against you to recover my money , compensation , and all costs .
negative	i hope that you do care about your customer_satisfaction and your brand , my experience so far suggests not .
negative	mike huston
negative	website states ' less_than 00 in stock '; i '_ve been speaking english all my life and this means in stock not out of stock .
negative	i realize that zero is less_than 00 but don_'_t accept that this meets any form of trade description .
negative	dabs used to be a good & reliable retailer but i won_'_t be shopping there again and would not recommend that you do either .
negative	my experience : place order mid_afternoon on friday for in stock item ( less_than 00 ).
negative	get immediate_confirmation of order but then hear nothing .
negative	tuesday check state of order and discover that it '_s out of stock .
negative	check item on site ( still less_than 00 in stock ).
negative	cancel order and buy from amazon - cost £ 0 more ; item delivered friday .
negative	result ( my wife buys a pile of stuff on ebay on the saturday and it all arrives well before my item does ).
negative	really unhappy .
negative	the only good thing .
negative	no monies were taken so i didn_'_t have to chase for a refund .
negative	don_'_t switch to first_utility .....
negative	just read all of the reviews , and then if you still go_ahead and sign up with this appalling outfit you will have no one to blame but yourself . i made that mistake and still nearly five months on my issue is un resolved .
negative	they don_'_t give a sh0t about their customers .
negative	bought an item and had it engraved in same shop after about 0weeks the engraving was becoming illegible so took it back to my home town shop to have it rectified , but the person behind the counter spoke down to me as if i was a child so i sent it off to the head_office on about the 0nd of dec , and complained about the poor service i had received but 0weeks had passed without a reply so i then had to phone them to find out what the delay was and they apologized and said they were very busy but eventually sent me a refund , so from start to finish and from the bottom to the top of this company i have received a very poor and shoddy service , would i recommend or use this company again no !
negative	never !
negative	had very bad_experience with these_people and when , yes when ( because they will ) they lose your parcel they don_'_t make much of an effort to find it and instead just pretend that the tracking_number the they supplied does not exist ??????????
negative	?/
negative	hopeless !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	at the last_minute my wife decided to work from home on valetines and of course i had arranged for the flowers to be delivered to her office .
negative	appreciate that last_minute changes are at my risk but tried to email the morning of the 00th having been unable to get live_chat response .
negative	understand it might have been difficult to make the delivery address change even_though it was with a days notice but would really have appreciated some response , well in fact any response would have been good .
negative	disappointed
negative	ordered some garden trellisses for next_day delivery .
negative	they took the money , all 000_pounds of it but no next_day delivery .
negative	in fact no delivery at all .
negative	no address on their website .
negative	call them and you immediately get put on hold with music on an 0000 number .
negative	no answer .
negative	email them and you get an_automated message promising that a member of their team will contact you .
negative	they never do .
negative	old_fashioned robbery in the grand tradition .
negative	thieves .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	worldstores eventually got back to me yesterday .
negative	i cancelled the order and agreed on a refund .
negative	i have since received a text_message telling_me that the order i no_longer want is being delivered to me anyway .
negative	i am reporting this matter to trading_standards .
negative	our online order for 00 bottles of wine was due to be delivered 00th_december_0000 .
negative	we waited in all day .
negative	we are still_waiting !
negative	!
negative	tesco say their courier delivered it .
negative	but to whom and when ?.
negative	it certainly did not get to us .
negative	this is an ongoing dispute .
negative	at the moment i do not trust tesco !
negative	!
negative	sent my samsung_galaxy_note into regenersis under_warranty .
negative	the phone was sent royal_mail ' signed for ' at my own_expense and arrived and was signed for by someone at regenersis the following_day .
negative	a week_later i phoned regenersis to find out what was happening and they denied receiving it .
negative	investigation by rm parcels indicated that it had indeed been delivered as shown by the parcel tracking .
negative	the following_day regenersis claimed that rm had ' just delivered it '.
negative	royal_mail said no , it had been delivered as indicated the previous week and provided the complete tracking log .
negative	at this point i began to detect the aroma of fresh porcine pastry savouries .
negative	two days_later i phoned regenersis to find out what was happening .
negative	er .... nothing .
negative	it hadn_'_t been seen by their engineers .
negative	after another two days i phoned again .
negative	had my phone been fixed ?
negative	had anyone actually looked at it ?
negative	they were unable to tell me and no manager was available .
negative	then they cut me off .
negative	i must add that for each of these calls i spent 00 - 00_minutes on hold before being_able to speak to someone ; that was when i wasn_'_t cut_off by them .
negative	i think i was polite and composed however it is really beginning to get my goat .
negative	i need my phone for work and it has now been almost two_weeks .
negative	i still have no_idea what is happening .
negative	if someone from regenersis would like to contact me i would appreciate it as you '_ve totally failed to communicate so far .
negative	ironic for a company in the communications industry .
negative	00000000000 .
negative	i have given one star as i class being_lied to as ' rude_conduct '.
negative	total incompetence , poor organisation , poor communication , no structure for investigating problems , no - one taking responsibility and someone telling total porkies .
negative	i needed a second business line at home so contacted chess_telecom .
negative	the sales_guy was very helpful and signed me up no problem .
negative	customer service since then has_been utterly miserable .
negative	promised connection in 00 - 00 working_days .
negative	a month later still not connected and chess advised a minimum wait of three more weeks .
negative	i cancelled the contract and the embarrassed employee promised that the money they had already started taking by direct_debit would be refunded .
negative	since then , no refunds but plenty more bills !
negative	the latest one has just arrived , for £_000 !
negative	i have emailed and sent letters to no_avail .
negative	i am completely fed_up with chess_telecom and will be making a formal_complaint to cisas first thing in the morning to get this sorted_out .
negative	my advice is pay the extra with bt , as they may be more_expensive but they generally do what they say they '_ll do , when they say they '_ll do it .
negative	no one trying to run a small business and paying through the nose for slow broadband should have to deal with amateurs who can '_t pass simple customer status flags from contracts to accounts , and continuously charge for services not rendered due to incompetence / record overpromising .
negative	i bought two great looking bunches of flowers from this rip_off company to be delivered on weds before_christmas .
negative	one bunch has still not arrived on boxing_day .
negative	the other bunch was christmas tulips with thistles .
negative	what actually arrived was two bunches of white tulips that looked like they were on there last legs .
negative	( no thistles ) the tulips started dropping petals the day after delivery so went in the bin .
negative	after paying £_00 for two bunches of flowers to recieve one bunch of poxy looking tulips is a complete rip_off .
negative	i contacted the live feed for the company but after my initial reply to my complaint the live feed suddenly went off line after i asked for a full_refund .
negative	will give more detail when i have more time .
negative	return_journey .
negative	return flight cancelled as they wanted to triple the price after booking .
negative	they then double charged for the outgoing flight ( after refusing to refund me ).
negative	to prove this i had to send them a bank_statement .
negative	they refunded me one of the charges ( out of two ) without bothering to tell me or answer my questions so right now i have no_idea what remains booked and what doesn_'_t complete_joke .
negative	first got battery changed 0 years_ago - watch came back scratched and stop - watch function didn_'_t work .
negative	had it fixed elsewhere .
negative	went back today as i had the " lifetime_guarantee " for the battery .
negative	they were very rude and unhappy to replace the battery under guarantee but had to as i had the paperwork .
negative	cam back even more scratched and they haven_'_t closed the back propoerly - and this on a watch meant to be waterprrof to 00m .
negative	keep away if you value your watch .
negative	parcel was severely damaged in transit , to the extent that some of the contents were broken and had to be replaced , entailing a 000 mile_round_trip by my client , and my replacing the damaged goods .
negative	photo '_s of damage were supplied , but no offer of recompense or refund of charge .
negative	i waited in as given the hour_slot .
negative	usually they turn_up and give a good service .
negative	however today they did not turn_up , no calling_card , nothing .
negative	i read on there tracking site that they had called and i was not in , they had left a calling_card .
negative	i rang them , quite politely informed them that this was not so .
negative	they had the nerve to tell me the the van driver had called and left a calling_card .
negative	they claimed they had proof and had taken a photograph .
negative	i asked for this to be forwarded .
negative	surprise it was a picture of another house , no apology just an expectation that i would be in tomorrow and lose money waiting for them to probably get it wrong again .
negative	in august we purchased a hotpoint dynd0000 washing_machine .
negative	the weekend before_christmas it stopped_working mid cycle .
negative	we contacted " know how " that is a joke , we had to wait 0 days for an engineer to be told " oh we don_'_t carry that module as it rarely goes_wrong .
negative	left with a promise to ring his " mate " who has one on his van and would ring in an_hour . you guessed it , nothing .
negative	my husband spent up to an_hour on monday the day he first visited to get through to this know nothing depsrtment only to be told they would contact him to get him to contact us .
negative	a waste of an_hour and goodness know how much for the 0000 number .
negative	he rang again on the tuesday , waited for 00_minutes to be told that the module had to be ordered and they would contact us with a new appointment date .
negative	we rang this afternoon as we had heard_nothing but after 00_minutes of waiting he put the phone down .
negative	this so obviously how they keep their profits up .
negative	i am tearing my hair out with frustration , it has now been 00 days without the machine and god_knows_how much longer it will be .
negative	i emailed the customer_services ( there is no way you can talk to anyone in that department )
negative	and demanded a full_refund as i was sold an item " not fit for purpose " i am still_waiting .
negative	we are both disabled and cant lug bags and bags of washing to a launderette .
negative	at the moment i want to hit somebody , i am so frustrated and depressed .
negative	no matter how much you will save by buying on line dont !!!
negative	!
negative	any item where you may have to use the " knowhow " customer service line in currys or p . c .
negative	world whether bought in store or on line , don_'_t , don_'_t , don_'_t , if you value you sanity
negative	previous dealing was with the nottingham branch who i found more than helpful so there are a few staff that can do what they can .
negative	talktalk are not interested in customer_satisfaction .
negative	all they want is your money and they know every trick in the book to get you to part with your cash .
negative	their service is the most unreliable broadband service i have ever used .
negative	they make is very difficult to contact them if there is a problem ... especially by email .
negative	my speed never got above 0 mb and i was forever rebooting the router .
negative	their tech_support are just telephone operators reading from a card of instructions .
negative	after i cancelled my service , they called me at_least three_times a day and pestered me to come back .
negative	also pestered me with emails not to leave .
negative	the way they go about their business must be illegal !
negative	the following is a review that debenhams asked for , then rejected :
negative	" i purchased a red retro phone handset .
negative	the description said it would not only work with iphones , but any that had the correct plug size .
negative	i tried it on my phone ( sony xperia ) as soon as i received it .
negative	did not work , my phone rejected it .
negative	ok maybe my phone is special - oh well .
negative	the problem is that i called customer service twice , to return it .
negative	on both_occasions i was put on hold , then someone put the phone down on me !
negative	that '_s not the way to run a " customer service " team .
negative	now i ' m left with a handset i cannot use and the money i purchased it for is gone !
negative	i am totally dissatisfied with debenhams and have told at_least 0 of my friends about it ."
negative	this is what they had to say about my review :
negative	" there was a problem with your review "
negative	" thank_you for taking the time to write a review for red retro phone handset .
negative	your feedback is very important to us and other customers .
negative	unfortunately , your review has_been rejected as it was deemed to be a customer service issue .
negative	please contact our customer_services .
negative	we encourage you to review our guidelines and resubmit your review on red retro phone handset . "
negative	did they notice that i tried_calling customer service twice ?
negative	the next move was theirs .
negative	don_'_t you think they should have at_least apologized ?
negative	offered to contact me ?
negative	this is their standard " customer service ", lousy !!!
negative	the service gets no better in their stores .
negative	they ignore you , are not helpful and are snooty .
negative	it '_s like the staff think their to good to help you .
negative	charlie
negative	where do i start ?
negative	tried to verify my debit_card , so entropay deposited a small_amount in my bank ac .
negative	there was supposed to be a code - but no code showed in the bank a / c .
negative	cue ticket after ticket pointing this out to them .
negative	don_'_t bother , they '_ll just send boilerplate responses !
negative	oh_yeah , my debit_card was blocked by my bank due to ' suspicious activity ' ( due to the small entropay deposit during verification process ).
negative	rather pull teeth out with rusty pliers , than deal with this lot !
negative	a review for the main superstore in thetford , norfolk .
negative	for starters the food is usually mispriced .
negative	so there '_s an offer for a product , only to find out later that it hasn_'_t been applied !
negative	some of the staff seem quite rude ( both checkout and the shelf stackers ); i '_ve lost_count how many_times i '_ve been given dirty looks ( whilst minding my own business ), and being stared at .
negative	don_'_t the staff have to abide_by some kinda conduct when dealing_with paying customers ?
negative	ok . you need to speak to an actual human_being at natwest ?
negative	good luck with that one !
negative	the ' contact us ' page doesn_'_t provide a tel no , it just tells you to go to their useless ' ask a question ' page , which merrily churns out boiler - plate , generic answers ' till the cows come home ( at_least there '_s a picture of a nice young woman , which is assuring ).
negative	will close my account and look for a bank who aren_'_t afraid of advertising their tel no .
negative	this company is an_absolute joke - the sales staff are useless lazy arrogant bunch of shysters who can '_t be bothered answering the phone cos they know your call will eventually go through to a call_centre , i was told by the a person who actually rang me to discuss my complaint that " the sales managers tell staff not to answer the the phone if there are customers in the shop " !!!!!!!!!????????
negative	what a great customer_relations policy .
negative	he promised me a return call from the complaints_dept .- it '_s 00_hours waiting now .
negative	i hope i don_'_t die before i get that call .
negative	after_reading complaints here and on cpw '_s own website i am not even going to bother pursuing this complaint with this bunch of incompetent untrained , couldn_'_t care_less idiots .
negative	so their complaints policy " i couldn_'_t give a s ** t ." works !.
negative	obviously , more incompetent shambles - less pursued complaints !.
negative	steer_clear save_yourself a load of hassle .
negative	i have been ebaying for a few_years and switched to collectplus when rm changed their prices in april_0000 .
negative	i '_ve now decided never to use collectplus again after having 0 parcels smash , another thrown over the gate and left in front_garden ( clothing ) and 0 parcel had been tampered with - customer claimed that parcel ( mail bag - clothing ) had been slashed opened with something sharp .
negative	i have been sending pyrex for years with rm and have never had a breakage .
negative	i bubble_wrap really well , use strong boxes , pad them out and fill all voids ....... can '_t imagine what collectplus do with the parcels .
negative	i '_ve given collectplus too many chances and just can '_t take the risk any more - my ebay feedback is too important to me .
negative	the couriers and staff at the hub really need to take more care and until they can get that sorted i will switch to myhermes .
negative	i signed_up for giffgaff after experiencing double - billing hell with virgin , expecting something better .
negative	what i got was far worse !
negative	i was one of the unlucky ones who got caught in a website outtage so my recurring goodybag did not recur .
negative	there was no notification of this and i did not get some rather important emails i was waiting for .
negative	fair_enough , they do not claim to supply a business - strength service but an_apology rather_than a load of criticism of me ( the customer ffs !)
negative	and self - righteous gobbledegook would have been fine .
negative	not only did my goodybag not recur , but i was unable to top - up in any way on my account - so effectively they managed to brick my phone !
negative	through all of these hassles there is no one to call up and talk to - you are forced to use their stupid forums where idiots who do not know what they are talking_about and have nothing better to do spam you with useless and inane comments so they can get a few_pence off their next bill !!!
negative	or contact their agents who take 00_hours to respond and then give you an equally useless stock response which indicates they have not even read your question .
negative	when they finally do read it you will get a bunch of patronising garbage about how great they are and not much else .
negative	when my phone finally came back on line after three days i was told that my blackberry services ( yes , i know , sad isn_'_t it ) would take another few_days to resume , even_though i had paid for them , but they weren_'_t sure exactly how long ...
negative	i got on the phone to o0 - talked to a human - they had me sorted with a new account in 00_hours which has_been sweet ever_since and costs about the same !
negative	if it were possible to give negative stars i would give them a hundred - do not use them they are total c_** p !
negative	no fewer than five emails promised a delivery date which was not met .
negative	three emails claimed that goods had been sent when they had not been .
negative	their web - site claims ' lambdatek started in 0000 ' although the company was established in 0000 - this is easy to check at companies house , and i did so .
negative	this company provided the absolute worst customer experience which i have seen .
negative	company employees refuse to provide names of directors and no email_addresses are available .
negative	stay_away !
negative	this is the third parcel in a row that '_s taken ages to deliver . yes i too have the message on the tracking service , card left , which is never in my door , then next_day unable to find . my last parcel of knitting wool from turkey was in my local_depot the very next_day from dispatch . and then took 0 working_days to get 00 miles up the road . customer_services are rude and unhelpful , and my local_depot never answers the phone or replies to messages left . i have made formal complaints on their forms but never_heard back . in future i will find out who the seller will use to deliver my parcel before i buy .
negative	i ordered a bed 0 - 0 delivery no actual date specified waited in and it didn_'_t arrive , emailed , no response .
negative	telephoned day 0 , 0 and they couldn_'_t locate .
negative	delivery company phoned to say it was damaged .
negative	i ordered another same schedule .
negative	day 0 phone_call to say could they deliver , but we away from home , day 0 - 0 parts arrived without warning , one missing , phoned and they said one piece lost , phoned next_day , still lost and so i have cancelled the order after 00 days .
negative	now waiting for the parts delivered to be uplifted .
negative	staff don_'_t seem surprised and willing to accept situation , with one exception will , but nobody will pass my calls onto him
negative	bitterly disapointed .
negative	below is a letter i sent to the ceo of the company to which he has replied but not carried_out any of what he said he would do .
negative	dear_mr lindsay
negative	to say that i am disappointed would be a great understatement .
negative	i have just had to suffer 00_hours without electricity due to utility_warehouse ’_s non - existent out of hours support .
negative	this has come at a time when with a family funeral yesterday and having my daughter and 0 month old grandson staying with me ( both with heart conditions ), i was forced to try to find them other accommodation nearby due to the lack of light , heating and hot_water .
negative	the problem_arose because of a fault in the local sub - station which caused a surge that destroyed my meter .
negative	as this was after 0 :_00pm , it was impossible to contact anyone at utility_warehouse to ask for assistance .
negative	i contacted uk power networks which is our local electricity distributer and they came out and checked my main fuse and confirmed that electricity was back on and coming to the house but that the meter was disabled .
negative	my house was the only one in my street and even the whole village that was without power once the sub - station issue was resolved .
negative	uk power networks said that the meter was your responsibility and had to be replaced by utility_warehouse as the supplier .
negative	this left me in a ridiculous situation because utility_warehouse doesn ’ t have an out of hours service and so i couldn ’ t reach anyone to arrange for the meter to be replaced .
negative	i used my neighbour ’_s computer to search your internet and this is what i found .
negative	what should i do if i have no gas and / or electricity ?
negative	“ please call our prepayment team on 0000 000 0000 .
negative	they ' re available monday - friday 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 and saturday 0000 - 00 : 00 .
negative	if you require emergency advice at any other times please contact your local electricity distributor ”
negative	the electrical distributor is uk power networks , so i was back to square one .
negative	i have lost food in 0 freezers that are in the garage – our chest_freezer and one freezer full of burgers for a cub event that i am organising for 0 weeks ’ time and also lost food in my fridge_freezer indoors .
negative	i did show your distributor this last_night .
negative	additionally i have lost £_00 of credit on my key meter and key which has not been transferred to my new meter , and £_00 . 00 for a day i could not go to work , also the cost of 0 letters sent via recorded delivery .
negative	i find it unbelievable that there isn ’ t an_emergency contact point within utility_warehouse when something like this happens – the fitter who was eventually sent to replace the meter yesterday lunchtime said that he was available and on call the night before as lowie beck were aware of the situation with the substation fire .
negative	if i had managed to get hold of someone from uw he would have been able to replace my meter within 0 hours .
negative	instead due to your lack of duty of care i had to suffer 00_hours with no electricity and significant discomfort , hardship and stress .
negative	i think that it is a shameful situation that could so easily have been avoided if your company had only had an_emergency service in place instead of just relying on the other_companies .
negative	as they said it isn ’ t their responsibility !
negative	i telephoned your customer service yesterday at approx .
negative	00 . 00 lunch_time , i spoke to joy in prepayment , i told her of my situation and i asked that a manger call me back within the hour .
negative	it is now 00_hours after that call to your company and i have not received any phone_call whatsoever from your company .
negative	i want to know how i will be compensated for this horrific experience – i was told that the customer service would be excellent with utility_warehouse and my family and i have been scarred by this experience .
negative	i need to feel that somebody there cares_about what has happened .
negative	and i also think the thousands of your customers that put you in the position you are in are made fully_aware that if their meter goes_wrong ( as mine did through no fault of mine ) that they will have to ensure it is between the hours of 0am and 0 . 00pm .
negative	you have a major floor within your company which should never have happened and it certainly should have never happened to me and my family .
negative	my uw distributor was the only person i could get hold of and even he couldn ’ t help me because you had no out of hours contact .
negative	i look_forward to hearing from you .
negative	i have ordered replica chanel embossed crocodile flap bag and have never received .
negative	my friend ordered a replica bag too but received a very cheap children one .
negative	i am sure they have changed their name as i
negative	i cannot open their web_site , probable have few sites .
negative	never trust them untill you are paying by paypal .
negative	i arranged for city_link to collect a wheel / tyre in london on the 0th_december_0000 .
negative	their driver never made any attempt to collect & after being chased by the seller we arranged a further collection date for the 00th_december_0000 .
negative	true to form city_link didn_'_t turn_up on the 00th but did on the 00st_december_0000 .
negative	then the parcel just disappeared & i thought that i would be making a claim .
negative	hopefully the parcel will be delivered tomorrow , just one month after i arranged collection .
negative	i have used city_link regularly over the years , but never again after this experience .
negative	the recent change of ownership seems to have marked a deterioration in their service .
negative	i placed an online order with toolstation yesterday for delivery today .
negative	since i last ordered online , toolstation have switched from royal_mail to comedians yodel .
negative	the order which i required for tomorrow never showed up with yodel today .
negative	i have checked the yodel online tracking which is a joke .
negative	i have emailed toolstation & cancelled my order as i am not prepared to wait_until yodel get around to delivering to me .
negative	i will never again place an online order with toolstation & you out there now also have been_warned .
negative	i ordered a kartell componibili storage_unit from this ' designer living specialist '.
negative	i paid for it , waited for it to come and was very patient when there was a delay in sending it to the uk , where i live .
negative	in short , i have not received the item .
negative	there was ( apparently ) an attempted delivery one day when i was out at work .
negative	since then , i have emailed at_least 0 times a day to try and find out how i can receive it .
negative	they refuse to give me a phone number or contact details for the carrier service , dhl .
negative	when i tried_calling dhl uk myself , they said they were ' acting as a third_party ' and couldn_'_t help me , or give me any other phone number .
negative	ambiente '_s only reply is that i can ' collect the item from my next ( sic ) post_office '.
negative	when i responded asking where that might be , and whether they meant a dhl delivery depot rather_than the royal_mail , there was silence .
negative	since then i have received no reply to any of my communications .
negative	basically , they don_'_t want to know .
negative	they have my money and presumably , in the end , the item will get sent back to them .
negative	i ordered a collection for the monday , late_afternoon they cancelled on me , then re booked for tuesday , i spend an_hour on chat trying to explain i was not in tue and they should make it wed but i will be out after 0pm ( that '_s why i booked mon as i was in all day !)
negative	someone still came at 000pm to collect on tue after me saying we were out !
negative	then again someone came on wed !
negative	they said on monday they would upgrade it to a 00 hour delivery so i didn_'_t lose out !
negative	it took 0 days to get there , i called them asking why it wasn_'_t delivered they said 00 hour means 0 - 0 days ?????
negative	surly the clue is in the title ?
negative	00_hours ???
negative	on the thursday i contacted them again asking where my parcel was they said they don_'_t know but will let me know when they are ready , i said no , i need to know now !
negative	they said we will let you know , i was not happy !!!!!
negative	they never came back and let me know at all !
negative	stay_away from this company !
negative	unless you want nothing but hassle and problems !
negative	i contacted them again for a full_refund we were arguing back and forth for ages until they agreed to a partial_refund , it just wasn_'_t good enough !
negative	i spend 0 days trying to sort this out , over an_hour a day on the phone and on live_chat !
negative	bad service stick with [_external_reference_] go !
negative	chesstelecom were responsible for delaying our office move by fours weeks , even after we had factored in a " worst - case - senario " 0 month provision .
negative	after that we had three_months of invoice errors and have been waiting four weeks while the matter is investigated .
negative	in a nutshell ; calls are never returned , emails seldom replied to , " account managers " who could manage their way out of a paper bag and countless broken_promises .
negative	they describe this on their website as award winning customer service - i beg to differ .
negative	i liked the idea of hiring a long lens for a family safari , but unfortunately chose lenses for hire .
negative	the lens itself was poorly maintained , scratched and rattled and the results were less_than pleasing .
negative	unfortunately the worst part came after the holiday when threatening emails started to arrive claiming additional_charges .
negative	nearly a year on i am still being chased by them highlighting small_print in their t + c '_s and threatening even larger bills .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	bought a phone form them last november and today it wouldn_'_t turn on .
negative	so returned it to my local_store where i purchased it from .
negative	they out right refused to accept it as a faulty return , they gave me a phone number and said i had to return it myself .
negative	i explained to them that the whole reason i purchased it from a high_street store is because i wanted to be able to return it quickly if anything went wrong with it .
negative	he said that they no_longer accept returns as they cannot do anything with it and blamed it all on the network_provider !????
negative	i spoke to the manager and he said exactly the same !
negative	the phone is still under_warranty and i now have to return it to the manufacturer myself and deal with them .
negative	absolutely_disgusted with them and would recommend to anyone to steer_clear !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i booked car_hire which was reasonable price for weekend , arrived at designation was informed by the car_hire firm i did not require my booking info was upgraded and mis_- sold by the appointed .
negative	extra money was taken from my bank_account .
negative	addressed this immediately on my return with both expedia and the car_hire company appointed both would not accept the facts given and took months to even get that far with frequent opening and closing of the complaints_procedure which in itself is set_up to buy them more time to make it look like the targets on addressing complaints has_been achieved .
negative	informed both expedia and budget car_hire i and that of associates would never ever use either organisation again nor that of our associates , which i happy to report from last_year is successfully achieved .
negative	i booked car_hire which was reasonable price for weekend , arrived at designation was informed by the car_hire firm i did not require my booking info got an upgraded and mis_- sold by the appointed car_hire company which was budget car_hire .

negative	informed both expedia and budget car_hire i and that of our associates would never ever use either organisation again which thus_far i happy to report is successfully achieved and only hope it continues to grow in support .
negative	i got a nokia lumnia with vodafone in may 0000 .
negative	they gave me a test_drive on data which was why i got the phone , but despite_repeated calls to vodafone , it never worked .
negative	didn_'_t stop them upping my usage to 0gb though , and they charged me for it !
negative	i went abroad in december thinking i ' d have my phone , but two bills of over £_000 despite phone not working at all in second week of trip definitely put me off vodafone forever .
negative	can '_t wait for my contract to end so i can go_elsewhere !
negative	i can '_t believe anyone_else could be worse .
negative	where '_s the no stars please !
negative	ordered & paid for bathroom on monday 00th_feb , was told on the dispatch date , wed 00th_feb , that delivery company would be in touch within next 0 days .... still_waiting and this is day 0 !!
negative	i have tried telephoning better_bathrooms , was kept waiting with no reply for 00mins , i have emailed better_bathrooms customer_services and had no reply .
negative	had further orders to place such as tiles and accessories inorder to complete the room ... will be going else where .
negative	only reason there is 0 star is because i was impressed with the original advert and price !
negative	!
negative	my order 00000000 was for instore collection .
negative	received acknowledgement , confirmation and delivery notification but article was not at store when i called to collect .
negative	many calls and e_- mails not responded .
negative	still_waiting ten days_later .
negative	no updates .
negative	nothing .
negative	advise go_elsewhere .
negative	this company is on a downward spiral as far as service is concerned .
negative	why does this company not respond to emails and promise 00 hour turnaround when they clearly haven_'_t the capacity to do so ?
negative	i ' m wondering_if the good reviews are posted by friends ?
negative	my ref no ends in 00 - rotten apples .
negative	please send it back , i '_ve already wasted £_00 on a contract i haven_'_t been able to use .
negative	delivery was very slow , i had to contact them to find out about delivery .
negative	i couldn_'_t leave a phone message as the box was full twice .
negative	when item finally arrived it wasn_'_t suitable and they had the audacity to deduct 00_% from my refund .
negative	overall i was dissapointed and wouldn_'_t use them again
negative	we were waiting for a delivery that should have arrived two days ago .
negative	we checked the tracking_info on the hermes , or herpes as we call them , website .
negative	it showed " delivered to porch " two day ago !
negative	we don_'_t have a " porch ".
negative	after a thorough search of the garden , bins , patio we could not find anything .
negative	hermes /_herpes allow or want contact from their victims as they don_'_t care and their victims don_'_t matter to them .
negative	so we contacted the company from which we bought the item .
negative	one email and three phone_calls in n afternoon later we received a call from the shop .
negative	the lame_excuse they had received from hermes /_herpes was that the " regular " driver was off sick .
negative	the stand in driver had " scanned all their deliveries wrong ", whatever that means .
negative	so they had not in fact delivered the package .
negative	strange how we only received this admission from them after we complained and said we could prove no delivery had been made .
negative	we had checked our cctv for the day in question and no one had attempted a delivery !
negative	it has still yet to arrive , we have been assured it will arrive today .
negative	if we ' re lucky !
negative	in august we used hermes /_herpes to send an item we had sold on amazon .
negative	a the customer contacted us later to say they had not received it .
negative	we checked and found that the hermes /_herpes driver had delivered it by throwing it over a garden fence !
negative	my wife '_s seller status with amazon was downgraded as a result of hermes /_herpes shabby action .
negative	even_though we had done everything we could to sort it out .
negative	only after a direct email to jeff bezos , the owner of amazon , was my wifes status returned to it '_s former five_star_rating .
negative	we will never use hermes /_herpes again .
negative	we now ask every online seller we buy from who they use for deliveries .
negative	if they say hermes /_herpes we tell them they have lost a sale as a result and we shop somewhere_else .
negative	this uncaring , shabby , third rate , pathetic excuse for a delivery company don_'_t want to hear from their victims .
negative	their cowardly attitude means there is only one recourse . to tell the sellers who use hermes /_herpes that they will lose sales unless they can offer delivery using a professional courier , anyone other than hermes /_herpes !
negative	if enough people boycott these_cowboys then they will either go out of business or start operating like professional couriers !
negative	we have received terrible service from city_link over and over again .
negative	they seldom deliver next_day and very recently my parcel was just dumped in a farmyard about a mile away from our house .
negative	perishable goods were ruined .
negative	more often than not we have to do a 00 miles round_trip to collect goods which we have been urgently expecting .
negative	they are a total let_down and i would not advise_anyone to seriously_consider_using them for their business or personal requirements .
negative	i found buymobilephones through uswitch . com as a best deal on a samsung_galaxy 0 ,. the offer was for a free mobile_phone on a 00 month_contract but after asking for the phone to be delivered to my works address as i am not at home all day they asked me for £_000 deposit which would be refunded at the end of the contract !
negative	their customer service line took 00_minutes to respond to my call and you cannot contact them by email .
negative	i am sure that some customers are satisfied with their service but personally i would never even think about doing_business with a company like this .
negative	i bought 0 of their platinum collection to give as gifts later on in the year .
negative	when these items arrived in june_0000 , i noticed that they had expiration dates of july_0000 .
negative	so i tried to call them to complain , they have no number listed ( see other_reviewers comments_below ).
negative	when i did find a number online , i left 0 messages and no one returned my calls , so i resorted to emailing them .
negative	below is the response i received from their customer_services department , when i asked for a full_refund , because their items were short_dated .
negative	in fairness , i have no_idea what their chocolate tastes like as i still want to return it and get my money back :
negative	hello ,
negative	thank_you for your enquiry .
negative	i can advise that perishable items such as food stuffs are not covered_under distance_selling regulations .
negative	the only item we allow customers to return are our best of the best introductory selection .
negative	as you have not purchased this particular selection you are unable to return the items to us .
negative	any dispute raised with your card_issuer will be responded to with all evidence of these emails and exceptions to the distant selling regulations provided .
negative	i would also advise that peeta selection has a near 0 month shelf_life and the queenie selection nearly 0 months .
negative	i would not call this a short shelf_life .

negative	i wanted a canvas picture for my oh '_s christmas_present , and wowcher had a promo for just this .
negative	paid my money , got my voucher , uploaded the photo and feel i got stung on the pp , but a month later , no goods .
negative	i emailed wowcher two_weeks_ago asking how i go about chasing my goods , but no reply .
negative	today i have emailed again , but am giving up hope of getting the canvas in time for christmas which is one month away .
negative	i have lost out money i cannot_afford , and learned a lesson .

negative	wowcher - disappointed with the poor service from your provider and your customer_services
negative	my teenage_son is addicted to pizza and over the last few_months we have tried several pizzahuts in london '_s west end .
negative	firstly they lull you into_believing there '_s plenty of seats by having the visible part of the restaurant fairly quiet .
negative	when you enter they then direct you , dependent on the specific " hut " either upstairs or downstairs , where you then wait in a queue for a table .
negative	you then sit and wait for your order to be taken .
negative	then wait for your drinks .
negative	then wait for your starters .
negative	then wait for your main course .
negative	then wait and wait for the bill .
negative	these places have nearly made me lose the will to live !
negative	i complained to their head_office and got a voucher to use for another pizzahut " experience "... that one was all about waiting too .
negative	there '_s lots more to complain_about with regards to the staff and the staff attitude ... to be fair , the food is reasonable for this type of place .
negative	but the staff and loss of many hours of your life easily detract from that .
negative	i never received the goods .
negative	no refund and they said it could take 0 months only if goods were returned and then they would deduct the carriage .
negative	it is 0 weeks since i received only part of my order .
negative	i still have not received the refund for the products they didn_'_t have .
negative	mitesh soma , you should be_ashamed of yourself , taking money under_false pretences from the most vulnerable people in society , yes thats right - shame on you ......
negative	after a week when my order did not arrive i contacted medicanimal and was told my order had been delivered , eventually i was told it had been delivered to the wrong_address and it would be collected and redelivered .
negative	this never happened , my partner went to the address it was delivered to and was told it had been collected the same day , i was then told it had gone back to the warehouse as the bag was torn !
negative	i had to but food as i had not got my delivery , when i complained i was told to scan over the receipt which i did but still no sign of my refund .
negative	having spent over a hundred pound i am very disappointed with the service .
negative	i doubt i will use this company again , mistakes_happen but to be told two different stories does not give one confidence in the company .
negative	i did eventually receive my goods .
negative	made the mistake of ordering from wae_+ without researching first .
negative	i needed a particular motherboard to replace a faulty one that would accept my aging components .
negative	this was difficult to source which may have been responsible for my lapse in not googling wae_+ before ordering .
negative	ordered on 00 june for delivery by 00 june that seemed quite reasonable .
negative	the 00 june came and went .
negative	wae_+ website said my order was " awaiting fullfilment ".
negative	it was obvious it wasn_'_t in stock so i cancelled .
negative	wae_+ replied they were expecting delivery within 0 - 0 working_days and would i like to wait .
negative	i confirmed my wish to cancel .
negative	after 0 days i enquired where my refund was .
negative	aftr 00 days i informed wae_+ if i did not receive it within the next 0 days i would be contacting my credit_card company .
negative	the reply was that under their terms and conditions they had 00 days from date of cancellation to refund .
negative	under the distance_selling regulations refunds should be made as soon as possible and no later than 00 days .
negative	funny that .
negative	i bid my time and waited for the 00 days to expire which they duly did .
negative	after 00 days i informed wae_+ that if i did not receive my refund within 0 days i would initiate a chargeback through my credit_card company .
negative	after 00 days i received my refund and a very polite apologetic message giving the impression my difficulties were abnormal .
negative	the forums tell a different_story .
negative	the message included the following sentence : " we really do value our customers and your custom and look_forward to continuing our relationship in the near_future .".
negative	frankly if wae_+ were the last woman on earth i would turn homosexual .
negative	conclusions : wae_+ advertise products that are not in stock .
negative	wae_+ give delivery dates for products that are not in stock .
negative	wae_+ will delay refunding for as long as possible .
negative	i very much suspect that if i had not paid by credit_card i would still be waiting for my refund .
negative	it appears that delaying refunding as long as possible is part of their business plan .
negative	- good for their cashflow .
negative	do you really want to deal with this company ?
negative	i love talent shows .
negative	why do we have to sit and listen to all the drivel and hype and be spoon fed opinions from talentless know it all judges .
negative	i want to listen to the acts they should be heard .
negative	so i don_'_t watch any more .
negative	change the format before you kill simon cowels golden goose .
negative	who do the judges think they are .
negative	do they really think we are stupid enough to believe these judges know what they are talking_about .
negative	i and others with no musical experience can pick the talent with a lot more creditability than these judges .
negative	lets have a talent show for judges and see how far these four go .
negative	if the adverts don_'_t work they won_'_t advertise .
negative	then no more company and no more brainwashing .
negative	how dare they interfere with my brain .
negative	it is a disgrace .
negative	i take great umbridge to being subjected to these awful television adverts that are only there to imprint those numbers into your brain at the exclusion of other good companies that cant_afford the advertising .
negative	we were meant to have free competitive companies but this company have successfully killed of the opposition .
negative	now we pay for an over priced service that should be free .
negative	dreadful company to deal with .
negative	poor after_sales , badly written contracts designed to mislead and hide the pitfalls .
negative	misleading advertising .
negative	dont know anyone who has a good experience .
negative	mine was not a good one and would never use again .

negative	impossible to use the free with with any useful result .
negative	waste of time
negative	throw them in the bin not out of the car window .
negative	foxes and birds get run over and killed trying to eat them .
negative	better still don_'_t buy them .
negative	save your money for something edible .
negative	lousy service lousy food
negative	not worth the bother
negative	yes that '_s what the sign said on new years day at poole branch when i was taking my non working newly purchased laptop back and that is exactly_what my experience of their after_sales service became .
negative	wo for me and wow for them .
negative	playing ping pong with a laptop .
negative	in the end i gave up trying to get them to admit it was faulty and paid for a repair elsewhere .
negative	the last place you should ever shop in .
negative	the laptops might look the same as you buy elsewhere but inside they are built with substandard parts .
negative	beware go_elsewhere
negative	no christmas spirit from them .
negative	no free listings this month .
negative	they now take 00_% of your money .
negative	the poor that sell the poor that pay .
negative	one bad customer and your reputation is ruined .
negative	buyers get protection .
negative	sellers get none .
negative	sellers pay the fee .
negative	buyers pay none .
negative	sellers sell none .
negative	buyers buy none .
negative	ebay gets none .
negative	perhaps then they will review their fee '_s
negative	they used to be cheap and good value .
negative	went there recently intending to fill my shopping_basket with all the items they sold cheaper_than tesco '_s .
negative	not any more though .
negative	came out with only 0 items and then found cheaper equivalent at tesco .
negative	i was amazed as in the past you could fill your basket with gay abandon .
negative	i think they are now trading on that reputation and joining the band wagon of rising supermarket prices which are catching people out because we seem to just accept that prices have gone up everywhere .
negative	well they have gone up a lot at aldi and far more than the others .
negative	i call this sharp_practice and have no confidence to shop there any more .
negative	sainsbury '_s or tesco '_s for me from now on .
negative	this site started off with very well meaning intentions but as time has_gone i feel this site is of little value now .
negative	developed into a cash cow portal for martin_lewis '_s entrepreneurial ambitions .
negative	the content has very little meaningful value and it is not possible to influence this by way of dialogue .
negative	martin is far to busy for that .
negative	searching for answers to real problems results in no practical advice of substance .
negative	fine till they lose a parcel .
negative	then the nightmare begins .
negative	i will never use again 0 days on live_chat getting nothing but appeasement and lies .
negative	they even apologised for lying .
negative	what a cheek .
negative	lost out big time .
negative	never again
negative	as an update i have now been contacted by [_name ] by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
negative	she was very apologetic and i am going to use parcel0go again but definitely not hermes .
negative	[_name ] said parcel0go are carrying out a full investigation and if they find the parcel as well as the refund they will send the parcel back as well .
negative	this would be a good outcome and i will then remove this review and write a new review that reflects an excellent company that acts in an honourable and ethical way .
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to [_private data ] in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning [_private data ] this may cost 00p_per_minute .
negative	used this company many_times without to much bother .
negative	i got lulled into a false sense of security .
negative	now they have lost my parcel and i am out of pocket , lost a good customer got bad feedback spent 0 days so far trying to sort_out .
negative	customer_services is a complete wind up .
negative	if you think hermes is bad try booking through parcel0go .
negative	now that is the biggest wind up i have ever had .
negative	one bad_experience with either of these companies will fill you with enough hatred to last a lifetime .
negative	don_'_t think " it will not happen to me " because it will .
negative	then you also will experience the nightmare and no what i mean .
negative	i wish i had paid the extra and gone elsewhere .
negative	don_'_t get caught_out .
negative	you have been_warned .
negative	as an update i have now been contacted by jenny bowles by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
negative	she was very apologetic and i am going to use parcel0go again but definitely not hermes .
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to j . bowles @ parcel0go . com in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning 0000 0000000 this may cost 00p_per_minute .
negative	never buy anything from merlin_cycles .
negative	i bought new avid brakes and they arrived leaking brake fluid .
negative	merlin_cycles tell me that it ’_s normal , but anyone with half a clue about bikes knows that to be rubbish .
negative	they also told me i ’ d have to pay to send them back , but i found it simpler to buy a service kit from elsewhere that solved the problem .
negative	my order was placed from your website for tyres to be delivered to ****.
negative	having received notification today from dpd the tyres have been delivered i contacted **** to arrange fitting but they confirmed they have not received the tyres .
negative	it transpires the postcode for **** on your website is wrong rm0 @@@ it should be rm0 +++ and my tyres have been delivered to an unknown location !
negative	i am really very annoyed about this , i feel an_immediate_refund should be made to me as i am not about to go hunting for tyres that have been wrongly delivered because the information on your website is wrong .
negative	you can contact me on *******
negative	i have now spoken again with the proprietor of ++++ and he has kindly been out with his satnav to see if he could locate another business the tyres may have been delivered to in the piostcode ???
negative	?, the code relates to private houses !
negative	quite why dpd delivered to a private house when it clarely should be going to a business is beyond me but the postcode came from your website so it is ultimately your problem to address .
negative	i will now have to seek tyres from somewhere more trustworthy , please issue an_immediate_refund and confirm .

negative	hello
negative	i ' m looking into it and i '_ll let you know asap
negative	best regards ,

negative	thank_you oliver ,
negative	i need to source tyres now from somewhere_else - i haven_'_t received the ones ordered from tyreleader so please issue a full_refund and confirm .
negative	thank_you .
negative	regards
negative	m
negative	the investigation is under way .
negative	please send over a joint statement with the garage that none of you you have received the tyres .

negative	oliver m
negative	0 hours
negative	this is preposterous !
negative	i have told you i haven_'_t received the tyres i have also confirmed on here in writing that the fitters have not received the tyres , i can do no more !
negative	i have never dealt_with a more obstructive and unhelpful outfit , this will be put under my comments for all to see .
negative	the way i am being treated by tyreleader is a disgrace !
negative	it is not up to me to sort_out problems you have created !
negative	i repeat - i have not received my tyres , nor has your designated fitter per the ( incorrect ) details taken from your website .
negative	i want an_immediate_refund i am entitled to under the sale of goods_act .

negative	mike ,
negative	if you wanta solution to this problem , please send me over a document as requested .
negative	in pdf form .
negative	best regards ,
negative	you know this is not possible , how can i get someone_else miles from where i live to write on and sign a piece of paper for me to then send to you ?
negative	this is your error , i have paid and you are keeping my money under_false pretences
negative	i will now deal with the matter through my credit_card company
negative	your company and behaviour are an utter disgrace and will be reported - my transript will be available to all .
negative	having been an existing customer of this company i decided to use them for a vet prescription purchase ( to avoid the 000_% mark up at the vets as its long_term medication ) i understand they cannot dispense meds without the hard copy prescription so posted 0st_class on sunday expecting at the very latest tuesday receipt ?
negative	i paid for my order on the sunday and therefore expected my order to be prepared ready for the prescription receipt which was marked urgent complete with order number to avoid any delays in matching it with my already paid for order .
negative	i also emailed daily sometimes twice to ensure vetsuk got the message i needed the medication urgently for my sick pet .
negative	there is no phone contact listed !
negative	they responded to each email_saying they had not received my prescription through the post until thursday ( 0st_class mail ???)
negative	i wish i had got signed for at the post_office but didn_'_t think necessary at the time ?
negative	i received an_email friday to say that my order ( several other items have been ordered ) was due to be dispatched .
negative	i rang them after receipt of the invoice showing a telephone_number .
negative	i complained about the length of time it had taken to dispense and despatch my urgent order and asked them to upgrade to next_day which meant saturday delivery ?
negative	they dont do weekend delivery using dpd !!
negative	i am still_waiting for the delivery and have had to sort interim pain relief .
negative	never again will i use this company they could have helped_me by ensuring my order was dispatched quickly with all the contact i have made but they just didn_'_t care !!!
negative	!
negative	having shopped on the internet for years i got caught_out buying from this supplier after checking their " excellent reviews "????
negative	ordered an ipad on 00 / 00 / 00 showing in stock , 0 / 00 days delivery , credit_card debited immediately !
negative	suffice to say , no goods arrived after several emails of promises , can '_t get through to helpline , always in a queue .
negative	i have finally cancelled the order 00 / 00 /_0000 and would rather pay more and get the goods immediately from a reputable company .
negative	i was offered a screen_protector and upgraded delivery ( laughable if not infuriating ).
negative	am awaiting a refund although i have already contacted my credit_card_provider to put the sale in dispute ...
negative	i will also be looking to report to trading_standards .
negative	asked to cancel coconut chair after delivery was postponed same as everyone_else on this site !
negative	someone called and said i couldn_'_t cancel until the 00 week delivery deadline .
negative	i asked then that someone give me a call back at 00 weeks .
negative	they did call me back and confirmed that yes i could now cancel the item and that i would get my refund within 00 days .
negative	i know , this is probably the same conversation that a lot of people have had with them and no refund is forthcoming .
negative	i am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and see what happens in 00 days .
negative	will review again in 00 days !
negative	wanted to update my review to say that my money was never forthcoming in spite of customer_services saying they would chase the finance department .
negative	got in touch with barclaycard who have refunded me the money and will be pursuing infurn to get their money back .
negative	if you paid on credit_card do get in touch with them as they may be able to help .
negative	how does a company like this stay in business .
negative	they take your money and never deliver the goods .
negative	i placed an order on 0st november .
negative	after a month started to wonder where the canvas was and what was the problem .
negative	called their offices and was told it would be sent in the next few_days .
negative	next phone_call was told it had left their offices and was on its way .
negative	never arrived .
negative	called again and was told will be sent out in few_days .
negative	asked for someone to call me back as i wanted a refund as i didn_'_t believe a word of what they were saying .
negative	of course nobody called back and have had no refund .
negative	if you are considering using this company don_'_t .
negative	there are companies out there who are a pleasure to deal with and deliver what they say they will .
negative	this company is not one of them !
negative	booked top price tickets back in september , 0 month before event informed that my seats are no_longer available and i have been moved to alternative seating which are 0 block further away and also in a different price bracket .
negative	i phoned and emailed them regarding this but they insist the tickets are of the same value , even_though if you try to book on their website the block i have now been allocated is £_00 . 00 cheaper_than what i originally paid !
negative	now with one week to go they say that they are unable to help me further and if i am still not happy to contact the promoters , this is a complete_joke .
negative	i will now wait_until i attend the concert and see if i can sort anything out then , but i will never use this company again , complete_shambles .
negative	may i also point out that this has happened to my friend for a different concert , booked great seats and then moved to just ok ones , i am beginning to think they sell the best seats and then move you so they can sell the good seats again !!
negative	avoid if you want a hassle_free booking .
negative	had used before and was quite pleased with service .
negative	however my recent order to my aunt who has terminal cancer was appalling and embarrassing .
negative	this was a gesture supposed to cheer_her up but firstly , the bunch arrived a day after they were due to be delivered with no apologies .
negative	secondly , i decided to upgrade to a medium - sized version of bouquet i had sent before .
negative	this time , the bunch that arrived was smaller than the standard size sent before , wilting and dying by the next_day .
negative	their site guarantees 000_% customer_satisfaction - don_'_t be_fooled !
negative	customer service was disgraceful !!!!!!
negative	thinking they would be horrified about this delivery and falling over themselves to correct this situation , i emailed their customer service with proof by way of photo my aunt had sent and requesting a replacement .
negative	00_hours_later got a reply which i can only think is automated because it did not address the question of a replacement .
negative	after sending out another 0 emails - and a 00 hour wait for a reply appears to be the minimum waiting period for a reply , i telephoned and was asked to send the photo again directly to the person i was speaking to .
negative	finally was told that having looked at the photo with her supervisor - nothing could be done because as far as they were concerned the flowers were alright .
negative	asked to speak to the supervisor who was conveniently out and left my number for her to contact me .
negative	never did !
negative	!
negative	i have never written a bad review before but really feel i should alert anyone wising to use this service don_'_t !
negative	i wish i could upload picture as proof but suffice to say a bunch from outside a garage would have been better value and less embarrassing .
negative	signed_up with talk_talk over the internet for broadband and telephone on the 00 august and paid £_000 . 00 line_rental up front by debit_card .
negative	received a confirmation_email on the 00 august advising me the my service will be up and running within 00 days , 0 september received my september bill for zero , tried to log onto my account on the 0 september to get an update , could not log on so rang talk_talk and spent 00_minutes trying to explain i could not log on to my account , only to told i had a credit on my account of £_000 . 00 and my account had been deactivated ?
negative	asked to speak to a manager who eventually explained that talk_talk could not provide me with the service , something to do with my local exchange .
negative	ok only 00 days wasted , no email from talk_talk to tell me that they could not provide the service , just please refund my £_000 . 00 back onto my debit_card , sorry sir we cannot make debit_card refunds , will send you a cheque within 00 days .
negative	so t t take my money for a service they cannot provide , give me every indication that the service will be activated within 00 days , send me a bill , but don_'_t bother to tell me they cannot provide me with the service and then expect me to wait up to another 00 days for a cheque that i have to drive 00 miles to the the bank to pay in and then wait another 0 days for it to clear , so in total tt can hold on to my money for up to 00 days , how many people are they doing this too .
negative	to make_matters worse i was told i was not forced to pay the line_rental in advance , then told i could have the service if i paid for a new line , another £_00 . 00 please , i checked the possibility of this with tt sales and was told it was impossible .
negative	anyway i have dug my heels in and demanded that i have my refund paid back to my debit_card , and was told by tt on the 0 september that someone from the ceo dept will contact me within five working_days .
negative	would you believe it september 00 and no contact , so i call tt again put on hold again , only to be told ceo has a bit of a back log someone should be back to you within the next two days .
negative	one could be forgiven for thinking this could be a way to make a little more profit , entice potential_customers with attractive offers and discounts if they pay in advance and then hold on to the money for as long as possible if they cannot provide the service .
negative	i run my own business so am used to dealing occasionally with idiots , and people that try to take_advantage , but what about all the people that get bullied into excepting excuses , and fobbed_off .
negative	i await your reply talk_talk
negative	i organised for a parcel to be collected from my home near southampton to be delivered to cornwall on a next_day service .
negative	the parcel was packed and awaiting_collection and my daughter waited in all day .
negative	by 0 . 00 pm it was still_awaiting_collection .
negative	at this point i tried searching the internet for a customer service telephone_number to find out if the collection was due to happen .
negative	it seems impossible to find a number .
negative	i then tried the tracking_number which told me the parcel which was still in my hall awaiting_collection had been delivered to glasgow !
negative	i then had to drive to the nearest parcelforce depot to send the parcel to arrive the next_day .
negative	fortunately for me the cost was half that of parcel0go but i now have the problem of trying to obtain a refund from a company that you can not speak to !
negative	very poor service
negative	the company ... horrid
negative	ordered an item and never came told to wait 00 days before anything could happen .
negative	i ordered dog boots and dog blankets for over £_00 .
negative	i received a message to say the boots were not in stock ; however , they were debited from my account and in spite of a promise to refund , they were never refunded .
negative	i returned the dog blankets as the sizes were wrong .
negative	however , i have never received a refund for my returns , sent by royal_mail recorded delivery .
negative	the website does not give a phone number or email address for the company .
negative	it can only be contacted by its own contact form .
negative	in short , they make themselves rather unreachable .
negative	i agree with the other reviewer that the website looks very professional but the actual service does not back this up .
negative	i have contacted them again to ask for my money back .
negative	if i do not get a refund , i will contact trading_standards about this company .
negative	i would have liked to review the quality of the flowers but my order never arrived the tracking_system said they were out for delivery and could arrive any time up to 0pm so wheh this all fell through i had no time to find any alternative .
negative	surely a company specialising in the delivery of flowers should know the importance of meeting delivery commitments and they must have known that 0hey were going to let me down whattever the reason was , but no one bothered to contact me and give a reason . i can only suggest if you have a special_occasion you want to celebrate with flowers chose a company that cares_about its commitments
negative	i saw what looked to be a great deal when i was looking to service my mazda for full service and mot .
negative	a quick search on google_search_engine and up popped service stop winners of dragon '_s den !
negative	impressed ?
negative	car was picked_up as arranged would be returned between 0 and 0 pm .
negative	we will contact you if there are any_problems , so far so good .
negative	! 0 : 00_hours phone_call from service stop " we have sent you an_email with a pro forma invoice ", " ok i will have a look ad get back to you ".
negative	to my horror i find that there are a few jobs needed to be done to get it through the mot 0 .
negative	cut in tyre at off side rear cost to repair £_00 . 00 +_vat £_000 .
negative	0 , the other 0 tyres have nails in them ?
negative	£_00 headlamps too low £_00 to re set them .
negative	brake discs worn and pitted £_000 ...... windscreen wiper not clearing windscreen properly the list goes on ..... total_cost £_000 . 00 !!!!!!!!
negative	phoned them back and told them i will get the work done elsewhere and just pay for the service and mot greed £_000 as they wont release the car until you have paid !!
negative	i paid by credit_card and waited for it to be brought back at the agreed time .. 0 to 0pm it got to 00 : 00 no sign of car ring them .
negative	" stuck in traffic " 00 : 00 where is my car ?
negative	" round the corner ."
negative	with you soon .
negative	00 : 00 where are you with my car !
negative	i ' m going to ring police my car has_been stolen !!
negative	oh the drivers just leaving the garage now ' darling ',!
negative	now they are lying and patronising me !
negative	car finally arrives at 00 : 00 i ' m fuming .
negative	poor driver got the brunt of my anger ( he only collects and delivers )
negative	i went to get tyres checked .
negative	0 needed_replacing .
negative	lights were ok as were the brake discs the wiper needed adjusting .
negative	but i got it replaced total_cost for all this ..... £_00 took it myself to the garage service stop had taken it to and it passed .
negative	i told them what i thought and as a gesture of goodwill they cleaned the car ( which should have been included anyway !)
negative	had i been less assertive i could have been conned into getting un necessary work done at an extortionate cost i will_definitely not be using them again i will however be contacting_trading_standards !!
negative	steer_clear
negative	halfords in slough mill street
negative	booked tyres on line and found a good price .
negative	chose halfords auto centre slough for the fitting , not the farnham road one as i had experienced bad service there in the past .
negative	big_mistake . i thought that they were all seperate and run as a franchise service .
negative	yhey are one company that i will never use again .
negative	i was kept waiting even_though i was booked in for the tyres to be fitted .
negative	i could see the tyres stacked in a corner of the depot .
negative	they were not touched as job after job was done before mine .
negative	i complained and was given the usual , they will do it next line .
negative	never again will i use any halfords
negative	have been a loyal_customer of orange for many_years , yet when i have a problem customer_services don_'_t want to know .
negative	i am very seriously_considering moving to another_provider , orange has_gone so far down in my estimation .
negative	from the very rude person in an orange shop to being told that my problem will be sorted_out , what they didn_'_t say was ' when they will be bothered to help resolve this problem '.
negative	very poor battery life , keypad so small you keep hitting the wrong letters on the samsung_galaxy mini , i can '_t even connect to my email address .
negative	bad customer_services , my score would be 0 / 00 .
negative	bifocals ordered .
negative	arrived fairly quickly ( 0 weeks ).
negative	second day glasses fell_apart .
negative	phoned company - no apology .
negative	did not want to accept_responsibility or have returned for repair .
negative	eventually agreed .
negative	posted specs guaranteed delivery .
negative	company claimed not arrived - despite guaranteed delivery .
negative	took a further 0 weeks of constant emails / phone_calls to chase .
negative	company repeatedly told me glasses had not arrived .
negative	after 0 weeks , suddenly they were found !
negative	so they were trying to fob me off .
negative	glasses returned fixed .
negative	no refund for postage .
negative	no apology .
negative	glasses are cheap product .
negative	side pieces keep wobbling about .
negative	very unsure these will last very long .
negative	poor product / terrible attitude to customer service .
negative	avoid this company .
negative	customer base in india dont understand you , value for money 0 star customer 0 star .
negative	i have been waiting for my order to be processes for 00 days now and it still has not been done .
negative	when i link on to website my order is saying in progress .. it never gets any further .
negative	i have emailed loads of times and just get fobbed_off with " i will look into why the delay ".. but no one ever does .
negative	their website says 00_% of orders despatched within 0 days ..
negative	this is one big joke !
negative	i am still_waiting for my order to even get to the quality_control dept .. never mind being shipped .
negative	buyer_beware ...
negative	this company is rubbish .
negative	they take your money and order ..
negative	the leave you waiting .
negative	don_'_t waste your money .. buy elsewhere
negative	speedtester works ok , but when tweeting results , the url link to the results takes you to a page not found and the not results page .
negative	my experience was awful and i will not trust hotel info again !
negative	!
negative	had to pay extra 00 pounds to have pedal redelivered , and poor customer service from guitar_guitar {(
negative	ordered money on internet got confirmation_email went to pick_up and was told they had no money ..
negative	euros !
negative	!
negative	complete_waste of time with a bad attitude thrown in for free .
negative	ps
negative	don_'_t bother going to their customer service as will put you in an online queue for ever and there is no email address either .
negative	00 months_ago i paid £_000 for a phone that is now worthless and does not work .
negative	this is how it happened .
negative	i bought a samsung_galaxy 0 through amazon_marketplace at end february_0000 .
negative	at the time i was surprised that the supplier didn_'_t provide a vat receipt .
negative	i queried it and was fobbed with the answer that the only document available was the amazon ' final details for order ' document - which specifically states that it is not a vat receipt .
negative	amazon customer_services were little help , referring me back to the marketplace supplier every time .
negative	so far so bad , then last saturday , 0st feb_0000 the phone developed a fault with the display .
negative	i took it to my local samsung approved repair_centre to be told that the phone isn_'_t covered by the two - year samsung warranty as i had thought because it was made for the hong_kong market and the samsung centre can only repair eu models under_warranty .
negative	it gets worse , i have gadget insurance so i then called them .
negative	they were sympathetic and helpful but there are two snags : firstly they don_'_t pay for repairs that ought to be covered_under_warranty .
negative	secondly before entering a claim they expect to see a proof of purchase receipt with vat number and imei_number ( neither are quoted on my final details for order ).
negative	i have made a request for special pleading in this case - we shall see what happens .
negative	of course i also went back to amazon .
negative	they insist you should first approach the vendor through amazon , which i did .
negative	i had a very prompt reply to tell me that company is no_longer a marketplace vendor .
negative	so , of course i e_- mailed amazon customer_services pointing_out that they have allowed a vendor onto marketplace which sold me a dodgy product with no warranty and has subsequently disappeared .
negative	amazon '_s response is to wash their hands of the whole business .
negative	buyer_beware
negative	p . s .
negative	the phone itself was fine until it developed the fault with the display .
negative	i have left orange after 00 years as a customer .
negative	i had been without a signal at home for over three_weeks .
negative	i had to use my bt landline to contact them as i had no signal at home .
negative	this increased my bt phone bill by over £_00 .
negative	i have eventually had an acknowledgement of two emails from ceo '_s office whom i contacted after two_weeks .
negative	i had so many promises broken by staff who were supposed to call me back , the signal was always ok at home until they joined with ee and t - mobile .
negative	the staff in india are an_absolute joke and were rude , surly and hung_up on me .
negative	if i could have rated it lower_than 0 star i would have done .
negative	i am now with o0 with great customer service and a functioning phone beside me on my sofa , great signal .
negative	thanks o0 .
negative	orange should be struck off or something !
negative	!
negative	i can only concur with the other reviews on this page .
negative	don_'_t touch talktalk with a bargepole !
negative	great promises , appalling service .
negative	what you see isn_'_t what you get .
negative	i had the most appalling experience for several months when i first signed_up to them six years_ago .. after that it wasn_'_t too bad .
negative	i looked at their youview service and i was told that they had worked very hard at making great improvements in their customer service .
negative	don_'_t believe it .
negative	incorrect billing , promotions offered but not given , loss of service , a wait of two to three_weeks for an engineer , call_centres manned by robots reading scripts who couldn_'_t care_less .
negative	if you love stress you '_ll get plenty of it .
negative	stay well clear .
negative	ordered 0 items ( all marked as in stock ) for the start of the season - 0 weeks_ago .
negative	£_00 odd quid .
negative	after 0 days with no_indication of dispatch i called the 00000 000 000 number and chose option 0 for customer_services - was on hold , in position 0 in the queue for 00_minutes .
negative	when call was answered , the computers were down and person wasn_'_t sure what the status of my order was , said they would call back ( sounding familiar ?).
negative	no call back so after the bank_holiday i called again , was told there was a problem at the warehouse and was promised another call back ( didn_'_t happen ).
negative	called again today and apparently there is a ' problem ' with one of the items , however the other items are due to be picked_up by hermes today ( just received email notification ) saying delivery in 0 - 0 days but could be longer ... was offered an ' upgrade ' on the problem item and said will call back with options ( 0 hours ago ).
negative	on balance - i think this company is best avoided
negative	i have used lastminute on many occasions but never again .
negative	i booked a hotel , received the confirmation_email and turned_up at the hotel only to be told that lastminute had made an error and that there was no room available .
negative	apparently there were five people in a similar situation and i actually met one of them who had been there for three hours trying to get a resolution .
negative	i then spent the next two hours either on hold or finally talking to people who did not have the seniority to help me .
negative	the only alternative i was offered was a hotel around 0 miles_away - i had booked a central_london hotel because i needed to be in central_london , not to end up in wembley !
negative	while i was waiting , i found a number of hotels with rooms available and at around 0 . 00pm decided to book one of them myself as lastminute had failed to find a suitable alternative .
negative	the ultimate insult came when i asked to speak to someone who could authorise paying for the room i booked only to be asked whether it would wait_until the morning !
negative	i am still chasing them for a refund - they are quick enough to take my money but it will take 0 - 00 days to return it - and i am still_waiting for the promised email about how to complain_about their appalling customer service .
negative	arrived in faro on 0 / 00 / 00 after booking return transfer to olheo , at airport informed that the carrier would be greenbus .
negative	one girl dealing_with a number of bemused and impatient travellers , eventually after an_hour we were transferred to our resort .
negative	not to bad you may think , however we were issued with a telephone_number to call 00_hours before departure to arrange pick_up .
negative	after approx 00 calls a girl answered and stated that they were having computer problems and would call back ( didn_'_t happen ).
negative	obviously concerned i called the next_day and again after approx 00 calls i eventually spoke to a girl who said that we would be picked_up at 0000 hours the following_morning ( 0 hours before our flight and some 00_minutes from the airport ! )
negative	told girl that this was not acceptable .
negative	no further calls from the company no pick_up from the company at 0000 hours and as such a local taxi picked us up at 0000 hours and deposited us at the airport at 0000 without_any hassle .
negative	avoid this company like the plague !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a pair of shoes from ebay .
negative	myhermes was the courier service used , the shoes did not arrive .
negative	myhermes said " our courier posted the packet through your letterbox ."
negative	the shoes were packed in a box and would never fit through the letterbox !
negative	this company uses casual delivery drivers .
negative	hiring a ' man with a van ' is how the business is run .
negative	the delivery driver clearly helped himself to my parcel .
negative	unlike_other_reviewers here who have had awful service from myhermes , i am in the fortunate position of running my own pr business , i will be contacting all of the myhermes directors and will then relate my experience on every social_media and forum on the internet .
negative	i also have access to news agencies across the uk .
negative	myhermes have made the biggest mistake of their lives in crossing me .
negative	i will not tolerate such an unacceptable , awful service .
negative	______________________________________________________
negative	update_: i have already contacted two of their directors and their lawyers in west_yorkshire .
negative	i would advise those of you who have received shabby service to go on to the myhermes facebook account and relate your experience .
negative	i have done this today .
negative	i ' m awaiting payment to my account from chess_telecom .
negative	calls to chess ...
negative	march 00th : " you will get a refund at the end of march ."
negative	april 00th : " we '_ll look into it ."
negative	april 00nd : " we '_ll sort it out for you ."
negative	may 0th : " you will get payment by 00th_may ."
negative	may 00th : " you will be paid in 00_hours ."
negative	june 00th : : well look into it , and you call back " - they didn_'_t !
negative	june 00th : " we promise you '_ll be paid ."
negative	enough is enough !
negative	time to let david pollock ( chief exec ), stephen dracup ( man .
negative	dir .
negative	), barney phillips ( wholesale channel dir ), vanessa errington - beech ( corporate relationship manager ) and andrea murray ( operation manager ) know what '_s going on in their organisation .
negative	i ’ ve just contacted the cheshire business leaders and cheshire community foundation , who were keen to hear about chess_telecom and the way they do_business .
negative	the chess chief_executive , david pollock , is a founder member of these two organisations .
negative	i have had a long conversation with both institutions and i have been given assurances that my complaint will be passed on to david pollock .
negative	if you have a problem with chess that is not being resolved to your satisfaction then contact these two organisations .
negative	believe me , the embarrassment felt by david pollock , will not only ensure that your grievance will be attended to immediately , but will lead to heads rolling at the heyes lane office .
negative	a tip : never speak to the monkey at chess , if you can get through to the organ grinder .
negative	the man at the top of the organisation always gives a damn .
negative	the minions don_’ t .
negative	i am now going to hit every social network site and internet forum to relate my experience with chess .
negative	barney phillips ( chess wholesale channel director ) and stephen dracup ( chess managing_director ) will be contacted via_twitter .
negative	they have , between them , 000 followers .
negative	i have almost 0 , 000 , so i ’ ve got a head start !
negative	__________________________
negative	since i posted this , earlier this month , i have received several enquiries from ' would - be ' customers ' of chess_telecom .
negative	the above experience with chess is only part of the abysmal service i received during the short time i was with them .
negative	the phone line was down ( including internet_connection and the card payment machine ) for three_weeks in the run - up to christmas .
negative	as you will understand , this time of year is always the busiest for retail_outlets .
negative	chess was not the least bit interested in getting me up and running quickly .
negative	i repeatedly made calls from my 0 mobile to the chess head_office .
negative	they promised to call back many_times and never did .
negative	each time i called i told them i was losing credit_card sales in the shop .
negative	they couldn_'_t give a monkey '_s .
negative	i spoke to several people at the office and always the same response - a negative one .
negative	i , like others who have posted complaints here , am very suspicious of the reviews telling us what good service chess give to people .
negative	by losing trade during the busiest time of the year , chess_telecom has ensured that i experienced a very difficult period in my business .
negative	was i compensated by chess ?
negative	of course not .
negative	i would advise_anyone who is thinking of becoming a chess customer to think very carefully .
negative	i doubt very much that my situation was an isolated one .
negative	they are still trying to charge me for a service i have never had with them , they could not solve the problem i had and fed a line with phone and broadband into the wrong room in a shared house instead of my room , and now want to charge me for it i have never had a service from them only bills , customer service was bad very bad rude and kept passing me on to someone_else who passes you on again , rubbish company , i would never use them as long as i live .
negative	always finding a way to charge you more than original price you paid , was recently charged extra for baggage when i ask to see print out of weight on scales they refused so i had to take thier word for this , my bag was the same going with less comming back but charged me more forced to pay i call this exstortion .
negative	purchased a tablet from this company and had to return for repair , so far so good .
negative	it came back and within a week was faulty again .
negative	returned as per their instructions - april_0000 and no word from them since .
negative	no response to support ticket ( which is now dead ) or to numerous_emails .
negative	all negative_comments on facebook were taken off and there is now no means of commenting - a transparent company ?
negative	i think not !
negative	important to note : as of april_0000 jexaa limited was dissolved .
negative	now trading under tablet gear limited - same director , same address .
negative	interesting that i got a marketing email tonight from jexaa limited .
negative	i have gone to watchdog .
negative	the tablet was a christmas 0000 present for my autistic son - shameful .
negative	do not touch this company !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	made booking on line and they charged whole amount of rental advance .
negative	car_rental agency was europcar .
negative	they refused to give a car because the was something in a file .
negative	after waiting for an_hour they still did not give an answer what it even was .
negative	we rented car from the other agency ( in 00min ) and asked for refund for the monies .
negative	they send an_email that they will keep the monies because it was cancelled on same day of the reservation .!!!
negative	no service but they keep over 000_euros !
negative	!
negative	luckily we americans are protected with our banking system and bank disputed the charge .
negative	from now on , we will always book directly with rental company .
negative	do not !!!
negative	repeat do not !!!
negative	take out a contract of any kind with this company , they will rip you off and threaten you as they have me .
negative	i had a 0 year contract with this shameful company which i duly completed and then asked them to unlock my iphone as it was perfectly ok and i intended to take out a sim only deal with another_provider .
negative	they said they would unlock it for a charge of £_00 . 00 which i reluctantly agreed .
negative	after months of costly calls to an overseas call_centre the unlock has not been provided forcing me to go to o0 for another contract and new iphone which is not really required at increased personal cost .
negative	orange said that they have unlocked my phone which they have not and i finally got through to the ee tech department the other day who confirmed it hadn_'_t been unlocked .
negative	the guy who promised to come back to me has also disappeared now .
negative	i am now being subjected to aggressive calls to my home number from a debt recovery company called nco threatening allsorts of recovery action over the £_00 . 00 which i have now reluctantly paid to avoid further upset to my wife and children .
negative	the purpose of this review is to warn you against dealing_with ee / orange as they are dishonest , unreliable and will not_hesitate to bully you and your family should they need to .
negative	disgrace of a company , they should be closed_down .
negative	not only have i been lied to over unlocking my iphone_0s at the end of a 0 year contract they are now chasing me with menaces for £_00 . 00 unlocking fee service that was never provided and i still have my iphone which is locked and useless .
negative	if you are considering moving to these fraudsters ...
negative	don_'_t !!!!!
negative	!
negative	they are a disgrace .
negative	first_utility sent me an e_- mail requesting details of current meter_readings and i managed to get this sent to them ok .
negative	this was the second meter_reading i had sent to them and as i am paying by fixed monthly direct_debit i wanted to see how my usage was faring against the amount i was paying each month but nothing in their system appeared capable of allowing me to view these details so i tried to contact them .
negative	despite quoting the account number that they showed on their e_- mail , and under which i was able to send the meter_readings , they now stated " this is not a correct account number " or words to that effect .
negative	so i repeat my header , is there any service here ?
negative	george tulip
negative	trading_depot '_s delivery agent , dpd , failed on three occasions to deliver when they said they would , causing me a lot of inconvenience in making arrangements to stay in for the delivery , then in making arrangements for a neighbour to accept delivery , both abortive because dpd did not deliver when they said they would .
negative	in addition , neither [_name ], trading_depot director , nor [_name ] of dpd have replied to my email of 00th_october , complaining_about their poor service
negative	i wrote a negative_review of a courier company , and had to provide proof of purchase which i did twice , and trustpilot reinstated my review , the whole_process took 00 days .
negative	i then edited my review for the same company , adding the comment that i expected my negative_review to be challenged , which it was , so my review cannot be seen .
negative	i again provided proof of purchase , on 00 th may but have had no reply from trustpilot .
negative	after the first time my review was challenged the courier firm in question received 00 positive_reviews in 0 hour , which to me looked like fakes , these have since been taken down , though i have had no confirmation from trustpilot as to wether they were fake .
negative	the whole system is flawed as the courier company consistently challenges negative_reviews hoping to get them removed , but never replies to customers on review_sites . trustpilot are just helping them to hide negative_feedback
negative	we accepted a quote for a house removal , and paid a deposit of over £_000 , our chosen courier did not contact us , when we contacted him , he said he was sorry but he had a lot on .
negative	we ended_up hiring a van and doing the job ourselves , but shiply will not refund our money .
negative	we have seen other reports of this happening , and also a report from the advertising standards authority criticising this policy .
negative	our house removal is still listed on shiply '_s website as succesful , but it was definitely not succesful for us
negative	our delivery number was item id 0000000
negative	having posted this review shiply asked trustpilot to verify that we were genuine shiply customers , which we did .
negative	it is obvious that shiply are challenging all negative_reviews in the hope of having them removed .
negative	shiply are happy to stand by their no refund policy , and it appears on their homepage , in faint lettering , this is in response to an asa ruling stating that this policy should be made more obvious to customers .
negative	it will be interesting to see if this edited review is challenged by shiply
negative	as expected shiply have challenged this review again , surely it would be better to sort problems out rather_than trying to hide them
negative	an order placed on the 00st_december is still " processing " according to my account details .
negative	the company failed to respond to a request to swap the item in order to get something for christmas and have failed to respond to a request since christmas to cancel the order and refund .
negative	the web_site looks good but it accounts for nothing if the service is poor .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again or recommending them .
negative	i '_ve given then one star as it seems you cannot rate them with zero_stars !
negative	my son ordered 0 xmas_gifts from fancy . com on 00 / 00 .
negative	they stated all three would be delivered next_day .
negative	one was delivered as promised .
negative	the other two were no shows .
negative	after a complaint about the 0 missing gifts fancy . com stated that the ' revised ' delivery date for the two gifts was 00th of january .
negative	now , on 0th_jan , they advise that one of the gifts is out of stock and money will be refunded .
negative	heaven only knows if and when the remaining gift will be delivered .
negative	they have ruined our family christmas .
negative	my son booked a flight with this mob , through a bunch of spanish con artists called edreams .
negative	the ticket he bought turned_out to be non - transferable and non - refundable .
negative	this was not advised by edreams at time of purchase of the ticket , nor in the e_- mail they sent out .
negative	called austrian airlines in the uk and got a call_centre in ukraine .
negative	no way would austrian refund the ticket .
negative	no way would they ( olga & zoryana ) give me the name of a contact in the uk or vienna to write to .
negative	they would not even give me the name and address of their ceo .
negative	( btw his name is jaan albrecht , office park 0 , vienna0000 , austria .)
negative	like most airlines that don_'_t ' get it '.
negative	they think it is better to hold on to £_000 for dear life , rather_than go out of their way to help someone .
negative	mustn '_t do anything to diminish the huge bonus the ceo will get next year , eh !
negative	?
negative	i purchased a dovedale solid_oak desk form the swindon store in april this year .
negative	if you order from this company you will know that you are not permitted to inspect your goods on delivery .
negative	on inspection it was hard to miss the badly_damaged door .
negative	i contacted ofl who promptly dispatched a repair man to refit a new door .
negative	imagine my dismay when he asked me to inspect his handy work .
negative	the door that was previously perfectly fitted into the frame was now some 0mm proud of the frame on the hinge side .
negative	the so called carpenter said he was unable to fit it any other way due to the pre existing screw holes .
negative	i contacted ofl who i now expected to pull out all the stops as i had been the recipient of two successive episodes of bad service from their company .
negative	instead , a somewhat off had & not to sympathetic lady form customer service phoned me to say that ofl had reviewed my photographs & decided to offer me £_00 compensation .
negative	i told them that £_00 will not excuse bad workmanship or bad service & ask what my options were .
negative	i was told that i could return the desk for a refund & re order if i chose to .
negative	i pointed_out that this option would leave me without a desk to work on until the replacement arrives .
negative	i was told that was ofl procedure .
negative	at this point i had a serious sense of humour failure & hung_up on the lady .
negative	in the end i went for a second repair to the door that was carried_out perfectly .
negative	why did the first carpenter not do the same ?
negative	can i add that the swindon store staff were sympathetic but their hands were tied by ofl procedures .
negative	my impression of ofl is of a company offering good quality items but not backing them up with good quality service .
negative	... ' cos you ' re going to work through a lot of them before you can get your problem_solved .
negative	that '_s the only reason we went instead to the post_office , where the ' phones are answered properly and promptly !
negative	before placing an order ( no .
negative	000000000 ) in may this year , i called there sales_team to confirm when the product would be delivered as i had read a lot of bad comments re meeting their commitments .
negative	i was promised in this call that a ship was due to arrive on jayne 00rd with my products on board ready to be delivered within 0 - 0 days .. on this basis , i went_ahead and placed the order but made it clear in the order the commitment that was made .
negative	i called again about 00 days ago and was assured that one of the two products was already in stock and the other was on its way and would be with them in the 00rd june .
negative	i heard_nothing since and therefore decided to call them today .
negative	i am now told that the products will not be in until august at earliest .
negative	you can imagine my fury with this news especially as half the summer has already gone .
negative	in this basis i decided to cancel my order and get a refund .
negative	vicki has very kindle agreed to email me today once the credit has_been processed and the credit should be with me within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	please do not trust anything that anyone tells you in rattan_direct as they are clearly lying to their customers .
negative	wish i had read these reviews before i placed my order .
negative	hope this will help others avoid same hassle .
negative	ordered 0 cookers on a special price deal .
negative	website showed stock and order was placed , credit_card charged .
negative	delivery terms we '_ll call you within 0 days and delivery within 0 days .
negative	no call after 0 days , checked website could still order item for 0 day delivery , so i called them .
negative	sorry no stock can '_t tell you when we will have and someone will call you within 0 days - no joy beyond that .
negative	eventually told delivery would be mid november - 0 weeks after ordering .
negative	next_day item i had ordered was showing no stock on website , but noticed there was showing an identical item in another colour , colour not an issue with me so went into local_branch to try and change to other colour as i could get no where with phoning .
negative	branch rang where ever and were told definitely no delivery on original item until nov .
negative	branch then checked re other colour and identified would be 0 day delivery .
negative	tried to persuade us to just go for other colour but i insisted they call up and check actual stock - again no stock will be mid nov .
negative	manager of store then persuaded us to change to another brand - bush , these are owned by argos so we are never out of stock .
negative	it was an inferior product , but you don_'_t order 0 cookers because you want them them it is because you need them .
negative	so after being absolutely assured there was stock and we would receive them 0 days_later we placed a new order .
negative	should have had my call yesterday to confirm time_slot , didn_'_t happen so i called today and was told yes all in order delivery will be tomorrow 0 - 00 . 00 and will call you on route - great .... then within 00_mins get a call sorry have no stock can '_t make delivery tomorrow ..... someone will call you within 0 days to discuss when we might be able to deliver .
negative	insisted that wasn_'_t good enough but of course no way forward so now waiting for a call .
negative	how can they think a call back within 0 days relating to an item that should have been with me within 0 days is acceptable ??
negative	?
negative	other customers might like to know i was told by a member of staff argos operate like an airline they sell stock they don_'_t have and so then have to bump people - great - how often do they expect us to be bumped before we bump them ?
negative	having been a loyal and very good customer for over a year now , putting good volumes of business through interparcel - i was really annoyed and miffed when there was an i . t .
negative	problem where there site suddenly decided it didn_'_t recognise our postcode as a collection address - having phoned interparcel and spoken to numerous people who suggested various things which didn_'_t work - nobody really seemed particularly bothered - my last dealings with this matter , a supervisor promised to phone me back to sort it out after supposedly going away to look into in more depth - they never did .
negative	their loss - i am now putting all my business through another company - interparcel have lost £ 0000 '_s business through me alone - if this is the way you look after customers when things go_wrong you don_'_t deserve to be in business
negative	hi im very disappointed as a new customer i cannot redeem my voucher ive followed all instructions and gone into my voucher looke for the instruction to print its not there !
negative	went and clicked on link if im having trouble it wont work my voucher runs out tomorrow what happens to my money as i have no goods , this is not right i will now have to call the company who keep office hours only , ive ordered a book from amazon on the same day and its arrived already they are the best i will never ever use this site again i just want my flipping goods and then put this site in the junk_mail where it belongs amazon and ebay all the way .
negative	will be on the phone tomorrow .
negative	a very unhappy ex customer !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	jill desborough
negative	contracted ecologicliving ( carlisle ) to provide 0 seperate biomass systems ( both ' turn key ').
negative	one a 00kw pellet ( one property ) and the other a 000kw wood chip system to provide hot_water and central_heating to 0 properties .
negative	the 000kw project was suposed to be finished by christmas 0000 .
negative	whilst we expected some minor teething_problems , we did not envisage such a delay to completion .
negative	the project is now 0 months , and counting , overdue ( both projects not actually complete - 0 properties still do not have central_heating ).
negative	the company showed us no detailed plans ( scale drawings rather_than schematics ), nor a project works plan ( pert / gantt chart ) and we ( the customers ) have found ourselves being resident site managers ( having to explain to workmen what is required and check the standard of work carried_out ).
negative	we also have to constantly ring the company to ask for various jobs to be completed .
negative	we then get promised that workmen will turn_up on a certain day and , guess_what , they don_'_t show and we get some lame_excuse .
negative	this shocking service is not just a one off it happens every week .... we ask , they promise , it doesn_'_t happen !
negative	last_week , for instance , i got one man for less_than half a day .
negative	i am hopeful that during this summer we might see some real progress ( i ' m holding my breath ).
negative	a positive_note would be that ecologicliving do install good quality boilers .
negative	advice to any potential customer would be :
negative	0 . ensure you balance the stage payments in your favour .
negative	financial pressure !
negative	0 .
negative	get a legally binding ( set in stone ) completion date with draconian penalties for overruns .
negative	0 . demand regular site meetings ( have it in the contract ).
negative	will do a further update when project is actually near a satisfactory completion !
negative	no contact number , tracking_numbers don_'_t work , two delivery dates missed and still not in possession of the package sent on the 00th !!!
negative	utter_rubbish don_'_t use
negative	ordered goods at the beginning of december .
negative	still not received by 00th_dec so cancelled order .
negative	they then said order ready to send .
negative	i told them i had cancelled it , they confirmed this in email on 00th_december and said refund would be in 0 to 00 days .
negative	00 february - still_waiting for refund .
negative	rang and emailed numerous_times - no reply to phone messages and emails keep saying refund is coming but it never does .
negative	we purchased tickets for a yankees game , did not get contacted to collect our $_000 + order .
negative	no one to talk to at cheaptickets .
negative	no contact email of the seller provided .
negative	no tickets !
negative	called the company multiple times , but they are closed .
negative	game is today .
negative	not cool !
negative	cheaptickets - the internet is a 00 / 0 online marketplace .
negative	you are selling tickets for flights , events etc_., you need to have customer support at all times ...
negative	my review is for curries in yeovil , i ordered a product and paid for it on dec 00nd , there was no mention of the product not being sent to the store in time for xmas , after 0 attempts to collect it the last time on jan 0st and was told it still wasnt in i phoned the helpline , total_waste of time , all he kept saying was that it was in store waiting to be collected which it clearly wasnt , they wouldnt give me the store number so i had to keep going 00 miles just to see if it had arrived , i will never be using the store again and would highly_recomend using ao . com they were brilliant .....
negative	if i had my way i would not choose city_link .
negative	if you miss a delivery , trying to re - arrange it is like pulling teeth without an anaesthetic !
negative	and if you try and speak to anyone they are at best curt and at worst rude .
negative	i dread it if i get a card through my door saying city_link had tried to make a delivery .
negative	i know how difficult it '_s going to be to get the package to be re - delivered .
negative	having bought and paid for items ... still have not received them .
negative	trust is gone .
negative	firms you deal with are rubbish ; as is your ordering system .
negative	don ` t deserve any stars and it probably wont let me publish this
negative	only contact from music city has_been to confirm that order was placed .
negative	the order was placed almost 0 weeks_ago and as yet i have not received any confirmation that the order has_been processed or dispatched .
negative	i am beginning to feel that this is a bogus company .
negative	i understand that delivery time from u . s to u . k will be little longer_than normal but i paid over $_00 . 00 for delivery so i am expecting better service than i already have received .
negative	if i get the goods before_christmas , i may use site again , if not then no way .
negative	this is a present for my wife .
negative	not happy so far .
negative	0 star only coz its christmas time
negative	my parcel was not delivered to the correct address and not signed for by me - my name is misspelt according to the delivery e_- mail .
negative	should have been delivered to no .
negative	00 ( with 00 " high numbers on white background ) but instead delivered to no .
negative	00 ( very small 0 " high numbers ).
negative	waited in all day for delivery expected between 00 & 0 - parcel delivered wrongly at 00 : 00 !
negative	all other couriers have delivered correctly !
negative	if you think you will be supported by a so called high_street name forget it i bought a 0d mk000 which has developed a fault they are so deliberately evasive
negative	real chuckle brothers to canon to jessops so utterly unprofessional so un customer friendly , they answer the phone for a sale do they ring back when their is a problem
negative	no way !!
negative	you have to chase and chase better shop on ebay and take a less risk this company will go belly up soon just like comet big fire sale on its way
negative	ordered watch in sale , 0 weeks_later they tell me sent to covent_garden store in error .
negative	said they would sent out last_week still_waiting .
negative	read other reviews they are true this unit grabs your cash then you are on your_own !!!!!
negative	the watchhut you are rubbish .
negative	it also seems the internet site is a diff set_up than the shops so if things go_wrong the shop cannot help you !
negative	if any manager from this watch_hut reading this please get a grip of your staff , or you all will be out of a job .
negative	update 0rd sept just phoned covent_garden shop sending out today .
negative	0 .
negative	pick_up watch 0 . put in jiffy_bag 0 . take to post_office 0 . go for lie down
negative	i have still not resolved the overcharging with this company , calling their phone help and u will lose the will to live .
negative	on 00th_november i placed an order with this company , then received an e_- mail the following_day , to say the items were out of stock , and asking if i wanted to wait_until they were in stock .
negative	as i needed the bulbs in a hurry , i replied that i would prefer to cancel the order and receive a refund .
negative	come 00th_november , i still had no refund , so used the website '_s live_chat option to query the situation ( i still have the transcript for this ), and was assured that the refund would be made immediately .
negative	yesterday , 00th_november , i still had no refund , so phoned the company to query the situation , and was again assured that an_immediate_refund would be made .
negative	as of today , 00th_november , i still have no refund .
negative	this is the worst service i have * ever * received from any online company in 00 years of internet ordering .
negative	the only reason i have given one star is that there is no option for no stars .
negative	feeling totally let_down by car trawler and holiday_autos .
negative	having used this company a number of times without problem , i noticed this year when booking that cartrawler appeared in the search page .
negative	not thinking anything had changed i continued to book a car .
negative	however the hire company chosen was not named until i paid with my credit_card .
negative	big_mistake !
negative	to make_sure that i was totally covered , i took out the recommended security deposit , insurance .
negative	this is with allianz ,
negative	so no_worries then ….
negative	another big_mistake !
negative	!
negative	arrived in murcia to pick_up my car from a company called dickmans , should have realised , who on earth , would name their company , dickmans !
negative	their office is in a van , row three murcia airport .
negative	trying not to pre judge the situation , i put my paranoia behind me and showed my cartrawler pre_- paid voucher .
negative	it was at this point that i started to feel uneasy .
negative	the agent took one look at my allianz insurance_cover and laughed !
negative	he would not accept this and stated that i would either have to pay £_000 deposit , directly into his bank_account , returnable 0 to 0 days after return , or take out their own insurance at £_000 .
negative	well common_sense should have told me to walk_away , but this being murcia airport , with few facilities , i was intimidated into accepting the situation or walking .
negative	another big_mistake !!

negative	having paid up , stating i was not happy , an employee then took me to the car and in a whirlwind after making me sign an inspection form , made his exit .
negative	no real chance to establish the cars faults , i photographed each elevation of the car and drove some 000kms to our destination , upon which we found there was no hi viz jacket , emergency triangles or first aid kit , which are all mandatory in spain .
negative	i tried_ringing the contact number on the paperwork , but no answer from the company .
negative	you ’ ve guessed it ………….
negative	on return i again photographed all elevations and returned the keys to a hole in the back of the van , things were looking up , there were now 0 pallets stacked up , for customers to reach , the service window .
negative	i am still_waiting for my deposit , to be returned , in the meantime i have contacted my credit_card company , who will act for me and tried to contact cartrawler through their complaints website , which allows you to upload your written complaint , but not supporting information , although it states the info , has_been successfully updated !
negative	i have always used holiday_autos in the past , but since cartrawler have been involved , i believe you have little redress , the company clearly knows there are issues with dickmans , ( see dickmans rent a car , reviews on tripadvisor ).
negative	incidently , taking out the recommended extra security deposit insurance with allianz , is a total_waste of time , because unless dickmans actually states the car is damaged allianz will not want to know , best thing to do is crash the car into their van , you should then be able to claim !!
negative	!
negative	its such a shame that a relatively reliable company should be let_down by the antics of cartrawler and its car_hire partners .
negative	will post again if i hear_anything , positive or negative .
negative	ordered a present from them for my little girl last christmas and am still_waiting they promised me it would be with me for christmas then just ignored emails and are impossible to reach by phone .
negative	awful company and would agree they are con_men , even if it '_s the cheapest or you can '_t get what yolu want anywhere_else i would avoid them like the plague or put your money in the fire it '_s the same thing .
negative	only gave them a star because i couldn_'_t post unless i did believe me they don_'_t rate at all .
negative	i keep on getting nuisance calls from a foreign call_centre which is ran by vodafone .
negative	i have never had any products through them and do not know how they got my details .
negative	i have asked them to stop contacting me and remove my details from their system but they persist !
negative	i purchased their xl broadband package wanting reliable and fast internet access .
negative	when watching programs on the bbc iplayer i sometimes get a message_stating ' insufficient bandwidth ' which i was assured would not be the case .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	00_% of the programs broadcast by itv are complete rubbish .
negative	it seems as though they are attempting to dumb down the nation .
negative	bbc documentaries like the attenborough series ' are far_superior to anything made by this ' broadcaster '.
negative	i was trying to find a new shirt using their website and gave up after 00_minutes .
negative	it is utterly rubbish .
negative	luckily i was passing by a shop so could pop in - they have a good range and reasonable_prices for ok quality .
negative	it '_s just the website doesn_'_t seem to show all items they stock in store .
negative	received a card from moon pig the other day and thought to myself how impersonal it is having a typed message .
negative	what is wrong with hand writing out a nice message ?
negative	bought my battery on the 00rd jan , when i rang on the 00st i was told by a very rude girl that they had trouble with their courier and my battery was not dispatched until 00th .
negative	very rude unhelpful staff , because of their problems i have had to pay over £_00 in public_transport costs .
negative	avoid at all costs
negative	i would rate them 0_stars .
negative	i ordered a flame failure device for my cannon gas cooker main oven .
negative	i checked beforehand that the model number was correct .
negative	.
negative	the part they sent me did not state it was for the grill and top oven .
negative	after returning it and waiting for my refund .
negative	i had to ring on two occassions .
negative	the second time the woman_who answered had a very bad telephone_manner .
negative	very offhanded .
negative	i then was put through to a manager at my request to ask why i was charged two lots of postage .£ 0 . 00 for delivery and returning the item .
negative	when it wasn_'_t my fault .
negative	?
negative	they didn_'_t state it was for the top oven and not the main one .
negative	as the gas fitter travelled some considerable distance to fit the part neither him or myself were very pleased .
negative	i do not recommend this firm at all .
negative	no star_rating !!
negative	!
negative	we were accused by the manager of our local_store of being shoplifters despite a total_lack of evidence .
negative	when we complained to the store . experience team they told us that the store manager could expel us if she liked .
negative	we disagreed with the manager '_s assertion and subsequent messages to the store . experience have vanished into the ether .
negative	queries to the online waterstone '_s message board have , through the online intermediary , revealed that they have no_intention of continuing the conversation .
negative	shocking !
negative	just of the phone to these cretins " if wit was a sh # t , they would be a prize t # rd " , details came through for some person in my address , and a letter from bt saying that they were sorry to lose me , 00 sec call to bt sorted_out my end .
negative	trying to stop mail coming through to my address a whole different kettle of fish .
negative	after speaking to cretin number " in customer service " employee of the month goes to the woman not uk_based who asked for details and then of the account .
negative	i said the persons name the envelope came through with and she then said you are not this person , i said no this is my address stop sending mail here .
negative	she then said on my system is down you will need to call back later .
negative	i said i ain '_t calling back you write the details down and sort it when your pc is working .
negative	i cannot do that i am not allowed to , i said ok let me speak to your supervisor , i can only do that if there is a problem .
negative	i said there is and its me , so let me speak to the supervisor silence ..
negative	i said hello think i had been transferred .
negative	i can '_t be helping you pc not working , i said again .. look i work in customer service if i write things down that are confidential it can be shredded ... why can you not write something , do you have a pen , i can '_t be answering that question ... end of call arrrghhh ... call 00 . 00am this morning and talk_talk like i said on the phone i am busy have things to do , if i have to call you again i will charge my admin_fee of £_00 . 00 per call
negative	i ordered a camera 00 days before i needed it for my holiday as it was meant to be 00_hours delivery .
negative	i had an_email the next_day to say the camera had been dispatched and giving me a tracking_number .
negative	the next_day i tried to track my camera ( being delivered by dhl ).
negative	dhl told me that they had received the data for the package but no package and told me to talk to pixmania .
negative	this was a vicious circle , pixmania said they had sent it but dhl hadn_'_t received it .
negative	i asked pixmania to send me a replacement but they refused .
negative	i asked for a refund but they refused .
negative	i received the memory card which i had ordered along with a vipix card which i did not order .
negative	this had been added to my invoice (£_00 . 00 ) and there was nowhere i could cancel it .
negative	i rang pixmania to ask them to cancel it but they said they couldn_'_t - the card would give me cheaper postage for the next year !
negative	!
negative	as i had paid by paypal , and 00 days had passed i logged a complaint with paypal .
negative	i eventually had all of my money refunded by paypal today , a month after my order .
negative	the camera never showed up and i did not receive any explanation from pixmania .
negative	i would never use them again and never recommend them to anyone !
negative	wrong product sent , no reply to emails .
negative	i ordered a necklace for my granddaughters bday .
negative	on the 0th_august and stil have not received it , this is the first and last time i shall be ordering from this company , as ive emailed them 0 times and all the say is they have no tracking , i feel totaly peeded off now waiting , i do beloive the necklaces comes from usa hence why its either got lost or taking so long !
negative	but i they dont mention the fact its shipped from the usa !
negative	i have asked for refund but havent got that yet , so im very dissaponted with the service , they should be providing tracking for their items .
negative	not a good service i wont be using again !
negative	did a online order and got a call after 00_minutes to say the restaurant was too_busy to accept my order . why take the order and process it in the first place . left to reorder from another restaurant and wait for another hour .
negative	jordan was the rep from just eat no compensation was given very rude service .
negative	also have a previous experience where just eat agreed to a refund which i never got from a sit indian resturant called the rice in hatfield area .
negative	all in all this is a joke of a company who need training in customer service .
negative	ordered lights on 00 may and we are in june and have still not received them .
negative	paresh patel order no 0000000000
negative	order never arrived on time after paying extra for the service . no compensation for all the time wasted .
negative	goods (£_00 . 00 total ) ordered 00 june 00 , confirmation received same day , chased 0 july with numerous attempted phone_calls in between and since .
negative	these_people are cheats and worse , we are pensioners .
negative	this fraudulency needs lots of publicity to get these_people out of business .
negative	deplorable .
negative	we ordered some goods on the 00 th april a . m having established online that they were available .
negative	we received confirmation of our order later that day and therefore expected to take delivery within their 0 - 0 days standard timeline .
negative	on the 00 th we received an e_mail to day that they did not have enough stock . we cancelled .
negative	i rang the firm to request confirmation of cancellation by e_mail and asked how long it would take to refund ( t and c say take 00 days ) given the fact that the firm could not process our request and we had not taken delivery of any goods .
negative	i was told that someone would get back to me asap .
negative	i am still_waiting .
negative	have since gone with an_alternative provider which has_been excellent .
negative	awful !
negative	i booked a courier and arranged to work from home on the arranged day ( s ) so i could be in .
negative	0st attempt - courier didn_'_t turn_up
negative	0nd attempt - courier came but outside the time window arranged so wasn_'_t able to make the pickup
negative	0rd attempt - courier claimed to come , knock on the door and ring the doorbell .
negative	however i have a coded gate at the end of my street and was in all day and recieved no calling_card
negative	the communication_throughout , whilst prompt , was awful and i never recieved an_apology or an explanation .
negative	just an_automated_response requesting my order number and another time / date to rearrange the courier for .
negative	i requested , and got , a refund and booked with myhermes . com who were excellent and cheaper and came the day after to pick it up no problem .
negative	avoid interparcel at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	the website is impossible the phone line not much_better .
negative	my milk order has_been incorrect several_times and often no milk at all and then i '_ve been charged for it .
negative	this means another call and somtimes i just can '_t be bothered .
negative	am going to stop the service the next time they get it wrong .
negative	i was contacted by orange to sign up for landline and broadband .
negative	i explained that i was already in a contract with another_provider for another 0 months .
negative	orange said they would pay the outstanding balance to the other company in order for me to move to orange .
negative	i said i wanted to keep my number .
negative	no problem was there reply .
negative	simply contact your existing supplier two_weeks prior to the switch to get the existing landline ported across .
negative	i did as instructed and was asked by my provider why i was moving considering i had £_000 to pay for cancelling my contract .
negative	i explained orange had agreed to pay the balance .
negative	my current provider said that orange had been saying this to customers but in truth they only pay up to £_000 .
negative	i had been mis_- sold the deal and contacted orange to cancel the switch .
negative	orange said they would cancel the switch immediately .
negative	however they didn_'_t .
negative	instead they switched my landline and broadband to them anyway . they had also given me a new landline_number .
negative	i contacted them immediately .
negative	they told me that the girl who cancelled the instalation did not know that she had to cancel the instalation on two computers and this is why the switch had went_ahead .
negative	as a result i was left without a landline or broadband for 0 weeks until orange could switch me back to my previous provider .
negative	i lost my phone number and this was a major inconveience .
negative	the orange customer service were rude and although i was promised phone_calls from supervisors they just didnt bother .
negative	they did however send me a cheque for £_00 after i had wrote several complaint letters to them .
negative	this was pathetic considering the major inconvenience i had suffered .
negative	all in all orange are liars and cheats who offer the worst customer service i have had from any mobile or telecommunications company .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	placed order for 0 tyres on 00th_feb . payment taken straight_away .
negative	no sensible emails received fro m company .
negative	two_weeks_later get email_telling_me my fitting date was 00thfeb .
negative	fitters had received nothing .
negative	today 0th_march my tyres have been fitted .
negative	almost one month to get my tyres .
negative	fitting_centre fine and no_complaints .
negative	what sort of a company takes your money and doesn_'_t have the courtesy to tell you that the tyres are not in stock .
negative	tyreshoppers owes me the interest
negative	on over £_000 which they " borrowed " for nearly four weeks .
negative	tyreshoppers deals with problems by silence and ignoring the customer .
negative	will go_elsewhere next time .
negative	alans
negative	this company sold me a tap that was badly manufactured and needs replacing with one that is not faulty .
negative	instead of saying sorry for your trouble here have another one that isn_'_t faulty they make it very difficult by asking you to send photos and then more photos and even more photos .
negative	meanwhile days go by and i still don_'_t have a functioning bath .
negative	after all that bending over_backwards they then tell you it '_s not faulty !!
negative	unbelievable , i would never deal with this company again and i advise everyone to stay well away .
negative	*** update **** one month later i have had a refund - yipee .
negative	guess_what ?
negative	the tap was faulty !!
negative	such nice people but such poor customer service .
negative	what amazes_me is that people read these reviews , then buy from vic plumb and then wonder_why they have problems with customer service and quality of products .
negative	remember , you could be that half a person who has a problem and not the 0 . 0 who get a great service .
negative	i too placed an order in october and was given week 00 to expect delivery , unlike previous reviewers infurn have not been in touch with me , or answered any emails .
neutral	decided to fumigate a small caravan i just purchased .
neutral	there were small flying things and crawlers and i thought the mini fortefog would do the trick .
neutral	it didn_'_t .
neutral	0 hours after activation i re - entered the caravan expecting to see dead insects and crawlers but only found live ones who seemed un bothered with the very small_amount of smoke produced by this product .
neutral	the product didn_'_t produce enough smoke to fill my small caravan .
neutral	the company sent a replacement but no different results were obtained .
neutral	i can '_t recommend this product but the company were quick to respond .
neutral	i had to change the dates i was going on holiday ( an easyjet package ).
neutral	i made the change less_than 00hrs since paying and the brochure price for the new holiday was over £_000 cheaper yet they gave me £_00 back , it would have been cheaper to go to the travel_agents , they tell me there would have been no charge for this , but how do you fight your corner properly at the end of a phone ( which by the way cost me over £ 0 )
neutral	buy same product from my local pizza house for a third of the price
neutral	check the reviews before you order , there are some really dodgy takeaways on my site
neutral	if you like to keep to the same stuff all the time then ok , but the variety is very minimal on the food side .
neutral	the fresh and frozen_food is costly .
neutral	the special non food items they get in are good value but be quick as they only sell a few .
neutral	but beware of network_coverage
neutral	it was the best thing when i left bt and cheaper
neutral	excellent prices and ease of service from this website , i have used before but , although blackcircles part of the deal was excellent they have changed the tyre depot to use to get the tyres_fitted .
neutral	before it was spotless and efficient unfortunately this new depot was somewhat the opposite , very dirty employees and i had my son with me and the boss was communicating with a customer in hear shot swearing and generally not really bothered my young son was standing practically next to him , very unprofessional ..
neutral	so definately not using this depot again !!!
neutral	!
neutral	tyres , good make , great road holding but very very noisey , ten times worse_than the michelins they replaced , so would not recommend them
neutral	a good product , easily fitted with good instructions .
neutral	the web_site is easily_navigated and the ordering_process simple to follow .
neutral	the goods took over a week to arrive well within the up to 00 days the web_site suggested it could take due to the items coming from a depot in europe .
neutral	however i was exasperated to receive customer feedback / buying experience e_- mail after 0 days asking for a review when i had not yet received the goods ???????????.
neutral	this annoyed me as it would be " good practice " for this feedback request to go out to customers at a time when they are likely to have actually received the goods and had the proper time to appraise etc .
neutral	( customer_services please take_note !!!)
neutral	i posted a review in the heat of the moment and actually i think used the b word once suggesting it might be better to allow at_least the 00 days possible delivery before bombarding the customer with requests for buying feedback .
neutral	i also praised the company for the ease of ordering and the easy to navigate web_site but as they were so upset at the use of course language ( 0 b word ) they complained and had the post removed .
neutral	i hope the company reviews their feedback procedure in the future and allows the appropriate time to elapse before requesting such information .
neutral	i should also like to apologise for the use of a course word in my original review and state for the record that after spending £_000 . 00 on your company products i would use you again and would recommend your products .
neutral	the products they sell speak for themselves , the postal prices are too much and the free option is way too slow , not even posted on day of order when ordered before lunchtime , and still no tracking_info 0 days on .
neutral	i tried them because the coffee is inexpensive compared to proper nespresso .
neutral	however the taste is poor and the pods are really cheap and don_'_t seem to be solidly packed with coffee .
neutral	will be going back to nespresso .
neutral	the booking experience was good but despite enquiries on delivery and promises of a dispatch date .
neutral	when the tickets had not arrived two days before the concert - we had to fly to the event - we ended_up chasing the courier and had to collect from their office rather then have them delivered .
neutral	sadly this soured an otherwise pleasant_experience .
neutral	we checked many companies on the internet looking for the best price for arden_grange light dog_food .
neutral	monster gave us this .
neutral	their email order confirmaton also gave us a delivery tracking_number .
neutral	on the day delivery was due , we tried to track it via computer but got the answer that the number was unknown .
neutral	we then phoned yodel ( their delivery agent ) and were told that it would be that day but could give us no estimate of time except - between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
neutral	we waited in and there was no delivery .
neutral	it arrived next_day when we were out .
neutral	i have written to monster suggesting that they review their use of this delivery company .
neutral	they have written back apologising for the problem
neutral	i am being asked to rate the company when i have only just ordered the product .
neutral	it says that delivery is 0 to 0 weeks which i think is unacceptable in this day and age , but it is a present for someone_else which they really want ; otherwise i would have found an_alternative .
neutral	the other thing is that the delivery starts at £ 0 + which for an item of £_00 + is virtually 00_% and makes the whole point of buying online pretty worthless .
neutral	transfer , accommodation and shooting range were all cool but our guide tried to take us to the most expensive bars so we did our own thing
neutral	having been given a delivery date , i waited in all day but my item never turned_up .
neutral	nobody had the decentcy to contact me to update me of the situation .
neutral	i did however get a phone_call at 0 . 00 am on the sunday after the delivery date from the driver saying he was half an_hour away .
neutral	he arrived but had no explanation as to why it was not delivered on the due date or to why i was not informed of any delay ..
neutral	however the customer service that followed was good , but was unable to give any reason for the delay
neutral	sky park steve booking was easy to use and very straightforward .
neutral	however , received an_email afterwards offering a further 0 %_discount if i revisited the site when i had already made my booking which was a bit rough !
neutral	whilst the customer service of the company seems pretty good the course i followed ( social_media marketing for dummies ) was clearly created a long time ago .
neutral	most of the social_media interfaces have changed since the course was designed and several of the features have ceased completely ( eg there are chunky sections on linkedin answers and linkedin events both of which are no_longer supported ).
neutral	worse still , there is a whole module on gowalla which ceased trading a year_ago .
neutral	the section on roi and analytics is less_than useful , and the test at the end seems a little bug ridden .
neutral	a shame because there is some good stuff in here and the style of presentation is engaging ( even if the sections are a little brief in some cases ).
neutral	trevor lambert ec0000
neutral	i received my headphones , the day after i placed my order , very impressive !
neutral	they are comfortable to wear and the case is convenient for carrying .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that i could still hear the car radio , when i was trying to listen to an audio book .
neutral	this was the main_reason for buying them .
neutral	also if using them with sky go on my ipad the sound goes out of sync , in fact distorted if you with the noise reduction mode !
neutral	good price and helpful staff however delivery was supposed to be on 0 / 0 and for some reason was arranged on 0 / 0 .
neutral	unfortunately it snowed over the weekend and the person we had arranged to sit could therefore not get here resulting in my husband having to take 0 hours off work .
neutral	my name is conor , i am from ireland . i am not a simply_electronics employee . if you wish to contact me my email is conor . heffernan @ iol . ie . i had a fairly decent experience with se .
neutral	it does say on the site that delivery would take between 0 and 00 working_days , basically , the best part of 0 weeks so i was ready for a wait . so i ordered a google nexus 0 00gb and started the process on the 00th of april_0000 .
neutral	i too went through the multiple status updates on the site which was very annoying , but every couple of days it progressed to the next one .
neutral	there were about 0 in all which is ridiculous . i think they are there to make it look like there is something always happening with your order .
neutral	finally , on the 00th of april , it said my order had been shipped and gave me a tracking_number with a courier company called aramex .
neutral	with most courier companys you can track your shipment across the world as it gets scanned into various places , but with aramex , nothing of the kind .
neutral	instead , on their tracking page the item remained " forwarded to : kowloon office hong_kong " for five days ., i rang the aramex office in ireland and the first time they hung_up on me .
neutral	the second time the girl took my details and said she would ring me back in a few_minutes but never did . that was on the 00th of april .... my phone arrived on the afternoon of the 0st of may but i remain seriously unimpressed by aramex . it was really well_packaged and when i unboxed it , all was as it should be .
neutral	this is not my first transaction with se , i bought a canon 000ex0 from them back in 0000 and it was actually delivered fairly fast .
neutral	tbh , after_reading all the reviews on here , i doubt i '_ll be using them again , but i just wanted to state for the record that my experience was a good one .
neutral	i have screenshots of the transaction if anyone doesn_'_t believe i ' m a genuine reviewer . regards , conor .
neutral	ordered a dewalt circular saw through ebay , waited a few_days and no delivery , sent an_email and was advised a new model replacement would be dispatched once in stock .
neutral	waited another 00 days and received the newer model but wrong voltage .
neutral	sent back using buyaparcels courier collection , waited another week while the incorrect unit was checked before the correct item was dispatched .
neutral	all in all a mixed experience , just unlucky with the mistakes and having to wait 0 weeks for what usually would be 0 - 0 days .
neutral	would still recommend as the pricing and service is great .
neutral	pretty_much says it all really ..... frustrating that it seems to be impossible anymore to simply buy a ticket for an event with greasing the palm of companies like these .... but at_least they ' re usually reliable unlike several others .
neutral	i '_ve had a few good buys via_groupon , and on the few occasions i '_ve had a problem , they '_ve been quite responsive .
neutral	too often though , you see " bargains " in their daily offer , that you can find just as cheaply elsewhere .
neutral	overseas call_centres most times i '_ve had to call them for broadband problems .
neutral	generally the service itself is fairly reliable , but if you have a problem , prepare to explain it to several people several_times .
neutral	also prepare yourself to count to 00 each time you ' re asked the most basic of questions about things you " could try " to resolve it .
neutral	actually , the website '_s pretty good , but for some reason i almost never get what i '_ve asked for when i get to the train ( quiet carriage , facing forward , table seat ?
neutral	pot luck !
neutral	)..... also , very inflexible if you need to change your travel_plans .
neutral	on a few occasions i '_ve been early enough to catch an earlier train - go to the ticket office and invariably it '_s " buy another ticket "..... fair_enough when it '_s a peak time train , but with no allowance made for the ticket i already paid for ?
neutral	seems unfair .
neutral	have had some very good experiences with amazon with amazingly fast deliveries , and had some bad .
neutral	slow delivery plus something not arriving at all from an amazon connected supplier .
neutral	amazon did refund the money eventually though .
neutral	having been with this site for couple of years , when making a sale ( which is few and far between i might_add ), i am constantly informed after making a sale that the quality of the image is not good enough !
neutral	continually told to re - photograph the images is impossible as any of the works i have on the site are either sold or have been discarded due to damage .
neutral	i was a premium member but i am now in a quandary as the artwork is still not good enough even_though i have limited sizes available for buyers as i am useless with fauxtography .
neutral	blurry , lighting , half cropped signatures are always the problem + i hate making sales when i know that i will get an_email_stating the image is pixelated , blah_blah_blah !
neutral	i realise it is up to the seller to check images at 000_% but it would be good to have someone check the upload , someone who_knows what they are doing , advise the artist to amend this and that before a sale is made !
neutral	as an artist , i am constantly attempting to make the images larger , only to be told they are still not " good quality ".
neutral	a cancellation recently occurred and i was gutted again .
neutral	i am not a photographer , have no_idea about cameras and yet now i have to await my son in laws visit to see if he can do the job that faa needs to get a " quality " photograph that will be up to scratch , and then maybe i will become a premium member once again .. we will see !
neutral	i bought tyre from tyreleader fast delivery at my door in 0 days from france .
neutral	and they recommended all the garages near me that fitted and how much , thought great either deliver to garage or to home i chose home , just as well as i live in glasgow largest city in scotland , and not one of the garages i called fitted motorcycle_tyres or even had herd of them .
neutral	i said to garage do you know you are recommended on tyreleaders web_site .?
neutral	not one had even herd of them , glasgow is in the central belt of glasgow but no i had to call the usual_suspects victor divine , mickey oates , ride on , when called ducati great western road glasgow wanted me to wait a week , and all priced between £_00 and £_00 depending if wheel was on or off bike these_guys are bad enough with there over pricing , and should be_ashamed they want you to buy tyre from them .
neutral	so they have the monopoly on it , but sorry guys the internets here .
neutral	so yes tyreleader , great if you have tyre leavers .
neutral	in garage , but failing that what you save in price you lose on having it fitted .
neutral	so my advice phone the garages near you to see if they fit motorcycle_tyres and how much , when i asked victor divine honda glasgow .
neutral	how long it took he replied 00_minutes , me and my mate took wheel of with trolly , jack in garage in dark in 0 minutes shame on you victor divine and all the other suspects in glasgow you know who you are , i will never cross any of there doors again .
neutral	ps tyreleader asked for garages in glasgow and would investigate .
neutral	done nothing no explanation just an_apology .
neutral	i particularly like secrets of the phoenix as its not available on other_sites .
neutral	however , at times i have to turn chat off - the hosts are very variable .
neutral	some allow blatantly sexual banter while one female host in particular drags people off chat for the slightest reason , particularly where she does not agree with their jokes !
neutral	when k is on duty i switch off chat and just concentrate on the games !
neutral	winnings are up and down but i withdrew £_000 this weekend :)
neutral	first off let me say that i have always thought that talktalk have some good ideas and services but they really can let themselves down .
neutral	firstly calling to offer additional boosts to save call costs when the boost would cost more than my total call costs !
neutral	the real bugbear though is when you have a problem with the line , all starts off well and i can imagine that if they get it sorted first time the process would be pretty slick , the difficulties arise when the problem does not get fixed first time around .
neutral	their insistence on going back over the same process from the start each and every time is infuriating , why not pick_up from where you have got to !
neutral	then comes the matter of the text_messages to which you can either only reply with a yes or a no , or even worse when you cannot reply at all .
neutral	i had 0 texts in 0 days that were no reply type messages telling my problem was being worked on when i had already had the problem sorted_out .
neutral	talk about a waste of time !
neutral	there is more but i do not want this to turn in to a rant .
neutral	they need to get their problem handling system sorted_out .
neutral	the email from simply_electronics acknowledging my order and a subsequent email_advising about delivery were poorly formatted and difficult to decipher .
neutral	they gave a poor impression of the company .
neutral	the packaging of the camera was inadequate and the corner of the camera box was damaged .
neutral	the receipt came from google_checkout not simply_electronics .
neutral	simply_electronics would help themselves if they adopted systems and packaging of a similar standard as amazon .
neutral	the delivery came in 0 days [ which incuded two public holidays ].
neutral	this company must be cheap , the only reason any one uses them had a washer deliverd by them arrived damaged , pointed_out damage to delivery driver he said you can unpack it and use it .
neutral	had to order a new one to replace it , could get new one but could not get damaged one collected same day so have to find room for two washers . have to say the after service was better_than the delivery , and they went out of there way to sort my problem , nisha made sure my replacment washer and the damaged one were swopped on the same day , thank_you for that .
neutral	orderd from sports_direct but wrong adress put on parcel , sports_direct rang yodel to get it changed , i rang yodel three_times last time on the morning of delivery and was told they had heard from sports_direct and the adress had been changed , next im told parcel had been deliverd to wrong adress , the lincoln center never botherd changing the adress , was only delivery driver who went out of his way to correct the problem , and went the extra_mile to get me the parcel , many_thanks to him .
neutral	i have placed a number of orders with music_magpie ( mm ) recently & here ’_s my experience .
neutral	for cd ’_s , dvd ’_s & games , as long as there is a barcode , the disks are all there and the album artwork is perfect mm will accept and pay .
neutral	for clothing , mm accepts only a limited number of labels and the item descriptions on the website are not always how you would describe an item .
neutral	the items must be perfect for mm to accept and pay .
neutral	mm does not pay for “ missing ” items although they were all there when they left me .
neutral	the website works well enough when dealing_with barcodes but is slow dealing_with clothing and arbitrarily rejects items without stating a reason for rejection .
neutral	the amounts offered are not good but , in my experience , they are as good as car - booting & avoid the people factor .
neutral	overall , i lost 0 . 0 % from offer through accept / reject to payment .
neutral	you contract to mm t ’_s &_c ’_s so read , understand and accept they ’ re written by mm to mm ’_s advantage .
neutral	if you ’ re not happy don_’ t do it .
neutral	mm uses hermes for collections in my area .
neutral	if you ’ re not going to be in for the 00 hour collection window , the mm website offers very few characters for collection arrangements , “ in the side alley ” is about all you ’ ll get in and then the disinterested guy from hermes fails to collect from the side alley .
neutral	hermes is also more difficult to track than collect +.
neutral	collect_+ tracking shows up the delays built into the mm system .
neutral	eight boxes sent by collect +, all delivered to mm within 0 days but in some cases not “ received ” by mm for 00 days .
neutral	the average time ( despatch to cleared money ) was just under 00 days .
neutral	i bought a set of bathroom fittings and they were delivered as promised .
neutral	product quality was ok but fixing screws missing from one box so not checked before dispatch .. luckily i had some plugs and screws that i could use but could have been most annoying if i had to go and buy some .
neutral	i notified victoria_plumb but had not response .
neutral	i find paypal a useful financial service but as most of my transactions are small , the fees make it inappropriate for serious business volumes .
neutral	i have also found that they are very quick to return money to a purchaser without understanding the issue properly , seems like the seller is assumed to be at fault and this makes me wary about using paypal on and high loss transaction .
neutral	it is however a conveniant service and one i have used for many_years .
neutral	lovely_lady spoke to me on the phone , my only_criticism is that i was promised a phone_call at 0 - 00 and it was actually 0 - 00 when i got the call .
neutral	we decided to book and we were short on time , your site was really helpful but pricing was really high , we had to take it , we wanted to book the hotel ( crown plaza down town in dallas texas ), but we found it much_cheaper on other_sites .
neutral	yours
neutral	eslah
neutral	i was disappointed to discover that , although the information material said that my car could be left at the drop_off point close to the departures door , i was in fact required to leave it at point c of short_term parking , a couple of hundred yards away .
neutral	since i am_disabled this was a considerable inconvenience .
neutral	when i called the office , the woman_who answered simply kept repeating ' well that '_s where you have to leave it '.
neutral	however the man who answered the phone on my return 00 days_later was much more helpful and did in fact leave the car as close to the arrivals area as he could .
neutral	east_midlands airport_parking is not disabled friendly .
neutral	i booked car_rental with car del mar for a trip in december and i had problems .
neutral	i carried on with my february booking with advantage at toulouse via car del mar .
neutral	i wish i hadnt .
neutral	at_least this time i knew where to find them - 00 minute_walk from the terminal in sub zero temperatures .
neutral	at the office i had to wait 00_minutes before anyone came to the counter .
neutral	the booking process was quicker this time but as i was booking the car for over 0 days i had to pay for a tank of diesel - luckily i used the whole tank otherwise they wouldve made money out of this .
neutral	i then went to find the car .
neutral	it wasnt where they said it was and when i found it the car hadnt been cleaned .
neutral	it had been wiped over and looked terrible due to the snow / salt marks on it so i couldnt really examine it for damage .
neutral	as i had to drive 0 hours i didnt want to wait for it to be washed .
neutral	apart_from that the car was ok . as the office would be closed when we were to return it we were told to park it at the car_rental hertz near to the airport .
neutral	on return we did this and hertz initially would not accept it and said we had to take it back to advantage .
neutral	we refused and eventually hertz accepted the car .
neutral	i am now awaiting the final_bill for the fuel and the additional driver as hertz inisited on taking all the paperwork including the itemised bill for these items .
neutral	if i am charged for anything_else i will be expecting a refund .
neutral	i will be very careful in future not to accept a booking using advantage as the car supplier at toulouse airport as the difference in price is not worth the reduced level of service you get with them .
neutral	if you have young children , lots of bags or reduced mobility do not use advantage as you will struggle to get to the offices .
neutral	i seem to have had the same problems as a lot of se customers .
neutral	0 ) not being told they are hk based
neutral	0 ) generic replies to emails ( we are sorry for the delay , awaiting dispatch , high level of orders etc ), none of which answered my questions
neutral	0 ) upgrading of delivery process
neutral	i am sure this all stems from the fact that they wait for your order , and take your money , before they source the product .
neutral	this is highly suspect and very unethical .
neutral	however , the product did arrive in a reasonable amount of time and i am pleased with the camera .
neutral	but unless i hear they have raised their game , i will not be using them again .
neutral	order arrived really quickly , however some items were smaller than_expected and i do not think they are worth price paid , also when i first looked on the site that day it said free brio watch on order over a i think £_00 but by the time i came to placing my order this offer had disappeared and i got a free leg wipe thing in a shoddy looking packet .
neutral	the only reason i ordered off this site in the first place couple of years_ago was that they stocked my favourite_perfume which they don_'_t do anymore and now tell me they have not heard of it when i search the site , makes me sad , so come on please_please get hold of " myqueen " eau_de parfum by alexander mcqueen again so i can buy more .
neutral	but i am happy with the order and items i used so far .
neutral	thanks
neutral	my only issue is having received my order for two 0gb of paired ram one of the modules was faulty .
neutral	this module was replaced promptly
neutral	and is working_fine the computor is up to full speed .
neutral	i used offtek as an_alternative supplier as they were the cheaper when compared to crucial whom i normally use .
neutral	my dissapointment is i have incurred £ 0 : 00 registered postage_costs ( as recommended by offtek ) sending back their faulty item , i would have assumed the postage to be refunded .
neutral	any savings gained are lost and otherwise spoiled aa acceptable experience .
neutral	recently_purchased a charging dock and a car dock for a samsung_galaxy_s0 , the price was very competative .
neutral	the delivery although free took a lot longer_than i expected , i would have either considered paying for faster delivery or buying elsewhere had i known the actual delivery time .
neutral	i was going on the site feedback which focussed on super_fast delivery .
neutral	both items were delivered by royal_mail and in courier bags , both items had damaged boxes which was very dissapointing .
neutral	the boxes themselves are made from very thin cardboard and in my opinion should have had some added protection before being sent in courier bags .
neutral	for this reason i don_'_t see myself buying anything_else from this outlet , i would pay a little extra to get the items quicker but the damage to the boxes just shouldn_'_t happen .
neutral	a lot of messing for little money , ok telling you of each process that is going on but all that for so little
neutral	they suddenly take a dislike to a product and you never see it again ....!
neutral	the latest is my brand of sparkling water .. it was nearly the cheapest , in glass ... now its gone !
neutral	and its apparently not coming_back !
neutral	something_else i have to go to tesco / sainsbury for ....?
neutral	if you want last years gear shop at pc_world !
neutral	i never had a problem with city_link until they lost a 00 " tv i was getting .. next_day delivery !
neutral	what was worse at the time was that they said i had it and had signed for it !
neutral	it got sorted but i aged a couple of years in the process !
neutral	i have vm broadband cos i can get 000m / sec !
neutral	and it is quick !
neutral	* i dont take their tv cos its so expensive compared to sky !
neutral	finally got my delivery from the us .
neutral	happy driver but 00 days late .
neutral	urgent stuff from friday still not collected !!
neutral	0rd friday this has happened .
neutral	many options were available and it was easy to book a hostel for my travels .
neutral	i have and will recommend to others hostelbookers . com
neutral	had qualified for a free gift , it was in my basket , however somehow lost it on checkout .
neutral	when i contacted cheap_smells they refused to honour gift .
neutral	these goods were ordered on 00 feb and delivery is not now scheduled until 00 mar .
neutral	no telephone_call was made to schedule the delivery and the order did not show on the tracking_system despite the correct tracking code being entered .
neutral	i think bingocams is a great conception and it '_s a great site .
neutral	the ch make the games enjoyable and are great .
neutral	they involve everyone in the room .
neutral	there is a clique with some players and they can be quite hostile to anyone different winning !
neutral	!
neutral	the ch soon nip that in the bud though !!
neutral	the only_downside is that there are too many of the same winners / jp winners and if you don_'_t play all day every day you have very little chance of winning big .
neutral	a lot of the promotions are geared up for those who can play in the evening and there is very little incentive for the morning / daytime players to play .
neutral	i ordered two tyres online .
neutral	procedure was quick and easy , but it wouldn_'_t accept my postcode .
neutral	i had to use another one nearby , giving a different address .
neutral	not had that problem elsewhere .
neutral	parcel not received on time after paying premium postal rate !
neutral	not happy .
neutral	now have to return item as arrived too late .
neutral	i own a range_rover , the first man who came took one look at the damaged screen and told me he could not repair it .
neutral	he arranged for a replacement to be fitted , when i pointed_out the likelihood of rain he told me they would cover the range_rover with a canopy attached to their van .
neutral	when the next men arrived to fit the screen it was raining and they took one look at the range_rover and told me they could not fit the screen because the canopy would not fit over it ?
neutral	i then had to make an_appointment to take the range_rover to the nearest autoglass centre , which was some miles_away .
neutral	they could not fit the new screen because they found some small areas of rust under the old screen , from this point the service from autoglass worked well and following the removal of the old screen and the treatment of the rust the screen was fitted .
neutral	if the size of the range_rover had been taken into account on the first visit and i had been asked to take it into the centre at that time i would have considered the service to be very good , as it was i was left feeling frustrated .
neutral	i bought a dell_laptop as i ' d had good experiences with dell in the workplace .
neutral	took forever to arrive and impossible to track effectively - seemed to be lost for weeks .
neutral	all the names and contacts i was given were never to be heard of again .
neutral	their info was out of date , the delivery company had moved their base 0 years before and told dell many_times , but dell kept giving me the old address .
neutral	spent hours and hours on phone lines , being cut_off , told garbage , etc .
neutral	warning : dell assumes you have internet access , which i didn_'_t have till i got the laptop !
neutral	!
neutral	bread is best around , some fruit and veg good .
neutral	not good on veggie food .
neutral	recent shelf rearrangement has_been a pain , no logic to it , just wasting my time .
neutral	prewrapped cheese is a rip - off compared to the cheeses counter .
neutral	often have good deals on alcohol , but i don_'_t drink much .
neutral	cafe is handy , some branches better_than others .
neutral	they have at last managed to stop the fresh coffee overflowing the cups but he flavour is not as good as it was .
neutral	great strong bags - especially the ones with apples on them - bring more please !
neutral	you lost out badly on the time the fire alarms went and i had to go outside , then you unloaded my trolley .
neutral	i had a broken arm at the time and it had taken half the morning to load it .
neutral	quality of the coffee in your cafe has dropped dramatically , but you still stock some of the best ground_coffee around .
neutral	( your mocha limu is fantastic !)
neutral	don_'_t like having coin operated small trolleys while the big ones don_'_t need a coin .
neutral	????
neutral	?
neutral	most of all your queues after 00pm with only one check - out operator working ( edinburgh jewel )
neutral	your veggie options are good right now - please don_'_t withdraw them .
neutral	know you can '_t maybe solve it , but why do you attract massive customers with trolleys laden with junk food and huge loaves of bread ?
neutral	amazon now have so many international sellers , you may want to purchased a uk branded product to support the uk seller but end up receiving the item from another international country .
neutral	we have used intrerparcel for over 0 years .
neutral	they are priced very competitively but i guess with that you have to expect a downside and these_guys don_'_t disappoint !
neutral	easy to use website offers all the main couriers at around 00_% less_than their own websites for ad - hoc deliveries .
neutral	we use them once or twice a month and their ups prices in particular are very good .
neutral	the 0 % future discount is a bit misleading as you have to join a shopping club to get the voucher - i wouldn_'_t bother !
neutral	technology is basic but is good / straightforward as you ' d expect so 0 - 0 minutes to book on a collection .
neutral	no urgency though as most of the services are next_day and you really need to book before 00am to guarantee same day pick_up .
neutral	problems 0 or 0 times a year with missed deliveries or lost / damaged shipments - mostly resolved in the end .
neutral	offer of free insurance is a waste of time so if its a valuable shipment you should get additional cover .
neutral	contacting them is a trial , they should know that using a premium number and long hold times doesn_'_t go down well with customers nowadays !
neutral	!
neutral	all in all enough goes right to keep using them ....
neutral	i bought flights to lanzarote and decided to pay extra for extra_legroom .
neutral	on the way out , brilliant , on the way back , disastrous !
neutral	the rhs of the forward cabin were just normal pitch , useless .
neutral	cock and bull excuses about configuration changes of the aircraft takes away half of the extra_legroom .
neutral	and jet0 were still selling extra_legroom at check in according to the ticker .
neutral	so it was a flight of two halves for me .
neutral	going out great , coming home , a nightmare .
neutral	i ' m not sure of the legality of changing an aircraft '_s configuration after selling extra_legroom which now doesn_'_t exist but as far as i ' m concerned it '_s an_absolute disgrace .
neutral	it '_s all very well giving a refund but i need the extra space and because i ' d booked and payed for it i should have got it .
neutral	beware of promises !
neutral	order some unlicenced mite killing product which was sent swiftly .
neutral	emailed regarding use / dosage / reapplication on bantams and no reply came .
neutral	i understand reluctance on part of seller but if they will sell it , advice should be forthcoming .
neutral	in this day and age with technology the way it is .... it really is unacceptable to make people wait all day for a delivery .
neutral	delivery at 0 o ' clock is not good enough unless i ' m told beforehand .
neutral	if i went to the garage ( freezer is housed in there ) i would have to check the front_door for delivery as these_people barely wait long enough for you to actually get to the front_door .
neutral	i '_ve missed no end of deliveries when i '_ve been in ... to find a post - card saying sorry you were out .... well guess_what ...
neutral	i wasn_'_t .
neutral	not bad service
neutral	no_frills airline had a problem with the plane divereted to manchester waited for another plane to take us to tenerife , was kept_informed at all times .....
neutral	good interest_rates but it '_s slow investing and not many new investments .
neutral	money should not be in limbo whilst waiting for drawdown , other_sites such as wellesley are instant and are also backed by assets .
neutral	reporting is poor and needs improving .
neutral	money transfer in should also be quicker e . g use faster transfer direct into own account .
neutral	my view it '_s one of a portfolio of p0p sites intended to spread the risk .
neutral	when i first came upon this site , i really liked it as i thought i was getting honest opinions of shopping sites .
neutral	i even posted a couple of reviews of companies i had bought from and after_reading comments about companies i was thinking of buying from changed my mind about them and tried another company which had good reviews .
neutral	so far so good .
neutral	that is until i bought furniture from oakfurnitureland . co . uk and received below par furniture , i posted a review which was removed , i received an_email from trustpilot asking me to verify i actually had dealings with the company as the company could not verify i was a customer from the information on the trustpilot website .
neutral	i sent trustpilot my receipt to prove i was a genuine customer but almost two_weeks_later my review is still not showing .
neutral	on scrolling down the reviews of this company i noticed they had excellent reviews but a lot of reviews had been removed and were being_investigated , i assume they were giving negative_feedback like myself .
neutral	what is the point of ths site if the company who gives bad service or sells rubbish stuff can get the reviews removed ?
neutral	starting to think this might not be a site i can trust .
neutral	took them a week to assemble the order , other wise all ok , goods as ordered , well_packed .
neutral	i ordered this particular bunch of flowers for my mothers 00th_birthday .
neutral	she_loves roses and purple .
neutral	the flowers arrived on time and were well_presented .
neutral	the colours and arrangement were lovely .
neutral	i only have two complaints ...
neutral	the roses , on the second day , have already started to brown at the edges of some petals .
neutral	secondly , i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for a bigger ' bunch '.
neutral	for the price i was expecting more .
neutral	i ' m a little disappointed to be honest , but , my mother was very happy .
neutral	hotpoint htv00s stainless_steel visor cooker_hood .
neutral	one of the cheapest stainless_steel hoods i could find .
neutral	thin metal but sturdy enough for the job .
neutral	one rear light with sbc bulb ( small bayonet cap ) & three fan speeds .
neutral	quite noisy on top speed but it '_s cheap !
neutral	you can set the internal hood flaps to recirculate back into the kitchen or extract via a standard circular duct .
neutral	mains_lead only 0 metre long & no 00a plug supplied .
neutral	flat mesh filter with a circular carbon granule one on fan inlet .
neutral	its a standard fit & can be mounted by top , side or rear screws .
neutral	handyman skills required to install but no more .
neutral	the mainly pictorial instructions were abysmal .
neutral	i am an engineer so could work out for myself how it was mounted & configured but for someone less technical it would be difficult .
neutral	once installed it works well and sucks in food steam / smoke from the cooker below , blowing out non - smelly air
neutral	i would recommend it as an item that does the job but you get what you pay for and spending more may get you a better quality one .
neutral	i had nothing to compare it too .
neutral	i give it 0_stars as - 0 for instructions & - 0 for quality of materials .
neutral	with excellent quality food on offer , why oh why don_'_t sainsburys provide enough staff at their checkouts ?
neutral	my branch in frome , somerset often has queues of customers waiting to pay while staff are running around with earpieces or watching shoppers getting more and more frustrated .
neutral	no wonder the tills at asda are constantly ringing .
neutral	i bought the tiger k tape which was a good price at £ 0 . 00 +_vat , however the next_day delivery by courier charged at £ 0 . 00 was expensive and unnecessary .
neutral	give the customer a cheaper royal_mail option .
neutral	a little obserd to pay more for delivery than the product is worth .
neutral	this is the only reason i gave this review 0_stars .
neutral	we booked through rentalcars . com as it was cheapest .
neutral	next time we '_ll probably pay a little more and hope for better .
neutral	arrived at pisa and there was no queue so we had the comprehensive sales_pitch to sell us the extra insurance as otherwise we would have to pay € 0000 excess ( this amount was reserved on my credit_card anyway and paying € 00 per day extra wouldn_'_t have changed this ).
neutral	this was boring and time wasting but i had expected it and managed to resist this rip - off .
neutral	we were given a free upgrade to bigger car , thank_you , and told to go over to collect the car that had no scratches or damage at all , but if we saw anything we should bring it to the attention of the man there .
neutral	having been ripped_off previously ( by europecar ) i knew better_than to accept their word but i was surprised to find that the car was covered with scratches , some damaged paintwork , a damaged mirror and 0 damaged hubcaps .
neutral	maybe they just save_money by having us punters do the work for them or maybe they would just have charged me for the damage if i hadn_'_t spent 00_mins documenting it , either way that could have been better service if they had made an accurate record of the damage instead of telling_me there was none .
neutral	car was ok , hadn_'_t been washed , windscreen washer didn_'_t work but nothing serious .
neutral	on returning car the man barely checked it ( apart_from the fuel gage ) ( but did check the car before me quite thoroughly and found some damage that may or may not have been there before according to the user ) and sent me off with the paperwork to the office .
neutral	unfortunately there was a queue of people waiting to go through the insurance sales routine in front of me and each one took 00_minutes so with just one person on the desk , it was an_hour before i could drop_off the papers .
neutral	fortunately we had allowed 0 hours before the flight so we just managed to get the shuttle_bus , go through check - in , grab a sandwich to eat through security , and then board with no time to spare .
neutral	could have done without the stress .
neutral	suggested improvements :
neutral	offer insurance with a reasonable excess to start with .
neutral	make_sure the damage inventory is complete and accurate .
neutral	wash cars
neutral	fix minor_issues ( windscreen washer )
neutral	have separate pick - up / drop_off people on the desk .
neutral	thank_you for :
neutral	free upgrade
neutral	allowing us to return with full_tank ( instead of saying it had to be returned empty and charging a flat rate €_000 to re - fill as happened to my sister with a different company at pisa )
neutral	polite and friendly staff .
neutral	bathing aids : cast & dressing protectors : cast and bandage protector - adult - long leg ... not suitable to use with compression bandaging .
neutral	believe this should be stated in description .
neutral	you matched a rival comp on price , you also said you would throw in some firelighters free but did not arrive .
neutral	first of all , i hate the new website .
neutral	full of glitches , hard to navigate and their stock_levels are unreliable with some items selling out quickly and not replenished .
neutral	there isn_'_t enough info about the product and they give no guidance that i can see on the exact lengths of short medium and long for trousers etc which makes_life difficult as the models they use are usually 0 ' 00 so the pictures are no help at all .
neutral	i am not impressed with this season '_s clothes which veer from dated and boring to quirky and overpriced .
neutral	they don_'_t seem to be able to decide where to pitch themselves and with shoes for example they offer cheap synthetic heels then jump to decent leather courts at £_000 !
neutral	what about something in between .
neutral	i ' d be shopping in lk bennet and upwards if i wanted to spend more than £_000 /£ 000 on a pair of shoes .
neutral	their underwear , men '_s socks etc still seem ok , but this is hardly enough to keep them going .
neutral	on the plus side , their instore delivery is prompt , though it is a shame you can return via simply food .
neutral	however , seem to have a good range of corner shops that you can return to .
neutral	unable to purchase due to bank security check each time i try to make a purchase from gamesbite resulting in purchase being turned down untill check complete .
neutral	which means i am unable to re - order for 00_hrs due to failed order while completing security check .
neutral	which means i have to source points else where so i don_'_t miss the offer i was hoping to purchase .
neutral	meaning not sure if after 00_hrs i would still be able to purchase .
neutral	maybe you should add paypal to your payment_options or once a successful purchase has_been made log the details so that there is no need for security check everytime .
neutral	just used this service .
neutral	order came 0 mins early - everything there .
neutral	not bad
neutral	i needed to change my booking - that was done pretty quickly and efficiently and did not cost too much extra so that was good .
neutral	the hassle was at the airport ( manchester t0 multi - story ).
neutral	they are meant to detect your booking via your license plate - that didn_'_t work ( and i suspect that was a problem for others trying to enter at same time ).
neutral	i didn_'_t have the qr code ( or confirmation_email ) to hand and had a queue behind me , so pressed the green button .
neutral	once parked i then located my email , and realised that it was probably safer to leave as once you have pressed the green button your booking is not recognised .
neutral	so i left ( getting charged £ 0 . 00 ) and tried again .
neutral	still didn_'_t recognise license plate and didn_'_t recognise qr code , but could speak to someone via intercom and give booking number .
neutral	still don_'_t know if i have done the correct thing - therefore i think it is quite complicated ( and i am £ 0 . 00 out of pocket )
neutral	i am looking for a holiday in salzburg , austria and have not found what i am looking for with last_minute , although they are the first people to come up on a web search they don_'_t do it for me .
neutral	i '_ve done this flight from heathrow to nassau many_times .
neutral	the quality of the on - board service varies from excellent to appalling , depending on who is in the team .
neutral	therefore i cannot give more than three stars .
neutral	i have been insulted by cabin_crew and treated like a princess - this does not make for a confident traveller , as you never know how your innocent request for a glass of water is going to be taken .
neutral	but the pilots usually arrive at the destination on time or early , so it '_s not all bad !
neutral	0nd order , first was brilliant - bulk anti - hystamine .
neutral	this one i ordered 0 x 00 one - a - day multivitamins .
neutral	when it was arrived it was 0 x 00 .
neutral	still a great price , but a little disappointed .
neutral	will still use them again though .
neutral	however , the delivery charge is where they make their money .
neutral	far too expensive .
neutral	ok , they are usually the cheapest when you ' re after something , especially electronic products .
neutral	recently i '_ve been reading about their 0 hours staff and the terrible work schedules .
neutral	they are cheap but what what cost ?
neutral	found bravofly after searching with kayak who directed me there .
neutral	i booked & paid .
neutral	i could not then find the booking on the airline website .
neutral	i then read some reviews of bravofly .
neutral	whilst i accept that people only post bad_experiences , they looked pretty scary .
neutral	then found my booking on the airline site .
neutral	all looks good , but we '_ll see what happens when i try to check in and go to the airport .
neutral	my order was delayed twice .
neutral	no contact by them after 0nd delay .
neutral	when i eventually got hold of them having left messages .
neutral	delivery was near instant .
neutral	so bad communication , bad record keeping , bad order progressing .
neutral	good radiator , good price
neutral	...
neutral	i got stung for charges during a transfer of funds back to me .
neutral	cheeky !
neutral	......... but they don_'_t deliver to bfpo .
neutral	they do however deliver internationally now .................. just not to bfpo .
neutral	bit of a slap in the face with a wet fish really .
neutral	not a fast moving company , from my email record , over a week to be dispatched & if my memory serves me correctly then some time before delivery .
neutral	the £_00 . 00 battery arrived too late for the holiday :-(
neutral	just over a year later they ask me for a revew .
neutral	0_stars is given for a acceptable experience , which ended with the promised product being delivered in the desired quality .
neutral	if it is not common order in plentey of time .
neutral	the battery worked well this march holiday
neutral	it was a very quick service and it was waiting for me when we came home though i thought i had to sign for as it came by the tracker post
neutral	caravanning round the uk i was looking for a network that supported iphone & gave good service .
neutral	o0 has done this though i am surprised with the various ' blackspots ' in coverage in scotland & middle england compared to my wife who '_s phone is orange .
neutral	quality / depth of service is certainly better_than hers when we both have signal but she has signal more often than i
neutral	all that seems to good to be true usually is too good to be true .
neutral	been waiting over 0 weeks now for the money to arrive .
neutral	phone was received by them before the end of march .
neutral	the company made some excuse that they cant send the cheques all out at once , sounds_like a cashflow problem to me .
neutral	update .
neutral	the owner mark went out of his way to put my money in the bank within an_hour of him learning of my problem , i have revised my original review to reflect the good handling albeit late of the person in charge ,
neutral	thumbs_up for better service after a bad start .
neutral	arrived for breakfast at 000am , member of staff crossed my name off but that was the only contact staff made .
neutral	i wanted a veggie breakfast as advertised but non was on offer .
neutral	there was no staff around to ask how breakfast works & another guest showed me where to get tea and coffee from .
neutral	the hotel is sited well for airport and bus 000 from airport goes reasonably close .
neutral	a 00 min walk from the bus_stop .
neutral	if you have heavy bags you might want to take a cab .
neutral	security / bed good .
neutral	no window to open .
neutral	well i bought a yamaha np 00 from ebay and it was supposed to arrive on thursday but it hadnt arrive so i phoned inter linked and said they hadnt recived the order so i phoned fair deal music and told me they had the purchase but hadnt send the order and said they will send it for tuesday week after thursday hoping it '_ll come
neutral	booking the appointment and the fitting were by two completely
neutral	different departments .
neutral	booking the visit was pointless .
neutral	i originally booked for the the tuesday .
neutral	i was telephoned the day after i ' d booked and told the tyres wouldn_'_t be at the branch until the thursday .
neutral	also , could i ' phone the branch on the thursday_morning to make_sure the tyres were there .
neutral	when i ' phoned the branch they had no knowledge of my appointment and had to ' phone me back to comfirm the appointment .
neutral	the branch was faultless , though i did have to wait about 00_minutes which i would have done if i ' d just turned_up .
neutral	i had thought that by making an online booking i would have been fitted in straight_away without the wait .
neutral	therefore when i need new tyres in future i shall just call into my local_branch and take my turn , which i did anyway .
neutral	online booking i give 0_stars , local_branch 0_stars ( because of the wait ) hence the rating at the top !
neutral	my wife continues to berate me for letting the app upgrade occur ( 0 month now ) the previous maybe 0000 app was easy to use and presented products in clear simple vibrant colours .
neutral	the new app is cluttered with small product images and in presentation like wandering round a warehouse - shopping_experience now painful for me every friday as she mutters her way through it with the odd accusing glance ... have just checked out the waitrose site which dose look better so will be bravely suggesting a change .
neutral	delivery excellent , do not expect as much when returning items .
neutral	i thought having the groceries delivered to the door would be great as i work full time and my time off is precious .
neutral	the delivery was prompt and the delivery man very polite , problem was that the fresh items delivered had one or two day shelf_life , many items where looking past the shelf_life .
neutral	i contacted when i at first glance saw items that had perished who where extremely apologetic and sent me an e_- voucher to compensate me .
neutral	but as the next couple of days unravelled i found more items with same day delivery shelf_life .
neutral	this experience has put me off getting my groceries delivered .
neutral	as long as you don_'_t expect them to stock any of the stuff they advertise on the website they are ok for the odd deal .
neutral	however , my local_store has got into a bad habit of pushing certain brands ( do they get a bonus for this ?)
neutral	which can make in - store browsing a bit tiresome ( have you considered an lg sir ?).
neutral	note to self , always wear headphones when entering shop to drown out the sales_pitch :)
neutral	great prices if you are close enough to pop into the store to avoid postal_charges .
neutral	the only black mark is the amount of grey_import stuff they sell which means any warranty may be with scan rather_than the manufacturer ( samsung disk drives are a case in point ).
neutral	i haven_'_t had to return anything yet so i can '_t comment on their customer service .
neutral	great prices if you wait for a sale , but the quality of their gear varies wildly .
neutral	i '_ve had walking boot from them that have started to fall_apart in a week , and others that will probably outlive me !
neutral	i ' m no fan of their ' discount card ' gimmick either , but the sheer range of goods they stock instore keeps me going back and the staff are always very helpful .
neutral	i stopped using this company a few_years_ago after a very poor experience trying to send back a faulty motherboard .
neutral	they insisted that i had to accept a repair rather_than a refund ( on a brand_new item ) and refused to accept the law of the land that states i should have the choice of a full_refund .
neutral	it '_s a shame as i keep seeing links to gear on their site at very tempting prices .
neutral	maybe i should give them another go but once_bitten ...
neutral	a couple of years_ago i would have given screwfix 0_stars , but prices keep rising in relation to other sellers , stock_levels haven_'_t kept up with the product range and the discounts given at the new ' trade counter ' are being paid for by everyone on the other side of the dividing wall ( cheers for that !).
neutral	add to this constant issues with account numbers changing and it '_s just not the same as it was before the takeover .
neutral	i still use them when i have to , but begrudgingly now rather_than happily :(
neutral	another convenient store that repeatedly fails on stock_levels , partly because the way they store stuff means if they say they have 00 in stock , 00 are probably broken / missing / on a pallet somewhere_else .
neutral	at_least the big stores store some of the wood horizontally , unlike wickes where 00_% of it is warped and twisted !
neutral	another gripe is the new ' trade counter ' that means if you are buying 00 sheets of plasterboard from a b + q warehouse and don_'_t have a trade card , you now have to lug the stuff through the old dears buying begonias to pay at the normal till !
neutral	i use tesco every week as it '_s convenient .
neutral	scratch that , it '_s not just convenient it '_s everywhere !
neutral	from a point of view of customer experience they are better_than the co - op ( where do they get their staff ?)
neutral	but still found wanting compared to other stores .
neutral	maybe a little staff training is in order , or possibly just give them more money ?
neutral	i '_ve contacted probikekit to query delivery and they haven_'_t got back to me today ( yet ).
neutral	ordered 00th , supposed delivery 00th , then told by parcelforce 00th , contacted both company and parcelforce ( parcelforce 0 times today by phone , twice by email , westin '_s line had switched to an answer phone by 0pm ), order finally delivered sat am , not to the right house ( yes we were in ), but 00 is close enough !
neutral	have to say i have no_idea why parcelforce can '_t understand the instructions when they are plastered in a large label on the top of the box " perishable - do not return to depot ".
neutral	now contacted their customer_services by their emailed ' ticket ' system and await their response to wether the meat is indeed consumable still as it is right at the limit of the 00_hours and all the packing had melted .
neutral	sadly , our first order and a terrible experience .
neutral	amended to 0_stars from 0 : as i said , to be fair to westin , they seem to have been let_down by parcelforce .
neutral	a week_later , a ticket opened with customer service , and answered , and one phone_call and a refund agreed without_any quibble .
neutral	if it was just westin i had had to deal with i ' d certainly have given 0 or 0 .
neutral	i really wouldn_'_t bother , i know some people find it brilliant , but not me !
neutral	i was unlucky .
neutral	i asked for a delivery to another address but paid by paypal but nothing warned me that this would mean it was sent to my home address and the one i had asked for would be ignored .
neutral	i picked this up but on sat when no - one was there to stop the delivery .
neutral	when i rang on monday the chaps said the paypal thing was a bit of an issue which needed to be ironed out and he would recall the laptop , refund me and ring me when it turned_up to see waht i wanted to do .
neutral	£ days_later no call .
neutral	i rang again and got a lady_who said the paypal issue was in your ts_&_cs and i should have realised .
neutral	i said it was astupid place to put it and it needed an upfront warning or even refuse to allow paypal payment if you wanted a non - home address .
neutral	the laptop hadn_'_t come back yet so she said i should wait .
neutral	ok but no need for the hassle .
neutral	i got a refund a couple of days_later , but no phone_call .
neutral	i reordered the laptop online , paying by visa .
neutral	next_day i get a text ; problem with the order , please ring .
neutral	i ring .
neutral	same lady .
neutral	why did i want to send to non - home address .
neutral	i explained i was buying the laptop for my sister who_lives in belfast .
neutral	i live in london .
neutral	she said they didn_'_t usually deliver to a foreign address .
neutral	i said belfast is not foreign .
neutral	she said it was over the water !
neutral	i said there was nothing about this on the site and i had paid the non - mainland postage .
neutral	she said it was in the ts_&_cs .
neutral	i had read them by this time .
neutral	like the paypal thing it isn_'_t .
neutral	she reluctantly said she would release the laptop .
neutral	next_day i get a text saying delivery refused by addressee .
neutral	i discover from dpd that this is because i have put my own postcode in not the belfast postcode ( stupid mistake on my part ).
neutral	i ring again .
neutral	same lady .
neutral	you put in the wrong postcode so laptop in woodford , she says .
neutral	could it be changed i said , expecting a fight .
neutral	yes , she syas and does it .
neutral	phew .
neutral	laptop turns up next_day in belfast .
neutral	amazingly_quick .
neutral	next thing i discover i have been charged twice on my visa bill .
neutral	i ring .
neutral	chap said he would have to look into it and would ring back .
neutral	no call back .
neutral	left it a few_days .
neutral	rnag again .
neutral	told repayment had been authorised on 00 / 0 .
neutral	left it a few more days .
neutral	repayment eventually turned_up on 0 / 0 .
neutral	good points ;: excellent price , good text comms about delivery , you do the right things eventually .
neutral	bad points ( which could be fixed ) - no - one ever rings back and over - defensiveness when things go_wrong .
neutral	need tp refuse paypal for alternative address .
neutral	the night before collection , we used online facility to extend the rental period and request a collection earlier in the day .
neutral	on arrival at the collection office at the new time , we found the office was not aware of the online changes .
neutral	why can '_t online booking revisions be relayed to collection points in less_than 00_hours ?
neutral	also , the gps system was useless .
neutral	the software was far too slow for inner city travel .
neutral	we had driven past the turnings before the gps caught up .
neutral	and the gps was unable to find one address .
neutral	you provide decent cars , why do you offer bottom - of - the - range satnavs ?
neutral	despite these administration disappointments , the service from the office staff was excellent .
neutral	the front office is doing it '_s job , the back office must shape up !
neutral	this merchant is fine if you can work out the part number from the manual and order it online .
neutral	support is useless as they never answer the phone or respond to email , though this is normal for r / c model shops , none of which seem to care to support the complex and fallible products they sell .
neutral	beware also a noticeable snobbishness in favour of petrol and against electric models !
neutral	the service was efficient and quick .
neutral	my ( husband '_s ) 0 photos were subtle in tone and colour but with a fresh ( winter ) sparkle to them - this was lost in the cards and the colours appeared dulled and in one case ' greyed '.
neutral	just usable but disappointing .
neutral	i chose small cards and would have preferred the ' cardtown ' logo to be appropriately smaller , less obtrusive and also to be left off the envelope .
neutral	i know the card source needs to be shown , but i wasn_'_t paying for showy advertising .
neutral	probably won_'_t use cardtown again
neutral	we use the shuttle a lot on our visits to mallorca , mainly_because it is decent value when compared to the cost of a return taxi .
neutral	however there are downsides that you need to be aware of .
neutral	firstly , there can be very long q '_s at the check - in desk , the last thing you need after a long flight , the tedium of going through passport control , and your bags coming off the carousel last .
neutral	there has to be a better way in this day and age .
neutral	secondly , there will be an almost inevitable wait of up to 00_minutes ( well that '_s what the say on the website ).
neutral	the bus will wait_until they have crammed on as many people from as many flights as they can .
neutral	unfortunately you do this without the engine running and hence no air - con .
neutral	with outside temperatures between 00 and 00 in june , july and august you can imagine what it '_s like inside the bus !
neutral	finally , they have a smartphone app which is pretty good .
neutral	you can check your return pick - up time but you still have to make a phone_call to confirm your return_journey .
neutral	surely this could be done from the app ?
neutral	got into the car - park no problem and found a space immediately .
neutral	on our return we thought that the signs for the car - park were really poor .
neutral	if we hadn_'_t have remembered the route we took on arrival we might still be there now !
neutral	tyres and price ok garage used one stop not so good .
neutral	tyres_fitted on friday and having to take back next week to have balancing redone , also had to go back as fitter left my centre cap of , these are about 00 quid and it was lucky i checked before i left the garage as i have been caught like this before
neutral	i purchased two flights and was charged in gbp .
neutral	credit_card bill comes and is £ 0 more_expensive involving time_consuming calls to credit_card company .
neutral	flowers as_described , although next_day delivery did not happen until 0pm .
neutral	just lacks customers :(
neutral	from a usability perspective our full width sofa bed is great and it came at an unmatchable price .
neutral	once assembled , it is a full double_bed size when pulled_out and the sofa itself is wide enough to use as a single bed , so ideal for what we wanted - a put you up in our spare room .
neutral	it is also a large comfortable sofa in its own right .
neutral	however .....
neutral	as clearly warned , it arrived on a pallet and really needs two people to safely take it off the pallet and transer it to the room where it is to be constructed .
neutral	it is essentially a 0d jigsaw puzzle which has to be built piece by piece from good quality mdf ( heavy ), sponge and fabric ; the last items to be fitted are the arms ( which are pre_- constructed ) so it is not possible , as with most sofas , to lift it by the arms to move it .
neutral	in fact , it is nigh on impossible to move without it disassembling itself ; it is very heavy .
neutral	so , in summary , great value item for the spare room , but i wouldn_'_t personally recommend it for your lounge .
neutral	for a product ( por00 fuel preservative & stabilizer ( us pint )) costing_£_00 . 00 to pay £ 0 . 00 postage will unfortunately make me think very carefully before buying again - sorry !
neutral	the order was for some spare bulbs for a bell push .
neutral	the product supplied was a manufacturer '_s original replacement , and the price charged was competitive with other_suppliers .
neutral	however , the delivery in 0 - 0 days slipped somewhat .
neutral	i received notification of a despatch date which was at the longest applicable under their terms .
neutral	i rang some 0 days_later to let them know the consignment had not been delivered .
neutral	i accept that they had a supply problem ( not stated at the time of ordering ), but surely some communication notifying the late despatch would have been helpful .
neutral	i have waited in all day for my parcel .
neutral	went down to the garage to find it in there .
neutral	no knock on the door and no note left through the door , so i waited in all day for nothing .
neutral	suggest dpd get more reliable drivers who are prepared to deliver to the door , or at_least advise that they have been .
neutral	following my review , after a phone_call from the driver , he insisted that they had knocked and received no answer .
neutral	he could not explain_why if that was the case , there was no note left through the door .
neutral	i am however increasing my rating on the assumption that he is not a liar .
neutral	i have upgraded my opinion of interparcel , because although their response to my non collection issues by hermes ( who should be avoided at all costs ), was slow and cost me my sale , eventually tried to rectify the situation .
neutral	interparcel need to be more careful about the couriers that they support , as ( was in the case with my customer ) the seller gets the blame .
neutral	hermes who were the culprit got away scott free ( or so they think ).
neutral	i do not think with the reviews that hermes are getting on trustpilot . com and also facebook that they will be around for much longer .
neutral	interparcel should drop hermes as soon as possible before it tarnishes their reputation !
neutral	the products are as you would expect , but given i specifically paid extra for them to be delivered within 00_hours , had the email_confirmation and they didn_'_t arrive ( with no explanation or forewarning ).
neutral	i had to chase up and they arrived 0 - 0 working_days after ordering , what '_s the point ?
neutral	ineeded to know something about the booking i made with lowcost yesterday , so phoned the 0000 no re existing booking to be promptly informed that no agents were available and it would cost me 00p_per_minute to wait !
neutral	!
neutral	thought oh well , at first , then after almost 00_minutes of waiting ..... and much out of pocket , and in sheer frustration , called new booking line ... and , lo and behold got through straight_away ....... was not impressed i can tell you ....... what it said to me ???
neutral	we got your money now sod off !!
neutral	thankfully the agent for new bookings was able to answer my very simple enquiry ........ but now i await an extortianate phone bill !!
neutral	thanks lowcost !
neutral	initially my add on partner paid rental_cars £_00 . 00 to hire a small car from enterprise . however when he got to enterprise they would not let him rent as he didnt have enough utility_bills to show them ( despite tv licence and aletter to him at his current address ).
neutral	however on asking for a refund so as to hire elsewhere they said it was rentalcars who had his money , not them . so he asked rentalcars for a refund and they refused ..... after a tense conversation with a manager there my friend managed to get £_00 . 00 back ..... money for old rope and a nasty rip_off , so beware good rental prices but , with a nasty sting in the tail !!
neutral	to add_insult to injury my add on driver got fined for parking at his own workplace despite having informed the company he was in a temp hire_car and them agreeing it was ok and signing reg no in every day ... this was obviously a mistake .... fine was squashed ... however , enterprise have charged £_00 . 00 admin_fee to my bank_account and despite agreeing if the fine was deemed wrong and squashed , i would get my admin_fee back , no such luck ..... even after several emails to the traffic violation dept ... i have heard_nothing !!
neutral	i hired this car as a goodwill_gesture for a friend ... never ever again will i help anyone out like this again ....... even_though this was not his error ... i have been charged for it and i am the only one out of pocket for doing a good deed .!!
neutral	and enterprise have received £_00 . 00 for absolutely zilch !!
neutral	how is that fair ?
neutral	no wonder they are the cheapest car_rental company around ..... thats because they make their money in other ways , obviously !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered item early on thursday ( item was in stock ) but did not receive it until late the next wednesday , there was no way of tracking its progress
neutral	they need to use a better delivery company other than royal_mail
neutral	having run this catalogue for many_years i have seen many changes and not many of them for the good .
neutral	it used to be the sum total of your order could be spread over 00 weeks or 00 weeks , now it '_s each individual item which can make the payments too high therefore limiting the number of items bought , so catalogue is missing out on profit .
neutral	it used to be a free phone number but now it '_s premium , which is not good as it costs a lot of money by the time all the options have been gone_through .
neutral	i know that catalogue prices have always been higher than shops but now the difference is getting far too much i . e .
neutral	ps0 in the shops £_000 in the catalogue £_000 .
neutral	£_00 is far too much of a difference .
neutral	also not getting rewards on sale items and other things is not fair on the person running the catalogue .
neutral	if items are out of stock then remove them from the on - line page or at_least mark it as " out of stock " it would be good if you could also request your cash rewards on - line as having to spend so much money in a phone_call to get it is not good enough and also the length of time it takes to get is not good .
neutral	it would be nice for long_term loyal_customers to get a wee reward or incentive as a thank_you .
neutral	i '_ve been using usenext for over a year .
neutral	the service has_been ok but you have little idea what you download until you do and i would guess most content is pirated and therefore useless and it frequently contains viruses .
neutral	it was ok for watching some us tv series but i got a bit fed_up after a while and decided to cancel my subscription .
neutral	i did this and cancelled the paypal automatic payment as well .
neutral	it seems matters then got a little out of control .
neutral	i received an offer of another free_trial which i did not take up and despite this usenext confirmed i needed to take no further action .
neutral	i assumed all was well at that point .
neutral	but then i started to get demands for payment for access after our agreement had been cancelled and after my access had ended .
neutral	these demands included penalty charges on top of subscription charges that i did not want and could not use .
neutral	the demands included links that required my response but directed me to missing pages .
neutral	i tried to communicate with them but they use a message portal which does not confirm the content of your message for your records and invokes the usual numb call_center reply .
neutral	in the end i had to send a recorded letter to them .
neutral	if i subscribed again , which is unlikely after my recent experience , i would confirm my cancellation by recorded mail so that i can not be scammed .
neutral	usenext - subscribers will come and go .
neutral	this has to be their decision .
neutral	you rightly have control and allow access after payment up front so you can not loose .
neutral	trying to trap customers will mean they are less likely to return .
neutral	i would probably have come back for a while after a break of a few_months but not after this experience .
neutral	it is simply not worth the hassle .
neutral	they seem to like to blame website for pricing , offers inconsistencies .
neutral	i ordered a laptop and wireless adapters / extenders should have been free but even_though free on website £_00 added in checkout .
neutral	had to cancel order .........
neutral	another time order accepted , no product arrived and on phoning them , they said my card_details were incorrect , even_though they stored them on their system from previous orders and i have used them again since ..........
neutral	but price was not honoured as offer had finished when i contacted them to find out where my laptop was ........
neutral	sales & service was good but the product was not , the speaker on the iphone is covered over by the vynal pouch causing very low sound .
neutral	the iphone fits too low in the retaining pouch blocking the home button somewhat & the iphone can slip out of the pouch very easily .
neutral	i am now shopping for a better iphone wallet .
neutral	chris
neutral	was attracted_by the £_00 joining bonus , and then went on to earn enough to get over the payout threshold .
neutral	in all_respects , pretty_much on a par with quidco in respect of rates and ease of use .
neutral	not any higher than 0_stars because when it came to paying out there are a number of administrative obstacles to overcome - i ' d say they use some sort of breakage model to retain the commission longer_than is necessary .
neutral	eventually got paid out though , but it was quite a wait .
neutral	the tesco credit_card is pretty middle of the road in many respects .
neutral	a 00 . 0 % interest rate as i write , and for new customers a reasonable free balance transfer and 0 % on purchases offer .
neutral	what set it apart was the rewards programme - you can use clubcard_points to convert to cash , or to convert to airmiles , with extra rewards if you use the card in a tesco petrol_station .
neutral	this was one of the very best ways of collecting airmiles until recently .
neutral	now , tesco has more or less halved the rewards points , and of course airmiles has moved to avios at virtually the same time , and now passes the taxes that were once absorbed on to you .
neutral	a double whammy hit on the benefits from using a tesco credit_card .
neutral	what was once a 0 star offer is now reduced to a middle of the road one .
neutral	still a good card , but my , how the rewards have been cut .
neutral	although i have used animed_direct for ages and delivery has always been a bit slower_than other_suppliers , i allow for this when ordering .
neutral	however on the last order , funds were taken from my account on the day of ordering but goods were not despatched for a further week , despite_being told that if this could not take place within three days i would be notified , this didn_'_t happen .
neutral	the online system is brilliant and certainly saves you rushing around when youi can reserve and collect !
neutral	the only problems seems to be lack of stock and chosen stores so sometimes when ordering a few items you cannot get them all from same store which is not good as they only hold reserved items until end of the next_day and if you have to wait for another item to come back into stock it means going back to collect !
neutral	we had a delivery of an electric towel_radiator that had no brackets , after several phone_calls , sending pictures to prove what was wrong a replacement was supplied a week_later , strangely both items were delivered by plumb center part of the wolsey group .
neutral	it was lucky that we hadn_'_t had rain , or a rubbish collection that day .
neutral	i think that the delivery service left a lot to be desired - no card was left to say that the parcel had been left , or where it was
neutral	ordered two bouquets , at the same time , to be delivered to the same address , on the same day .
neutral	one arrived , one didn_'_t .
neutral	the second one arrived the next_day but no - one was in .
neutral	my email complaint and request for an explanation has_been ignored .
neutral	the flowers arrived on the monday and i ' m told they were lovely .
neutral	i '_ll try serenata one more time , but any more glitches and bad manners and i '_ll not use them again .
neutral	i placed my order on 0th_june and received an acknowledgement .
neutral	i also uploaded the prescription , as requested .
neutral	also acknowledged .
neutral	i heard_nothing more until the 00th , when i received a " reminder " that the prescription had not been received .
neutral	i was surprised but attached it to an e_- mail on the same day .
neutral	i checked by phone that it had been received on the 00th and later that day an e_- mail confirmed that the order had been despatched .
neutral	unfortunately , the order did not arrive for another 0 days .
neutral	i will try the same company again , but will check that the prescription has arrived
neutral	when uploaded .
neutral	it was the first time that i used the company .
neutral	i would use them again but not for something that i urgently require .
neutral	i had to send 0 emails on 0 consecutive days , 00 days after_placing my order .
neutral	on the 0rd day i got an apologetic email informing_me that they were now dispatching my item ( what was going on for 00 days ?
neutral	i have no clue .
neutral	what would they have done if i hadn_'_t enquired_about my order ?
neutral	i have no clue ).
neutral	the thing is that they took the time to send me a promotional email instead of answering my request during my 0 - day -' chase .'
neutral	yes i got what i ordered but i do not recommend to use this company if you are in a hurry .
neutral	everything was very easy to follow from the music_magpie website .
neutral	but there '_s not much money to be made from cds .
neutral	one cd ( out of about 00 ) was not recognised by the site .
neutral	i ordered a new shower_tray , door and shower_head from betterbathrooms .
neutral	they all arrived on time .
neutral	unfortunately , as i am not a plumber , i bought a slim line shower_tray ( i think they look much_nicer_than the other ones ) i didn_'_t know that i would also need to buy a kit that included the legs .
neutral	when i have bought shower_trays in the past they have come with the legs .
neutral	when my plumber realised that the legs weren_'_t included , i contacted betterbathrooms and asked where they were .
neutral	i was told that i should have bought the extra kit and that i would need it in order to plumb in the tray as it was also going on a concrete floor .
neutral	as i didn_'_t want the plinth that came with the kit i asked if it was possible to just buy the legs .
neutral	i was told that someone would get back to me .
neutral	unfortunately no one did .
neutral	i contacted the company again ( on the same day , late_afternoon ) and was told that the legs were around £_00 , and that with delivery they would cost about £_00 .
neutral	the cost of the complete pack , with the plinth was around £_00 , so i decided to order the complete pack , only to be told then that they were out of stock and even if they were in stock i would not receive them the next_day as it was too late for a next_day delivery .
neutral	so i had a plumber who couldn_'_t do any work , and a tiler who was waiting to tile the shower room after the tray was installed and no kit .
neutral	the next_day i spoke to dave in the wigan office .
neutral	he was very helpful and suggested that i buy a kit that contained four legs and have my plumber put supports under the middle of the shower .
neutral	thank_goodness he suggested this as i was desperate to get the equipment needed to complete the installation .
neutral	i had also bought a shower_head that was too small , so i ordered another one .
neutral	this was on a next_day delivery but actually took two days to get to me .
neutral	i did phone to complain_about this and spoke to someone in customer_services .
neutral	she was very helpful , found out when the delivery was occurring and said she would try to get the cost if the delivery refunded .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t heard_anything from betterbathrooms regarding this .
neutral	it should be automatically refunded if the items don_'_t arrive on time , there is nothing to think about .
neutral	overall i would say that betterbathrooms are good value for money .
neutral	their staff are helpful , but it would be a good idea if there was a pop up when ordering these slim line shower_trays asking if feet are needed as they are not included .
neutral	after all there is a pop up offering accessories etc .
neutral	also refunds on delivery charges should be automatic if they do not arrive on time .
neutral	overall i have enjoyed going through quidco .
neutral	but as the title_says some transactions can be iffy .
neutral	let me explain .
neutral	we registered 0 cards with quidco ( my wife and i ) at times the card_details got erased so any purchases made did not register .
neutral	it was only when i tried to chase them up i noticed the cards had been erased , so no payments .
neutral	we do not always save receipts so cannot claim on these .
neutral	also account shows car insurance payment paid yet this has not been paid .
neutral	does not seem point in sending yet another message as i never get a satisfactory reply , even when i get a telephone_call .
neutral	have considered closing account down several_times but keep hoping it will improve .
neutral	will stick with it a little longer to hope for improvement .
neutral	the sooner the govt reduces the vat threshold so that companies like play can '_t take_advantage of it the better .
neutral	then we can buy from companies that don_'_t split an order for 0 cd / dvds into 0 parcels so i end up having to pick them up from the post_office 0 bloody times !
neutral	sure pricing is ok but just so they save the vat they split orders into amounts that are less_than £_00 or something .
neutral	i see that tesco , asda and all the rest of them ship from the channel_islands too nowadays so they can all save on tax - while the rest of uk companies have no choice but to pay it - money goes to money as usual
neutral	i have bought from them a few_times and if you are willing to wait a few_days longer_than say amazon then you can probably get it cheaper here than most .
neutral	the issue is with electrical equipment that requires a uk plug - both time i have not had one and it '_s come with a eu plug instead - so i have had to go out and buy a plug convertor - kinds of defeats the savings .
neutral	we have used virgin for our florida flights quite a few_times - using air miles collected through amex and then xferring them to virgin .
neutral	problem we '_ve had this past 0 or 0 flights is the attitude of the virgin crew on the plane has_been really poor .
neutral	sure they smile when it suits them but there has_been an air of everything is too much_trouble recently - rolling eyes , sighs , just general body language that indicates they would just rather sit down and read their mags in between the times they throw meals at you .
neutral	we tend to travel with their premium service ( not upper but better_than economy ) and you tend to pay £_000 /£ 000 more per person per flight - so a family of 0 it racks up .
neutral	for that money i expect a courteous service at all times .
neutral	we try and avoid them from now on .
neutral	we have had better cabin_crew service from bmi and even ba to be honest .
neutral	shame really , used to like virgin at first .
neutral	saying that - going to dubai with them this year in upper class so we will see - again - not by choice - just the only ones that flew there on the dates we had where we could use our airmiles to reduce the cost .
neutral	quick , easy and prompt payment .
neutral	are better deals out there but they make it so easy i keep using them !
neutral	however , recently sold them an iphone for £_000 and i asked them how they made money on that to be told they sold them to developing countries .
neutral	so , that makes me a little uneasy to be helping a company make money out of africa or wherever .
neutral	i mean , how can they make money on a 0nd_hand iphone when paying me £_000 ?
neutral	doesn_'_t sound right at all hence lowered review rating .
neutral	0_stars for service , 0_stars for morals .
neutral	i had been with o0 for a number of years , and generally their service was above_average .
neutral	however , i moved_house , and that was the beginning of a very sorry_saga .
neutral	in a period of 00 months i had 0 routers .
neutral	each one had a different problem , ranging from getting so hot , i did not need heating , random drop outs , disconnections , and the list goes on .
neutral	finally having had enough of the poor quality of routers being provided , i contacted them and explained that they needed to get their act_together .
neutral	in fairness the customer service were every helpful , waiving the early_termination fees .
neutral	but , it is only since i have moved to another provided that the cheapness of their routers has_become increasingly apparent .
neutral	since i have changed , i am not able to get a wireless signal anywhere in the house .
neutral	not just sat on top of the router .
neutral	this review is now a little redundant as sky is buying out o0s ' customer base .
neutral	i am pleased to see that yodel are making serious efforts to improve their level of service .
neutral	i have been a catalogue customer for a number of years and yodel took over the courier service .
neutral	items would regularly disappear , text_messages saying they had tried to deliver but there was noone home ( i had been in all day ).
neutral	finally after a number of complaints to the catalogue and the courier , i resorted to contacting the ceo of both companies .
neutral	very recently , i have noticed a considerable improvement ( it would have been near impossible to get worse ).
neutral	but yodel have a lot of work to do before i have 000_% confidence in their service .
neutral	everything else seems okay .
neutral	prices are fair , i order a pair of cycling bib and went by their sizing chart but the fit was not accurate .
neutral	i am waiting for the exchange item to arrive .
neutral	the service was great , all the phone_calls were answered quickly and the cso '_s were extremely friendly and polite .
neutral	the brighton team were excellent great service and lovely people .
neutral	the actual treatment involved about and hour of delay before i finally got to the treatment room so i was pretty nervous .
neutral	the actual procedure was ok , not painful although quite unpleasant , but initially i could see pretty well .
neutral	it did get very sore after about 00_mins but a friend had advised me to go to sleep for a few hours and when i woke_up i could see almost perfectly .
neutral	it was very exciting .
neutral	i opted for monovision ie a reading eye and a driving eye and personally i would not recommend this perhaps for me the sacrifice on long vision for reading was too great .
neutral	disappointingly 0 months after treatment i have suffered some regression and will have to have the procedure repeated as i now require glasses again for driving .
neutral	booking made easily , but i was surprised when the payment was taken .
neutral	not clear that extra charges were added , sms confirmation , cancellation cover plus booking_fee
neutral	i was a customer of another isp up until a couple of months_ago .
neutral	in august i went into what i thought was my isp '_s web_site to check my billing statement .
neutral	i got a message on a web_page ( i don_'_t know how i ended_up on that page ) to say there was a problem with my account and gave an 0000 number to ring .
neutral	when i dialled the number i got an operator who claimed they were signing_up customers to a new account .
neutral	i then noticed the different name ( time talk ).
neutral	i told the operator that i still had time left on my current_contract but i was told not to worry_about it , that it would be taken care of .
neutral	i had the definite impression that my isp was aware of this .
neutral	realisation that time talk was actually a competitor poaching customers from my isp came later , but i stupidly allowed myself to be drawn in .
neutral	my isp charged me a £_00 contract break fee , which they took out of my direct_debit .
neutral	for a few_weeks the time talk customer advisers insisted i shouldn_'_t worry , just mail them a pdf of the statement , and they ’ ll pass it to their accounts_department for processing .
neutral	a lot of sympathy and telling_me how bad my isp was by charging such a large_amount and they would write to them on my behalf and urge them to refund it ..
neutral	i have now accepted my mistake , and as a result of this experience i want to leave time talk and go_elsewhere .
neutral	their cancellation advisor told me they would charge me a contract breaking fee of over £_000 .
neutral	i have since heard from time talk and they have decided to credit me back the £_00 because as they admitted their salesperson had made a mistake in allowing me to believe they would simply pay back the breakage fee .
neutral	so on this basis they have started to go up in my estimation .
neutral	fell foul of cut_off point for next_day delivery .
neutral	paid a premium but had to wait untill after the weekend . result no bike .
neutral	probably my fault but be warned .
neutral	autoglass really messed me around with the booking to fit a replacement screen after they were unable to repair my windscreen ( a small " star " crack in my windscreen caused by a stone ).
neutral	the replacement screen was booked to be fitted at feltham as i was told by the technician who visited my home that it was a complex job ( my car is a convertible ) and it was " better " to have it done at their centre .
neutral	i took his advice and got booked into my nearest branch ( feltham ).
neutral	i had to wait 0weeks for an_appointment and on the morning whilst i was driving there to leave the car , i got an_email from autoglass to tell me the booking had been " upgraded " and now would be done on a home visit !!!
neutral	when i got to the branch , it took some time to resolve this confusion as " they do not make the bookings ".
neutral	so lots of wasted time and irritation - plus a loss of confidence in what autoglass had advised me .
neutral	the original transaction was conducted through paypal and for no reason was reversed with no contact or information .
neutral	it took two_weeks to get money back to be able to order again .
neutral	the product itself when it finally arrived was fine .
neutral	a very messy process .
neutral	obviously something needs sorting_out somewhere .
neutral	will make me think_twice before using again .
neutral	i wrote a detailed and thoughtful review .
neutral	i was then asked to confirm by email or facebook .
neutral	this shouldn_'_t be necessary at all if i click on an invitation to review email .
neutral	i entered the email and password i had used with the supplier but this was not accepted .
neutral	i had no choice but to ' verify with facebook ' or abandon teh review .
neutral	luckily i do have a fb account or i '; d have been stuck .
neutral	however , i don_'_t want anything posted on my fb page or anything notified to friends which you try and sneak through .
neutral	i managed to write about five reviews the first time without a problem . there is nothing wrong with my computer but ever_since i click on the review button for various companies it just states done . the response to my emails to support endlessly states ` can you copy and paste the urls in to an_email and send it to us ?
neutral	the range of products has always been good compared to other_supermarkets . average fruit and vegetable section not as good as morrisons . very good wine section .
neutral	they are let_down by careless home delivery staff who clog the aisles with large trolleys chatting and poor responses to comments .
neutral	loved the car , the prices and the overall package .
neutral	however pick_up was appalling - it took nearly as long to get the vehicle as it did to fly from the uk to majorca - literally .
neutral	for the people behind us in the long queue it took longer .
neutral	they knew how many people had booked , when they were arriving and which cars were needed , yet there were not enough people to deal with this and to have to wait 0 hrs plus to pick_up your vehicle is not good practice .
neutral	i hope it is not usual .
neutral	food wine and electrical bargains brilliant and cheap cheap cheap but they buck pass if a fault develops , so a bit iffy for computers , cameras etc , might need to regard as a write off if they go_wrong .
neutral	£_00 for a room , looks very good but parking and internet add £_00 per night so in reality it was £_00 per night , again not bad but this should be the advertized price
neutral	better_than most of them but if you telephone them prepare to wait for an answer about 0 to 0 hours
neutral	the process from finding v0 online to meeting a sales_rep and getting the funds into my account was really straightforward and i was kept up to date by the sales_rep when he was on his way to meet me , the forms only took about 00_minutes to complete and i received my loan really quickly .
neutral	my only negative is the aftersales service .
neutral	i have emailed about a couple of queries and it has taken me to chase and chase to get a response .
neutral	i would also really appreciate receiving some sort of monthly statement instead of always having to call or email to find out my remaining balance .
neutral	i have also got in touch to request my v0 for an address change but yet to get a reply again !
neutral	so this side of things i am not happy about
neutral	i was pulled into facebook by an_email from someone who wanted me to be his ' friend '.
neutral	he was already my friend , so i had no_idea what he was going on about , however i followed the link , intending to give him some click to confirm rather_than ignore him , but found i actually had to join the thing to do so .
neutral	i was tempted to phone him to say ' nothing personal , but you ' re going to have to accept that i am your friend , without my having to join some official club in order to prove it to you '.
neutral	however , i decided to join , in the unlikely_event that it might be in any way of interest to me .
neutral	that seemed to put me on some kind of a map , and i was soon getting emails from more people wanting me to be their ' friend '.
neutral	each time , i had to find and apply my login details in order to validate the friendship i thought they already had with me .
neutral	after a few_months , these interruptions began to dwindle , and i only have to log in about once every three_months .
neutral	occasionally , i am told that people have ' written things on my wall ', so i log in .
neutral	it is a lot of effort to do things which can more easily be done by phone , email or forum .
neutral	worse still , i seem to be in the centre of irrelevant , even idiotic information trying to grap my attention of my clicks .
neutral	somebody was desperate to get a virtual ingredient to make a virtual cocktail in order to get a virtual - bartenders ' certificate .
neutral	what collyrot !
neutral	but i wincingly and , i admit , patronizingly decided to click to assist them in their pointless ambition ; and found that to do so , i had to liberate my entire address book to the organizers of the virtual bar , presumably so that i become implicated in spreading this .
neutral	therefore , i go on facebook only when i am called , am unimpressed each time , and i log off asap .
neutral	there are , however , many millions of people who like spending time on it - it obviously ' works '.
neutral	even some of my real - life friends tell me that it helps them to ' keep in touch '.
neutral	when reviewing , i typically feel secure and confident that i am assessing the quality of a ' thing in itself '.
neutral	but , regarding facebook , i realise i am reviewing a product which works , but which i have no interest in , like a chicken - sexing kit .
neutral	the serious difference_between facebook and chicken - sexing kits , both fo which , i assume , achieve their objectives , is that the latter does not force itself into my awareness , nor recruit my friends to be part of its marketing .
neutral	it '_s only a propelling pencil .
neutral	i '_t s less_than £ 0 .
neutral	after more than a week overdue it hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	emails and phone_calls not responded to .
neutral	eventually i managed to make contact and all was resolved amicably and in a friendly way .
neutral	they refunded the cost - which was nice - and sent the pencil anyway .
neutral	once we ' d established comms i was told they had email and hosting problems .
neutral	satisfactory_outcome .
neutral	just returned from a 0month trip around singapore , australia , new_zealand and thailand , one of the legs from sydney to bangkok was on ba00 , and i must_say that the service on business class is not what it used to be .
neutral	the service was some what rushed and we got the feeling that we an inconvenience to the cabin_crew , they would have been happier if the business class cabin would have been empty .
neutral	come on ba get your act_together , i am afraid that qantas really have the better customer service than you at the moment .
neutral	my last order was about the sixth pallet of tiles i have had from this company .
neutral	generally i would say everything is very good and of course you can ’ t beat them on price .
neutral	but i will say that i have sent back a pallet of tiles before as they looked a mess on the lorry and they sent me back what must have been seconds as the tiles we warped .
neutral	this last pallet was a mess when it arrived as well .
neutral	but i was waiting on them so i accepted it .
neutral	it must have been packed by someone without a brain as the boxes were stacked upright and wrapped with a bit of clingfilm .
neutral	soon as the pallet gets knocked in transit they have all leaned forward ripping all the boxes and scratching some of the tiles .
neutral	it also made it a nightmare to unload without them toppling .
neutral	i must_say that i have used about a third of them and so far only two have been broken .
neutral	the last problem was although i clicked the link on my previous order so as to get exactly the same tiles they are different .
neutral	not the same shade of white , not the same manufacturer and not even exactly the same size .
neutral	which meant i cannot mix them with my left over ’_s .
neutral	the initial order worked well and i expected to receive the code within their stated 0 to 00_hours .
neutral	however after 00_hours i had to send an e_- mail asking for the code .
neutral	within a couple of hours fonesunlock sent the code to me and it worked with no_problems .
neutral	thanks
neutral	well i keep getting used to good ' ol facebook , then they go along & change it every few_months .
neutral	now we have timeline .
neutral	love it or hate it .
neutral	actually , i love it ~ but will it be around for long ?
neutral	who_knows ....
neutral	been with 0 for about 0 years now , originally the signal_strength was excellent here in west cumbria , this was the main_reason that i sarted with the 0 network .
neutral	however over the last 0 - 0 months the reception has got to be more patchy , giving them 0 last chance as i have just taken out a new contract , then i may have to reconsider my options despite the excellent packages offered by this company .
neutral	ordered 0gb_ram on the 00th midday .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	have still received nothing .
neutral	was assured by mr m that my parcel would be delivered today by 0pm .
neutral	i ' m still_waiting for it .
neutral	the courier company never pick_up their phone .
neutral	mr m not interested .
neutral	advise others not to shop_here when there are other_suppliers that go out of their way to provide the service their customers deserve .
neutral	i shall never use this company again
neutral	i would like to add that i have finally received my order and i have installed it and is working great .
neutral	mr_memory interceded and helped get my order to me on the 0rd attempt and my next_day delivery premium was refunded .
neutral	i will give mr m another chance so i know i shall be shopping with them again as i love their products and the people there are great .
neutral	however , its a shame they may lose customers due to a poor courier service experience such as mine .
neutral	sorry for the mix_up .
neutral	the tap i purchased from you guys was a wonderful top_notch product but unfortunately didn_'_t fit my bathroom so i returned it but i am still_waiting for the refund .
neutral	had to pay vat and duty this was not explained during checkout nor was it explained that the goods were coming from abroad .
neutral	i found using the site very easy , good value for money and definitely cheaper_than anywhere_else .
neutral	however , the courier used clearly did not read ( or maybe did not receive ) the explicit instruction left regarding delivery and leaving at a safe_place at my home , and i had to contact customer_services ( delivery ) on a number on which i only had push button responses to use .
neutral	not acceptable on any level .
neutral	pet_supermarket did resolve it for me , but , will i use it again ?
neutral	probably not .
neutral	like most people i work for a living and the courier will only deliver mon - fri free of charge , if you want delivery on a saturday it is apparently £ 0 extra which would negate the saving i make on my pets food .
neutral	disappointing that this is not taken into account .
neutral	ordered early on a thursday and delivery will be the following_tuesday .
neutral	i know that is within their time limits , but there really is very little reason that next_day delivery could not be provided as it is with loads of other in stock mail order items from other_companies .
neutral	having said that price is good and one has comfort from it being a reliable source .
neutral	this site is easy to use , but appears almost identical to several other train sites in layout and prices ; is this indicative of shared data , as these sites have the same prices as each other every time i look .
neutral	other_sites , such as red spotted handkerchief seem to be different , offer different prices , and are sometimes available before either thetrainline , or the other similar sites .
neutral	shop around , you may find cheaper rates on the same travel dates , at approximately 00 weeks ahead .
neutral	the title_says it all .
neutral	despite many attempts to stop them sending e_- mail ads to my workplace address , it hasn_'_t stopped .
neutral	it has now been added to the works blocked sender '_s list .
neutral	sorry argos , buck up your customer service ideas .
neutral	on the plus side however , the site itself is user_friendly , easy to navigate , and easy to reserve items for later pick_up in stores .
neutral	( hence three stars not two .)
neutral	i found workwear_express very efficient .
neutral	our order was dealt_with quickly and sent out within they time they promised .
neutral	i was pleased with the artwork and initially with the t shirts we had ordered .
neutral	on closer_inspection , however , the t shirts were too short and after a couple of washes on 00 degree wash they had shrunk even more and had gone out of shape .
neutral	i would certainly order from work wear express again but would not order the type of t shirt purchased this time .
neutral	very dissapointing when you pay for something and you get it three_months later due to being out of stock .
neutral	shame but this has put me off ordering again .
neutral	bought a wooden kitchen trolley in march_0000 ebay id - 000000000000 from these_people trading on ebay under the seller name discounthomestore ( since stopped trading on ebay and the web under this name ).
neutral	they are clearly the same people , same names , e_- mail address , telephone_numbers and address .
neutral	the trolley was assembled in april .
neutral	in december it had collapsed .
neutral	there appeared to be no way of getting touch with them .
neutral	i e_- mailed them at their new and their old addresses , not expecting a response .
neutral	both did respond and a refund and collection for the damaged goods was arranged within_00hrs .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	everything was going great until website used parcelforce for postage . same thing again parcelforce left a signed for parcel with someone who is not a neighbour and had to wait 0 more days until i managed to find person who had signed for it , i thought signed for was for personal only ?
neutral	i walked out of my local o0 shop when they said quote " yeah we are expensive and the trade in is pants - but hey we can sell as many as we like ( 0s )".... so i went to vodaphone and they had a really good deal but no phones .. so went back to 00 .
neutral	no joy , no price match not even for a long_term customer with 0 phones in the family ... so went back to vodaphone .
neutral	they suggested i called o0 retention !!!!!!
neutral	i did - they did a great deal ... but .
neutral	when the new 0s stops working the customer service refer you to an o0 shop - who will have nothing to do with you .
neutral	as neither will apple .
neutral	buying from ' retention ' is deemed to be online and nothing to do with o0 retail shops .
neutral	poor service , wrong customer service advice - shame about the phone .
neutral	only saving grace was excellent support from repairs team - but it took me 0 hrs and 0 calls waiting on piped music landlines .
neutral	not enough variety .
neutral	the soups don_'_t taste that good .
neutral	price is good compared to lighter life .
neutral	play . com offer some great goods at reasonable_prices , my only complaint is the speed of delivery , it normally takes 0 - 0 days to deliver to worcester uk , orders form amazon also based in jersey , normally arrive in 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i always prefer to book a hotel with a shared or private kitchen but there isn ’ t a search option for this .
neutral	many of the reviews are written in different languages and there is no translation facility - this is frustrating as you have to copy and paste into google translate .
neutral	often the information is incorrect - hotels promise more than they deliver .
neutral	when booking a hotel for several days it would be useful to see the daily as well as the total price .
neutral	found this website that offered more than just flowers to be delivered , ordered what i thought would be a special gift of flowers , mini balloon and birthday cake .
neutral	unfortunatley the cake was not delivered , which was a great disapointment as i received 0 really good emails , 0 to say they were on the way and the other to say they had been delivered .
neutral	=.
neutral	(....
neutral	if you create a truthful and honest review about an experience you have had with an online supplier who use trustpilot and should you dare to publish a poor service , the retailer then objects if you give them a low score .
neutral	trustpilot then threatens to have your review removed if you don_'_t change it .
neutral	i don_'_t believe that this is then a fair or independent review of the service or experience received when forced to change the review !
neutral	could this be because the retailers have paid trustpilot to be on their website !!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	can consumers then trust the reviews placed on trustpilot ? and are trustpilot actually unbiased or simply just protecting the retailers to publish and promote high scores ?
neutral	regards alan hinman .
neutral	0rd july_0000 .
neutral	i ordered a large white radiator .
neutral	i received an e_mail on the day it was due to be delivered to say the courier couldn_'_t deliver and it would come the following_day , as it was heavy and they needed a different vehicle .
neutral	it eventually arrived the day after that - but they sent a black one !
neutral	the invoice and the delivery note clearly_stated it was white .
neutral	very helpful people , arranged for courier to deliver the correct item and take away the wrong one , but by now my builder and plumber had wasted five days .
neutral	i ordered a set of car mat and a cover for my soft top when its down ' tonneau cover '.
neutral	mats despatched fine and as advertised .
neutral	very curt note saying , ' we are not supplying the tonneau cover as it is not suitable for your vehicle '.
neutral	i had to contact the supplier and ask for one that was appropriate for my vehicle , and recieved another curt reply - there is none available for your model of car .
neutral	i found what i needed from another supplier .
neutral	dont ignore the ads , i missed out on a great broadband detail because i went to the standard page which did not have the deal on offer by their ad .
neutral	come on bt put the offer on the page as well
neutral	woulld say that your site was one of the best for getting a return on your money
neutral	but my opinion has changed because over last 0 weeks i have not had any luck
neutral	i have just been depositing money so i dont see the point on going on iam just losing money so i am not playing anymore .
neutral	regards derek
neutral	takes a lots of time to compile .
neutral	resultant photos acceptable , could be better .
neutral	zapper is great if you have a load of old books that you '_ve read and no_longer need which are taking up space .
neutral	the collection drop_off point are close by .
neutral	but sadly out of the 0000 books that i own and urgently want rid of only 00 were accepted and it took me a whole day to enter all of the codes onto the zapper system .
neutral	then of course you have to find the right sized box and a roll of tape and then you have to weigh the box and measure it or it won_'_t meet the criteria .
neutral	so you need scales that read kg '_s .
neutral	i got my cheque ok about a week after i had posted the books out .
neutral	the next time i am just going to bag them up and recycle them as paper as its easier and you get the money in your hand right away .
neutral	i do think this service is getting poor , i remeber you could get your first bid within 00min it was excepted , not now the bids are ridiclous its laughable , my wife used the same courier , s if she can , courier , s come and go . my wife as used this service for 0yrs , it was great , courier were reliable , you got a good service all_round , i used this service because its straigt forward but you do wait a long time for a good bid offer
neutral	i think it '_s user - friendly but i don_'_t like the amount they deduct every time !
neutral	i feel m & s is a trustworthy store who do care about customer service .
neutral	they offer good value , well_designed products but sometimes their buyers lose the way with their choices !
neutral	i think bt are too big but we just can '_t avoid using them
neutral	i try not to shop too much at tesco because i don_'_t like their domination .
neutral	they do offer good value products in most_cases but i feel they punish their suppliers to enable this .
neutral	i might be wrong on this but i dont ' think so .
neutral	there has definitely been a decline in the quality of thee books .
neutral	i have done about 0 now and the colour is really poor compared to original photographs .
neutral	i feel there aren_'_t enough options in the layout either , quite boring layouts so going to start having these photobooks done elsewhere .
neutral	mmmm .. what game is this refering to ?
neutral	there was no contact until item was dispatched .
neutral	i have just returned from spain where i hired a chev aveo for two_weeks and thought i was getting a good deal .
neutral	however i left the car with a three quarter tank and was charged e00 . 00 euro for fuel !!!!
neutral	that was more than 000 of the total hire charge which included insurance .
neutral	i understand i could have left an empty tank , but who takes a chance with travelling on an empty tank in a foreign country .
neutral	the car_hire company was eurocar .
neutral	the fuel_tank has a capacity of 00 litres and at the cost of fuel in malaga at e0 . 000 per_litre - a full_tank of fuel on empty would have cost e00 euro .
neutral	i will never hire a car again on these terms .
neutral	i would not recommend this type of car_hire .
neutral	i hire_cars 0 to 0 times a year , guess_what a lost customer here >
neutral	as i have bought several gtech products it would be quite helpful to know which one you want a review for .
neutral	we purchased an adjustable foot stool which was promptly dispatched .
neutral	the stool was quite poorly finished with sharp corners , in fact my wife cut her foot on one of the corners .
neutral	it was not worth sending back and i smoothed it off .
neutral	with a bit more thought it could have been made with rounded corners .
neutral	when folded one of the metal struts protrudes slightly again poor construction / design .
neutral	it is a shame as with a bit more thought it could have been excellent .
neutral	i was thrilled to try out this method of quitting smoking conventional cigarettes .
neutral	at first it did save a lot of money .
neutral	however of late the company is constantly updating their products and the new models are unrliable and so becoming too expensive to continue with .
neutral	i am almost at the brink of changing allegience to another company .
neutral	i ordered my pc on 0th_january_0000 via the website and it arrived on 00 january_0000 so just outside the 0 week lead time mentioned on their website so not too bad , it came with all the correct components , the oem windows 0 disk and the graphics_card box + drivers so no_problems there !
neutral	however , when i tried to contact them to find out when the order would be dispatched ( after the 0 week deadline had passed ) it took three attempts on different days and waiting an average of 00_minutes before anyone picked_up the telephone , i also sent 0 emails and got no response .
neutral	i think this company is basically sound but when you hand over several_hundred_pounds it does make you sweat a little when you cannot get hold of a human_being , customer service needs some working on and then they would be a great little company and no doubt pick_up far more business !
neutral	whilst holidayautos booking process works really well it is important to fully understand the contract with the car_hire company .
neutral	on this occasion the 000_euro deposit stated on my confirmation became a 0000 euro deposit when i arrived at gold_car in rome ..... that '_s their requirement for the class of car we hired .
neutral	also i had to take gold_car '_s inflexible ' flexible fuel ' policy ... take the car full and return it empty and pay their high fuel price and a compulsory refuelling charge of 00 euros .
neutral	the wording in my confirmation wasn_'_t absolutely clear and gold_car would not allow me to take the car full and return it full .
neutral	also the transfer service for gold_car at fiumicino is a nightmare , 0_seater minibuses and a scrum to get on one competing with parkinggo car_park clients .... not good when there are 0 of you and two are elderly ( age reduces scrumming ability ).
neutral	on the positive side gold_car provided us with a brand_new car and refunded the unused fuel .
neutral	i ordered 0 items online on 00nd march .
neutral	0 item was delivered within 00 days but the other 0 items had expected delivery dates of 00th_may and 00nd june !
neutral	h & m sell good quality items but do yourself a favour , buy instore as the online set_up is abysmal .
neutral	i have just cancelled the remainder of my order as i am not prepared to wait 0 months from the date of order until delivery .
neutral	have had some really good juice ( menthol and banana ) but vermillion river menthol tasted nothing like menthol and standard blueberry tasted of very little .
neutral	always quick delivery though
neutral	the initial contact with the support_team was very good .
neutral	i had a problem with my login where i could not login , but neither could i obtain a new password or get the system to recognise me to do this even_though i have registered and at one of the stages it is obvious that i have been recognised .
neutral	the support person i spoke to sent me a copy of my bill ( which i was attempting to access with difficulty ) and promised to chase up a rectification of my account login and the let me know when it was fixed ( expected to be 0 working_days .
neutral	no contact was made after 0 days and so a chase e_- mail was sent , with no response .
neutral	it would be good to know the current status and when a fix is likely .
neutral	because i neglected to get the registration date of the owners v0 before we parted company this did not match on the final certificate .
neutral	my experience with waltons was not a good one .
neutral	i placed an order that was said to be delived the next_day tomorrow came and went no contact from anyone to inform me as to why my order had not been delivered .
neutral	after several phone_calls i was told it might be delivered on monday 0 days after order , as luck would have it i took delivery on the saturday , and was given a 00 . 00 pound refund , not what i would call proffesional service
neutral	placed an order before their cut - off time and according to their own website the phone should have been dispatched the same day .
neutral	0 days_later and the phone has still not been sent .
neutral	update_: received prompt reply to my email_advising that they did not have any stock of the item and that there was a problem with their on - line inventory regarding this particular_model .
neutral	offered a full_refund which has_been processed .
neutral	unfortunate first interaction and not the outcome i wanted but a satisfactory response to the issue .
neutral	website great , products and prices are great , delivery tracking and delivery excellent .
neutral	they lose a couple of stars for issuing a generic " there is an issue with your order , please call ..." message if you specify an alternate delivery address even if you have been through the " verified by visa " process which thieves won_'_t be able to get through .
neutral	i can '_t hang_around in telephone queues during the business day ( and they always have a queue ) but got through in the last 00_mins of their working day on a friday .
neutral	this is just an unneccessary irritation to genuine customers ... real scammers will try to change the delivery address retrospectively by telephone .
neutral	the bag is what i expected and the service was good .
neutral	but the bag was squashed into the packaging box which was too small for the item - therefore the bag is badly creased .
neutral	shame !
neutral	don_'_t you have bigger boxes !
neutral	?
neutral	purchased simms star cleats , the website says the box contains 00 when in fact it only contains 00 , otherwise i would have given 00 stars given the chance .
neutral	haven_'_t opened the container to check but unless they have opened it and placed an extra 0 in , it says 00 .
neutral	it '_s all in the detail !
neutral	i am sure my equipment will turn_up promptly and as ordered .
neutral	my gripe is in the fact that despite_emailing them and telephoning them , leaving my details for a callback to enquire_about an armed forces discount that one of the shops confirmed they do offer , nobody bothered to reply to either .
neutral	i ended_up ordering regardless but will go back to my previous_supplier for future orders .
neutral	not feeling very valued .
neutral	i had very mixed experience with very .
neutral	the first time i ordered a jumper to try them out was extremely bad .
neutral	i had chosen a sat for delivery as i work during weekdays .
neutral	i waited from 0am to 00pm on saturday and guy did not turn_up .
neutral	i rang them and they simply told me the guy cudnt find the no so left .
neutral	that was such a feeble excuse and its absolutely rubbish .
neutral	however , eventually the coat turned_up late_afternoon .
neutral	however , my second experience with them turned_out rather good .
neutral	delivery was prompt , returns experience is average as they do take ages to update their returns .
neutral	people taking calls on average most are not very helpful or knows what they are taking about .
neutral	i had a good and a really bad customer service online before .
neutral	on the whole , i would give them a 0 . 0 out of 0 .
neutral	they need to give better customer service .
neutral	i do like the take 0 payments which are great if you are short of cash to get something you need really badly .
neutral	and if you pay them within the stipulated time without interest is great .
neutral	i avoid this social network .
neutral	tried to use it but it just don_'_t suit me .
neutral	i think aria is a great company with some fantastic bargains .
neutral	for me the only thing that lets them down is there delivery charges .
neutral	i was going to order an asus motherboard and 0 gb of ddr0 memory from them the other day .
neutral	now the strange thing was that the motherboard had free delivery so i thought that by adding the memory to it would also count as free delivery , but i was shocked as the delivery went up to over £_00 , if i had ordered them separately i would have got free delivery on the motherboard and paid just over £ 0 delivery on the memory . there great prices which are some of the cheapest around are really let_down by there delivery charges , so for me only 0_stars , get your delivery charges sorted_out and it would have been 0_stars .
neutral	pitty really .
neutral	poor service , having received my new phone i took it into the shop and they put the new sim_card in , but it didn_'_t work .
neutral	then had to wait 0 days for another one i gave the shop the tools that came with the phone to remove the sim_card but didn_'_t get them back .
neutral	when i asked about transferring my no '_s they said it would cost £ 0 but afterwards i found out i could do it through i tunes !
neutral	then when i registered my new sim on the phone ( website wouldn_'_t work ) i was told i would receive a text but after 00_hours it hadn_'_t come so i had to phone again !
neutral	this time i was told it was registered but i had to switch it off and on again !
neutral	i received only one response to my request and that was more_expensive than buying the part new .
neutral	however , full_marks to the one respondent .
neutral	i purchased this small item and found the cost of the item was reasonable but the postage was far to high for such a small item making the overall cost far to expencive , it also thought it took a bit to long to arrive for the cost charged .
neutral	i ordered some flowers for my daughter for her_birthday and received email_confirmation of safe delivery .
neutral	i then discovered , on speaking to my daughter later that day , that she had been out all day .
neutral	she had picked_up a card which had been put through her letterbox that rather unhelpfully said the flowers had been left at her own door number !
neutral	she called on neighbours both_sides but no luck .
neutral	eventually she spotted a rather nice bouquet in the window of a house three down from her and thought she would call on the off - chance .
neutral	fortunately her very honest neighbour confirmed that they were indeed meant for my daughter .
neutral	i appreciate that it was not the fault of the florist that the flowers could not be delivered but i feel cheated that i had been told they were safely delivered when clearly they were not and if it was not possible to deliver to a next door neighbour surely it would be better to keep them and try to arrange a more appropriate delivery time ( even at extra_cost ) rather_than risk them being lost .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	the flowers however were gorgeous and i would order again but give more specific delivery instructions next time .
neutral	good on overall weekly_shop it stock most brands friendly staff
neutral	site a little_slow to use and lacking maps to assist with hotel locations , but fairly competitive in terms of pricing .
neutral	however , alpharooms fail to be up front when it comes to charges for using a debit / credit_card .
neutral	in their terms and conditions , reference is made to bookings being subject to such a charge where applicable , but it is only at the final payment stage when this becomes visible .
neutral	for my own hotel booking , an option to avoid debit / credit_card costs was offered by paying with a fairfx prepaid mastercard .
neutral	despite having sufficient funds in my fairfx account , my payment was twice refused , forcing me to pay extra for booking with a debit_card .
neutral	i was left with the opinion that the " free " fairfx offer was a bit of a con , and would suggest that alpharooms be more transparent on their card charges .
neutral	i was disappointed when my order for perspex sheeting arrived with every sheet broken .
neutral	it is clear it was broken in transit , but the packaging was so poor , i am not surprised they were all broken .
neutral	they were quick to replace though at a price that was competitive , so worked out ok in the end .
neutral	part exchanged my 0 year_old ford ka which i bought brand_new from this garage , after 000 , 000 trouble_free miles . this time i bought a 0 year_old ka with 0 , 000_miles on the clock .
neutral	because there was a private plate on my vehicle and some dual controls to change over it was 0 weeks before i got the new car . whilst waiting for these weeks to pass and having signed the new agreement i received a letter from ford finance about a missed payment on my old car , i still had 0 payments to go .
neutral	jennings had some how managed to forget to settle my previous car finance despite a new agreement being in place , it was then paid .
neutral	not a good start but hey no_problems with my last car !
neutral	!
neutral	the day came to pick_up the car and as we sorted last bits and pieces and i was shown how many checks the car had gone_through before i was receiving it the salesman held up the spare , none remote key declaring the other was missing , but it wouldnt take long to get another !!!
neutral	despite having 0 weeks to sort this . not looking good .
neutral	got in the car started the engine , sure i heard a knock ??
neutral	drove home with occasional , " i ' m_sure i heard a knock there ".
neutral	turned engine off , definate knock .
neutral	rang and told salesman , " thats strange , surprised i never_heard it when i drove it but pop it back and sure we will sort it ".
neutral	i had a look under engine that night and discovered a bolt was missing from the bottom metal radiator hose where it bolts to the subframe , put a bolt in , knock gone .
neutral	:-)
neutral	got a call on the friday before_christmas to say key was in so duly arranged to go in the next_day .
neutral	the heater fan was buzzing occasionally and it had a slight groan on the steering at low speeds so i was going to mention these item too .
neutral	there for 0 . 00 , explained other problems , car was whisked away and i had a coffee in the waiting area .
neutral	00_minutes later good news and bad_news .
neutral	good news new key up and running , bad_news spare key has_been blocked , so do not use and we will be in touch in the new year to programme a new one !!!
neutral	they couldnt hear fan rattle or groan but to be fair they were a bit random .
neutral	drove home a bit happier :-)
neutral	as the car is used for driving tuition i ' m in it an awful_lot and fitting in trips to the garage are very rare so i '_ve coped without a spare key , no great hardship , and the other 0 faults have nicely grown louder making detection easier .
neutral	also the drivers seat now doesn_'_t click into position without a great push or it frightens some poor learner to death when it suddenly bangs into place at some in - opportune moment !!
neutral	!
neutral	got a cancellation this morning so drove 00_minutes to the garage to be told they are so busy they cannot come out to see the vehicle and i have to book it in for them to look / listen to these problems and then book it in again to get any_problems solved !!!
neutral	i was told even if i needed a bulb changing they couldnt do it until next week .
neutral	i mentioned my replacement key and was told it was replaced on january 0rd this year !!!
neutral	they will order another key and program it when my car comes in for the above problems .
neutral	not sure how they had confused me coming in and having a key programmed !
neutral	!
neutral	i have put off writing this review thinking that they will sort things out once i pop in and let them listen / look to things , then i book it in and all '_s rosy .
neutral	its not to be .
neutral	the last car only had the first service done by jennings then i did all the other '_s myself , its cheaper and you know_whats done but obviously not everyone can do that .
neutral	i ' m always on a tight schedule with my work and i have never found a garage that understands this , even on that one and only service i didn_'_t get the car back at the alloted_time because they didn_'_t have an oil filter for it in stock !!!!!
neutral	maybe i should have learnt that so long as you dont have to deal with the service department then alls good but if you do then i think its god help you .
neutral	purchasing the vehicle from the salesman was the usual 00 / 00 but its been all down_hill from there .
neutral	sorry about the lengh of this review , it would have been much shorter for my last car lol but i hope it will help anyone purchasing a vehicle from jennings to know what they could be getting into .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	i '_ve just tried the first 0 of the 00 pack of 0oz mature rump_steaks i had delivered last_week by westin_gourmet .
neutral	whilst the steaks looked very lean , and tasted fine , they were both tough in terms of texture .
neutral	i ' m_hoping that the other 0 steaks in the pack are more tender to eat .
neutral	having never used this company before i was hesitant when placing an order for nearly_£_000 , however i rang through to ask a few questions prior to ordering and was confident i was dealing_with a reputable company after i got off the phone .
neutral	what a shame the experience has left me very disappointed .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t rung myself to chase my order along the way i would not have had a clue what was happening .
neutral	communication was non_existent , a few_days after_placing the order i rang to be told i would receive it within a couple of days ... no ...
neutral	i then rang again when it hadn_'_t arrived to be told the same thing , only after the third chasing phone_call was i told it was actually being sent that afternoon , i received two_thirds of the order the following_day , that was a week after_placing the order .
neutral	the outstanding item was out of stock but i was told that stock was coming in that week by the 00th_march and it would be sent when they received it .
neutral	another chasing phone_call when it didn_'_t arrive i was told it was due in and would be sent ... a final call this week to sue , who actually had the courtesy to come back to me , i discovered that my item was actually not due in till april as there was a problem with the supplier .
neutral	sue arranged for me to receive a similar item .
neutral	yes the prices are great and i am pleased with everything received now , but nearly 0 weeks having spent in the region of £_000 , with no communication at all was a little stressful .
neutral	wouldn_'_t use again due to lack of communication .
neutral	ordered a samsung sound_bar and hdmi_cable for which i was given the same delivery date ; blue_ray arrived but no cable .
neutral	cable arrived next_day in post and another the next_day .
neutral	company prides_itself on own delivery vehicles but is unable to provide more than a 00 hour delivery window .
neutral	most white van men are now giving 0 hour delivery windows .
neutral	inquired about the purchase of samsung blue_ray ; was advised that it was out of stock with no know re - stock date and a suggestion that i should purchase a more_expensive unit that i did not want .
neutral	excellent customer service would have retained my details with a promise to let me know when in stock and reserve me one for immediate delivery .
neutral	company lost that sale .
neutral	a good range of quality products at reasonable_prices .
neutral	the only problem i had was some of the led lamps ordered were incorrectly boxed and therefore not what was ordered .
neutral	i have been promised replacements which i am still_waiting for .
neutral	when ordering was told it would be 0st april .. then phoned and told no sooner_than 0th
neutral	therefore it hasn_'_t yet arrived
neutral	although i had a groupon_voucher i still thought i was getting a good deal .
neutral	0 pairs of glasses supposed to be £_00 each for £_00 .. i honestly don_'_t think they ' re any better quality than of the peg glasses from a cheap shop ..
neutral	order placed paid extra for delivery arrived a week_later and not the next_day as promised .
neutral	sadly the owner , who i have emailed twice now , still_hasn_'_t replied :-(
neutral	this is the third time i '_ve placed an order with hispek , they seem to have a problem with customer_services they don_'_t contact you if there is a problem but leave it until you contact them , i don_'_t mind problems with orders as long as i am aware of it .
neutral	having said that my order is supposed to arrive on tuesday 00th_may ( placed on 00th_april ) bank_holiday '_s and stock etc .
neutral	so if i can i '_ll leave a review then .
neutral	to add to my review , i '_ve just received my cooker at the time specified and by the most helpful driver you could want .
neutral	the cooker is all and more than i expected and very pleased with both the price and the product .
neutral	regarding customer service if they just followed up an order after confirmation with an expected delivery date but apart_from that hispek is a good company and worth looking at especially there prices i can '_t fault that .
neutral	price couldn_'_t be_faulted and neither could communications .
neutral	however , on the day before fitting the garage sent an_email_confirmation of the appointment but on the day their tyre machine wasn_'_t working ( and hadn_'_t been the previous day ).
neutral	this should have been communicated to me to save a wasted trip .
neutral	the garage did ' phone in the afternoon to say it had been fixed a i rescheduled for the following_day .
neutral	service was prompt , polite and efficient on the day .
neutral	i would use again but maybe not use the same garage for fitting .
neutral	ordered epiphone ukulele and belcat 00w slim amp on monday and tracked until thursday when they said that they had tried to deliver but they hadn_'_t so after several phone_calls to yodel they managed to phone their driver who was in next village so arranged to meet at coop to pick_up package ( never really wanted to be a courier ) his excuse was that his sat_nav sent him wrong .. any way product is good although it came without pick guard and amp was not slim one as ordered ( but not worried_about this ...) i would recommend this firm as i think courier was at fault ..
neutral	ordered last thursday , just too late to get dispatch that day , but was advised order had been dispatched friday - got tracking_information and everything .
neutral	tried to track today , but no information , so rang bdw only to be told that one of the products that i had ordered ( one they had specifically emailed me about to tell me it was back in stock ), had not come into stock until friday at 0 . 00 pm meaning that my order was not dispatched at all .
neutral	they had not contacted me to advise me of this delay , and would presumably have just let me arrive home tonight to find my dog without food .
neutral	i really am not impressed with this experience , and will almost certainly use a local supplier from now on .
neutral	revised rating following the apology from the company , and some compensation .
neutral	still feel there are aspects of this experience that could have easily been avoided .
neutral	i run regular speed tests on a bunch of services .
neutral	this one is much like all the others .
neutral	except when it takes time to load .
neutral	( like today .)
neutral	no better , no worse .
neutral	never rely_on a single source for this sort of data .
neutral	delivery address 00 sheepcot drive watford herts wd000dz email not going to you regards kathy
neutral	quick effiecent service and prices comparable at_least on the tem i bought .
neutral	kara bistro set .
neutral	i have started my exante diet today .
neutral	i have 0 weeks supply of the winter warmer pack which was very reasonably_priced .
neutral	i made up the porridge according to the pack instructions , and was surprised to find a hot milky drink with a few bits in !!
neutral	are there some special tips to make it thicker ( apart_from halving the water content !!!)
neutral	i would be grateful for any advice as i have 00 packs of porridge !!!
neutral	!
neutral	really pleased with the bars very filling .
neutral	the pasta carbonara is ok ..... gonna try & tweak the strong salty flavour & runny consistency & leave to stand / soak for longer to expand & soften the pasta .
neutral	this holiday was booked for 00 and at the last_minute 0 were unable to travel due to the death of my father ( grandfather for the other party member ) i was told no refund will be given and was very disapointed as this was not just someone not wanting to go .
neutral	it was essential non travel i am in the process of drafting a letter to head_office under the circumstances i would like to know if any kind of refund is available as £_000 is a lot of money to loose especially under these circumstances . other than this side i would consider_using travel_republic again but willwait to see how i get on with this matter
neutral	i had booked 0 flights with flybe through bravofly - then found these reviews !
neutral	my worst fears were confirmed when the 00kg hold luggage each , which i had paid extra for , showed on the flybe booking site as 00kg .
neutral	as we are cruising - we need big bags !
neutral	i experienced 0 really bad phone_calls to someone in india ( i think ) , who did not understand what i was complaining_about and left me on hold for ages before i hung_up .
neutral	i then contacted the contact on one of these posts - simona - who has sorted it , with no further charges .
neutral	( dont know what the phone bill will be though !!)
neutral	so far so good !
neutral	!
neutral	the iphone 0 is fantastic .
neutral	but phones0u added the wrong data bolt on to the package .
neutral	o0 sorted this out but i had no data connection for 0 days .
neutral	other than that i had no issues .
neutral	twice now animed_direct have dispatched my cats cystitis pills never received , the most_recent order being 0000000 .
neutral	this is not acceptable and the second time i have had to do another emergency order and then claim back the prepaid funds for the lost orders later . no point in free delivery if it never arrives !
neutral	!
neutral	the pc is great looking and from my son really good spec .
neutral	what i haven_'_t liked is the box it came in had no padding or protection for such an expensive item .
neutral	then a few_days_later my son set it up for me , but noticed the front usb socket was bent inwards presenting it to be used .
neutral	to save hassle of sending it back he has bent it into place .
neutral	now up and running we have now come to the disappointment of the windows we paid for being an online server ?
neutral	when we picked it we were under the impression it would be the normal windows .
neutral	but in saying this my son bought his computer through them 0years ago and was disappointed to find he had been sold a build windows disk and not the full pro pack that you get in the shop .
neutral	apart_from these the pc is great , just struggling to use it with this rubbish windows server os
neutral	unfortunately my purchase did not arrive .
neutral	i notified woolovers after 0 days ( surely it would have arrived by then ?)
neutral	but was advised to wait 00 days before contacting them again .
neutral	i just hope i can resolve this dispute .
neutral	perhaps all parcels should be " tracked " as m & s do on mail order deliveries ?
neutral	my previous purchases ( and there have been many !)
neutral	have arrived_safely and service excellent .
neutral	also subsequent large purchase arrived within a few_days but i am still_waiting for my pretty cardigan !
neutral	overall t mobile have offered a good reliable service , with good coverage over most of the uk , however they do seem prone to changing their price structure at the drop of a hat , and their contact number has also changed .
neutral	being a bit of an old fogie i prefer stability in my service providers .
neutral	overall they are good but could do better !
neutral	some very interesting offers , but their service , when you need to speak to someone is pretty poor .
neutral	got a message to say that the product was to be delivered on this particular day but the website it referred me to seemed to have lost the item or sent it somewhere_else .
neutral	whatever i decided not to stay in and sent e_- mails to both companies .
neutral	no one replied with what was happening - i only got an e_- mail ( basically the same one from the courier and the vendor ) at the beginning of the next_day saying that the part would be delivered that day .
neutral	unfortunately i was out all that day but fortunately returned 00_minutes before the item was delivered .
neutral	at the end of the day all was well and the product works_fine .
neutral	but it could have gone wrong spectacularly .
neutral	the reply below was well received .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	this experience won_'_t put me off as in most_cases described in these reviews everything_went well .
neutral	i assume i must just have been unlucky !
neutral	i ordered two items .
neutral	000 phoned the next_day to say that the wc was out of stock , would be delivered in a few_days .
neutral	that '_s exactly_what happened .
neutral	unfortunately the shower was not included .
neutral	i phoned to find out where it was .
neutral	a charming young_lady promised to find out and phone me , but didn_'_t .
neutral	i had to phone again , this time she did reply , the shower was not in stock .
neutral	would like to have known that at the start .
neutral	i needed to set_up the shower room , so asked her to email instructions .
neutral	yes she said , that will be fine .
neutral	no instructions , but finally , after three_weeks , the shower did arrive .
neutral	we booked well in advance to select a villa rather_than a specific country or region that would meet our diverse extended family needs and were disappointed that this villa and our second choice were both withdrawn over the following months having booked and paid a sizable deposit .
neutral	villa_plus staff helped_us select an_alternative villa on both_occasions and offered some compensation which we accepted .
neutral	that said bob parish at villa_plus was very helpful and overall the villa atalaya was more than adequate .
neutral	the pool and garden were good and safe for the kids with supervision .
neutral	the local rep and local staff were good too ( gardener , pool cleaner and villa cleaner ).
neutral	the jet_0 flights were very good and there was plenty to do and see in the surrounding area but a car is essential for getting around .
neutral	the local beach was disappointing .
neutral	there are some shops : butcher , baker and supermarket within walking_distance as well as a couple of bars and restaurants .
neutral	it all worked out in the end and the family holiday was judged a success by all .
neutral	i '_ve been a customer for over five years .
neutral	the prices are competitive , the web service is ok , the email service has improved to ok , but every now and then you get outages for up to several hours when you can '_t get to you email .
neutral	i agree with another_reviewer , watch for the auto - renewal , they love to capture your card_details and generate those invoices .
neutral	but also note that all prices are displayed excluding vat , which only appears on your emailled invoice .
neutral	printer was ordered at 00 : 00 on wednesday_morning , showed in stock and the money was taken straight_away so i hoped to get the stated " usually shipped same day if ordered before 00 : 00 " deal .
neutral	very disappointing that the shipment was not made until the following_monday_afternoon .
neutral	thankfully parcel_force did their bit and got it delivered next_day .
neutral	not my best experience and will not be top of my list next time .
neutral	this was my first order with boohoo . com it was free delivery ( with code ) and free returns .
neutral	i sent for 0 pairs of leggins in the sale at £ 0 . 00 a pair . the sizes were 00 / 00 and m / l to fit my daughter who is a size 00 , but only one pair was a perfect_fit and another pair fit ok .
neutral	the other three pairs she could not even get them past her knees .
neutral	don_'_t know if i would order from them again as you have to pay for delivery normally .
neutral	ordered a boquet specifically because it contained chrysanths and roses , but it contained mostly lilies , which are disliked by the recipient , who of course was politely grateful .
neutral	delivery was great and on time by a good guy .
neutral	we have used alpha_rooms for years and always an exellent service all the way , the people they used in turkey this year not good the atitude of the english female rep at dalaman airport was at best terrible the bus went without us and all the rep said was you only paid peanuts so i dont know whay your problem is if you have to wait in heat with no shelter or water for a couple of hrs tough we are quite capable people but what if that was someone old / infirm or with disabled children not what i expect from alpharooms
neutral	... if it were not for their payment_method being by cheque , the process is faultless but take a very long time from acceptance of goods through to authorisation of cheque to posting of the cheque and then the delay while cheque goes through the bank .
neutral	given ziffit and music_magpie can pay via bacs i see this as a weekness in the zapper propostition
neutral	now on second shipment where items i know were shipped are marked as not received , raise it with customer_services and the response is ' well the item ( s ) was not there '
neutral	very difficult to speak to anyone after purchase .
neutral	was charged for handset when it was supposed to be free still_waiting for refund .
neutral	edition 00 makes some bugs .
neutral	i booked a collection via parcelhero .
neutral	it was an international packet to usa .
neutral	i paid for an ' express ' service , with collection any time between 0000 /_0000_hrs .
neutral	i wasted an entire day , nine frustrating hours , sitting here , waiting for the courier ( fedex ) to collect .
neutral	at 0000_hrs , i tried to call parcelhero ’_s 0 . 0 pence per_minute 0000 revenue - share line .
neutral	it closes at 0000_hrs !
neutral	so , if a collection is not made , you can ’ t get hold of the company until the next_day !
neutral	what ’_s more is its ‘ live_chat ’ isn_'_t ' live ' after 0000_hrs .
neutral	it closes at the same early time as the phone lines !
neutral	you don_’ t even get connected with some clueless live messaging centre operator in the third world ; it is just an e . mail service after 0 , dressed up as live_chat .
neutral	what was i supposed to do ?
neutral	sit here for another 0 hours like a fool , listening for the door_bell ?
neutral	i wanted to know why but parcelhero ’_s customer service lines had closed .
neutral	i was absolutely seething :-(
neutral	update 00 sep 00 .
neutral	i have to commend parcelhero for its customer service .
neutral	i have received and made numerous phone_calls from / to its staff , including its md .
neutral	i have been assured by him that the reason the collection failed was because fedex failed to fully record and pass on to its staff my collection address .
neutral	the village name and last 0 characters of the post_code had been omitted .
neutral	there are a few roads in this postal area with the same name as mine .
neutral	as a result , the fedex driver had visited an identical address in an adjacent village .
neutral	however , i do still have some criticisms of the parcelhero service .
neutral	above , i describe its customer service lines , which close at the same time as its last collection time of 0000_hrs .
neutral	in addition , it was ironically ‘ fortunate ’ that my package containing 0 legal knives was not collected by fedex .
neutral	according to parcelhero staff , fedex does not carry knives and my parcel could have been impounded in uk by the authorities .
neutral	this would have caused me enormous stress and concern that 0 valuable items (£_000 gbp ) were impounded in uk , whilst the receiver in usa waited interminably and perhaps eventually would demand a refund .
neutral	i chose parcelhero to arrange carriage of these items since knives do not appear in its prohibited items list .
neutral	the parcelhero md advised me that he would ‘ look at ’ the parcelhero customer service closing time and in addition , consider including knives in its prohibited items list .
neutral	as a result , i am raising my score of parcelhero to 0 points .
neutral	last december we ordered springsteen tickets for the june 00st concert at the stadium of light , we chose 0 tickets @ £_00 . 00 add on booking and delivery fee plus_vat and the total charge came to £_000 . 00 fair_enough !
neutral	we were very happy with the online service from viagogo but when our tickets arrived they were clearly_marked at £_00 .
neutral	this is clearly a rip_off i have tried to ring the customer service number on the event information email , this number according to recorded_message no_longer exists .
neutral	i will be writing to viagogo in the hope of getting a refund of the price difference .
neutral	otherwise great .
neutral	good easy web_site to use , sometimes delivery seems to take longer_than you might expect .
neutral	packageing is a bit naff , seems to be get a box and stuff things in . when arrives all items seem like they have been through a tumble_dryer .
neutral	some great offers , wide_variety .
neutral	down_side delivery on the slow side , puts me off ordering again .
neutral	fine little outfit but be careful with stroppy staff , if you nod or say yes to everything they tell you you may be okay but don_'_t disagree with what they say , it '_ll cost you one way or another .
neutral	look out for the extra charges they hide in everything and be prepared to spend more than you save at the other end when faced with a long_journey to where you thought you were flying .
neutral	example weeze to essen , 00 euro taxi ride
neutral	great system but has a little problem listening to it '_s users
neutral	delivery and packing was about the same as other online grocers i '_ve tried , but unfortunately the food i received was lacking in freshness .
neutral	not sure if they just sent the stuff that was nearly out of date , but i '_ve never had a similar problem from other grocers .
neutral	i might have had a bad one - off , but we '_ve never been back !
neutral	the order came as promised but took a week to come .
neutral	other things i ordered on the same day arrived within 0 days .
neutral	have tried other search_engines but google is deffo the best imo !
neutral	!
neutral	downside .... google_chrome !
neutral	!
neutral	very fast & love the way it '_s set_up with saving footprints etc .. but it just will not function along with certain websites .
neutral	i have come_across a few_glitches but the main one has to be " paypal ".
neutral	upon doing some research over the internet i have found out that they have known about compatability issues with certain website '_s but have chose to ignore it for years , in some cases !!
neutral	!
neutral	that '_s just not cricket !!
neutral	!
neutral	absolutely superb website but has dropped its usual standards due to the following sellers :- zoverstocks = fantastic prices & when the orders are correct , 00_% of the time they are in excellent condition ..... but , they take far too long to dispatch items , which seem to be getting longer & longer .
neutral	out of the last handful of orders i would say 00_% of them have been wrong , missing discs , wrong films , not as advertised ect .. ect ... customer service is pretty quick to rectify but when you wait about 00 days for an item which is wrong , not worth the hassle !!
neutral	!.
neutral	indigostarfish . com ( an amazon preferred partner ).... absolutely_shocking delivery times !!
neutral	!..... no comms whatsoever , items take about 0 weeks then one item from order was was then put back upto another 0 weeks ( 0 weeks in total !!
neutral	).... which was subsequently_cancelled !
neutral	!... absolute joke !
neutral	!
neutral	there are some great sellers on there though and take my advice , avoid the above 0 and you won_'_t go too far wrong !!
neutral	!
neutral	picked_up car at milan airport ( having fully paid for everything ) and even with 0 people manning the desks , i had to wait a full 00_minutes before i walked out of the office .
neutral	not sure why everything needed to be so slow ( about 00_mins per person on average at the desk ) when everybody had already entered all their details when booking on - line .
neutral	car was fine though and good value , by booking early .
neutral	return at pisa airport was quick and painless .
neutral	informed car pick_up point was at florence railway station .
neutral	spent several hours walking round trying to find them .
neutral	eventually rang the company to be told it was a good half / three quarters of a mile away which we had to negotiate with heavy cases and inadequate directions .
neutral	when we finally arrived they presented us with a budget car .
neutral	we had paid extra for a bigger car because there were 0 of us and 0 cases to go in the boot .
neutral	the car provided only held two .
neutral	when we complained we were informed that was all they had .
neutral	after remonstrating they did eventually provide us with a bigger car from another garage - however we had to wait a further hour for them to deliver it .
neutral	however everything else , once we had the car , went_smoothly and handover at other end was very easy and swift ( once we had managed to find an open petrol_station on a sunday to fill the car !).
neutral	we chose a different drop_off point from pick_up point and this option proved to be quite pricey for the privilege .
neutral	ebay are an aggrovating company who move too late and do too little to stop all the scams and fraud .
neutral	you have to be certain you are buying from a seller that is trustworthy .
neutral	my rule is that if the seller has less_than % 00 . 0 in their seller ratings then go_elsewhere .
neutral	this means it '_s time_consuming and whenever you spend more than £_00 or so you have to wonder whether you made the right choice of seller .
neutral	in disputes ebay usually believe the seller rather_than the buyer as it costs more to get the money off the seller and risk losing them than it does to tell the buyer to clear off .
neutral	i still use ebay , dont get me wrong its great if you cant get something from a decent website .
neutral	buying from ebay is like buying a hifi from a flea market .
neutral	you dont know_whats in the box till you pay up and open it .
neutral	it wouldnt be so bad that they are overpriced if they actually didnt , each week , make me have to go to customer service desk complaining that what i bought as buy one get one free is actually not shown as that on the reciept .
neutral	their prices are increasing disproportionately to income and even to cost price .
neutral	politicians blame the banks for this economic depression but i can_assure you that the board room at sainsburys and their cronies at [_external_reference_] etc_etc_etc are solely responsible for the majority of the excessive inflation rates .
neutral	their greed is beyond_belief
neutral	before i get onto a review of the site , i want to say something about the local maplin shop i use .
neutral	the manager at the local maplin is unknowledgable and rude .
neutral	on several occassions i have found it necessary to return goods which were unfit for purpose .
neutral	notably a card_reader with a bent pin , and a wireless networking card that refused to automatically connect via dhcp .
neutral	on both these occassions i had my money returned to me , but not before the manager had passed some comment to the effect that it was my fault .
neutral	i take exception to such accusations and infact in the case of the wireless card i even found it highly amusing that he thought i must be one of the people who havent a clue how to set_up a computer ( i run several networks for various people as my vocation in life is a network engineer ) he demonstrated his complete misunderstanding of how networks operate and what all the letters such as n & g mean and how to use them .
neutral	now onto the website .
neutral	i am frequently told that what shows as in stock on the website is incorrect at the store .
neutral	my local_store hardly has anything i need , and even when they do its overpriced .
neutral	the site itself is substandard and shows results for totally random items .
neutral	fo example i searched for key switch and for some totally bizzare reason i was shown a few key switches and various toy planes etc_etc_etc
neutral	this company really must try a lot harder because they are rapidly sliding down the pan .
neutral	get some staff who actually know wth they are talking_about and get some new web designers the ones you employ are rubbish
neutral	i find preloved easy to use , with a nice format .
neutral	but take care !
neutral	i bought a campervan from a regular user a dealer on preloved , and it was not as_described , quite the opposite .
neutral	the mot was not worth the paper it was on , and vosa failed the van on over 00 major points .
neutral	the guarantee was invalid and i was expected to pay a massively inflated amount for this warranty which would not have been valid if i had tried to use it due to a number of reasons .
neutral	the habitation check was not produced as promised .
neutral	it took me months to eventually take the dealer to court .
neutral	i won , but he still tried to wangle out of payment .
neutral	i got all my money back , and he narrowly escaped a judgement .
neutral	but i cannot warn anybody that these campervans could be dangerous in more than one way .
neutral	what would have killed me first the carbon monoxide or the failing brakes ?
neutral	of course he will sell the van again and uses dodgy practices to sell these vans .
neutral	i don_'_t have any way of feeding back my negative experience about this dealer on the preloved site .
neutral	i bought a twin_pack of ballycastle hot toddy from my local aldi and discovered that the ingredients are described as " a warming sweet hot toddy blended with smooth triple distilled irish whiskey infused with lemon and spice flavours ".
neutral	however as there is no list of ingredients i phoned aldi to ask whether there is added sugar or honey .
neutral	( this is pretty important if you ' re diabetic !).
neutral	the customer adviser clearly thought this was a highly amusing question and informed me between giggles that she had no_idea !
neutral	after putting my call on hold for a long time , she then said there was nobody available to provide the information .
neutral	she took my number and promised that someone would call me on monday .
neutral	i shall await the call with interest , but i do feel that the ingredients should be listed on the product in the first place .
neutral	my friends and i bought tickets for rod on 0 june at men .
neutral	the seats , as promised , were fantastic , block b , row j - 0 rows from the stage .
neutral	however , when the tickets arrived we were not seated together as one of the tickets had been sent to someone_else and we had theirs .
neutral	double0tickets sent us a text advising that we should go to the seats originally allocated in row j .
neutral	the officials at the arena would not allow this , indicating that double0tickets do not have the authority to make that statement .
neutral	we managed to sort it out in the end ourselves .
neutral	the biggest disappointment was that the face_value of the tickets was £_00 and we paid almost three_times that much for each ticket .
neutral	people we spoke to sitting in our row and around us paid £_00 .
neutral	it pays to shop around !
neutral	despite this the concert was brilliant .
neutral	excellent start , good site and booking was done nice and fast .
neutral	once @ dubai airport we received a terrible car , old , full off scratches and not in line with what we expected .
neutral	after we complained we got " an upgrade " which meant , same car other color .
neutral	what do you do ?
neutral	we accepted the car , tired , and left to drive to the hotel .. by the way with an empty gas tank so we had to drive thru half dubai to find a gas station ... bad start thx to dollar rent a car !!!
neutral	!
neutral	ordered a new cooker , on line , on a sunday_afternoon .
neutral	i was surprised to see that the following_day , monday , was an option for delivery .
neutral	as our existing cooker was not working i was more than happy to have it delivered next_day .
neutral	on the monday i phoned to check the delivery time .
neutral	i was told that owing to a technical issue it was not going to be delivered that day .
neutral	we agreed another day and told that we would need to phone the day before to get a time window for delivery .
neutral	we made the call and where told between 00 . 00 am and 0 . 00pm , with the driver calling half an_hour before delivery .
neutral	at 0pm we hadn_'_t heard from the driver so i called fires - cookers .
neutral	i was told the times we were given were only an estimate .
neutral	the driver did call and arrived about 0 . 00 pm , better late than never .
neutral	delivery was excellent .
neutral	ordered late on monday and delivered before 0am on the wednesday .
neutral	box was a little damaged due the weight , 00kg , manufacturer needs to invest in stronger boxes as parts could easily have rolled around in the delivery van .
neutral	we were lucky , all parts were there .
neutral	i left my 00 , 00 and 00 year_old to assemble the frame and then my husband had to take over because parts kept falling down .
neutral	it didn_'_t take long to assemble the 00ft trampolin the main problem was keeping the legs up .
neutral	there are 0 poles that slot in but there are no screws which i was amazed at .
neutral	it means that unless the trampoline is on 000_% flat ground at_least one of the poles lifts on the bounce of the trampoline and there is a real danger it could collapse .
neutral	also makes it almost_impossible to move for mowing the grass .
neutral	screws in the legs would have made the whole_thing much sturdier and i had known this i would have paid more for something that has solid legs .
neutral	saying that we '_ve had it a week , had 0 fourteen year olds on it and there have been zero problems and the price was much_cheaper_than the competiton .
neutral	the same size trampoline could easily have cost £_000 more on some websites .
neutral	so pleased with the product , children delighted but just wish i was happier with the legs and being_able to move the trampoline for mowing the grass without a real danger of it collapsing .
neutral	well i spent some time getting prices for my items and packing them up .
neutral	i chose a delivery slot and indeed music_magpie were good enough to sent reminders about my collection date .
neutral	and so on the agreed date i waited ... and waited ... and waited ... for over 00_hours but no courier , no communication , absolutely zilch .
neutral	i have better things to do than wait around all day for a ' no show '.
neutral	i '_ve since attempted to get a re - scheduled collection date and hopefully things will go well but my first impression of music_magpie isn_'_t very good .
neutral	if my stuff is collected i will gladly post positive_feedback .
neutral	the courier arrived the following_day - 00_hours late !
neutral	as luck would have it i was at home and my parcel was collected without_any problem .
neutral	i have updated the review to three stars .
neutral	i really do like boden '_s clothing for men - it '_s well made and stylish to boot .
neutral	but almost every time i go on the website looking for stuff , it '_s out of stock !
neutral	if i stick to making a purchase i usually have weeks to wait for delivery .
neutral	so , often as not , i amble down the high streets instead , and get decent stuff right away .
neutral	i ' d buy a lot more from boden if they kept their stock up a good deal more .
neutral	the print quality of the photos was fine but the size was smaller than the one i ' d asked for .
neutral	i found the software a little troublesome , with it crashing on me twice .
neutral	i was uploading 00 photos when it got stuck when i was about 00 in causing me to start all over again , searching for them from numerous different folders - so that was annoying .
neutral	we have had a few problems with deliveries with interparcel but have to say it '_s not interparcel them self '_s but one of the company '_s they used which was yodel out of 00 bikes delivered one was damaged badly one has_been lost altogether and about 0 of the cartons was damaged when our customs received them .
neutral	i have noticed that yodel are no_longer an option with interparcel so it seems that they must of had a lot of complaints for interparcel not to be using them any more which is a good thing .
neutral	i now use city_link through interparcel and am getting a better service and the driver that collects form me is very good and takes care with the parcels and i have had no_complaints from my customers with the condition they arrive in
neutral	00p for postage when i print it out myself ?
neutral	easy to use and understand but surely your costs are included in the ticket handling_fee to chrage postage on top is a bit annoying .
neutral	ali went very well until we got back and found that the rear number_plate to the car had come off ( somehow ??)
neutral	could not be sure of some slight scratches to the rear bumper and when asked why they hadn_'_t re fitted the number_plate got no reply ???
neutral	the only attendant left the car_park in the mini_bus .???
neutral	still none the wiser as to how it happened or why it was not replaced .......
neutral	oh_yeah , the head rest on my seat ( was raised up very high ?)
neutral	wonder_if the person parking it was really tall and had a bit of a sleep in it ??
neutral	? too many strange goings on for me .
neutral	would recomend that you take your milage reading and ensure that the car is inspected thoroughly before you leave it .
neutral	it could all be coincidence , but lesson_learned for me
neutral	not sure if my prescription was incorrect or if the glasses are incorrect or maybe i need trifocals !
neutral	- but my new bifocals while ok for reading up very close are too strong for me to read my laptop screen or car speedometer - which is really frustrating .
neutral	flowers arrived on the correct day as promised , however , i was really disappointed to find that the deluxe moonlight bouquet was little better_than you see on a garage forecourt but at three or four times the price .
neutral	i will not use this service again and cannot recommend them
neutral	shipping is way too high .
neutral	the item took a long time to be delivered despite saying on the website it would be delivered within 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i had to phone the company 0 or 0 times before i was informed when the despatch date would be .
neutral	i must_say i would like a bit more flavour ...
neutral	i love licorice and it '_s become my fave , but it is a bit .... erm .... insipid ... still i am still off the fags !
neutral	the thing wit liberty_flights is speed ... they are so quick and don_'_t charge too much for postage ... i likt the xo supreme too , it give good hit and a nicotine supply whilst tasting good .
neutral	best of all their e_- liquids do n ot have that horrible unnatural taste that some have .
neutral	that '_s why i get all my stuff from them
neutral	i was disappointed that it took them a week to email me to say they had now processed my order and it was ready for collection from the courier .
neutral	not sure why it took so long .
neutral	this means from day of ordering to delivery took 0 days which i think is too slow .
neutral	eye_test pretty painless .
neutral	glasses 0 for 0 .
neutral	prices pretty good , but they will not repair broken arms , so at home several pairs of nearly new glasses with arms missing
neutral	go in for 0 tyre , your car needs 0 . had mine mot / serviced , passed ok .
neutral	but told timing belt was due for change , cost £_000 , went to vauxhall because recall on horn , asked about timing belt change , wasnt due for another 0 years , phew saved a few bob there , when you are waiting for car fitters always seem to be on phones telling customers that their cars need something renewing
neutral	when you buy happy meal they will not serve coffee as your drink
neutral	ordered on the phone .
neutral	staff were friendly , well informed & helpful .
neutral	promised same day dispatch , next_day delivery & emails_keeping me upto_date .
neutral	no emails - so i called .
neutral	phone is out of stock .
neutral	will be 0 to 0 working_days before dispatch .
neutral	they really need to make_sure they have stock when you place the order .
neutral	( but they do answer the phone quickly , & are friendly )
neutral	i ordered a canon ixus 000 camera and was able to track its delivery until i received it fairly quickly .
neutral	however it was a powershot sd 000 which was sent , which is the us version of the same camera , complete with us battery_charger .
neutral	on hunting through the small_print on bitesizedeals website it states that they may substitute another countries version of the product you order .
neutral	canon uk customer_services state that the warranty of the powershot i was sent is invalid outside the us and that leaves me relying on the warranty service offered by bitesizedeals themselves .
neutral	i also am left having to buy a uk battery_charger to be able to use the camera .
neutral	bitesizedeals customer_services have not yet got back to me about my complaint .
neutral	if i ' d seen this review website before i would have shopped elsewhere !
neutral	don_'_t go_anywhere_near oak_furnitureland their customer_services are rude unhelpful and uncaring .
neutral	i have never had such bad service anywhere in my whole 00 years of life .
neutral	i am so disappointed with them !
neutral	i just thank_god i never bought the bedroom_furniture to go with my sitting room furniture that turned_up damaged .
neutral	at last they have been back in touch and this time the customer_services were excellent thanks kevin maguire hope i spelt his name right faith restored !
neutral	!!
neutral	hence the new rating 0_stars :)
neutral	product ( 0 pine broom handles ) was ok if a bit roughly finished ; one was not straight but will do for the application for which they were purchased .
neutral	delivery by city_link was prompt but to the wrong house .
neutral	they delivered to my next door neighbour , saying there was no - one in at my address .
neutral	i was in all day along with a crew of builders , so i don_'_t know which door the driver went to .
neutral	the variofocals and fit are not as good as last time i ordered them .
neutral	the prescription was the same as was everything else but this time they are not as good or as comfortable .
neutral	no_problems with the delivery .
neutral	currently have personal 00 phone , which drops the 0g signal and makes it difficult to surf on the move .
neutral	work location has poor reception so personal mobile is pointless during most of the working week
neutral	i bought the ipod shiffle to use in the gym as it was small and compact with easy controls .
neutral	there is a problem with the headphone control button which has failed on two headphones now .
neutral	i had one pair replaced within the warranty_period , but they lasted 0 months .
neutral	this was a known issue and should have been rectified by apple , but customers have to prove the goods are within warranty , despite having recorded the serial_number with apple .
neutral	given that people using this service are usually stressed to get to a plane on time or knackered from a long_journey home , the drivers and staff on the phone could be more precise .
neutral	we phoned 00_minutes away and were told to go to the car_park .
neutral	we did and we waited for 00_minutes which at 0am is a long time , only to have to phone them again to find that the driver had been waiting on chairs facing away from the cars .
neutral	whilst not a big deal it was annoying .
neutral	we fly standby a lot , so we arrive very early for a good reason .
neutral	coming_back we found we had to pay the parking ( not had that before ) and we didn_'_t know and had no english money to hand , so we had to unpack a case by the barrier to find some coins .
neutral	we were not happy about this ... just telling us would have been helpful .
neutral	doesn_'_t mean we won_'_t use it again but prefer the [_external_reference_] people although they don_'_t use the car_parks .
neutral	computer is great - good price , decent spec for less_than pc_world , working well after a month of use
neutral	but
neutral	it arrrived broken , processor moved in transit
neutral	it got sent back - eventually - took days to get this arranged
neutral	another arrived , again it took far too long
neutral	and it arrived broken again
neutral	this time , a support guy talked me through resiting the processor which was a new skill for me - amazingly it worked .
neutral	then i discovered that all my calls re problems , returns and resiting cost quite a lot - which was annoying given it was not my fault .
neutral	support guys were very pleasant and competent but the return and repair process is not too efficient .
neutral	however i would use them again .
neutral	i had previously bought from frost a can of gasket remover , which had been delivered .
neutral	this fresh order , the ultrasonic cleaner and cleaning fluid was ordered but for some reason which i can not fathom i was sent , and charged for , another can of gasket remover .
neutral	admittedly , i had not read the confirmation_email which included this but it was not welcome .
neutral	the u / s cleaner works well .
neutral	i '_ve used printerinks many_times before , but unfortunately they took so long to dispatch my cartridges this time that i will shop around next time .
neutral	cannot see how you can justify charging £_00 for us paying by credit_card , when other holiday companies do not charge anything . the banks dont charge us , so were does your cost come from ?
neutral	other than that holiday is a fair price
neutral	i ordered a well_known manufacturers barbel rod from tackleuk on the 00nd of july this year , according to the website it was in stock .
neutral	however i had a phone_call the next_day telling_me it was out of stock , but a delivery was expected before the end of the month .
neutral	i said to put it on back order .
neutral	as i was going away for two_weeks holiday i was not too concerned about the delay .
neutral	on my return from holiday , still no rod .
neutral	correspondance with tackle_uk continued through their website and i was told on several_occasions that they were expecting delivery at the end of whichever week it was that i contacted them .
neutral	i was on the point of cancelling the order when the order tracking changed from holding to pending on the 0th of september so i hung on a little longer .
neutral	the rod was eventually despatched on the 00th of september and i recieved it the next_day , by next_day delivery at tackleuk '_s expense .
neutral	( i had only requested standard delivery ) i am giving tackleuk the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they were going on information from the manufacturer and that the the delays and missinformation originated with the manufacturer , although i do not know that for a fact and may be being unfair to the manufacturer .
neutral	they did , in the end get my rod to me as quickly as possible , at their expense .
neutral	would i use them again ?
neutral	probably yes .
neutral	have used this transfer service twice once in may which was brilliant on both journeys ( to and from airport ) and just recently in august .
neutral	our return to airport was brilliant but our pick_up from airport to resort did not show and another service took over the booking after ringing the number of the firm and getting clearance .
neutral	wish they had kept me posted on the despatch / delivery .
neutral	i had to keep chasing and eventually i contacted their delivery company myself - frustrating !
neutral	!
neutral	bought a hotpoint washer / drier .
neutral	installed by a monkey .
neutral	went into meltdown after a month .
neutral	phoned currys to complain .
neutral	within 00_minutes an engineer was on the door_step .
neutral	thank_you hotpoint for the most remarkable service .
neutral	currys , you need to improve .
neutral	well on arrival to destination waited for 0 / 0 hour for pick_up . the fiteen minute journey we were told took nearly 0 / 0 hour . on return arrived at pick_up point for time they asked . bus was 00_minutes late . driver missed one client and had to do a return to pick_up point . from there almost at airport when driver apologised and returned to resort and did a further 0 or 0 pick_up before eventually heading bak to airport . as you can imagine was not very pleased . may think again about using resort_hoppa .
neutral	i ordered flowers to arrive in england when i was visiting my parents for my stepmother '_s birthday .
neutral	i ordered them for the day before her_birthday as we were going to france on her_birthday for lunch .
neutral	well they arrived the day of her_birthday and had to be taken in by a neighbour .
neutral	quality was reasonable considering the extreme snow etc .
neutral	i . e .
neutral	the roses showed some deterioration , browning on petals .
neutral	i purchased a pair of adidas golf_shoes , had them on about 0 times , due to our lovely weather , had the chance to go back out and play the game i love to find out that the right shoe was letting in water , phoned littlewoods explained the situation , they were so nice on the phone , told me to return them and they would credit my account with the £_000 that they cost .
neutral	a few_weeks_later the shoes were returned to me , no letter stating why , i had to phone littlewoods again , i was told that i had to proof there was a fault within the shoe myself and that i had to get in touch with adidas , now the way i see it is that i purchased the shoe from littlewoods and it should have been up them to find the fault , according to the sales of goods_act , this should have been the case .
neutral	i have always been happy shopping with littlewoods but was left very disappointed with the way i was treated .
neutral	i have to say that i am a very regular customer of amazon - most weeks i buy something and i always go there first .
neutral	on the whole , they tend to be the cheapest , although they ' re not always the fastest and their packaging does leave a lot to be desired .
neutral	my last purchase really annoyed me however .
neutral	i bought a game for my grandson - it had lots of little bits that had to be pushed out and put_together before playing it , so imagine my disappointment and shock when i opened the box and it had all been done - clearly second_hand but i hadn_'_t paid a second_hand price .
neutral	i find this entirely unacceptable and think somebody had probably ordered and returned it , but nobody bothered to check the returned goods .
neutral	that '_s my guess anyway .
neutral	in any case , it has made me rethink my constant use of them .
neutral	i didn_'_t bother to return the game and just kept it , how many other people are like me and can '_t be bothered to complain ?
neutral	i think i will look_elsewhere for products now and not just keep going there blindly .
neutral	in addition , the bad_press about not paying taxes has made me uncomfortable with them anyway .
neutral	why should i pay tax and they don_'_t ?
neutral	so i '_ll be buying a lot less in the future from them .
neutral	good product , will order more , came next da .
neutral	still_waiting for my order
neutral	on 00 april i ordered a variety of items from bigdug , namely some divided galvanised shelving , a longspan bench , a hazardous waste cabinet , a draper tool cabinet and a bolted steel workbench .
neutral	the ordering_process was fine , although i found the website a little_confusing as they have so many items at so many different prices , with similar descriptions that it is difficult to decide , from the limited information available , what is best suited to your requirements and your price range .
neutral	anyway , i spoke to " nicola " in customer_services who assisted me with placing my order and who was very friendly and helpful .
neutral	she offered to throw in a free gift - more of that later .
neutral	the hazardous waste cabinet , the shelving and the longspan bench arrived very quickly indeed .
neutral	only one delivery man , and very heavy goods , so it was just as well there were three of us at home to unload the lorry .
neutral	the pallet holding the bench and shelving would have required an industrial fork lift truck to unload , so we had to cut all the packaging off and unload it piece by piece .
neutral	two slight problems , though , no assembly_instructions for the bench , and the instructions for the galvanised shelving was for ordinary galvanised shelving not the divided shelving .
neutral	a call to customer_services ( incredibly helpful and friendly again ) pointed me in the direction of their website from where you can download all their instructions .
neutral	well , apart_from longspan benches and divided galvanised shelving , it turns_out .
neutral	more calls to customer_services .
neutral	the longspan bench is a new item , and there are as yet no assembly_instructions for it ; but i was sent instructions for bulk longspan racking , which was close enough .
neutral	the divisions in the galvanised shelving i could work out myself without too much difficulty .
neutral	one word of warning , though : i ordered a starter bay with a width of 0000mm and an extension bay of 0000mm , naively assuming that the total width would be 0000mm .
neutral	it isn_'_t , it is 0000mm which meant i had to spend a couple of hours relocating an electrical wall socket , and making good .
neutral	the draper tool cabinet also arrived very quickly , but the bolted workbench did not .
neutral	the website quoted a delivery time of 0 - 00 days when i ordered it , and as i write ( 00 days_later ) it has still not arrived .
neutral	i have been in regular contact with customer_services , who are very responsive , but they say this item is coming direct from their manufacturer , is made to order and the earliest they are likely to deliver is monday 00th_may , three and a half weeks after i placed the order .
neutral	i am hoping that they might just manage to bring this forward to friday , but am not holding my breath .
neutral	one rather odd experience during this whole_process : the free gift i referred to above was a set of 00 small storage_boxes .
neutral	these arrived with the first delivery of shelving and the hazardous wasterage boxes .
neutral	these arrived with the first delivery of shelving and the hazardous waste cabinet .
neutral	i was slightly taken_aback , though , to come home one evening and find a further 0 , 000 small storage_boxes packed onto a large pallet and left on my drive .
neutral	i e_- mailed customer_services who told me it was an " administrative error " and they would arrange for the pallet to be collected , which they did very quickly .
neutral	very impressed so far with the quality of the items i have ordered , i would love to see what my bolted steel workbench looks_like .
neutral	we ordered an electric_guitar and all stuff needed .
neutral	i had a question , so during ordering i tried to phone them .
neutral	phonenumber did not work from of the netherlands .
neutral	so i sent them an e_- mail to ask them their telephonenumber .
neutral	they have not replied untill today .
neutral	ordering_process : it is promised that you can fill in a delivery adress , different from the invoice address .
neutral	that did not work .
neutral	so , after you have ordered and you have paid , you find out that you are not able to fill in another delivery address .
neutral	working with computers and programs the whole day , we managed to change the deliveryaddress during the processing of the order .
neutral	the package arrived at the promised day .
neutral	that '_s good .
neutral	but what a bad carton they had used !
neutral	i have considered to refuge the delivery .
neutral	damage around all over the box .
neutral	our son would not have been happy ...
neutral	i decided to accept the package .
neutral	products : amp / guitar connection makes a lot of noise .
neutral	cheaper_than_expected .
neutral	will we recommend gear0music ?
neutral	mwahhhh .
neutral	marcel blom
neutral	update_: connection cable between guitar and amp was damaged .
neutral	matthew kirk wrote us that we would receive a new one .
neutral	which they have sent immediately .
neutral	which we received very swift .
neutral	positive_note : it was a better quality than the original supplied one , so there was much less noise and rumble at the amp .
neutral	small issue : they managed to mix partsof the invoice address and the delivery address .
neutral	lucky us that it arrived anyway ...
neutral	here is my letter to hammonds sent 0 weeks_ago - still no reply or even acknowledgement , also no allen key which was apparently posted 0 weeks_ago as the senior fitter refused to give it to me !!
neutral	!
neutral	we write to complain regarding the above order of bedroom_furniture taken by your designer , john fox on 00th_january .
neutral	a surveyor ( lee ) checked the order and measurements on 00th_january and installation was booked for 00th and 00th_february_0000 .
neutral	we expressed concern at the short_notice and were advised that hammonds required seven_days ’ notice of cancellation .
neutral	despite the shortage of time to decorate the room in readiness for the installation , we complied and were ready for the fitter , lee falconer to commence work when he arrived at 0am .
neutral	on wednesday 00th , i overheard lee contact his manager as he was concerned straightaway about the position of the main light switch , something which was raised with the surveyor as i was worried that john fox had not taken this into_consideration in his design .
neutral	the manager told lee the company would pay for electrical works to move the switch , however , lee managed to get around this although the wardrobe doors overlap more than they should .
neutral	we would not have wanted the switch moved as this would have ruined the decorating already undertaken .
neutral	lee also advised me that the internal brackets had not been delivered but should arrive the following_day – at no time were we advised of this in advance by hammonds .
neutral	furthermore the internal floor panels promised by the designer had not been ordered .
neutral	at around 0pm that day it transpired that the internal brackets would not arrive the following_day and since customer service closed at 0pm i was unable to ascertain when the delivery would be made .
neutral	by this time it was too late to contact my husband who had the thursday booked as leave , a complete_waste of a day ’_s holiday .
neutral	lee could not complete the works as booked and was most apologetic – i completed his paperwork accordingly before he departed .
neutral	despite my request for hammonds to contact me first thing thursday_morning with an explanation of what was happening , i was not contacted until late morning only to be told that the bedroom_furniture could not be completed until the following thursday ( 00th ).
neutral	i have therefore had to take additional leave .
neutral	to cap it all , i received a text on monday 00th stating that hammonds would be delivering the furniture on tuesday 00th before 00am .
neutral	i telephoned customer_services at 0 . 00 to rearrange as this was inconvenient but never received the promised call back and had to telephone yet again at 0 . 00 to find out what was going on !
neutral	i was told that the order would be delivered to a fitter who would in turn deliver it to our fitter who was due come on thursday 00th – only for a box of parts to be delivered to me on wednesday 00th .
neutral	i was then told that a senior fitter , wally , had been booked for thursday 00th who would handle the remaining fitting and ensure i was completely_satisfied with the furniture .
neutral	despite_being ready to receive wally at 0am , he had not arrived by 0 . 00am .
positive	on the day of delivery i was emailed and text a one hour delivery time_slot which was accurate !
positive	if only all online purchases were so straight_forward and user_friendly , thank_you !
positive	excellent selection of chamilia beads .
positive	first_class service , and super customer service dealing_with questions too !

positive	suntransfers were waiting for us as we walked through the airport to take us to our hotel , they text the day before our departure to confirm our return pickup and arrived 0 minutes ahead of schedule .

positive	i used hostelbookers last_year when i was on a 0month uk and europe trip ... with no_hassles at all .

positive	after experiences of john_lewis ( nice stores but difficult to try anything out and very limited for real hifi separates ) and richer_sounds ( the less said the better ), i was very pleasantly_surprised to find that the old_fashioned approach of courtesy , helpfulness and expert friendly advice could still be found in the high tech age !

positive	“ hi there !
positive	just wanted to say that it took me months to save up for my furniture ( tokyo ), which was delivered today , and i was a bit_nervous_about ordering stuff i hadn_'_t actually seen - particularly as i have seen some really poor quality furniture when looking round .
positive	however , i ' m absolutely_delighted with it !
positive	the quality is fantastic - and i '_ll be ordering some dining_chairs next month !”
positive	always had no trouble and quick deliveries .
positive	for the price the product is better_than can be expected .
positive	they are almost half the price of the cheapest rival i can find .
positive	i can buy items here that i would not buy on other_sites because the addition of delivery charges makes the product too expensive .
positive	this site allows me to order things with no delivery charge , this makes them a bargain .
positive	i get get the products for the same price i would get them if i had a local shop .
positive	i do hope the sort_out the delivery difficulties though , sometimes i have waited a bit too long for a delivery .
positive	this is especially important when it comes to bags of feed .

positive	i needed to order some vietnamese dong but your company did not seem to handle this particular currency .
positive	0 .
positive	i would have liked to have been able to enter the foreign_currency amount in the request box as i required a set amount of us dollars .
positive	your website seemed to ony allow figures in the english pound box , and then adjust with + and - which i found a little unsatisfactory .
positive	very impressed with the ease of bank transfers , the updating e_- mails from currency_club letting me know exactly_what stage the transaction had reached , and the next_day special delivery of the currency to my home .
positive	brilliant .
positive	thank_you .
positive	a party of us went to dubai for a family wedding . ben was recommended by one of the party as he had arranged flights for them on previous occasions . all went well including a bassinet for our nine month old grandson . ben was easy to talk to and did his best to help sort all our needs .

positive	as a person very experienced in all matters ' diy ' i found assembling the metal garage very very time_consuming and the instructions not as helpful as they could be !
positive	the fact that there are so many small pieces to put_together to make each part of the building makes it a blind task unless you have previously erected one and would therefore be aware of pitfalls encountered .

positive	the building looks good now it is up and all becomes clear mistakes included !
positive	excellent and prompt service .

positive	we had been into several travel agencies and felt pressurised but on speaking to the advisor tina at very cheap holidays she made us feel comfortable from start to finish .
positive	we knew where we wanted to go and she gave us her advice and of course fantastic price and on no occasion were we pressurised to use the company or bombarded with telephone_calls which is what we had with other_companies .
positive	she advised the hotel it was our_honeymoon and also my husbands_00th_birthday and we had a bottle of champagne chilling in our room when we arrived .
positive	we were also thankful of her suggestion of the extra baggage_allowance and felt quite smug watching everyone_else panicking with their lowly 00kg .

positive	as part of my kitchen refurb last_year , i put new cupboard doors on the old units from hh '_s parent company jmt trade ltd .
positive	i was originally going to reuse the old handles , but after a little bit of umming and aahing from the other half , i decided to have a look online for the replacements .
positive	i hadn_'_t gone into household handles premises because i just assumed they would be dear .
positive	not so .
positive	when i did find them online , almost accidentally , they were cheaper or similar price as the other_suppliers .
positive	because i had already chatted to them about the doors for ages before i made a decision , i knew they were trustworthy .
positive	so i had no_hesitation in buying once i had seen their prices .

positive	it '_s a great forum for keeping in contact and getting technical_support , blowing off or having a serious debate .
positive	downsides - only one really - a rather incestuous relationship with petrolhead nirvana .

positive	have been very very impressed with diy kitchens .
positive	okay , so you need to know what to order ( including end panels , plinth , cornice , handles ), but ordering is pretty straightforward and it is well_worth making the effort as the prices are amazing .
positive	things i have really liked about diy kitchens :-
positive	- massive_range of unit sizes / styles , allowing you to create a truly bespoke looking kitchen
positive	- good quality units .
positive	was a little_nervous_about how good the quality would be , but even our carpenters who fitted the kitchen were impressed !
positive	- ready built units .
positive	saved loads of time at installation
positive	- colours .
positive	we went for a painted kitchen , and could pick any farrow & ball colour
positive	- unit ' options '.
positive	you can ask for units to be dry assembled , and have screw in feet , allowing you to adapt units easily .
positive	we have used base unit on a base unit to create mid height oven housings , and done the same to create some extra high storage areas .
positive	- massive selection of ' finishing touches ' - pop up power points , intergrated bins , magic corner units etc_etc
positive	- tea & biscuits with the order - carpenters were very happy .
positive	- sorting_out post delivery problems .
positive	we had a couple of doors missing .
positive	these took about 00 days to come , but we were kept_informed and they were very helpful !
positive	if i could change anything about their service ( and i ' m getting petty now )
positive	- would be great to get sample painted boards for the bespoke painted kitchens ( we chose colours from test patches painted in the wall )
positive	- delivery notes that are easier to check off against the order ( need to ensure everything is okay within 00_hours ).
positive	other things to consider if you order from diy kitchens :-
positive	- don_'_t underestimate the space you will need when the cabinets arrive !
positive	- be sure of what you need before you order !
positive	- get yourself a good fitter ( who can often advise on what you will need in terms of panels / cornices before you order )
positive	- measure carefully and check how units fit ( i . e .
positive	does it fit flush against the wall ?)
positive	you can phone diy kitchens for this information .
positive	i am a very happy customer and would heartily_recommend diy kitchens .
positive	wow , posted my phones on saturday_morning , money in my bank_account by monday lunch_time .

positive	), that '_s high praise indeed .
positive	if their goods and services were rubbish , they would have been binned a long time ago .
positive	if you ' re looking for chocolate products , especially for cake decorating , don_'_t go_anywhere_else .
positive	their cigarello '_s come with very few breakages and they are the best tasting too .
positive	i love pet_supermarket .
positive	as the elderly mum of two 0 month old indoor kittens , i couldn_'_t do without their support .
positive	we use the worlds best cat_litter ( which is by the way !)
positive	and buy the huge and heavy 00kilo sack every 0 weeks .
positive	at my age there is no way i could carry that home from the supermarket , even if i could find somewhere locally that sells it .
positive	when the soft food and iams kitten biscuits are on offer and cheaper_than my local supermarket , which is very i buy them on line as well .

positive	well finally , i plucked up the courage and found mr_memory '_s website ( among others ).
positive	the scan feature was brilliant and recommended exactly the items i needed .
positive	the price was competitive , so i went_ahead with the order .
positive	i was then pleasantly_surprised to find that i could choose free first_class postage .
positive	but i was feeling quite excited about giving my laptop a boost , so i chose express despatch ( only 00p !
positive	).
positive	so , having first clicked onto the mr_memory website at about 0 . 00pm on a friday , i managed to find what i needed , do couple of price comparisons , check the installation process , eat some lunch and place my order within the hour - the memory arrived with the post about 00 on saturday and was installed and working_perfectly by midday .
positive	quick , painless and a massive boost to my laptop !!
positive	thanks mr_memory !
positive	a very good service .

positive	having recently seen a tv report on mattresses made in china carrying false fireproof certificates , we were determined to shop for silentnight , a brand that we trust .
positive	we ordered a comfort pocket 0000 memory mattress and are delighted with our choice .
positive	its is medium - firm and very comfortable .
positive	the price was very competitive and included delivery and removal of packing material .
positive	we were further impressed by the offer of a £_00 discount to remove our old mattress .
positive	we chose our delivery day - a saturday at no extra_cost .
positive	the day before , we received a ' phone_call confirming a 0 - hour delivery slot .
positive	then the delivery crew rang on the day further to confirm a 0 - hour_slot .
positive	the two man crew arrived as promised and were clean , courteous and professional .
positive	what more could we want ?
positive	i find that chemist_direct consistently offers good value on large pack royal_canin dog foods .

positive	delivery itself is always prompt .
positive	booked and collected on monday .
positive	notification via tracking that ups has delivered to houston today ( wednesday ).
positive	just waiting for confirmation from my son that he has managed to collect it from the office in his apartment complex .
positive	so far i have been very pleased with the service .
positive	i have used other intermediaries in the past .
positive	i think it depends on which carrier is chosen when making the booking .
positive	fedex is best for rural australia , ups for any city and nothing at all works in italy !
positive	so far i am very pleased with the service .
positive	although there was some difficulty getting the watch exactly when i wanted i was kept up to date with the order process .
positive	in fact the watch ended_up arriving sooner_than i expected so it all ended well .
positive	the watch is perfect and a great price

positive	i asked them if they could ship to me in a replacement for my sgx model , a couple of days_later i was back up and running again .

positive	competitive_pricing for premium tyres .

positive	unbelievable .
positive	it was about half theprice of a leading discount furniture store for what to me looks_like theexact same product .
positive	the manufacturers have obviously added a fewadditional parts to improve the bed and have not updated the instructionsbut it was fairly easy to work out .
positive	highly_recommended from a thoroughlysatisfied customer .
positive	well donemervyn kinney .
positive	virgin games is a good all rounder , if you want to experience the thrill and fun of playing bingo and slots .... i must_say they have by far the best selection of slots of any site , you can also play them in demo mode , so you can try them out before playing for cash to see which ones you prefer .
positive	although you can win big , you must remember that you can also lose , but virgin games allows for this by enabling you to put a cap on the amount you can deposit if you so wish , as it can be easy to get carried away as on all sites .
positive	the chat_hosts are great and offer quizzes and media games allowing you to win some extra cash , not forgetting the daily free game in which you can win cash , there is also a free monthly game too .
positive	all in all i would not_hesitate to recommend virgin games to anyone .
positive	a very easy site to follow , with excellent instruction videos .
positive	the goods were delivered swiftly and in good condition .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone , trade or diy
positive	from ordering to delivery , it was all very simple .

positive	perfect , thank_you !
positive	abi & heather .
positive	i found digitalrev . com on search_engine and bought purely on price ( which was excellent ).
positive	normally i would check and double_check reviews before using new company but , thankfully , my lack of research was safe this time !

positive	i ordered two_pairs of reading_glasses .
positive	everything fine .
positive	after about two months one of the nose pads on one pair fell_off and was lost .
positive	annoying , but these things happen .
positive	it won_'_t be a problem as long as specky can solve it .
positive	i contacted specky to ask if they could send me a nose pad and screw .
positive	i received a very nice reply saying that wasn_'_t possible so they would re - send my complete order .
positive	a week_later , two_pairs of glasses arrived .
positive	one might be wary that customer service won_'_t be so good from an internet seller as from a high_street shop .
positive	in this case that is clearly not so and i am_delighted with the service from speckyfoureyes .
positive	thanks , samantha .
positive	an easy to us website with a good range of frames at good prices .

positive	its truly a place no one in their right minds should miss , you cant lose but plenty to win and tell your friends as i am sure you will ...
positive	go on give it a go .
positive	thanks for senidng me my items so quickly .
positive	dedicated smokers / vapers will know how imporant that is .
positive	i stumbled_across the supplement_warehouse website and discovered that they were substantially_cheaper on most of the items that i buy .
positive	they were the same price on one of the pricier items .
positive	i look_forward to reviewing their delivery time .
positive	i only have one thing could gave been done better !!!!
positive	after paying almost £_00 for connection i thought they would have turned the doors around on fridge /_freezer !!!!
positive	especially as my husband is recovering from surgery after a new heart valve only a few_weeks_ago !!!
positive	other than that wonderful service second to none !!!
positive	!
positive	love personalised items especially for grandchildren .
positive	they don_'_t lose things so easily because they are easily identified !!
positive	!
positive	bought a few electrical items from this company .

positive	grantham ford dealership have been brilliant .
positive	lucy on the reception is friendly approachable and extremely_helpful .
positive	may be more_expensive than others but i think you get what you pay for .
positive	would definitely recommend .
positive	from searching for tyres to making the booking it was simplistic throughout .
positive	price was excellent especially to say they were fitted by a national company that would have charged 00 per_cent more direct through their website .
positive	will recommend and use again …..
positive	ordered one for a family_member engraved .
positive	was so impressed treated myself .
positive	pens are excellent pricewise .
positive	engraving seems a little_steep compared to pen cost , but it is so worth it .
positive	at_least now workmates wont be picking my pen up believing it is theirs .
positive	will_definitely purchase again should the need_arise .
positive	the dehumidifier is much_better_than i expected .
positive	it is slim enough to stand against the wall without causing an obstruction and quiet enough to use in the bedroom at night .
positive	delivery was very quick .
positive	if i need another dehumidifier i know where to go .
positive	i ordered the saw at 00 . 00 on thursday and it arrived at 0 . 00 on friday with free delivery and it was 00_% cheaper_than screwfix .

positive	i cannot_fault simply_games , have used a few online stores in the past for our video games , and although they start with a good service , for some reason the level of service decreases and we lose confidence in them .
positive	we have decided that we will use simply_games for all our games in the future .
positive	managed to lock myself out of my account , 0 minute on live_chat with catherine and all sorted .
positive	you don_'_t get that kind of service every day .

positive	we had a lovely day in the jewellery_quarter yesterday , looking for a ruby to celebrate forty years of marriage .
positive	we went to marlows first , where margaret remembered that we had bought a beautiful diamond from her last_year .
positive	in fact , she recognised the stone !
positive	it needed resizing and this was promptly organised .
positive	then on to the task of finding a ruby ...
positive	i saw a fantastic ring , a great price was negotiated , but i had to be sure that it was the ' one ', and we hadn_'_t looked anywhere_else .
positive	margaret understood and happily we left the store to go searching .. look where you like , you will come back to marlows .
positive	when we returned to collect my resized diamond_ring , we looked again at the ruby .
positive	nothing anywhere_else had come close to the colour , quality and style .
positive	it was perfect for me , so now i have two fantastic rings from marlows .
positive	thank_you margaret for your expert_advice and friendly service .
positive	chris and john hayes

positive	this is the third order i have placed with my tuxedo and i cannot_praise this retailer enough .
positive	the range of items is exceptional , particularly for a slim person with long arms !
positive	website is easy to navigate and find what you require ( and plenty of choice ).
positive	once ordered , my goods have arrived within a day or two and the the prices are very competitive .
positive	no need to look any further .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	really fast service and a great service when sending back a exchange item , paying return postage is part and parcel if you order a incorrect item .
positive	could have got slightly more for my 0 phones at other_sites but their feedback / reviews were very negative so i used mazuma .
positive	sent the phones on monday , money was in my bank tuesday .
positive	furthermore the amount agreed was in my account , not less like other purchasing sites seem to do .
positive	if you are thinking of using them .... do it i ' m_glad i did .
positive	we have had lots of villa holidays in our time but villaplus truly provided a fabulous service .
positive	the rep , kim was brilliant , sorting_out our wi -_fi for us ( which was of vital importance to my kids !!)
positive	we '_ve never been in a villa where the cleaners have come in and changed towels so often .
positive	it was truly refreshing .
positive	the villa inside and out was kept in excellent condition , pool was immaculate .
positive	we are already looking to book with villaplus next year .
positive	i ordered after the cut_off time for next_day delivery and i still received my item first thing the next_day .
positive	highly impressed .
positive	thank_you
positive	i was delighted with the sunglasses i ordered .
positive	they arrived really quickly and fitted_perfectly .

positive	i have already_recommended them to my friends and i will_certainly order from them again .
positive	excellent service with great communication .
positive	i was kept_informed as to how my order was being_processed .
positive	bought a very competetively_priced rab downie for my wife '_s xmas_present .
positive	quick and helpful on the phone checking stock prior to order , quick delivery and very helpful after xmas when having to swap as the size was wrong ( my fault not theirs ) they were sensible and relaxed about the deadline for exchanges .
positive	excellent company to deal with , would strongly_recommend them .
positive	it just shows you can give a good serivce if you think thats important .
positive	i have been searching websites to replace an old kilim for the last couple of years , and i was thrilled to come_across carpetvista .
positive	the site offers an unparalleled selection of these carpets , and my experience is that the colour representation used is very accurate .
positive	when ordered , service given in respect of information and delivery is exceptional - less_than 0 days from sweden to my door in scotland is pretty special in my experience .
positive	and of course , the quality of the carpet supplied is excellent .
positive	i just wonder_why it took me so long to find the website , when i was searching for " kilim ".
positive	i '_ve now bought a camera and a couple of extra lenses from park_cameras , and have experienced prompt attention and delivery on each_occasion
positive	they managed to provide an item i had had great difficulty in locating at other on - line retailers , and at a lower price .
positive	took just four days from order to delivery .
positive	these are indeed great pieces of kit , had one in the previous house , albeit a genuine early victorian one i had reclaimed and restored , i generously left it for the new owner , the thing i find interesting is that this type of airer seems to have more relevance in modern houses that have less usable space for drying clothes during inclement weather , i guess people often just throw money into tumble driers , pulleymaid airers are not only a green alternative but i would guess , as a replacement for a tumble_drier , will repay their initial cost many_times over .
positive	excellent service with very quick delivery
positive	copy of e_- mail sent to hursts .
positive	in response to an order placed on a sunday_afternoon
positive	" as always superb service and great price , despite some of the worst snow this year , combined with us living in the most remote village in england , you still managed to get the mixer to me in under 00_hours , as always your couriers were on time polite and courteous ."
positive	i then had a small query after delivery :-
positive	sent e_- mail query at @ 00 - 00hrs , received a response with resolution at 00 - 00_hrs
positive	i doubt any company could equal let_alone better the service i received from hurst and sons
positive	the goods arrived on time and were in excellent condition and loved by the person i gave them to
positive	helpful pre_- sales technical info by phone .
positive	order processed quickly and delivered next_day .
positive	item easy to program with door code and works_fine .
positive	would definitely recommend easygates to friends !
positive	as a local theatre group we have a regular need for printed matter in the form of flyers , posters and programmes for each of our productions .
positive	over the years we have tried various printers , many of whom were based some distance away , and contact was by phone or email .
positive	with printing . com we have been delighted to find a locally based printing company which is very approachable and affordable , and which offers a design and print service to an extremely high_standard , which we feel reflects the quality of our shows .
positive	our recent pantomime programme for aladdin won the scottish national and operatic and dramatic ( noda ) award for best programme .
