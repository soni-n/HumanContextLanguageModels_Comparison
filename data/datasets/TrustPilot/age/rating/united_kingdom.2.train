negative	i have used apharooms twice once last_year in marrakech and this year in spain .
negative	i am_disabled and require disabled access shower facilities .
negative	i
negative	i had booked hotels where alpharooms stated the hotels as having rooms with facilities for the disabled .
negative	in marrakech the hotel kenzi farah did not have rooms with bathroom facilities for the disabled .
negative	in spain the hotel sorra daurada gave us a room with no disabled facilities but they changed us to a room with a shower only when i compl
negative	ained .
negative	why have a part on the booking form for requests when there is no chance of getting what you request .
negative	also i would like to say that in my opinion alpharoom clients are given the inferior accomodation that hotels would not offer to guests paying the full price .
negative	always use gjw_titmuss for ordering our dog_food , never been a problem on line swift easy to use .
negative	efficient delivery .
negative	this evening , tried and tried , after 00_minutes have given up - very disappointed customer ( maybe soon to be ex - customer )
negative	bought wowcher deal , money came out twice and didnt receive voucher , although i contacted them before deal expired by the time it was established my card payment was authourised the deal was finished so here i am , no voucher for uk break and £_000 out of my credit_card .
negative	this was the first dealings i had with the company and will_definately be my last .
negative	very unapologetic e_- mail saying that the money would be refunded !
negative	terrible service .
negative	they simply didn_'_t deliver the flowers and blamed their courier .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews before using them .
negative	i brought some glasses from glasses_direct due to a web offer but am bitterly dissapointed by this company .
negative	they are much more_expensive than specsavers but offer no customer service , no personal fitting and the glasses took two_weeks to make - only after complaining_about where my glasses were did they agree to send them out .
negative	they would appear to offer no benefit over some of the high_street opticians and i would advise everyone to give they a wide_berth .
negative	i am extremely surprised how uncompetitive , lackadasical and pricy they are .
negative	serenata do great flowers in great arrangements .
negative	they use another company to deliver .
negative	my last two orders were delivered late , the second one being for my mother on mother '_s day .
negative	customer_services were again less_than helpful .
negative	they snootily pointed_out that the small_print says they can '_t guarantee delivery on the specified day .
negative	what '_s the point of sending special_occasion flowers if there '_s a 00 / 00 chance they won_'_t arrive .
negative	what '_s the point of using serenata ?
negative	none at all .
negative	no response when phoning to drop of car .
negative	no one there to meet us .
negative	had to make alternative_arrangements to park our car .
negative	have tried_phoning and emails but can '_t get a response .
negative	it '_s not so much the money , i just don_'_t want others to be caught_out and left in the lurch .
negative	you have been well warned as with other reviews ..
negative	theres no beginning to their talents - just years of endless errors - even sold my data - was fine when it was abbey - have now moved to another bank - poorly trained staff , even they themselves finally admitted they had expanded too quickly have messed_up big time - and its in every possible ... they even get a rare red flag - avoid !
negative	warning in which magazine - at_least its their corporate colour ...
negative	bought lava lamp - told at till v clearly - its ok to try it at home and no_probs to get a refund if i didnt like it - took it back 0 days_later after plugging it in just once - v rudely refused refund because " tried it " [ which meant i had " used it " ] - omg !!!
negative	!
negative	wonderful on initial sign up of contract very helpful .
negative	absolutely_shocking service thereafter !
negative	regularly cut_off mid sentence after a massive amount of waiting time to speak to an operator who usually passes you through to several other depts so make_sure you '_ve got lots of free time to speak to anyone at talk_talk !
negative	don_'_t expect to speak to a manager or anyone in authority it won_'_t happen !
negative	definitely don_'_t forget to pay your bill on time or they will cut your service off for a full 00hrs after you '_ve paid it !
negative	english_speaking operators would be nice as its very hard to understand what '_s being said !
negative	i was with talk_talk for over 0yrs for broadband / homeline / mobile and never notified i was clearly on the wrong plan for usage consequently paying over the odds !
negative	have switched provider altogether and much happier with my wonderful services and plan .
negative	i ordered flowers for my mothers 00th_birthday in australia .
negative	the picture looked lovely and i scaled up an extra £_00 for extra flowers rounding up to an arrangement for £_00 . 00 which included £ 0 . 00 delivery in australia .
negative	the flowers my mother received were definitely not worth the money i paid so i complained to iflorist who opened a ticket and advised they would check with the australian end for an explanation .
negative	a couple of weeks went by with no word back from iflorist so having got the phone number of the australian florist , i called them directly to find out their side of the story .
negative	they advised me they had not heard a word from iflorist and that the order they received was for $_00 aud which at the time and exchange_rate would have been £_00 ... meaning iflorist kept £_00 for themselves ... yes .. as good as half the amount i paid .
negative	i think this is disgusting and dishonest !!
negative	the australian florist advised out of the $_00 they received , they had to take out $_00 delivery , $ 0 for packaging , paper , ribbon etc and the 0 roses in the arrangement were $ 0 each plus a few carnations , 0 gerbras and a bit of greenery .
negative	the australian end are not at fault .
negative	it is greedy iflorist .
negative	they need to be exposed so that other consumers do not fall victim .
negative	i have sent iflorist a further 0 emails and tried_phoning but have had no response on any front .
negative	i am totally disappointed and will also report them to trading_standards as i feel its highway robbery !!
negative	buyers_beware !
negative	!
negative	i '_ll go straight to the point .
negative	tesco is phenomenally dreadful when it comes to displaying goods on offer .
negative	the amount of times i '_ve had to go back to customer_services to return or exhange items because the notices are not displayed with the appropriate products .
negative	is this a strategy to catch out customers who do not check their receipts ?
negative	don_'_t expect customers to read little labels to determine whether a product is on a particular offer or not .
negative	shelves should be stocked appropriately and should not be mixed up with different offers .
negative	this is one reason_why sometimes i go off shopping at tesco for a long time .
negative	i never seem to have that problem in asda or sainsbury '_s .
negative	why can '_t tesco be a bit more organized .
negative	not very helpful indeed when the shop is busy .
negative	and don_'_t blame customers for putting other items on the shelves - perhaps they give up because they could not understand what is actually on an offer !
negative	and by the way , sometimes these offers are not really good deals - so it is quite misleading !
negative	purchased a yoga retreat back in october , booked to go in march .
negative	turned_up at the venue to find it locked up and closed .
negative	contacted groupon to be informed that the company had gone bust the day before , mass email sent to all purchasers ( still to be received ) and telephone_call made to me ( an_absolute lie as no record of call being received or missed ).
negative	in fairness i did get the money credited back to my card however my friend and i wasted a day travelling to and from the venue ( so loss of earnings and petrol money ) and needed to find another activity to use with our holiday days .
negative	groupon could not help with this either so we had to find an_alternative which cost us lots more than our original trip .
negative	trying to get a response from customer service was impossible without having to shame them into it on facebook .
negative	would appear that if you post on their facebook_page you get shunted up the list of customers that need responding to .
negative	saying that , i sent a response to their e_- mail on 0 march and still not heard back .
negative	really can '_t see that i would buy from groupon again .
negative	i did buy something from wowcher recently and their customer service was excellent .
negative	problem_solved within 00_minutes of me raising it .
negative	groupon could do well to learn lessons from wowcher .
negative	i ordered a piece of software from proviation that was , and still is , advertised on their website as " in - stock " .
negative	my money was taken swiftly taken and then ....... nothing ................ until i added myself to a lengthy list of dissatisfied_customers on a forum that cannot be named ; and then made a " one - last - try " attempt to contact them via the live_chat on their website .
negative	now for the first time in over 0 weeks i have had a response !!!
negative	.
negative	my previous multiple emails , telephone inquiries and even live - chats have been completely_ignored , now i am assured that my goods have been dispatched ( to a " blank " post_code ) so only time will tell if the goods will turn_up .
negative	btw i did cancel my order and ask for a refund , but it appears that that request was ignored along with all the other queries .
negative	never again :-(
negative	it would appear that a refund is in process ( awaiting confirmation ) .
negative	a " reply " from the advertiser of the goods i wanted stated words to the effect that i was contacted and to confirm this , they also stated they were sending me a copy of the email that they claimed to have sent ; not a great surprise to note that nothing was received in either case .
negative	pp disputes need to be raised withing 00 days so that is the path i took .
negative	i would suggest that any would be purchaser does a thorough search around the internet and i would add further that they might inquire why so many reviews are taken down so quickly for spurious reasons .
negative	a company that seems to spend most of its time defending itself from negative_feedback has more problems that it cares to admit to in public .
negative	yesterday i used curry '_s / pc_world web_site to reserve a tom tom 00 sat_nav for collection from my nearest curry '_s outlet where it was shown as in stock .
negative	i duly received an_email with a collection reference_number to collect and pay for my item .
negative	on arrival at the store i was kept waiting 00_minutes whilst staff searched for my sat_nav only to be told eventually that they hadn_'_t got any after all !
negative	so valuable time and petrol wasted in a fruitless and frustrating episode .
negative	not to be deterred i checked online availability at another branch and again the item was in stock and it allowed me to reserve it for in - store collection .
negative	i duly received the confirmation order with my collection reference advising me to collect .
negative	this time as i was literally walking out of the front_door to collect the telephone rang and it was the branch saying don_'_t bother coming we haven_'_t got any !
negative	!
negative	what terrible service this represents - customers booking online for later collection must have an assurance that the goods actually exist .
negative	i shall not deal with curry '_s / pc_world again .
negative	got the same sat_nav same price free delivery off amazon , don_'_t waste your time i won_'_t again .
negative	background :
negative	0 windows incorrectly measured by surveyor ( one too big and one too small ).
negative	photographs were taken of the large gap .
negative	we stated we would withhold the cost of one window until rectified ( legal right ).
negative	this resulted_in threats by 0 of the directors of supaglazing , where they both stated they would remove all the newly fitted windows and threatened the 0 nice / competent fitters with the sack .
negative	0 other snagging problems have been fixed , but the tone of gary left on the phone at the “ eleventh hour ” was unacceptable ( recorded on answerphone ).
negative	supaglazing were emailed with a detailed list 0 weeks before he finally phoned us .
negative	further installation problems – still not fixed despite many email – we contacted cab and trading_standards who have documented details of the issues .
negative	internal plastic moldings are becoming loose on many windows on this installation .
negative	this as affected my decoration that will have to be done again . kitchen window left hand top hinge faulty ( gap of 0 . 0mm towards the top ).
negative	i hope this is not due to being measured incorrectly by the surveyor , that subsequently had to be cut down to fit the existing hole !!
negative	holes and uneven silicone application to bedroom 0 sill , needs to be removed and applied correctly .
negative	we still await the guarantee certificate and fensa documents for our the installation completed in august .
negative	i had to contact fensa myself , it was disclosed supaglazing had forgot to submit the request to fensa !
negative	!
negative	conclusion :
negative	we were going to have a conservatory made by supaglazing , thankfully we did not sign the dotted line .
negative	ordered a present 0 weeks before_xmas , pcw sent wrong item .
negative	had to wait for wrong item to be returned to pcw before they would despatch the correct item .
negative	still_waiting .
negative	communication a joke !
negative	!
negative	have cancelled order , never order again pcw
negative	the item was not delivered in the advertised time and i had all the usual problems with yodel .
negative	avoid .
negative	tried to buy a tv , recieved conformation of order and then nothing , no reply to emails and phone no is to an orange answer service to whitch no - one replies .
negative	after 00 days i have not got a single reply , all i want is to know_whats going on . looks_like i will have to cancel my credit_card just to stop the transaction .
negative	they may be cheap but its not worth the hassle .
negative	ordered an item , paid for it , waited for it to arrive , it didn_'_t .
negative	i had to contact them to find out where item was , they said item had been sold in store on saturday , i bought item on the previous friday .
negative	they were not in the slightest bit bothered , just said my money had been refunded , no apology , no alternative , no concern .
negative	good luck with treating future customers this way .
negative	we ordered from decuisine over a month_ago .
negative	when the goods were not delivered i googled & saw all the bad feedback .
negative	i phoned & was given a long plausible tale indicating delivery would be in a week .
negative	no delivery so we asked for a refund .
negative	no refund so i have my credit_card co chasing for the money back .
negative	don_'_t believe their tales .
negative	they are rogue_traders !
negative	buyer_beware .
negative	nb : i ' m a real_person , not as they will tell you some competitor trying to ruin their reputation .
negative	we enjoyed a family holiday in october in el gouna , approx .
negative	00km '_s north of hurghada on egypt '_s red sea .
negative	i had pre_- booked online via resorthoppa . com .
negative	the outward_journey was fine , apart_from being initially dropped at a hotel in hurghada instead of el gouna - i needed to call the number provided on our paperwork and ask them to send the driver back to pick us up !
negative	on our journey back to hurghada airport , the driver was clapping to his favourite song on the radio , taking his hands off the steering_wheel whilst driving , he also took us on a short - cut , which initially went across a bit of desert on - route to an unfinished stretch of road , he then decided to drive on the wrong side of the road ( dual carriageway ) against oncoming traffic for approx .
negative	0km '_s , he also drove over a couple of speed - bumps much too quickly , as a subsequence my wife banged her face ( had a nice bruised nose as a memento ), my son banged his head !
negative	i complained to resorthoppa '_s customer_services a couple of weeks ' ago , however , i am waiting for their response - i won_'_t hold my breath ..!
negative	i recieved some flowers today , from my daughter in canada they were not suppose to be sent until the 0th but came today on the 0th for mothers_day , i dread to think what they would be like then , i feel for my daughter who has paid to have these delivered to me for mothers_day , you could buy a better bunch at supermarket i am discusted to think they could send such a bunch and charge my daughter a lot of money .
negative	and have no phone number to contact them , please do not waste your money ordering from this firm until they can prove who they really are

negative	the companies who send parcels by this company should be_ashamed of themselves .... yodel is not fit for the purpose .... 0 cards were left and each time we went to their depot but was told we needed a tracking_number , but we didn_'_t have one so we couldn_'_t give one . on the 0th visit we were told it had been returned to sender .. the manager refused to talk to us ... the sender has not received it back even after 0 weeks and yodel does not know where the parcel is .. reading other reviews i can believe they still exist .... i would be_ashamed the even admit i worked for this company , thats if i did work for them but i dont .....
negative	ordered tickets in februaruy to see pink in hannover on the 0th_may .
negative	received an_email in german on friday 00th_april and couldn_'_t get to speak to anyone untill the monday when i was told that this email was telling_me that the seller couldn_'_t supply the tickets and that they were offering me tickets for the o0 - she asked me if this was acceptable at which point i made her aware that the o0 concerts had indeed already happened !
negative	i was then assured that they would try to get me replacement tickets for hannover , apologised for the email being sent in germand and assured me it would be resent in english and took my mobile number so that they could contact me as soon as they found replacement tickets to change delivery to the hotel in hannover as they would not get to the uk in time .
negative	come the end of wednesday 0nd may , i realised that these tickets were not happening and so i cancelled our travel from aberdeen , uk ( myself , my husband and our 00 year_old son ).
negative	then what happened - i got an_email on the thursday to say my tickets had been dispatched !
negative	no call , no way to change delivery and all travel and hotel already cancelled .
negative	on top of this , the tickets arrived - i had paid eu000 each and the face_value was eu00 . 00 - double the price - disgusting !
negative	and of course , we all lost out completely so i am eu000 out of pocket ( including viagogo '_s admin_fee ).
negative	i would never use viagogo again
negative	and you will note that 0 weeks on , they haven_'_t responded to explain themselves !
negative	it '_s now 00th_may and i posted this on the 0th .
negative	ref_: 0000000
negative	don_'_t have anything to do with this company at all .
negative	used a voucher to purchase a parka for my daughter on 00 november infortmed dfashion it was needed by 00 november , but still_haven_'_t received anything .
negative	have e_- mailed many_times but they do not respond , tried their phone number - message_saying voicemail full and you cannot leave a message .
negative	ordered with next_day delivery but a week on not arrived .
negative	no reply to email so rang them .
negative	some items out of stock so the whole order delayed !
negative	and it '_s not their policy to let you know - how helpful eh !
negative	disgusted , will be going back to my regular reliable internet supplier whose prices are the same or cheaper .
negative	i searched the internet and read some of the reviews and thought they are a good company to go with to sell my ipad they quoted me a good price , then i sent it via_royal_mail special delivery costing_£_00 i then received an_email_saying it had been requoted when i checked it was for half the amount of the original quote !!
negative	when i emailed them to question why they said there were scratches to screen and casing !!
negative	i know for sure that is lies because it has_been in a leather case since the day i bought it .
negative	i told them to return it then they said it would be returned in over two_weeks !!!
negative	why ??
negative	i sent numerous_emails and tried_ringing but to no_avail this went on for a few_days eventually i got an answer from someone i told them i wanted my ipad back immediately he tried to say it wouldn_'_t be returned yet but i kicked off told him it was my property and wanted it back he then turned around and said i would have it back by two days time ..
negative	i got it the next_day .
negative	it was missing the lead to charge it too so i rang about that and they said i couldn_'_t get my lead back but he would send a standard one mine was an extra long pink lead !!!
negative	all in all it was a bad_experience they are scammers , liars and thieves !!!
negative	do not use them !
negative	!
negative	we ordered some wallpaper on 00 / 00 / 00 , value £_000 . 00 .
negative	everything seemed to go through ok , including on screen provision of order acknowledgement and order number .
negative	however , the promised email_confirmation never arrived .
negative	there was a pending payment to homebase on my bank_account for this amount so i rang homebase to find out what is going on - turns_out they have no trace of my order !!
negative	it seems that they have had " website " problems and the person we spoke to was unable to resolve the pending payment issues and / or reorder for us leaving us to sort_out with our bank ourselves - just spent 00_minutes on the phone to barclays sorting_out - apparently this is a regular occurrence with homebase !
negative	very disappointed both that things went wrong and with the lack of customer_services appetite to resolve their end .

negative	watchfinder offered a watch for sale on their website .
negative	i clicked to buy and at the checkout applied the discount_code from the voucher they sent me and progressed sale in the normal way .
negative	the next_day they called me and said they didn_'_t feel they would make enough money on the sale of the watch and wanted me to pay more money then we had already agreed on or they would cancel the sale !
negative	!
negative	trading_standards complaint registered and after talking to them they felt that watchfinder were in breach of contract and should have honour the sale agreement .
negative	this isn_'_t my first purchase from watchfinder , the first didn_'_t go smoothly either , i won_'_t use them again , shortsighted approach by watchfinder as i generally spend more than £ 0000 on watches a year but none of it will be going to them after this .
negative	i '_ve emailed and requested callbacks and no response .
negative	possibly the worst customer service on the internet .
negative	i ' m having to resort to talking to my bank now to cancel payment .
negative	00 . 00 . 00 : i ' m still_waiting for a refund .
negative	someone did reply and told me a refund would be made and when i chased them four weeks_later he told me he could not tell me when a refund would be made .
negative	i have now sent a request into barclays to do a chargeback on the payment .
negative	i really can understand how a company like this can still be in business .
negative	i bought a new husqvarna cth000 ride on mower from abbey_garden sales at the end of june and had nothing but problems !
negative	the pre delivery inspection wasn_'_t done properly so it was delivered without an english_manual , 0 other handbooks in 00 languages , and i don_'_t speak any of them !
negative	i rang the abbey and they said they ' d put one in the post , they didn_'_t .
negative	0 weeks_later the deck belt broke , i rang again .
negative	they said it wasn_'_t covered_under the warranty so i had to fork out over £_00 for a new one , they posted it free with the manual .
negative	once i read the manual , i realised it should have come with a bioplug , for the cutting deck , also missed on the pdi .
negative	i rang them again , they eventually got back to me to say they ' d put one in the post .
negative	it arrived within a couple of days .
negative	i fitted the new belt this week and it was cutting fine , until one of the blades broke !
negative	looks_like a fatigue fracture .
negative	i wondered_if that was covered_under_warranty ?
negative	it was .
negative	0 weeks since the blade broke .
negative	i ' d chased it up but abbey just kept giving excuses .
negative	husqvarna told my supplier that it is covered_under_warranty but it still didn_'_t arrive !
negative	i usually rely_on this months holiday to get my garden and paddocks in order for the autumn , but as the mower has_been unusable for the whole of august , i had no chance of doing it .
negative	i bought this machine to solve my problems , not add to them .
negative	after waiting for 0 weeks i got fed_up with all abbeys excuses , got husqvarna involved and they sent me a new blade themselves and it arrived the next_day , as abbey still hadn_'_t sent one .
negative	abbey made no effort to contact me , i had to chase them for everything .
negative	poor customer service and they couldn_'_t even say sorry !
negative	trust_pilot has requested me to authenticate my review of house trip 0 times .
negative	each time i have furnished proof of purchase to trust_pilot and each time it has ignored the evidence i have supplied .
negative	trust_pilot is clearly not an independent organisation and appears to be paid to only accept positive_reviews of house trip .
negative	our review of house trip was not positive and it appears that trust_pilot does not want to publish our review because it is negative
negative	this is an update to my previous review please read that one .
negative	on the advice of trading_standards to try and resolve my problem as mentioned in my review basicly the pixels were missing on my galaxy_note 0 after 0 months and went to cw for repair under_warranty and came back with a crack in the screen which was not there when they took the phone from me ( they were responsible for the crack ) anyway on ts advice i wrote to the managing_director by recorded delivery that letter which was signed for by this company has_been totally_ignored , not ever the courtesy of a reply i have sent another letter by recorded delivery will see what happens now .. then i am afraid it off to court i have to say before i took the contract for the phone they were very helpful but once signed on the dotted line customer service just doesn_'_t exist with these so called professionals anyone_thinking_about using these_people read all the reviews on this site and all over the web first i wish i had .
negative	after all this i have just received an_email from this joke company bearing in mind they damaged my phone this is the response i got also the two letters mentioned were sent by recorded delivery to the managing_director not the sender of this email as he seems to think ... read this : and think before you fall for it .
negative	i regret that we will not be able to reach an amicable resolution to your complaint .
negative	i feel that we have reached a position of deadlock , as i am unable to overturn the decision made by our repairs centre .
negative	in terms of the two letters that you have advised you have sent to carphone_warehouse ; if these letters have been received in our central office , it is possible that they have not reached our department yet .
negative	please_accept our apologies if this is the case .
negative	i will arrange for a letter of final response and deadlock to be issued to your home address within 0 - 00 days .

negative	i made my first and last ever order with this online seller that is for sure .
negative	returned three of six items as poor quality , got an_email_confirming that they received the items ant that refund is just about to be done .
negative	since then i am chasing that lost refund as they have sent it back to an no_longer existing account .
negative	i am exchanging emails with " rachel " which is obviously not even reading the enquiries but answering with some standard email .
negative	first one , they '_ll get in touch asap , but they need to have a look at it first .
negative	second one is they have refunded me ( which i already had and answered to that one , that the money was sent to a wrong account ).
negative	i explained again and again that the money is coming_back and i would like to know what happens next .
negative	in one of her nonsense answers she was asking me to fill in the attached form ( which was not attached ) and send my postage proof even if she could see that she has already confirmed me they got the items back .
negative	i gave her 00_hours to get serious and give me some decent answer to my enquiry .
negative	she answered again with more or less standard answer and asked me to wait_till 00th ( like ten days !!!)
negative	and if i don_'_t get my refund till then ( how if the only option to send it to a non - existing account is this going to happen ???)
negative	to get in touch with her again .
negative	i am waiting now , this is quite frustrating as i know how this works as i do refunds myself for online customers and know that this kind of communication is simply unacceptable .
negative	decent produce and prices but they just can not deliver on time .
negative	last_week 00_mins late this week 0 hours late .
negative	customer_services are jammed and everyone blames someone_else .
negative	back to tesco for me - the quality may be lacking but at_least you get to eat !
negative	faulty device - wrote for advise - did not here a word - oh - device was for a friend .
negative	paid £_00 for a package to be delivered from gloucester to leeds saturday delivery - so urgent .
negative	no communication to me - package in hatfield delayed .
negative	recipient got through to a human after 0 attempts on an 0000 number to be told the vanhad broken down so it wasnt just us affected and it might arrive on monday .
negative	they boast they have 0000 vans .
negative	do yourself a favour - dont use - suggest we start compensation campaign < sensitive data_removed >
negative	i bought a voucher for carpet cleaning and have had to chace the firm constantly they have failed to turn_up with more excuses than i have had hot dinners .
negative	wowcher have not responded .
negative	the voucher is showing as reddemed so i presume the compnay are claimin he have done the job .
negative	the company are still selling vouchers
negative	ordered flowers 0 weeks in advance for my mother '_s birthday .
negative	not delivered on the day - i was not told there was a problem .
negative	looking further the flowers went to the courier the day before due delivery date and have no been transported around various couriers depots for the last three days !!!
negative	!
negative	i have tried contacting the prestige and delivery company ( yodel ), whilst to be fair i have had a reply ( albeit slow ) all they say is sorry , should be there soon .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable , has ruined my mum '_s birthday and i have had to order new flowers from elsewhere , as even if these ever turn_up they will be dead !
negative	flowers finally arrived 0 days_later , the roses were totally dead and the rest of the bunch had seen much_better days - my mum was so upset .
negative	i sent another email to the company who still refuse to give refund , only offering another bunch of flowers .
negative	why would we want another delayed and dead bunch of flowers ?
negative	never mind the fact i have already had to purchase another bunch from elsewhere .
negative	to top it all prestige lodged a claim on trust_pilot that my review was not accurate !
negative	a few emails soon sorted that - thanks trust_pilot !
negative	prestige have also stopped me posting on their face book page - i put nothing other than the truth , in a reasonable way !
negative	this company are relying on the perishable goods_act to get out of refunds and need to be stopped !
negative	i have also experienced really bad customer service from superfi .
negative	i bought a humax dtrt0000 / 0tb via another on - line retailer , thought it was so good i wanted another , they were out of stock , so i searched the web & found " superfi ", never_heard of them before but they had listed what i wanted .
negative	so i clicked , added to basket , checked out , paid via_paypal - job_done with free next_day delivery , happy days !
negative	instant response from paypal stating the money had left my account .
negative	i refreshed my emails , clicked send / receive several_times ... nothing from superfi , ok , bit worrying , but ok .
negative	the nextday , the delivery day , i still hadnt received any email or any response from superfi , so i called them .
negative	first i tried their 0000 number ( fabulous a company with a free phone number ).
negative	recorded_message stated there was no one available to take my call & duly cut me off .
negative	that was option 0 on their list , so thought i ' d try option 0 their sales line ...... nope , silly me , after trying several_times on every available option & constantly getting cut_off ... i slowly started to panic , i ' d paid this company i '_ve never_heard of before a few hundred_quid of my hard_earned cash & now i could find anyone who cared enough to answer the telephone .
negative	i telephoned their nottingham store to ask if they were still in business , apparently they were , and the very helpful chap gave me another number to call , not all bad ... could have just been me !
negative	i called the other number .
negative	the chap stated no i wouldnt have received any emails the item is out of stock , apparently i should have checked their stock_levels before placing the order ... strange !
negative	i placed the order , they took my money , the deal was that they would deliver the next_day for free .... its the next_day & they ' re telling_me its not going to be delivered .
negative	i asked to speak to his supervisor & was told " oh he '_ll only tell you ...." thanks but i '_ll have a chat with him anyway if thats ok with you .
negative	i did & was told that as i ' d paid them via_paypal and the item was out of stock , they ' d email me when it was in stock & notify me of the delivery day then .
negative	he couldnt understand_why i was getting annoyed .
negative	explain please why i '_ve placed my order , paid my hard_earned & you '_ve not even sent me an acknowledgment email as a courtessay ?
negative	explain_why your system took the order & didnt tell me that you were out of stock ?
negative	explain_why i should check your stock_levels ?
negative	explain what your company pays you for ... what exactly do you do ?
negative	customer service manager is poorly trained & dosent understand customer service , offered to pop round with a customer return product to replace the one i ' d ordered and refund £ 0 ..... nah , thanks , but ... i ordered new & kind of thats what i ' d like .
negative	i '_ll wait the week for you to get it back into stock , and spend the day i wrote off to wait in for the delivery publishing my experience with your company on - line , if thats ok with you ?
negative	after all , you '_ve got my money , you agreed to supply a product via next_day delivery and have entered_into a contract as such , and you ' re now in breach of contract .
negative	would i spend anymore money with this company , no thanks .
negative	customer service just isnt there in relation to their on - line sales , retail sales staff are of course a different breed and do actually give a damn , which is unfortunate as sorry guys , but its now a company thing for me , i '_ll avoid you all .
negative	sorry .
negative	update in response to superfi '_s response :-
negative	really amusing that of course its the customers fault as he " didnt see " hidden away information relating to the companies stock_levels , nothing what so ever to do with my " order was accepted on a next_day delivery basis " & that no attention was drawn to the fact that the item was out of stock .
negative	my order was accepted & payment made on the basis of next_day delivery , therefore a contract is in place & the company is required to deliver in line with that which was agreed , the company failed to do so and is therefore in clear breach of contract , and in my view should have made amends swiftly & openly .
negative	i '_ve repeatedly stated that i received no correspondance what so ever in relation to my initial order , strangely , in english , this means that i received no correspondance what so ever from superfi in relation to my initial order , what part of that superfi dont get is beyond me .
negative	it '_s quite wrong for people to assume things , causes all_sorts of problems .
negative	this is further highlighted by the fact that the customer service manager aledgedly repeated all of the steps i made to test out the system and also received no emails - my experience in relation to this is that i received no emails from superfi at all in relation to this initial purchase , which means nothing went to my spam folder either - i received no emails in relation to my initial order .
negative	your reference to " we believe you normally work from home ?
negative	", yet another assumption that is incorrect , i run a very successful company thats built up a reputation based on 000_% customer_satisfaction , not that its any of your business or that you would know anything about that .
negative	glad that you '_ve confirmed that for the second_hand unit that you offered me you offered a £ 0 discount .
negative	i ordered a new product , i paid for a new product , i expected a new product .
negative	do you really think i ' d accept less_than a 0 . 0 %_discount to take a second_hand unit ?
negative	who would ?
negative	however , had you applied the same percentage discount as you claim was applied to the original rrp of the product to the 0nd_hand unit then that would have been a far more reasonable approach and one possibly worth considering .
negative	there was no offer of a loan product , there was an attempt to talk me into taking the 0nd_hand unit & returning it under the " distance_selling rules " if i wasnt happy later .
negative	but certainly no offer of " here take this one until yours arrives & we '_ll pick ours up later " as implied .
negative	you dont get a second chance to make a first impression , i wont be shopping with superfi again .
negative	as audio visual is part of what my company does i ' d say superfi have lost out .
negative	whilst writing this update i have recieved an_email from superfi stating that my order has joined the que for picking , the first email in relation to this purchase & have a guess_what .... it didnt go into my spam folder either !!
negative	lets_hope that the product is in good order when it arrives , if not we '_ll end up in the court arena to resolve matters as i ' m fed_up with such bad customer service & a clear breach of contract .
negative	customers dont have to put up with bad service , and i wont put up with it .
negative	i should state in fairness that the service that i received from the retail side of this company in specfic relation to this situation and their attempts to try & resolve matters , was entirely decent & genuine , a shame this cant be reflected to the web side of this company .
negative	bought 0 strip lights via_ebay , the photo showed 0 tubes inside the lights , the description referred to " tubes " plural , therefore its acceptable and perfectly reasonable for me to rely_on the phot & description - which i duly did .
negative	i received 0x strip lights with only one light in each one , not what was ordered .
negative	i telephoned the company to let them know of their mistake , only to be very rudely told to " get a life , go to b_& q and buy another light " and was then told to " go forth & multiply " ( only not quite so politely ) and the phone was put down on me !
negative	how rude ?
negative	what level of customer service could this be possibly described as ?
negative	the matter has_been reported to ebay who are passing the matter onto their security team and also to derbyshire trading_standards .
negative	would i buy from or recommend this company to anyone_else , not a chance !
negative	follow_up : following factual feedback left for this company on the website on which it trades i have received several abusive emails .
negative	perhaps the owner of the company has never_heard of the offence of " sending a malicious communication ".
negative	i '_ve then received an_email_telling_me i need to amend this review , clearly a complaint was received pointing at a minor technicality ( the owners language directed at me and duly accurately reported on here ).
negative	whilst the owner of the company appears quite ready to spout abuse at people , he clearly doesnt like it when people report the facts of the matter for all to see , accurately & truthfully .
negative	maybe he wont be quite so quick in future to treat people in the manner in which he treated me , but then maybe i '_ll win the lottery this week !
negative	further follow_up : the owner of the company continues to object to factual feedback left for his company .
negative	i have therefore made my own objections to the manner in which this chap continues to have the factual feedback left by many about his company removed for no reason .
negative	kingston 00gb class 00 microsdhc card £_00 . 00 delivered , i bought two for £_00 . 00 delivered , checked out via_paypal & the amount changed from £_00 . 00 to £_00 . 00 .
negative	cost me £ 0 + to phone them to cancel the order - disgraceful service from a uk company , will never be buying from them again .
negative	customer service very slow too .
negative	only_downside of primark if you want to take anything back you go to customer_services with two people on , queue for ages as everyone takes one item back and pays for two basket fulls while they are there , i recommend that the refunds counter is for refunds only ... as i wasted all my lunch hour queing to just get a refund very frustrated , or even more people on to deal with just refunds .........
negative	b . t .
negative	for far too long have got away with ' blue - murder ' an out dated , over priced broadband service that is a disgrace for a once leader in communications .
negative	i f you do not live in the london area do not expect good service from this awfull company .
negative	the quality of service virgin gives leaves an awful_lot to be desired , to date i have attempted to set_up a direct_debit with them five times to no_avail , the ' cannot care - less atitude ' is awful for such a big company ... shame on you branson
negative	most products have little or no details regarding sale item , site security crazy .
negative	initially this company seemed perfectly businesslike and professional prior to taking my payment .
negative	once you '_ve paid (£_000 in my case ) then forget about contacting ' thelittlehousecompany '.
negative	the ' hotline ' as advertised goes straight to voicemail always .
negative	you are told " one of our operatives will return your call asap ."
negative	i don_'_t believe there are any operatives other than the owner operator .
negative	no point in leaving any messages as they do not believe in customer service once payment has_gone thru '.
negative	even the ' contact us ' link on their website does not work !
negative	not one single enquiry in 0 weeks .
negative	the provided floor plan is incomplete .
negative	the website is confusing and difficult to navigate .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i ordered a completely standard pair of glasses on 00th .
negative	september with a website promise of 0 days delivery .
negative	here i am practically a month later and am still_waiting !
negative	!
negative	i put in a support request for ' where is my order ' and three days_later was advised ,
negative	" please_accept our apologies for the delay of your spectacles , there has_been a delay of the lenses for your spectacles .
negative	we assume your glasses should be with you till the end of next week ."
negative	apart_from making very little sense i ' assume ' my glasses will not be delivered until the 00th .
negative	october , fully five weeks after they were ordered .
negative	five weeks_ago they banked my money and i '_ve received nothing .
negative	well , my friend , what do you think of it so far ?
negative	rubbish
negative	decided to place an order for a water rowing machine costing_£_000 as it looked cheap .
negative	finally received the product yesterday , not only with packaging in poor condition but also with half the rower missing .
negative	the guy who delivered it said there was definately only one box ( paperwork said box 0 of 0 ), and duly dumped the product on the drive and cleared off .
negative	i then had the nightmare experience of actually trying to speak to someone at amazon , is anyone actually employed on customer service , no human voice can be found ?
negative	gave up in the end , and returned to the amazon website to try and arrange a collection and refund , a much_easier process than trying to find someone to talk to , but again no option shown for a part delivered product .
negative	amazingly , on requesting a refund last_night , my wife gets a call today from amazon , confirming they have located our missing box ( after saying there was only one box ) and would arrange a second delivery ( another day of work for my wife ).
negative	stay well clear of this outfit , bad delivery company , poor packaging , non_existent customer service , no compensation offered to us for having to take a further day off work .
negative	they may look cheap , but when you factor in the cost of their awful customer service , you will regret you didnt go_elsewhere .
negative	i ordered a camera lens off them over £ 0000 worth .
negative	their website said it was in stock .
negative	they say it will be shipped in 0 - 0 days but could take 0 - 00 days .
negative	they took the money out of my account right away , the lens was not in stock or it would have been sent out to me .
negative	i inform my credit_card company who said cancel the order .
negative	it took seven emails to get a response and then it was because i started to get really nasty with them .
negative	a waste of time ringing them as it '_s easier to get hold of elvis .
negative	they are then contacting me asking to lt them fulfill the order ; have it by the end of the week etc .
negative	remember the website said it was in stock .
negative	i said no refund me .
negative	although in my account status it says refund in progress three days_later still no money transferred back into my account .
negative	do not think about ordering anything off this totally_useless oufit .
negative	i orderes two items from here both sent out between the 00th of feb and the 0 march still havnt received any opened a dispute with paypal , god know how long it will take to get my money back thats if i do , all there saying is were looking in to it , what ever you do dont buy from here
negative	first they fail to deliver , but pretend they did .
negative	we were in at the time they claim they delivered , and not even a " you were out " card left .
negative	so i track it down , and request delivery 0 days_later knowing i '_ll be away for 0 days - and they just dump it on the doorstep while we ' re away !
negative	i raise a complaint , and they respond with an_automated email_saying that as they '_ve now resolved it and talked to me the case is closed - but they haven_'_t contacted me at all !!!
negative	this is just staggeringly bad and i wish amazon would stop using them .
negative	why pay for prime if the courier is rubbish !!?
negative	?
negative	bought a bed from one of the companies they '_ve got on their website , comfy living .
negative	it broke within 0 weeks - complained through amazon , which took me a few_days how to work it all out as so complicated and got the response from the company after they took 0 days to reply - that as i ' d had bed for 00 days i wasn_'_t entitled to a refund !
negative	am still battling with this rotten company - do not buy anything from comfy living - who are a disgrace .
negative	amazon say they can '_t help , even_though when i put a claim in i had a phone_call from them stating that they were going to refund me ?!
negative	i will never buy through them again .
negative	this company are the worst ever - do not go with them .
negative	i had non stop problems with their internet which their staff are unable to sort_out - they are frequently very rude and / or cannot speak_english properly , so you have a lot of trouble trying to understand what they are saying .
negative	when we tried to leave they wouldn_'_t transfer our account to the new company we chose .
negative	in the end i got so fed_up with receiving umpteen calls from their staff asking if i ' d like to renew my contract , that i cancelled my direct_debit in the hope that this would tell them that i was leaving - they cancelled our phone line the next_day and left us with no line , not to even call emergency services - which i thought was illegal .
negative	it took us 0 months to get our phone line reconnected due to the way in which talktalk had cut us off - as if we hadn_'_t paid , which we had - we were up to date with payments .
negative	they continued to charge us for the next 0 months also !
negative	this only got refunded when i took my complaint to ofcom - but talktalk sent them copies of letters they ' d " sent " me - they hadn_'_t ?!
negative	so i ' m still trying to get compensation for everything they did wrong to me & for costs incurred as a result of being suddenly cut_off without_any warning !
negative	do not go with this company ever
negative	rubbish - every time i see yodel are delivering i cringe
negative	ordered 0 toilets , at £_00 charge , was given 0 hour delivery slot , delivery came 0 hours earlier , house was not occuppied plus i took time off work , was told delivery time is an estimate , so why give one at all !!!
negative	one toilet was not suitable , vp wanted £_00 for return cost ,( wasnt told at time of order , just told i could return ) i got my own courier in the end , cost me £ 0 !!
negative	not happy , wont use again .
negative	i had an extremely distasteful first - time experience with viagogo when buying e_- tickets for a concert .
negative	despite choosing e_- tickets and paying , the e_- tickets were not available .
negative	this was not clearly_stated before the transaction .
negative	their client service refused to cancel the transaction .
negative	i was told to resell the e_- tickets , even_though i had not received them .
negative	with " small fees '" of course .
negative	this is a sham .
negative	fees paid to viagogo for buying and reselling e_- tickets without received the tickets at all !
negative	this is misleading , unclear , a rip - off and completely customer - unfriendly .
negative	nice way to treat a first - time customer ... which speaks_volumes .
negative	vianogo .
negative	i spoke to american express who told me to beware and to rely only on reputable establishments such as fnac .
negative	isold tkts for a concert which took place on 00th_sept and im still_waiting for my money .
negative	the tkts were delivered on time , so why have i been waiting for 00days now to be paid ?
negative	not easy to contact them , and no answer from email address .
negative	help !
negative	i ordered a wreath for my aunties funeral it was meant to be bright vibrant colours of pink , purple and lime green but when they sent it the wreath was yellow and nothing like the colour or description or one i had purchased ( see photos ).
negative	i complained to them online as they conveniently have no telephone_number available to contact them with .
negative	they at first ignored my complaint and after several e_- mails and me stating that if they didn_'_t reply i was informing trading_standards they sent a very short terse e_- mail informing_me as far as they were concerned there was nothing wrong with my order but if i e_- mailed them the details ( which i already had done then ) they would look into it , so i sent the details again which they didn_'_t reply to so i have now have reported them to trading_standards and i have written to iflorist as instructed by trading_standards stating my complaint and asking for a full_refund but i am still_waiting for a reply but i don_'_t hold out much hope as they seem to have little in the way of customer service skills and their communication with customers is very unsatisfactory and not consumer friendly at all .
negative	it almost seems like they hope if they ignore customers or make it difficult to contact them that anyone who complains will give up and put it down to experience , but i am not willing to do this on principle so i will keep contacting them until i get a satisfactory reply .
negative	i had two upvc doors installed in january .
negative	looked for ggf endorsement and expected quality work .
negative	so many faults it was unbelievable .
negative	ok , the repairs have been dealt_with now , but should never have happened in the first place .
negative	and when i contacted ggf '_s compliance manager i was told there was nothing they could do .
negative	i bought an ipad 0 on simply_electronics website on 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances i had to cancel the order on 00 / 0 / 00 , but was told the item hadn_'_t been shipped so all was ok .
negative	i was assured the refund would be made in 0 / 0 working_days .
negative	when that didn_'_t happen , i emailed again , and this time the refund time went up to 00 working_days .
negative	still no refund , but everytime i email i ' m told ' few more days '.
negative	this mornings email stated " our accounting department is very much aware of your case and they are on their best effort completing each and every refund case as fast as they possibly can .
negative	with this said , please immediately contact us again using this email thread in any case no refund confirmation will be received after few more working_days .
negative	onceagaion , we would like to seek your extended patience on this matter as we look_forward having your case resolved ."
negative	i have contacted barclays whose card i used to make the purchase , and they are taking over my case .
negative	they have assured me i will get my money and they will get it back fro se .
negative	be warned before you buy from this company .
negative	i can now add to the review .
negative	at last i have got my refund of over £_000 , but it '_s taken almost a month .
negative	all i got was emails saying a few more days , another few_days .
negative	eventually i replied to one email_stating that i was handing everything over to barclays to recover my money .
negative	would you believe it , two days_later i got an_email_saying that the money was no_longer in their account , but depending on how long barclays took to process the payment , was how long before i would see it on my statement .
negative	don_'_t get caught by this company - read all the other reviews - nearly all say similar things , either item not delivered , or no refund received .
negative	never again , and i ' m going to advertise the problem i had to make_sure as many people as possible are aware of the way this company goes about their business .
negative	can i recommend bullguard online backup as a service then the answer has to be " no ".
negative	as a customer for some years and using the service to protect the data for a small company ( 0 pcs ) we need a service we can rely_on .
negative	bullguard have decided to upgrade the service during oct ' 00 without_any warning to customers or any information on their service status page .
negative	the result is constantly failing backups and a service that i cannot rely_on or trust and one that i have to supplement with local manual backups .
negative	they have now told me that this situation could last 00 days - a service that i am paying for which is not delivering and cannot be trusted to backup our latest data .
negative	worst of all is the lack of communication before they went_ahead and put customers data at risk .
negative	poor show bullguard - am_currently reviewing alternatives with a better service policy and will not be renewing .
negative	and they took 0 months to reply to this !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i was contacted by optical_express by phone many_times telling_me that there is a surgical procedure to cure my vision .
negative	i kept asking them if they are certain of that as i only have glasses for reading .
negative	anyway they assured me that there was and an_appointment was made in november_0000 with their consultant .
negative	i drove from long eaton to optical_express shop in derby and after five_minutes of filling forms they told that there is no sugical procedures to correct my vision but i obviously need glasses ( how sly are these_people ).
negative	i had my eyes_tested and i kept telling them that i drive over 00_hours daily for living and it is very important that i have full field of vision .
negative	they sold two_pairs of vary focal glasses to me and i paid them £_000 . 00 .
negative	after two_weeks they arrived and i put them on , they seems alright .
negative	as i drove home i realised that i had focused vision only in front of me and simple task of negotiating round abouts and looking in the side mirrors with blurred vision was impossible and i had to turn my head round so much that my neck started hurting me .
negative	the next_day i put them on and within two hours i began to have headache .
negative	so i took them off .
negative	this went on for a week when i took them back and took the manager of the shop that i would like a refund .
negative	he told me that i should contact their head_office and arrange for a refund .
negative	i did that and i was contacted by the manager of derby optical_express to go down and have my eyes_tested to find out why i get headache .
negative	at the test they readjusted the frame and i was told to wear them for two_weeks and then go back .
negative	i had two_weeks of headaches and went to my appointment .
negative	i asked for a refund and this time they took the glasses of me and told me that the refund will be in my credit account by 00 days .
negative	i travelled overseas and returned in late march when i realised that no refund was paid into my credit account .
negative	i rang the manager of derby optical_express and told him that i would go to the shop so that he can arrange for the refund , he told me that if i go to the shop he will throw me out of the shop .
negative	so i went to the shop on 0nd_april_0000 and asked for my refund , he called westfield security and had me removed from the shop .
negative	i called 000 and asked for police .
negative	two police officers arrived while westfield security was standing around me .
negative	the police officers managed to convince the manager to pay the refund .
negative	i went back with the police officers and a refund was paid to my credit account .
negative	why not do this in the first time some three month_ago .
negative	i went home and checked my statements and realised that they have not refunded me the full_amount .
negative	so i am trying to contact the police officers to accompany me back to the shop to find out why !!!!!
negative	the lesson for anybody reading this is do not go to optical_express even if you have to use their toilets .
negative	i bought 0 vouchers on line on 00th_april for a cooking experience and dinner at shanghai blues .
negative	the vouchers never_materialised - nothing , nada , zilch .
negative	however , the money was debited from my credit_card the same day .
negative	i have phoned and e_- mailed and been told that someone will get back to me .
negative	a week_later i am still_waiting and i am not a happy customer .
negative	0 days on and still no explanation .
negative	i have given them 0 days after that i will go to the small_claims court .
negative	from start to finish duel were a nightmare .
negative	they underestimated the length of the job by 0 days ( a 0 day job in total ) because they ( in their own words ) " underestimated how long the paint would take to dry ".
negative	in addition , they left my house unlocked , doors open and insecure twice .
negative	guaranteed my spare room would be ready for overseas visitors - i came home from work that night to find it looking like a bomb had exploded .
negative	i paid £_000 to put my visitors in hotel for the weekend - not even an_apology from duel .
negative	i wouldn_'_t wish the stress and incompetence ( let_alone shoddy workmanship ) on my worst_enemy
negative	my wife and i ordered a range_cooker and a dishwasher from an online company ( not curry '_s ) and we were informed knowhow were going to deliver it .
negative	they supplied us with text_messages to say they would be delivering it but no reference_number should we need it .
negative	we had a text on the day of delivery to say it would arrive but no time .
negative	i took the opportunity to disconnect our old cooker and stick it in the garden .
negative	at 0pm we were called but missed it .
negative	an answerphone message said the delivery could not come today as they were having trouble with their trailers and we should call them back on the number supplied .
negative	easier said than done .
negative	the usual loads of options followed_by endless minutes of waiting .
negative	the person who answered could not help us because we did not have a reference_number and they said they would get the person who left the message to call us .
negative	she did not .
negative	we had to call her and again had to endure the wait .
negative	we were told that the delivery would be rescheduled for the next_day .
negative	no real apology or regret was conveyed to us .
negative	i was fuming and asked what sort of compensation we could expect because we had nothing to cook on and also had a lodger who would not be able to prepare meals either .
negative	i asked for £_00 which i thought a reasonable and not extortionate amount .
negative	i was told £_00 was all they could go to .
negative	pathetic response from a pathetic company
negative	i hired a car through their website called carhire0000 .
negative	the car_hire company hertz would not let me have the car as they claimed i was not on the electoral role .
negative	i am and i voted in may .
negative	however this is not the problem .
negative	the problem is that the traveljigsaw website carhire0000 will not refund me .
negative	i had no service from them .
negative	it has_been a month and they still have my money .
negative	the website did not tell me a credit_card would be required .
negative	after paying and completing my booking ( by debit_card ) i was told a credit_card would be required .
negative	i rang up and had this confirmed by a member of staff .
negative	since i do not have a credit_card i asked to cancel the booking and have a refund .
negative	i was told i was not allowed a refund .
negative	i had to work had to persuade the staff_member to let me speak to a manager .
negative	he said someone would call me back .
negative	they did not .
negative	i rang up again an_hour later and spoke to a different member of staff .
negative	this time i was told i would not need a credit_card too pick_up the car .
negative	i went_ahead with the booking .
negative	however , on picking_up the car from hertz i was told i was not on the electoral role so could not take the car .
negative	i voted in may 0000 and am on the electoral role .
negative	i rang up hertz for a refund but they cannot help .
negative	i was charged by carhire0000 on 00th_november and have yet to receive a refund .
negative	make_sure you are on the electoral register if you plan on hiring a car .
negative	they don_'_t tell you this is a requirement before collection .
negative	no refund yet .
negative	total timewasters .
negative	they lure you in with a low price then make you view add on after add on until the price is 00 times what you expect .
negative	don_'_t bother with them .
negative	having ordered a watch , i was told that it would be delivered within 0 - 00 working_days .
negative	following non - delivery , it took three attempts to get to speak to the salesman and to understand that delivery would be another 0 - 0 weeks .
negative	meanwhile , they had moved speedily to take the money out of my account .
negative	having finally spoken to the salesman who seemed quite blasé about the fact that he had failed to communicate the delay to me he then , initially , refused to hold the watch unless he held on to my money in full as this was their " policy ".
negative	on further discussion , he then offered to take a deposit of 00 %, it seems that this was the new policy that he had made up on the spot .
negative	i suggested that given the delay it was not reasonable for the company to hold on to such as substantial sum of money and that i was prepared to offer a deposit of 00 %.
negative	he refused the offer ( may be he had used up his policy making quota for the day !
negative	), which i found to be quite unreasonable given the lead up to these events .
negative	needless to say i asked for my money back and will never deal with this company again .
negative	in my dealing , it felt to me that the company was simply interested in getting hold of my money as quickly as possible , but unwilling to provide the customer service that is inherently required in dealing_with an internet retailer .
negative	ordered last_week and paid extra for 0 day delivery .
negative	we are now 0 days on and items still not arrived .
negative	customer service line has now been engaged for over 0 hour as my auto dial service redials every 0 mins .
negative	the ' on - line tracking ' doesn_'_t even give any clues .
negative	discusting service .
negative	on calling and discussing with paypal they adised me they had recieved numerous_calls regarding escapade today !
negative	!
negative	customer service is is a misnomer , no interest in service or facts .

negative	i have been with orange for a few_years now and i have only stayed with them because of the orange wednesdays but even that has lost its appeal .
negative	i find i have a lot of connection issues , it is always dropping the internet , and today when i was trying to get hold of my daughters school i couldnt get a signal , to be honest im sick of getting the sign which means no signal !.
negative	i am done with this company but unfortunately i still have over a year to put up with it
negative	was charged over double what the tickets actually cost ,
negative	disgusted !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered them months in advance too ...
negative	i know tickets can cost a lot if trying to get them at the last_minute , but surely not months before , i was so shocked that i had been charged sooo much extra , yes i knew i would be charged a bit , but more than double , viagogo is on a real good thing ,
negative	i will never use this company again , stay_away !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	please beware
negative	advertised as uk registered company by actually conducts business out of hong_kong .
negative	my order placed 0th_december still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	i emailed the company several_times and they just don_'_t respond .
negative	currently £_000 out of pocket .
negative	they do not ship , they stall , they keep emailing dispatch notes but no goods arrive .
negative	i do not believe there is an office at the published address i think calls are handled at a home
negative	this site attacts visitors because of its low_prices , it passes you through to amazon and earns affliate commissions on anything you subsequesntly buy - on amazon_marketplace .
negative	delivered late - on valentine '_s day .
negative	never answered the phone to respond to query .
negative	never responded to e_- mail for 0 - 0 days , and even then never understaood the issue of delivering so late in the day .
negative	i have been trying to get a refund on the 00 day terms of refund . customer service is hopless . and unhelpfullhave been misinformed about returning item to store . for refund . not straight_forward as led to belive wasted hours going back to store to get this refund , still trying
negative	i ordered a divan bed and was told it would be delivered on wednesday .
negative	well that was half true the base arrived but no mattress .
negative	i was told by the delivery guy that it had not been there when he set off but one of the vans had broken down so it would probably arrive early evening .
negative	so i sat in all day and waited but no mattress , no call from the company - nothing .
negative	next_day i contacted world_stores and received a call back late_afternoon asking if my mattress had arrived .
negative	when i said no was advised that ws would contact the delivery company .
negative	strange way to operate !!
negative	by friday_lunchtime i still had heard_nothing so i contacted the delivery company myself and was told i would have the mattress that afternoon and if i called back after two i would be given an exact time for delivery .
negative	( in the words of the meerkats simples !)
negative	what is the point of dedicated delivery days if you cannot keep the customer up to date .
negative	the mattress when it did arrive was marked at one corner however having_read the problems other have had with returning items i will live with it .
negative	i would certainly not recommend this company for service , quality or customer_care .
negative	a place where the malicious can do serious damage to people '_s businesses without either proving who they are , what their motive is etc .
negative	the sooner this is cleared off the world wide web and people start honestly using reputable sites like trustpilot the better .
negative	pissedconsumer . com is on a par with some seedy sex sites , or other such highly obnoxious internet experiences .
negative	where '_s trading_standards when you need them - this company needs removing from the internet so no one can place any further orders with them as they are clearly not honouring them but pocketing the cash .
negative	i am in dispute with them via barclaycard for £_000 where they took my money when the goods were discontinued and have not refunded after multiple attempts / methods of engagement .
negative	does anyone know the owner '_s details to bombard him with complaints ?
negative	i have sent over 0 emails regarding my bills and yet to have my billing rectified .
negative	0nd february_0000 and no bills provided since october_0000 a total_lack of support and no way to run a company , i have tried everything to sort this issue but no help from the company .
negative	now seeking_legal_advice totally fed_up
negative	am an <_external link_removed > customer of many_years .
negative	lost times now of the amount of collections yodel fail to collect .
negative	in fact they have failed to collect every one , thats around 0 , these last few_months .
negative	always ends up with <_external link_removed > taking over .
negative	not only that but why dont yodel reply to your complaint emails either ?
negative	never known a company so bad , and look at the amount of neg reviews !
negative	there is a distinct theme on this thread which csl are clearly not addressing and which , sadly , is letting them down big time .
negative	the sales staff and buying experience in the store are very good .
negative	there is a wide_range of choice and the furniture is comparatively good value for money .... when it arrives in perfect_condition .
negative	where this company is seriously , and i mean seriously , falling over is in its abysmal customer after_sales service .
negative	particularly when the goods are not perfect through no fault of the customer .
negative	even the manager of the store where we bought our sofa ( who we had to visit after our frustrations in getting through to customer service on the phone ) admitted that he is frustrated that the quality of after_sales customer service does not back up the front line sales staff .
negative	we ordered our sofas in march_0000 , we got them in early july .
negative	as i sit here on the last day of september waiting for a technician to deign to turn_up ... again , we still don_'_t have our ' perfect sofa '.
negative	the technical call_centre have all the chat but , they just don_'_t have the service quality to back it up .
negative	the most basic customer_care is completely lacking ... endless hours listening on the phone to how important our call is but still not bothering to answer it , failure to call back when they say they will , failure to do what they say they will when they do turn_up , failure to give reasonable time slots for deliveries and technical work ( t ' aint rocket_science that customers have to work to pay for this stuff !!
negative	), blase scripted responses to enquiries , complete disregard for the cost to the customer of phone_calls and time off work , and complete_lack of anyone with balls making interventions to put right what they have done wrong .
negative	i get it completely csl ...... we have landed in ' we '_ve got your money so you ' re stuffed ' ville .
negative	i haven_'_t detailed all our issues on here because it '_s just more of the same as in previous posts .
negative	would i recommend csl to anyone_else ...... no .
negative	would i buy from them again ....... no .
negative	with all this in mind , if you do still decide to go_ahead and buy , then my only advice is this - make the delivery staff wait_until you have checked every inch of your sofa / s , sit on all the seats , work all the mechanisms , check all the fabric / leather , they won_'_t like it but do not be hurried .
negative	if you find anything wrong , no matter how small , no matter what the delivery_men advise ..... refuse to accept delivery and make them take the whole lot back .
negative	if you don_'_t , be warned , you are heading for a nightmare and there will be lots that comes between you ( your_sanity ) and your ' perfect sofa '
negative	i had ordered a new galaxy_s0 three days ago , no phone as yet , i have e_mailed them on 0 occasions no reply , i tried_phoning the 0000 number , on hold for 00_minutes no reply .
negative	i went through nectar for the extra points .
negative	do not use this company .

negative	never win on this site .
negative	somebody ........ or the boss at ladbrokes ........ is a wealthy person , i never met a winner ........ ever
negative	packed in and forgotten about .
negative	no stars , can '_t go into negatives but i would if i could .
negative	the most biased propaganda machine ever , like a chinese water torture the bbc '_s drip drip is fed to the poor audience , who '_s propaganda is it ?
negative	i can '_t bear to listen to the incomplete information that constantly pours from this iniquitous company , they have taken trust that was built up over many_years and have totally abused it .
negative	i would dearly like to know the real motives .
negative	don_'_t believe anything that the bbc puts out , not even the weather report .
negative	listen to as many other news sources that you can and try to redress the totally biased bbc output form your_own ideas !.
negative	that one star is only there because the trustpilot will not accept no stars .
negative	i wish i had read some of these reviews before i ordered my bookcase .
negative	it arrived damaged .
negative	when i spoke to someone to arrange a replacement , i asked whether it would be delivered when the old one was picked_up .
negative	the woman just laughed at me .
negative	" oh no .
negative	we '_ll need to see the damage before we make a decision ".
negative	i am still_waiting for something , anything , to happen .
negative	i '_ve emailed twice and had no reply .
negative	no refund and no replacement .
negative	asda should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves with this service - it '_s appalling .
negative	i bought a number of groupon vouchers in the lead - up to my holiday , most of which are " pampering " things .
negative	i have just tried to redeem the first one at a clinic that i have used in the past , only to be told that i ' m not eligible as the coupon is for new customers only ( this was not clear on the groupon advert ).
negative	having contacted groupon for a refund , i was told that they would not be able to give me a refund as i bought the voucher more than 0 days ago .
negative	the woman i spoke to would not budge on this even after i kicked up an enormous fuss .
negative	it was only after i demanded to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold for ages that i have now been told that i should receive a refund within 0 working_days .
negative	i am about to try to redeem my remaining vouchers and will update this review after doing so and after receiving my refund .
negative	similar complaint to john .
negative	i was in the aberdeen bridge of don store on 0 oct_0000 to buy a few things .
negative	whilst there , i spotted a 0 tier plastic shelving unit on offer at £_00 . 00 .
negative	thinking this was a good price , i bought it .
negative	struggling through the checkout with all my purchases , stressed about the ridiculous amount of time taken to get served and how i was going to get all this stuff out to the car without help from the few disinterested staff , i did not pay attention to the amount charged and did not notice that i had been charged £_00 . 00 for the shelving .
negative	i assembled the unit when i got home .
negative	it did the job so i went back the next_day and bought another , taken from the same pile of stock in the same location in the same store .
negative	this was correctly charged at £_00 . 00 .
negative	i only noticed this error as i was reconciling all my receipts .
negative	i took the 0 receipts back to the shop , along with the packaging , explained the situation and asked for a refund for the difference in price .
negative	the store manager refused stating that the products were clearly different as they had different product codes .
negative	when i claimed that they were the same , he sent someone to get one of each unit .
negative	other than the colour of the homebase label , they were identical .
negative	however he claimed that one was clearly of a superior quality , hence the difference in price .
negative	when asked to point out which one , he had to resort to checking the product codes in order to tell them apart .
negative	when i pointed_out that this reinforced my claim that they were identical , he said that they were obviously different as the
negative	product description stated one was black and the other graphite .
negative	when i asked which was which , he was unable to tell them apart .
negative	in summary , these units are absolutely identical .
negative	both units were picked_up off the same pile which was clearly_marked £_00 . 00 .
negative	i believe that requesting a refund for the balance is not unreasonable , and was very annoyed and disappointed that homebase clearly thinks so little of its customers as to fob them off in this manner .
negative	i emailed their customer_services dept who forwarded my complaint to the store manager for response .
negative	however , i was fobbed of with a response from the team_leader that i spoke to originally .
negative	after several emails , i was informed that if i took the items back , unused and in their original_packaging , that i could get a refund .
negative	they were quite safe in making this offer as i had already told them that i had assembled it and was using it .
negative	all in all , thoroughly disgusted that a supposedly reputable chain should feel quite content to blatantly rip it '_s customers off in this manner .
negative	i will never shop in homebase again .
negative	really dreadful experience with a sofa delivered on the 0rd .
negative	wish i had seen these reviews before ordering a high value item from argos .
negative	sofa arrived as promised but really was not good value , cheap and nasty , grey plastic legs etc ( cost was over 000 gbp ).
negative	delivery guys said that there would be no problem returning it for a refund within 0 days .
negative	so , trustingly sent it back .
negative	have spoken to argos customer_services every day from the 0rd , they will not let me have my money back , i keep being told that there is a problem with their system which won_'_t let them authorise a refund , has to be the technical_department .
negative	promised return phone_calls , which have never happened .
negative	no reply to emails .
negative	staff disinterested and ill informed .
negative	i am moving_house , can not move until i have a sofa and white goods , argos are holding my money .
negative	there is no way i would recommend this shambles of a company .
negative	nor will i spend any more of my money with them , as i intended , should i eventually get a refund .
negative	i will be taking this to the citizens_advice at the first available opportunity .
negative	as instructed by a camerabox rep .
negative	i returned a canon camera & associated bundle on 00 / 00 /_0000 , due to them sending me an incorrect order .
negative	i was instructed by them to take the package to the post_office , pay the cost of return postage and enclose the receipt for the cost of postage in the package , and they would refund me in full .
negative	cost of return postage was £_00 . 00 .
negative	when they made the refund it was for the actual cost of the items minus the return postage .
negative	i contacted them via_email and got a reply from a person appertaining to be their returns manager ( some manager he is ) stating there was no receipt for the return postage in the package .
negative	this was a downright lie because i personally put it in to the carton with a letter of explanation .
negative	i then emailed him a copy of the postage receipt and have sent several emails for the attention of this manager , but so far he has failed to reply to any of them .
negative	i think their customer appreciation stinks and if i could i would rate this company as zero , but unfortunately the lowest score i can give them is a 0 .
negative	i know this company has defrauded me out of £_00 . 00 and will never ever trade with them again .
negative	i would urge any person thinking of buying anything from camerabox to really think again .
negative	there are many far better websites out there who really appreciate your custom .
negative	you have been_warned
negative	time for a new mobile_phone and intomobiles had a good offer for a samsung siii with orange .
negative	placed the order on - line but no e_- mail acknowledging it .
negative	tried e_- mailing the company but everything bounced_back by mailer - daemon - undeliverable quota exceeded .
negative	eventually got through on the 0pence per_minute line and told to re - place order and that would be acknowledged .
negative	did that but again no e_- mail response .
negative	getting a bit_concerned about a company with my bank / credit_card_details who appear uncontactable so wrote recorded delivery cancelling everything .
negative	next , both orders are confirmed by e_- mail .
negative	another letter sent cancelling .
negative	next an e_- mail cancelling one order and confirming the second .
negative	letters never acknowledged .
negative	e_- mails bounce back .
negative	telephone_calls left on hold for 00_minutes without an answer .
negative	tried sending a message through the returns form on the website but have no_idea if it got through .
negative	phone arrived but delivery refused .
negative	almost two_weeks on and orange send me a letter activating the account and the direct_debit .
negative	orange customer_services worse_than useless - even gave me the wrong number to contact intomobiles .
negative	this has_been the worst on - line buying experience i have ever had .
negative	i would tread with great care if you are thinking of buying through this website .
negative	order placed on 00 / 00 /_0000 : delonghi magnifica esam0000s coffee_machine
negative	received coffee_machine and after a telephone_call with delonghi i was advised to return the item as it was obviously faulty .
negative	i completed the return procedure but was unable to print the voucher .
negative	i have emailed to ask why it is not possible to open the voucher and have received no reply .
negative	today is the 00 . 00 . 0000 - i guess i will not be enjoying a cup of coffee any time soon !
negative	in light of the non_existent customer_care i will not be requesting a replacement but a full_refund .
negative	i will not be purchasing from pixmania in the future .
negative	this is my update .
negative	yes , i am waiting for webcreation uk to have this negative_feedback removed , how increasingly predictable .
negative	to all those people left with an unfinished website , my commiseratons .
negative	i am in the same position .
negative	however , i can confirm that not only is there an online petition , a government body will now investigate .
negative	so good luck to all you unlucky people who have come in contact with this comapny .
negative	updated review 00 . 00 . 00
negative	this review is from a confirmed client !
negative	invoice number 00000 and invoice number 00000
negative	my full name appears with this review and i am more than happy to share my experience with this dreadful company .
negative	a new low for this company !
negative	updated review 00 . 00 . 00
negative	i confirm that i understand that it is illegal in the uk to write a review about my own business , or to write a review that is false .
negative	are webcreation uk aware of this ?
negative	my experiences with this company are well documented along with many many other dissatisfied_customers .
negative	it is a real blow to discover that every negative_feedback listed on this forum against webcreation now states that they are from unconfirmed clients .
negative	surely everyone is aware that before listing feedback all customers must provide invoice numbers .
negative	is this yet another ploy to discredit their unhappy_customers ?
negative	take_responsibility webcreation uk and stop blaming everyone_else for the amount of online negative_feedback .
negative	i purchased a beko cxfd0000w fride /_freezer online on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the delivery date was scheduled for 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	we received a text on the 0th to say delivery would now be the 0th ( i have the original e_mail with stating the 00th ).
negative	my husband had to take a day off work otherwise the delivery would have to be rescheduled .
negative	so obviously customers requirements are immediately disregarded .
negative	the item duly_arrived & our old fridge /_freezer was uplifted .
negative	we waited over 0 hours then swiched on , filling the freezer later that evening .
negative	overnight the fridge heat up & the freezer defrosted all the contents .
negative	money i can ill_afford to lose .
negative	on contacting curry '_s & spending 00_minutes on the phone i was promised a replacement ( a further delivery of fridge / freezers expected on the 00th ).
negative	i called back to - day ( 00th ) & was informed that expected deliveries did not if fact arrive .
negative	possibly ?
negative	they would be in the uk on the 00th .
negative	( they are continuing to sell this product online ).
negative	but that time it will have been almost 0 weeks since original order with no arranged delivery date .
negative	i wish i had never looked on the curry '_s website & had just kept my old fridge /_freezer .
negative	i have also e_mailed curry '_s direct to complain_about the poor service , surprisingly i have not received a reply .
negative	please if considering a purchase from curry '_s .......... look_elsewhere .
negative	not a happy & never again to be curry '_s customer .
negative	i only gave this one star because zero_stars is not possible .
negative	why do computer manufactures bundle a trial version of the mcafee " anti_virus " software ... answer .
negative	because mcafee pay them to do so .
negative	i will never again buy a computer with this pre installed .
negative	it is , in my opinion , total over priced rubbish that can '_t be removed once your " free " updates expire and thus prevents installing free anti_virus alternative software .
negative	vote with your wallets guys , dump this software and don_'_t buy a computer with this already installed .
negative	we should be able to decide ourselves which anti_virus we want on our computers not mcafee .
negative	an executable file that cannot be removed = virus ...
negative	think about it !
negative	i placed an order for a bed that was advertised as available for immediate delivery for next_day .
negative	after confirmation the bed did not arrive as indicated .
negative	got a an e_- mail saying someone tried to call me and the order has_been delayed and they will be in touch with regards to a new delivery date ( i checked my phone no messages or missed call ), so this was lie .
negative	a few_days_later after receiving no response i chased world_stores only to be told that the item was not available ( despite it being still advertised on the website ) and a refund has_been requested .
negative	it has_been 00 days since order was placed and i have received no refund .
negative	they are quick to take your money ( despite the item not being available ) but are not prepared to do a refund very quickly .
negative	i wonder_how much money they make from customer in this way ?
negative	i joined first_utility because of their advertising the roll out of ' smart_meters ', two years later and they have now stated that the roll - out is not going to happen . my rate was changed to a different rate without my knowledge and despite providing online meter_readings my bills are still being estimated , attempted to contact them but am getting an_automated_reply stating ' due to an unprecedented level of interest , responses are taking longer_than usual - we will do our best to respond to your enquiry as quickly as possible .
negative	currently this may take up to 00 working_days ' poor , poor service - avoid at all costs
negative	closed by account and paid in full .
negative	then get an ' urgent ' email directing me to messages on my closed account where i find 0 messages .
negative	no previous notification of any type beforehand , just an urgent email to say we haven_'_t paid our outstanding amount .
negative	looked at my bill and we had paid up but they had reapplied out final amount to the account again - no_idea why !
negative	tried to contact them but bloody impossible to get through - waited for 00_minutes for someone to answer .
negative	tried again and for some reason got the option for a callback .
negative	had to wait in for 0 hours but no callback .
negative	tried contacting online but no response .
negative	tried sending an_email but yet again no response .
negative	just thought i would try the sales number and , would you believe it , the phone was answered immediately .
negative	now waiting for another callback - it '_s been 0 0 / 0 hours since attempting to make contact , maybe they ' re on the moon - might as well be .
negative	finally got a callback - got curt , abrasive and off hand response from the customer service girl , which was not what i needed after a frustrating afternoon .
negative	i appreciate she has a job to do , but she could easily have diffused things with just a little consideration .
negative	all in all , i would never recommend scottish_power .
negative	having seen an installation done by quickslide and visiting their factory , we fell into the trap and ordered windows and doors for our home from them .
negative	after more than 0 months , substantial damage to our home , mess and weeks of delays and frustration they still_haven_'_t finsished .
negative	the original installation was quoted to be 0 or 0 days but 0 months on and it still isn_'_t finished .
negative	the company has over promised and under delivered on just about everything .
negative	hugely disappointing and we are on the brink of handing the whole_thing over to our solictors .
negative	we wish we had never_heard of quickslide .
negative	we had a hotel booked to be able to attend the commonwealth games in glasgow in july_0000 .
negative	we booked and paid in full in october_0000 .
negative	in march_0000 we are informed by hoetelsclick . com that our booking is cancelled .
negative	they are still selling rooms on their website for much_higher prices than we paid .... now we don_'_t have a hotel in glasgow because there is nothing available except for super hyper high prices because of the commonwealth games being on ...
negative	if you are ever tempted to use hotelsclick . com - just don_'_t : they are liars and cheats !!
negative	!
negative	i had problems booking a hotel online . ended_up with 0 hotel bookings for the same dates .
negative	phoned lastminute to explain . they were no help at all . this company takes your money but if anything_goes_wrong they ' re not interested .
negative	i bought a sub_standard ben 00 camera for my son and when i realised how poor the quality was , i tried to return it .
negative	they said i could not because i had had it longer then 00 days , - i had bought it in advance of his_birthday and then it was a week before we actually tried to use it .
negative	i then tried to return it as faulty but they insist that i need to send it recorded delivery , at my expense , and if ( i think it will be when ) they find it not faulty , they then insist that i have to go and fetch it within 0 days .
negative	stay_away from lambda - tek .
negative	if your product is sub_standard or faulty , you '_ll never get a return / refund .
negative	they '_ll make_sure of that - they talk in riddles - go with a decent company , not them .
negative	proviation claimed that the watson weather forecaster was in stock - but it wasn_'_t .
negative	they took my money straight_away via_paypal but didn_'_t supply anything or tell me there was a problem .
negative	a week after the promised delivery date i chased them .
negative	only then did they admit that not only did they not have any but they couldn_'_t get any either .
negative	they offered to sell me an_alternative at 0 times the price .
negative	i declined and asked for my money back .
negative	they said they would repay it but they didn_'_t .
negative	from there on , they would not answer my emails , the on - line chat didn_'_t work , they never answered their phones and their answer - phone was full up so no message could be left .
negative	one month later i sought redress via_paypal and proviation refunded my money instantly .
negative	thank_you paypal !
negative	goodbye proviation .
negative	incidentally , i ordered the watson from another company and it arrived the next_day - just as you would expect .
negative	update_: after i posted this review proviation contacted me and asked if i would delete my ' negative ' review because they are only a small family business and they can '_t cope .
negative	i had another look at my review and could not see anything ' negative ' - just factual .
negative	it is noteworthy that took the trouble to respond promptly to paypal and they took the trouble to respond promptly to a review they didn_'_t want to appear but they simply couldn_'_t be bothered to deal with me once they had my money .
negative	looking at the other reviews , that seems to be a common story , my experience is far from a one - off .
negative	i think we can also guess at why there are so many reviews that have been deleted .
negative	if they respond now to this review with some sob - story or ' excuse ', they need to ask themselves why didn_'_t they contact me to give me a reasonable explanation or , more_importantly , get on and deal with the issue .
negative	if they want to stay in business , they have to start giving decent customer service .
negative	if they don_'_t , they don_'_t deserve to stay in business .
negative	they bring in a secure key card and you have to use it or you get basic internet access .
negative	i can '_t even send a secure message to them .
negative	without the secure key i have to call them to set_up any new payments , that i believe is fair_enough and did just that .
negative	i then had them transfer some monies to it .
negative	i believe that was all i would have to do and then any future payments i would do online as per normal , but no apparently , all payments to these new people will have to be done over the phone .
negative	this is ridiculous , every other bank only asks that i do it on the first payment to a new account / person etc .
negative	i don_'_t want a secure key pad for every account i have , i would need a suitcase to carry them around with me .
negative	why can '_t they do like santander where they confirm via a text_message to my registered mobile_phone .
negative	if i lose my phone i call them to cancel .
negative	if not do not deal with simply_electronics .
negative	i don_'_t really need to write anything here .
negative	just read any 0 * review below , or in due course above .
negative	bottom_line : ordered camera 00 sept , not even dispatched in promised time window ( a very lengthy 00 working_days - nearly 0 weeks !)
negative	despite_being shown to be in stock all the time .
negative	cancelled order and still not got a refund 0 weeks after that point .
negative	now a disputed transaction with my credit_card company .
negative	fraud .
negative	below you '_ll see an unitelligible reply posted by simply_electronics .
negative	i assume it means that by now i should have been refunded .
negative	i have not .
negative	lies !
negative	update 00 nov - finally got my card refunded about 0 months after the funds were originally taken , by which point my credit_card company had suspended and refunded the original transaction .
negative	an experience not to be repeated .
negative	this is quite clearly a planned tactic by simply_electronics to ' borrow ' your money for as long as they can get away with and presumably make interest on it .
negative	key messages 0 . always check independant feedback before ordering and 0 . purchase using a credit_card so you have section 00 consumer credit act protection for purchases of over £_000 in value .
negative	cheap isn_'_t always best !
negative	i ordered a blackberry playbook .
negative	it took 00 days to be despatched ( compare this to amazon and virtually every other online_retailer with same day or next_day despatch ).
negative	when it arrived it was clearly an american import because it had an american 0 - flat pin power adaptor .
negative	when i queried this they asked me to send a photograph so the matter could be referred to the right ‘ department ’.
negative	then instead of supplying a uk charger they sent me an adaptor for a uk three pin , but refused to send it to my home address insisting it had to go to the work address to which the playbook had originally been sent .
negative	this despite the fact that i was off work for three_weeks .
negative	i then discovered a problem with the play book .
negative	it would not ‘ talk ’ to my computer when i plugged it in to the usb port .
negative	the playbook would ‘ see ’ the pc but the pc said it was an unrecognised device .
negative	i contacted blackberry support who could not have been more helpful , and with their assistance ran through a whole series of checks and tests , including using other pcs , and re - installs of the pc desktop software .
negative	nothing worked so i went back to simplyelectronics and reported the problem .
negative	they told me to send the device back , which i did by special delivery with guaranteed delivery by 0000 on the monday .
negative	it took 0 days , and two nagging emails from me to acknowledge the playbook had even arrived .
negative	two days_later their engineers informed me there was nothing wrong with it .
negative	i challenged this .
negative	they repeated the assertion .
negative	i asked them to return the item .
negative	four days_later i received an_email_saying the item had been despatched .
negative	the next_day i went on line and discovered the courier company had attempted to deliver the item two days before that email .
negative	eventually i went to the depot and collected the delivery myself .
negative	when i plugged the playbook into my pc , to my surprise , it connected – once .
negative	they the same problem recurred !
negative	i wrote to simplyelectronics asking them to replace the playbook .
negative	they simply told me to return the item to them .
negative	there was no way i was going through that again , so i took it down to my local vodafone dealer .
negative	they discover some minor damage to the contacts in the usb port , which they seem to have fixed – hopefully it will stay fixed .
negative	i bought from simplyelectronics because they were cheap but the saving was not worth the hassles .
negative	ordered an item on 00th_feb , asked for confirmation of dispatch as it was to norway , nothing .
negative	emails sent 00th and 00th_feb , no response .
negative	phone_calls no reply , even left messages , until he decided to pickup the phone on 0th mar .
negative	said item was not in stock , so he would refund the money straight_away .
negative	still no money , 0 emails sent , 0 phone_calls with no response .
negative	as it was under £_000 , not covered by credit_card , spoke to cab , open a dispute , so lets now wait and see .
negative	takes money , does not deliver , stay_clear .
negative	0 star well_deserved here .
negative	tried to book through aviva extras but the holiday_autos site had a fault on it which made it impossible to book online .
negative	so i reported it via e_- mail and 0 days_later it was still not fixed .
negative	so rather_than use their 00p a minute number , i used a uk number ( 00000_000000 ) supplied by their customer_services department .
negative	when i said about the aviva corporate discount , they said they did not have one and refused to honour the price via our aviva site ( the fault came after that ) and to add_insult to injury said if i found another company who could give that price they would match it .
negative	this is a fake site .
negative	i placed my order , they took my money and then nothing .
negative	they have no phone_call and emails responses are automated stating they don_'_t answer on may holidays .
negative	this is a scam .
negative	i have lost my money and am worried_about the security of the transaction .
negative	this is a company based in china .
negative	was promised delivery in 0 days , took 0 after making enquiry .
negative	i bought sennheiser cx000 earphones the sound is terrible , did some reserch on the web , they are fakes , much worse the standard ipod plugs which are supposed to be cheapies .
negative	please beware lot of fakes out there .
negative	reading_reviews on here i have no chance of refund .
negative	i ' m sick of groupon .
negative	it seems they are now scraping the barrel to get companies to sign up to offer a deal .
negative	i have purchased several deals in the past .
negative	o spa never delivered , groupon didn_'_t want to know and refused to refund .
negative	other beauty deals reasonable but staff moan about how badly groupon treats them so you end up feeling bad for them and giving a huge tip so no discount there then , restaurants - hit & miss , usually struggling businesses trying to drum up business and when you get your meal you know why .
negative	now it seems to be only indian restaurants offering deals .
negative	my biggest gripe is when a company fails to honour groupon don_'_t want to know .
negative	i find now that many of the deals and available cheaper on amazon , ebay or online .
negative	i '_ve also used kgb deals , no_problems getting customer support or refunds with them .
negative	i ' m totally sick of repeatedly watching the same ads every time i want to skip on .
negative	i understand itv is reliant on advertisers but i get so infuriated it makes me never want to shop or buy from those suppliers .
negative	ok , play ads at the beginning of the show but then allow the user to skip them thereafter .
negative	hate hate hate it player , a complete_waste of time .
negative	we have just printed our tickets for brussels airlines and find that we are not going to get meals which ebookers said we will be having on their confirmation .
negative	just had a lengthy conversation with an ebooker customer service rep and after being put on hold for a while was then told i have to fill in a form on their website and attach the confirmation they sent us the form and it will be investigated .
negative	we are flying first thing in the morning !
negative	i know i for one will never use ebookers again and i haven_'_t even taken off yet !!
negative	!
negative	the first thing i thought a bit off , was when i first ordered on the website .
negative	their email stated they were confirming an offer to buy , and would let me know if my order was accepted !
negative	there was no message telling_me that the curtains i had ordered were out of stock .
negative	when i tried to track the order , it said " dispatched " but i didn_'_t receive them .
negative	when i started asking where they were i was told there was a delay .
negative	but not before i had asked several_times .
negative	i particularly_liked the pattern , so persevered , then found the next size was in stock so ordered them and asked for a refund on the other items .
negative	these have eventually arrived !
negative	several weeks from first order !
negative	i booked through cruise . com and the cruise was cancelled and they said it was because i was british
negative	call_centre morons you won_'_t get anywhere if you have a problem
negative	use to be good now it '_s biased rubbish run by idiots
negative	look at the website clearly - did you see the bit about the glasses taking 0 weeks ?
negative	- no just as well that you ' re not in any hurry .
negative	i ordered my glasses and received them in 0 separate lots .
negative	the first pair ( transitions lenses in a half frame ) fell_apart in under 0 days .
negative	it '_ll take another 0 weeks to get another pair , by which time i '_ll have been on holiday for ages .
negative	" once we receive the glasses , we will contact you to explain the cause of the fault ," - yadda yadda yadda - they were poorly put_together - no explanation necessary - rubbish quality doesn_'_t have to be " explained ".
negative	just as well you can get a pair in a couple of hours on the high_street - which is where i suggest you go as_opposed to getting rubbish service and useless goods via the web .
negative	i did ask customer " services " if there was anything that could be done to expedite a properly built pair but my impression was that they couldn_'_t care_less .
negative	well , while i was away , the replacement glasses appeared .
negative	this time the new lens was attached far too loosely so that there was a clear gap between frame and lens .
negative	both lenses were badly smudged with grunge as if the operative had spent the lunch hour changing the oil on their car without washing their hands before bodging a pair of glasses together .
negative	back in the post - let '_s hope it '_s 0rd time lucky for this lacklustre bunch of amateurs .
negative	ordered 0 sets of earphones that were never delivered , sent loads of emails but was only told there was a problem and slight_delay ?
negative	groupon just said that as they had been sent by their supplier un - recorded they could ' nt do anything .
negative	i '_ve lost my money by the looks of it .
negative	very poor company to deal with and i won_'_t be using them again ................
negative	have been waiting for an important delivery from dpd and would like to share my experience .
negative	day one , was sent an_email_stating delivery window of 0000 - 0000 .
negative	left work early and lost money to get back on time .
negative	got home at 0000 and went outside to leave a note on my front_door to say , could they use the back door but there was a missed delivery note already there .
negative	no time was on it so i used my phone and checked the tracking_details .
negative	still was saying " out for delivery " kept refreshing it ontil at 0000 it changed to say that they were unable to deliver as nobody was in !
negative	why send a delivery window if your going to be early ?
negative	day two , email again saying window of 0000 - 0000 .
negative	got home at 0000 .
negative	put up note again , turned on outside lights and waited .
negative	kept refreshing tracking until at 0000 it said unable to deliver as nobody was in !!
negative	rang them and managed to get through to a person ( by putting in an incorrect calling_card number ) told them the situation and hey claimed the driver had gone to the wrong_address .
negative	i called this into doubt as it was the same package , same address , same driver ( daniel ) and i live in a small village with nt many properties .
negative	person said they would get the driver to turn_around and try again .
negative	i said great i would go outside and wait on the drive so the driver wouldn_'_t miss me .
negative	00_mins later i called back but they had no record of my earlier call and no message had been sent to the driver .
negative	i wasn_'_t happy .
negative	i got all the details from the person i talked to the second time and they were very apologetic but it wasn_'_t helping me much as they said it was too late to turn him around now .
negative	it '_s now been arraigned for tomorrow ...
negative	i ' m not hopeful .
negative	i order lots of things online and by far the worst service i have received by a courier , is from dpd .
negative	i find it hard to believe that i ' m not being_lied to as none of what i '_ve been told adds up .
negative	if they had a truly local_depot i would have gone and got it but a round_trip of 0hrs is a bit much .
negative	please give me my package
negative	frustration . when it work it works but the customer service is appalling if you have problems , warning warning , if it works don_’ t change anything .
negative	0 months still no results , help help help
negative	just so you know you cant phone giffgaff , only email them via your account portal on the web_page .
negative	giffgaf support has to be done via_email only and all you get is communication done over several hours or days at a time . so it will take up to 00_hours to answer a question via your account portal , no alternative is offered . it feels_like walking in slow motion for every question .
negative	you often don_’ t get the same technician so you end up having to explain it all over again and again again until your tearing out the last bit of tuft hair in your head .
negative	by that time you want to jump up and down on the gaffgaff sim_card until it is carpet dust .
negative	i am not exaggerating .
negative	be prepared for frustration !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i had a nokie 0000 phone that worked ok on giffgaf but foolishly i asked for a replacement sim , since i wanted to put it in another phone and thought that would be easy_peasy .
negative	however not so ….
negative	the sim in the new phone did not work even thoughthe phone was unlocked to all networks as tested on some other friends sim_card ( o0 and orange ).
negative	so , i emailed the giffgaf tech and he suggested i order a new sim via the lost / stolen link he sent me .
negative	i clicked on bar sim only button , but giffgaffs system managed to bar my phone also arrhhh .
negative	after sending questions to giffgaf over many days , they asked me to supply them my emei number from the phone which they still have not un - barred my phone after 0 month .
negative	that is a straight_forward operation for a nokia 0000i
negative	as i say if it works then leave well alone but if you expect them to help you with anything technical like porting your number over or anything other than simply grabbing a sim with new number and topping it up then be prepare for a mountain of wasted hours trying to re explain the same problem to the technicians who seem to work from canned scripts , most_likely from india .
negative	for giffgaff technicains if you get this review and feel like helping me then my account is alexadams
negative	so far so good but my purchase hasn_'_t been delivered yet ?
negative	the order status on my order has changed to ' picking '.
negative	what does this mean .
negative	sent my iphone 0 for new screen paid for special next - day delivery 00000 said it had been sent on friday 00 july but wasn_'_t delivered on 00th as it should have been .
negative	then they said it had been sent on 00 july but still no sign and now they don_'_t know when it was sent and can '_t give me a tracking order so what does that say .
negative	i need my phone it '_s vital
negative	i cannot_believe the bbc have sold out regarding the coverage of formula 0 .
negative	this surely will reduce the appeal to new and old audiences alike .
negative	i am new to formula 0 and found the coverage fantastic .
negative	why don_'_t you listen to the thousands of fans and spend money on this fantastic sport that promotes everything that is good about human achievement rather_than some boring drama .
negative	despite their advertised turnaround time of 0 days , repairs0 seems to be completely unable to source parts .
negative	they had had my device for over two and half months and nothing has_been done !
negative	while the young_lady on the phone is very helpful , i have been told repeatedly that the parts are expected within a couple of days .
negative	i have just requested that my device be returned to me as i ' m completely and utterly fed_up with this sham of a company .
negative	i have had only two emails from them in all that time - i have had to ring at my convenience to try and find out what '_s been going on - which has actually been absolutely nothing .
negative	terrible ...!
negative	i think that booking with late_rooms is ok but i found that the price they give you is not much of a saving i paid £_000 for bb but their price would have been £_000 so saving £_00 not much of a saving not worth going through you .
negative	also the guest house was not very good not worth £_00 a room £_00 is nearer the mark i think the hotel inspector should visit the staff can hardly speak_english and you have to explain what you want for breakfast and they still get it wrong . not impressed
negative	we ordered from this company on the 00th_september with a 0 working day delivery .
negative	it is now the 0th_oct and no sign of our goods .
negative	trying to contact them is a nightmare , their web_site won_' let you send a message no phone number to contact and when i finally found one it a premium_rate number at !, 00 per_minute to use .
negative	i don_'_t know who writes 0 star reviews but it '_s the worst internet company i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	do not use this company
negative	paid evans for an estimate for accident damage after crash .
negative	forgot to do it first time and had to go back a second time and pay for cab both times as bike was unrideable .
negative	i trusted their estimate and got money from insurers for a new frame and eventually got around to buying a new one .
negative	when i came to rebuild bike i removed the bar tape and found the £_000 set of carbon bars had snapped almost clean through leaving me £_000 out of pocket as it was too late to claim .
negative	when i contacted evans for an appology they refused to beleive me and said the damage must have been caused while the bike was stood in my house waiting to be rebuilt .
negative	its nice to know that they are willing to risk customers lives by not carrying out basic checks such as checking for damage under bar tape after an accident .
negative	if the frame was not cracked i would have trusted their judgement and cycled through london with a set of bars almost sheared through .
negative	however to add_insult to injury they then accuse the customer of lying and blame them for the damage they missed .
negative	avoid , avoid_avoid !!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve been sending email enquiries to this company for a month in regard to one of their products , but they appear to have chosen to ignore me .
negative	i won_'_t be bothering again and will simply take my custom elsewhere .
negative	if a company won_'_t respond to a simple product enquiry then just imagine their attitude_towards a customer who had a problem .
negative	i arrange to work from home for the day for our sofa delivery , which consisted of 0items .. 0sofas and a footstall .
negative	only 0 sofa turned_up ..
negative	no customer service number available to call ..
negative	cannot keep being at home so extremely fed_up with poor customer service
negative	nothing more to say .
negative	simply abysmal !
negative	maybe the last time ............
negative	so we paid a fortune for hyde_park hospitality including seats .
negative	viagogo receipt indicated row and seat numbers but no tickets in pack .
negative	seller said just tell them at hyde_park ticket office , but they were not interested .
negative	no ticket no seats !
negative	great concert but could have done with seats as it was 00_degrees on 00 th july .
negative	viagogo have been silent despite several emails and a poor response to their customer survey .
negative	maybe this will provoke a response and preferably some recompense .
negative	transaction_id 0000000
negative	booked on the monday for a wednesday collection which wasn_'_t collected .
negative	it was rebooked on the thursday for a friday collection .
negative	once again it wasn_'_t collected .
negative	we live in a town not in some far flung cave .
negative	they then offered to collect on the saturday .
negative	as if ....
negative	i have waited 00_hours for this to be picked_up .
negative	i am not going to give them a chance to stretch this out the 00_hours .
negative	pathetic
negative	what a rip_off this company are .
negative	my son booked a holiday with them and rang me last_night to say he was asked to leave the hotel as alpharooms had cancelled his hotel .
negative	i rang them and was informed they had changed the hotel a few_weeks back .
negative	checked his emails - nothing from alpha_rooms .
negative	eventually checked his junk_mail and there was one from a company called bookout informing him of a change to hotel as marco_polo overbooked .
negative	son then went to new hotel which was not in the area he wanted , was a dump and to top it all there was nothing booked in his name !
negative	!
negative	went back to marco_polo hotel and paid himself to stay there as they did have rooms !
negative	rang company asking for refund due to their cock up .
negative	have spent three hours on phone now and still not getting a refund .
negative	they are taking £_000 cancelation fee for the three nights he didn_'_t stop in a hotel that wasn_'_t booked in the first place .
negative	great idea for a business if you have no conscience and totally arrogant .
negative	customer service is diabolical , they just repeat themselves until they wear you down .
negative	i was told that if i did not accept this offer and let things drag on it would cost me more money ,.
negative	i will take this further as i don_'_t see why companies like this should be able to just rip people off and think the won_'_t do anything about it .
negative	" your parcel has_been left with your neighbour at no 0 / 0 "
negative	awesome !
negative	thanks !
negative	0 / 0 has_been unoccupied for at_least 0 months and nobody_else in the apartment block has my parcel !
negative	been on hold for 00_mins at 00p / min trying to get through to customer_services .
negative	what a joke !
negative	if the rest of the reviews are anything to go by i can kiss my parcel goodbye !
negative	i recently sent flowers to friends in south_africa .
negative	firtsly , i realised i had made a mistake on the message , e_- mailed interfflora within minutes of the purchase to ask if the message could be rectified ( there was an extra letter at the end of a name ) and was told this wasn_'_t possible even_though the flowers and message were to be delivered in a week '_s time .
negative	i was also asked if i wanted a text_message notification of delivery , to which i answered yes .
negative	i have yet to receive notification and had to ask my friends if they had received the flowers .
negative	booked a taxi to take me to the airport , pre_- paid online as thought would be easier .
negative	the taxi never showed up and when i called they had no record of this booking - they still took the £_00 from my account even through the taxi never arrived and have not replied to my emails since .
negative	this company is to be avoided in my opinion .
negative	i like many people i see before me , are in a battle to get my money back .
negative	i returned an item that was too small 0 days after i bought it i sent it back re ; the courier company use .
negative	0 weeks_later still no refund i have contacted them several_times and all i can say is if you pay peanuts you get monkeys , because clearly their staff do not know what they are doing .
negative	i have given them all the information they have asked for but they seem to be incapable of imputing numbers into a computer correctly .
negative	as when the courier company got back to them the number was wrong no one bothered to contact me to let me know .
negative	i have now rung them again and have given the info again i have also contacted my credit_card company and they are going to launch there own investigation now .
negative	so here we are , i ' m still out of pocket they are laughing as they have my money and the item and this seems to be a trend with them i think will contact watchdog about this company and their policies .
negative	we had worked with groupon on and off for 0 years and to start with even_though we were paying a lot for the advertising we got quite good expose so we just ignored the cost but as time has_gone on , the service they provide has got worst we have had to wait weeks to get paid and this after they have had the money from our clients weeks if not months before hand , no business provides a service and then should have to wait weeks to get paid and then only after threatening_legal_action do we get paid .
negative	and to add_insult in injury there staff seem to think they can tell us what we should or shouldn_'_t do and expect us to work for free , why they reap the rewards .
negative	we own our business and paid them for advertising that is all .
negative	when we dared to argue about what service we should offer they will argue with us and push us to keep lowering the price groupon are only interested in them selves not the partners and not the customers and the service they provide is disgusting .
negative	they seem to forget that without the businesses working with them and the customers buying the goods and services there would be no groupon they should try remembering that .
negative	order no 000000
negative	i received an_email from lindy on 00rd august stating they had shipped the order 0st_class , today is the 0th_september and i have received nothing / heard_nothing .
negative	appalling service i cannot understand all the positive_comments .
negative	so if i hear nothing further and dont receive product or refund then small_claims court and off to maplins .
negative	this is a cowboy firm what the quote on line is not the price at the airport you think you have paid all the access but it doubles at the airport
negative	i bought an item with a delivery schedule of 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	after waiting 0 working_days i contacted buydirect0u via_email and got an_email back saying that there had been an issue with stock .
negative	nobody thought to email , ring or contact me at all to let me know that there would be a delay but i was told that it was in my local_depot would be delivered today .
negative	so i waited in all day and guess_what ..... it didnt arrive .
negative	customer service is very poor it took 00_hrs for somebody to email me back , you cannot track your order on their site and when i rang up their telephone system apparently suffered a technical fault as i was explaining my issues and went down .
negative	i only got a tracking_number after emailing them .
negative	do yourself a massive favour do not use this company .
negative	i am awaiting a refund and will review back again shortly .
negative	update ... to be fair the refund was very quick .. a word of advice to buydirect .
negative	just talk to your customers , keep them informed this way people will know where they stand .
negative	i would not of minded the wait if i had been told ......
negative	still disappointed overall .
negative	without a doubt , the worst company i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	i have experienced significant quality issues with the sandringham tv bed that we purchased from bensons .
negative	it took 00 calls for customer service ( hahaha ) to actually do something to address my issues .
negative	note - they never call their customers back .
negative	every call was initiated by me .
negative	the engineer that they arranged to attend agreed that the tv lift mechanism was indeed faulty .
negative	two_weeks_later and bensons hadn_'_t called following this visit - so rang them to ask .
negative	they stated that they had the report but just needed to check on what they would do next .
negative	we '_ll call you tomorrow .
negative	a week and a half later with no call .
negative	call them back to be told the bed is now discontinued .
negative	my choices - wait_until june for the replacement .
negative	have a refund .
negative	i will have the refund thanks as i have had it with this company .
negative	i will never buy anything from them again .
negative	twice i have paid extra for a next_day delivery only to find out the companies used yodel - i hate them they have their own agenda .
negative	how can we , the customer , convince the selling companies to stop using them .
negative	frankly i ' d have been quicker collecting my order myself .
negative	over night delivery took a week and every tine i got in touch i was fended off with lies and promises that were always broken .
negative	then to top it off another parcel from another retailer got the same treatment at the same time .
negative	this has_been the fourth and fifth time that yodel have let me down .
negative	they said they couldn_'_t find me and that the parcels were improperly addressed .
negative	this was not true they were correctly addressed and in the week while i waited [_external_reference ],_[_external_reference ],_[_external_reference ],_[_external_reference_] and [_external_reference_] all made it to my door .
negative	yodel are useless and i would never recommend them to anyone , ever !
negative	do not use bravofly - total_rip - off !
negative	they took my money and then couldn_'_t confirm the flight or provide a ticket .
negative	no one answers the " all times " help line and they charge you for the call !
negative	then i went to cancel the booking that they couldn_'_t confirm and they charge a " penalty " to cancel .
negative	review regarding a go pro hero 0 black motor edition ordered on the 00 / 00 /_0000 yes 0000 , not posted due to me mentioning one christian name who sent me an_email and speaking honestly !, nonetheless less they still have my money and i , nearly 00 months later do not have the goods , come on proviation get your act_together and give me what is mine !

negative	my wife and i bought a renault koleos from this company and had nothing but grief with it for 0 0 / 0 yrs .
negative	the car was either broken down on our drive or gathering_dust on their plot whilst a bunch of ignorant , arrogant , sales staff and technicians scratched their heads .
negative	not only was the car sold not fit for purpose , there are several issues with this vehicle ( well engine to be more precise ) that we should have been made aware of from the start .
negative	truth is , despite_being a renault dealer , i don_'_t think anyone there new a bloody thing about them .
negative	in 0 0 / 0 years we lost £ 0000 with not a godamn thing to show for it , as a result of this company '_s ignorance , contempt and utter arrogance .
negative	when we placed an order the web_site failed to finalise the payment procedure so we tried a number of times again without_success .
negative	we then found out that four paments had been taken from the bank_account .
negative	we received an_email_confirming that the duplicated payment would be refunded but we have now strated to receive the duplicated items by post .
negative	we have not been able to contact the company so my recommendation would be to shop elsewhere .

negative	i ordered a tv from pixmania through their website , and paid via_paypal .
negative	they realised that their website was wrong and sent me a lower model tv than i had ordered but did not charge me any less .
negative	i obviously refused to accept delivery and requested a full_refund .
negative	i informed paypal that the order had been cancelled and that i was due a full_refund .
negative	pixmania refused a request from paypal for the refund , and one week_later i phoned pixmania to ask where my money was , they told me that i had to drop my paypal_dispute before they would give me my money back , in other words they are trying to blackmail me into dropping the insurance and protection of paypal - thus leaving me wide open to them denying all knowledge of any payment and me being over £_000 out of pocket .
negative	pay_pal have advised me not to drop this dispute or i will lose their protection and that pixmania have to contact paypal , but pixmania are adamant not to contact paypal but maintain their stance of me dropping the dispute .
negative	you have been_warned .
negative	pay more , rather_than deal with these horrors
negative	looks_like gameseek . co . uk is just another scam site , after waiting for a delivery ( or at_least of information about the item being dispatched ) for more than a week , i have tried to contact them using web form on their website , then by calling them directly ... no luck phone is always busy , form doesn_'_t look working ant all :( so guys .. just be careful you can lose money as well
negative	last_week i was telephoned by someone from zenith home improvements .
negative	on asking the person why they hadn_'_t consulted the tps list , they accused me of being rude .
negative	i asked for my name to be removed from their list .
negative	about half an_hour later i received another call from this company ( a different person ); a similar conversation ensued .
negative	today i received yet another cold call from them .
negative	i am reporting this company to the tps .
negative	they have succeeded in ensuring that i shall never do_business with them should i need the services of a home improvements company in the future .
negative	thought i would give asos a try and ordered 0 items .
negative	after a week i received an e_mail saying one of the items was out of stock ( even_though when i checked on their site it was still available to purchase ).
negative	they said they would refund me and 0 days_later that has still not happened .
negative	the other item was 0 packs of socks and this morning a tiny package was put through my letterbox and inside was one pack .
negative	now these socks were supposed to be a well_known brand but are the poorest quality socks i have ever purchased and the inside if full of dangling threads which i imagine would get caught in your toes when putting on .
negative	asos have no contact number and no e_mail address and you literally have to go through loops on their automated answer system to send them an e_mail .
negative	just the fact that they do not have contact details would stop me using them again .
negative	it makes it almost_impossible to sort_out their mistakes and from my experience i would imagine that happens a lot .
negative	item was bought well in advance to be taken away to university by my daughter .
negative	sadly boohoo '_s incompetence kept the item moving around their depots but never getting to me or even contacting me .
negative	despite_numerous_emails all you get is a generic computer reply saying they will get back to you ; they don_'_t .
negative	they have no readily_available phone number so they seem to deter customers from actually speaking to them .
negative	i managed to track down a number via internet searches of complaint sites ..
negative	when i finally spoke to a person the product arrived soon after but still many days late .
negative	needless to say with such incompetence as the norm i will not use them again ..
negative	still trying to call customer_services to find when i can go to the depot to get my parcel but gave up after 00_minutes of automated rubbish .
negative	they can '_t even tell you how many people are in the queue in front of you .
negative	the website is equally useless at trying to find where your parcel is .
negative	i will not willingly use this company .
negative	time without number i have tried to buy items from argos and they never seem to have what i want in stock either in store or on their website .
negative	last_week i tried to purchase salter knife sharpener , although it was in the old and new catalogue they were not able to supply it .
negative	thank_goodness for john_lewis they had the item at the same price and did not charge for delivery .
negative	arrived two days_later from order .
negative	next time i check out with john_lewis first .
negative	ordered flowers for mothers_day over a week ago , they took the money straight_away , no flowers , no customer_services to talk to and no reponses to emails . my mum thought i ' d fotgotten , how bad did we both feel later that day when we spoke . not impressed at all
negative	i bought the three seater electric recliner sofa and chair after spending much time deliberating in the shop - the most expensive there .
negative	when it arrived there was a rip on the side of the cushion on the chair and a gap between the two sections of sofa as well as stitching out and loose staples underneath .
negative	upholsterer came out and i said i was unhappy , he said it had to go higher .
negative	the store manager came out and noted concerns and agreed it was under foamed .
negative	he said he would take it to the shop and sort it and that this would make the gap less .
negative	went to look today and is indeed better foamed but still a gap .
negative	i became very upset as £ 0000 is a lot of money to spend .
negative	i said that it may have been helpful to be informed when i purchased it there would be a gap but was told it would be assumed i knew that ( the one i sat on in the shop didn_'_t have one but was not a three seater ).
negative	i am deeply unhappy and wish i ' d never purchased a sofa there .
negative	this is a huge_amount of money to me , even_though it '_s on finance .
negative	i have been told they will be delivering the sofa back to me as it is now mine .
negative	i will be researching to see if i can take this further , but in truth , don_'_t think i ' m strong enough to fight and will just accept something i don_'_t want .
negative	i will never shop there again .
negative	laaaang ventetid ved telefonen min .
negative	00 min .!
negative	har ringet mindst én gang pr .
negative	måned for at få afklaring på mystiske regninger .
negative	skal også ringe for at få voicemail afmeldt .
negative	flyttede 0 telefonnumre med aftale om : 0 timers taletid og 0 gb datatid - jeg fik 000_mb datatid .
negative	har sendt den oprindelige aftale ind til tdc 0 gange og det_er stadig ikke rettet .....
negative	elendig service ....
negative	jeg skifter selskab nu ...!
negative	har ikke prøvet noget tilsvarende !
negative	ordered a fridge drawer (£_00 . 00 ) on a thursday_lunchtime to replace a broken item and paid for next_day delivery (£ 0 . 00 ) as i was on leave the following_day to receive the delivery , but was back at work the following week and would not be at home for delivery .
negative	the booking was followed up with a dispatch confirmation stating that the item has_been dispatched from the distribution_centre at 0000hrs on friday_morning .
negative	the item didnt arrive until the following_monday at 0000hrs a full 0 days after ordering - hardly next_day is it partmaster ?
negative	0 complaint emails later requesting that they refund the difference_between 0st_class and next_day delivery charge which i think is fair , but this company will not even show the courtesy to reply which says what they think about their customers .
negative	it is now 0 days since i sent my first complaint email to their customer_services team and i ' m still_waiting for a reply despite a follow_up reminder to them .
negative	think_twice before using partmaster , they ’ re good at taking your order and your money , but they will not respond to dissatisfied_customers .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	anyone can give less for less money .
negative	there is no value in tesco and no respect for customers .
negative	it is a pure money grabbing operation .
negative	and i know someone who chauffeured the directors .
negative	my wife discovered an item on her till receipt that she did not buy .
negative	the store manager made her wait standing at customer_services for over an_hour while he went and checked cctv which happened to show she never entered the aisle with the expensive product she had been charged for was stocked .
negative	a refund with no hint of apology followed .
negative	every little hurts as this monster forces smaller shops off the high_street and makes other_supermarkets drag their values and quality down to compete with tesco '_s base levels .
negative	item ( an sds drill ) arrived with inadequate and torn packaging .
negative	when opened there were bits and paperwork ( reg docs etc_.)
negative	missing i ' d normally expect to find and the manual had been thumbed through .
negative	it looked like a customer or catalogue return or ex - demo to me , plus it did not arrived sealed from the courier so who was to know .
negative	charlies_direct refunded , but they didn_'_t like it and were quite snooty and unapologetic .
negative	their customer rep claimed to be doing me a favour by not making a charge for returning the item to them as they did not regard it as faulty .
negative	i suspect they only fully refunded to try and not get bad feedback , but john_lewis they ain '_t .
negative	i will not be buying from them again .
negative	these_people have various flashy websites suggesting they have excellent customer service however they don_'_t .
negative	they don_'_t seem to be able to deliver when their website promises and they don_'_t seem to be aware of their broken_promises .
negative	i ordered goods which didn_'_t turn_up despite having taken the day off ( unpaid ).
negative	when i chased the order they blame the supplier ( their problem not mine ) and they seemed totally_unaware of the fact they had broken their side of the bargain and cost me a day '_s pay into the bargain .
negative	i cancelled the order which happily they did refund .
negative	howveer the really funny part is that they then delivered the thing a few_days_later but seemed totally_unaware of until i asked them why they had done that .
negative	they then wanted me to take another day off work to wait in for their courier to collect it !
negative	tried to buy computer equipment and had a few questions , went o the desk and asked the assistant but he told me he had to finish sending ( and actually writing !)
negative	an_email first and went back to his desk .
negative	after a few_minutes of waiting , i just left , he did not care .
negative	ordered a toaster via [_external_reference_removed ], yodel tried to deliver to neighbours instead of me , i received the failed delivery card a few_days_later from them .
negative	tried to call yodel , kept getting disconnected .
negative	arranged re - delivery for the 00 th april , stayed home all day , parcel never came .
negative	asked [_external_reference_removed_] for a refund as toaster was a birthday_present and now it was too late .
negative	as per their website , yodel is still trying to deliver to me
negative	this is the worst service i ever came_across - please [_external_reference_removed ], stick to [_external_reference_removed_] or [_external_reference_removed_]
negative	i have posted two reviews on this company .
negative	i would advise you not to trust them .
negative	i purchased an expensive toaster , which had a large mark on the stainless_steel .
negative	they accepted it was defective by e_- mail after i sent photographs and said they would replace .
negative	they then told me when i chased up that they had not stock ( despite the website showing the item as available ).
negative	when they could not tell me when they would get stock i asked for a refund .
negative	miraculously then stock became available .
negative	they said they could send it that day , then that it had missed the van .
negative	when i chased again they said that they had received one toaster and it had been sent to someone_else .
negative	this is incredible - it seems that they may have lied about stock to prevent a refund .
negative	they also attempted to renege on the agreement to accept the product was defective .
negative	they are now collecting the defective toaster and have agreed to refund , but they are plainly untrustworthy and i would urge that you do not buy from them .
negative	i am considering reporting them to trading_standards , principally because of the apparent lie .
negative	this is the most unacceptable company i have come_accross .
negative	they never phone when they say they will , scare you about unretrievable data , take your money when infact very little has_been done and never return the hardware sent .
negative	trading_standards must get involved .
negative	i bought a dress from debenhams over a week ago , it was in their sale section and it was just what i was looking for to wear at an upcoming wedding .
negative	now i have had an_email_saying it was priced wrong so they have canceled my order and i will get a refund in five days
negative	i find both the cancelling of my order and the fact i have to wait for my money for five days terrible service
negative	won_'_t be using them again that '_s for sure .
negative	last_week i bought tickets to bruno_mars concert for me and my family .
negative	we will travel to dubai tomorrow to attend the concert on april 00 .
negative	i thought i would have the tickets after i click the purchase button .
negative	but i never got the tickets .
negative	on the viagogo website it only said that my ticket purchases were " pending confirmation ".
negative	according to their terms and conditions , i should know for sure within 00_hours if i have tickets or not .
negative	well , it has_been 0 days so far and still it is pending confirmation .
negative	i sent them several emails but all replies were vague and unhelpful .
negative	i tried_calling but nobody ever answers .
negative	i called my bank who informed me there is some unsafe activity on the credit_card so it had to be cancelled .
negative	i sent an_email to viagogo to inform them of this , that it has_been more than 00_hours and no confirmed ticket , so consider the order cancelled .
negative	they replied by telling_me that i cannot cancel !!
negative	in other words i do not have any rights !!
negative	how is this possible ?
negative	i was not provided with the tickets within 00_hrs , and there was no payment transaction , so how can i not cancel ?
negative	i have never come_across this type of abuse of customer rights .
negative	i do not want the tickets !
negative	this has_been traumatic experience !
negative	when i first queried my bill , i got a letter from them some time later which stated that they could not accept my initial meter_reading ( though i had never queried it , i had told them that their end of bill reading was wildly too high ).
negative	i phoned to complain , but found that i was ` no .
negative	00 in a queue '.
negative	i then sent a written letter of complaint by post , but received no reply whatsoever .
negative	a couple of weeks_later re - sent the letter as an attachment to the complaints form on their web - site , but still received no reply .
negative	now given up expecting any reply and have switched to another supplier - life '_s too short !
negative	i received an_email which i think was very rude , from customer_services after complaining an order was a completre waste as photograh was on half of the front and half of the back of welcome card !
negative	!.
negative	i also think the hidden_charges are very high .
negative	i would never use this company again because of the rude remarks from their so called customer_services , and would advice others to keep away from them .
negative	do not trust this company , 0 months waiting for a part , 0 email 0 weeks_ago to say part was " in transit " where from the far side of the bloody galaxy ?
negative	phone now cut_off , will not respond to emails or faxs i say again !!!!!
negative	do not trust your hard_earned money to these robbing bastards are you reading this des coffey ??????
negative	?
negative	we ordered a kitchen_sink and monobloc tap .
negative	they arrived very promptly but ....... it was the wrong tap .
negative	contacted immediately via their abyssmal ' submit a request ' utsumi help_desk .
negative	got a response after a few prompts stating when they could not deliver and what i had to do and not do and on and on .
negative	emailed back asking for the ' correct tap ' to be delivered the next_day .
negative	then on checking the sink and trying to get it fitted , the waste system did not seem to fit , in fact when it was fully checked , it was over 0 inches short and the wrong angle .
negative	well this was over 0 days ago and the last response i had was yesterday morning asking me to respond by 0000 if i wanted delivery today , i responded_immediately but of course nothing .
negative	we have sent images of the sink and told they would go to technical_department .
negative	i sent images to the actual sink company who responded the same day to say it looked like taps uk had sent us the wrong waste system .
negative	i have now opened a dispute via pay_pal and will contact my credit_card tomorrow .
negative	talk about waste of time and frustration , never mind the fact that we have no kitchen_sink or tap ( i am too scared to go and buy one elsewhere as we cannot_afford to lose this money ). i have no_idea what else to do now , they really do not have a care for customers and tehy seem to get away with it .
negative	maybe next step will be trading_standards ?
negative	they billed me over £ 0000 . 00 for data i didn_'_t use !.
negative	in my experience they couldn_'_t care_less about their customers … they seem to be driven by greed .
negative	i wish they really did " record their calls " that way they couldn_'_t blatantly deny all responsibility for saying things they later deny .
negative	it '_s the orange customers who are the only real_asset and not the orange brand ironically run by " number crunchers " that have destroyed their own_brand by squeezing every drop of trust from its previously loyal_customers which is why ee can '_t wait to drop the name .
negative	i for one will be glad to see them finally run out of juice !
negative	i also hope that ee " everything everywhere " doesn_'_t apply to employing the bandits responsible for oranges demise .
negative	rotten to the core !
negative	i have bought many computers in the past from g0 , for friends , family , myself and all , beginning when he was just starting out on ebay , until the last one they were fine and adequate and most are still working .
negative	then i decided to go all out three years_ago and buy one that cost £ 0 , 000 or thereabouts , all the best components i could_afford .
negative	it worked great until it was about 00 months old when suddenly the psu began to fail .
negative	of course i could see in the computer and noticed that the psu had no internal fan but i assumed that this was just a feature of this unit , i could not open the case to check as it would have nullified the warranty .
negative	i contacted g0 to ask whether the symptoms i was having could be indicative of a psu failure , it was taking longer and longer to boot after the press of the power button , the response was a simple assertion that he was 00_% certain it was not the psu and to contact them again if they could help .
negative	in the end i had to buy a new psu so had to remove the old one as the model number and stickers were not visible which was strange - and i was incredibly shocked to see on removing it that it had been put in upside_down , and there was no venting for the fan , which was there after all , to exhaust out of the bottom of the case .
negative	g0 had , for purely aesthetic reasons , put the fan 0in upside_down with inadequate ventilation so that the power cable harness could be tucked away at the back of the case so it would look nice through the window .
negative	i contacted them again , expecting a response from them , an_apology maybe for the error and all being fair help to buy or a complete new psu because their installation had to be one cause of the failure after 00 months .
negative	the response - nothing !
negative	absolutely nothing so to hell with them .
negative	i have since got computers from a well - known on - line and high - street retailer for a lot of friends and friends on my recommendation have gone there instead of g0 and they have all been more than happy and believe it or not they are cheaper as well .
negative	i emailed
negative	i wished i had read the reviews before being tempted to order from this company .
negative	i have ordered 0 different articles and in five weeks only two of them have arrived even_though money was taken for the goods on ordering day .
negative	one of the orders has_been returned , which i know will take an age to get a refund - plus its cost me an extra £_00 for p_&_p for a double duvet_cover value £_00 which was crap !
negative	having been sent a small rubber gasket instead of the shower hose ordered and paid for , i have emailed 0 times over 0 working_days and have had no response apart_from a recognition that they have my email and are working on it !!!
negative	not happy .
negative	would rather give no stars .....
negative	i really wish i had read the reviews on here before i sent 0 phones to them for repair .
negative	i sent them on june 00rd .
negative	one was water damaged and was to be investigated .
negative	0 weeks_later its still being_investigated , with no progress report or hint of return .
negative	the other had a cracked screen which was replaced and returned after 0 weeks .
negative	the screen was badly fitted and didnt work properly .
negative	it was returned to them and received on 00st_july and since then nothing .
negative	i have emailed their help_desk numerous_times without_any reply .
negative	i have phoned 0 times and got through once to be commisserated with and told someone would contact me to tell me whats_happening .... no contact .
negative	as i write this i am on hold again ( currently at 00_minutes and im supposedly caller no 0 !)
negative	i just want my phones back repaired or not .
negative	i have posted on their facebook_page .
negative	they clearly monitor this as within 00_minutes each time the post has_been removed .
negative	tweets go unanswered .
negative	clearly nobody at repairs0 actually cares_about their customers and tries to sort_out the issues .
negative	i would urge people not to use this company .
negative	finally got through and apparently both devices are being returned to me by courier tonight .
negative	i will be very relieved when i have them both in my hands .
negative	i purchased some dressing_table mirrors from this company .
negative	there was no charge for postage and the goods arrived promptly .
negative	however , when we tried to assemble the mirrors they were discovered to be faulty .
negative	the company would not agree to a full_refund and payment for the return postage .
negative	they wanted to charge me an administration charge of 00_% plus return carriage .
negative	after much negotiation , i managed to get the admin_charge dropped but i still paid for the return carriage .
negative	i just wanted to end the mess and although i could have gone to the small claim court i really couldn_'_t be bothered .
negative	tread carefully with this company and know your rights !
negative	i ordered a summer bundle of pumps , shorts and 0 t shirts .
negative	they sent the wrong_colour and size of pumps .
negative	i contacted them ( not able to do this by phone ) through the site and returned the pumps for exchange .
negative	i had to chase them up after they had had them back for 0 days and was then told - out of stock and would get refund .
negative	now trying to get through to them that this was ordered as a bundle and i want to return the lot as it is not what i ordered at all , not just a refund for the part of the bundle .
negative	they do not answer what i sent them but what they think i should have asked .
negative	this has_been going on for 0 weeks .
negative	send a message and wait a day before any reply back .
negative	order number 00000000 .
negative	after 0 weeks , we are still_waiting for one part of bed to arrive ( unusable without it ).
negative	this part was initially lost by the mattressman courier and then delivered one week_later ( earliest they could offer ) and was smashed to bits with footprints all over the outer box .
negative	now awaiting delivery in yet anothert week of new replacement part to be able to build the bed .
negative	also found that in trying to sort_out the problem , mattressman customer service is always busy and all calls are diverted to a third_party call_centre to take a message and then it takes several hours to receive a return phone_call from cs .
negative	happily used mattressman many_times before but sadly never again
negative	i ordered a bouquet from iflorist on thursday 00th_september_0000 for delivery next_day ( and paid for this ) the next_day no delivery turned_up despite taking my money .
negative	i have tried to make contact on several_occasions as they have no phone contact i tried via_email and fax to no_avail .
negative	i have also sent my details with order reference to the address supplied on the web_site to see if i can make any contact .
negative	and am waiting to hear from them .
negative	i sent today registered_post a letter to ask that they make contact with me to resolve the situation and will wait to see if i have any reply .
negative	we ordered a £_00 . 00 bq to be delivered to where we work in halifax .
negative	a corporate venue in the town_centre ) we asked for early am delivery as it was for a presentation at a collegues retirement .
negative	the flowers arrived at almost 0 . 0pm and were disgusting .
negative	three stems of yellow crys , four old geminas .
negative	three limp iris , two old shamrock crys blooms and some purple limonium .
negative	tied like a hand tied and wrapped in left overs from halloween .
negative	omg .
negative	i felt so humble and embarressed as all the office staff stared at me while i tried to put the mess right .
negative	impossible .
negative	the ' shop ' that delivered the flowers ' scentiments of wibsey ' were not available to take a phone_call .
negative	i drove to the shop with the bq to find it dident exsist only to be told by the hairdressers where it used to be " she went last_year and works mobile from her van " !!
negative	omg .
negative	where i appreciate that iflorist do a great job usually as ive used them many_times and always been happy with the flowers i do feel they need to visit the shops they have registered with them as some are not shops but con women posing as florist shops .
negative	ie .
negative	scentiments of wibsey .
negative	ive posted a photo of the pile pf poo the shop sent for 00 . 00 .
negative	i could have got better for 0 . 00 at the co - op .
negative	!
negative	awaiting delivery , trying to be patient , have given one star but only to post opinion
negative	buyer_beware .
negative	this company didnt confirm my booking until after i traveled even after numerous_emails to request the details .
negative	i ended_up having to pay another firm to get a car and when i requested a full_refund from this company due to their efficiencies they said no .
negative	customer service was terrible and appallling .
negative	i have no_idea how companies like this stay in business .
negative	holiday auto always advertise attractive rates but often use less then reputable rent a car companies .
negative	they are now owned by a company named cartrawler of dublin who '_s customer service department are experts at refusing to assist if any_problems are experienced , their stock reply is holiday_autos are only an introductory agent , your contract is with the rental company .
negative	you have no control of which hire company you will be introduced to , many will demand a very high deposit if you do not pay for additional_insurance , this will often not be returned .
negative	holiday auto advertise rates in sterling but your credit_card will be debited in euro '_s for which there will be a high charge .
negative	i would recommend anyone not to use holiday autoos .
negative	please never use vodafone .
negative	at best they are either extremely poorly organised and trained or at worst they deliberately alter contract lengths , overcharge and confuse imei numbers so you are unable to unblock the phone when moving to another_provider !
negative	i have experienced all these issues .
negative	i had 0 phones on a business contract with them .
negative	now down to 0 thank_god and desperate to be rid of vodafone forever .
negative	going to use giff gaff from now on .
negative	by the way o0 / giffgaff have the least complaints of all mobile companies .
negative	vodafone have pretty_much the most .
negative	you have been_warned !!
negative	!
negative	i booked a dinner / theatre trip as a special outing for myself and three friends through lastminute . com .
negative	the package was £_00 and it said tickets were up to £_00 face_value and we would get the best available seats within their allocation so we thought great .
negative	dinner was fine but when we got to the theatre the seats were dreadful and we were so high up the only way we could see the stage was by leaning right forward for the whole of the performance !
negative	we went to the box office and asked if we could change seats as there were plenty of empty seats elsewhere but they said no , we had to stay where we were .
negative	we talked to other people who had done the same as us , they were all very disappointed .
negative	we also found that we could have put the same deal together ourselves by going direct to the theatre and would have got much_better seats for less money .
negative	complained to lastminute . com who said they were seats with a good view - only with binnoculars and if you are a contortionist !
negative	they offered a £_00 voucher towards another event ......... i don_'_t think so .
negative	won_'_t use lastminute . com ever again .
negative	i paid and ordered eyesential in october_0000 still reciving emails saying it will be with me in 0 - 00 days i have asked for a refund of the £_00 that was paid in good faith they are totaly criminal i am contacting_trading_standards on monday 00 jan
negative	i had a problem with my fridge_freezer the freezer stopped_working on the friday .
negative	on the saturday i went to appliance direct ordered and paid for a new one all i got was a receipt for the money i paid , was not told anything about no refund . on the sunday my freezer started up again had been told on saturday delivery would be monday after 0 oclock first thing monday_morning i rang to explain what had happened .
negative	was then told they dont give refunds and had to have credit_note what a load of rubbish i do not need to buy anything from this shop again .
negative	any business needs a robust structure to ultimately deliver an exceptional customer experience .
negative	many business talk about putting the consumer at the heart of their thinking including sky .
negative	but they don_'_t .
negative	i concede that they have a good product but that '_s where it ends .
negative	without paying a high price to call sky , which many people are unprepared to do , it is very hard to get in touch with sky unless you ' re happy to deal with a non uk_based centre ( which i ' m not ).
negative	so i write to sky on three_separate_occasions explaining this and receive one unsatisfactory call in response , therefore ignoring two other letters asking for information .
negative	as i ' m moving home ( and out of contract ) and was paying a considerable_amount per_month to sky you might have thought that for the cost of a telephone_call for my continued patronage might be worth it .
negative	think again .
negative	the way sky is managed is a complete disconnect with no - one allowed to either take ownership of a problem nor use their initiative .
negative	therefore i '_ve canceled my subscription .
negative	ultimately over a period of 0 months ( yes 0 months ) sky have not found a way of allowing me to call them without paying for the cost of the call .
negative	i have had a trail of emails with some robotic centre based i know not where you use cut and paste techniques to never fulfil my needs .
negative	it really beggars_belief how inept and short - sighted sky have been in this process .
negative	apart_from losing my custom there is the impact of word of mouth as if anyone asks my views apropos sky they are not tinged with any real positive glow .
negative	they really have lost complete touch with the customer experience .
negative	it also makes me laugh out loud every time i hear their tag line " believe in better ".
negative	their kidding us , right ?
negative	newsflash : do believe all you see and read about bt .
negative	bt are one those organisations that manage to shoot themselves in both feet .
negative	the way that they are organised is counter - intuitive to delivering a customer_focused business which is what they claim they want to achieve .
negative	they are riddled with bureaucracy , take little or no ownership of customer '_s problems and toothless at resolving the most basic issues .
negative	we moved home and gave bt 0 weeks to deliver on a specified day , which at no time did they challenge or suggest would pose any_issues .
negative	we wanted a phone line , although as we use mobiles mainly so this was not as important as broadband .
negative	we also wanted broadband which , for the many , is indispensable .
negative	you must have read the script because the phone line was not a problem ( although a story to tell at another time ) but they could not provide us with broadband .
negative	actually the guys said it was an easy fix but it required the two bt companies supplying us talking to each other .
negative	fast forward to innumerable and unsatisfactory calls including me taking time off and waiting in all afternoon for an a no - show engineer ( he went to the cab and it was too hard from him , so i subsequently discovered ).
negative	we then get the indianian call_centre horror show which is too distressing to recount .
negative	after another round of hugely emotional calls we eventually get an engineer over , who has_been sub - contracted , and spends two hours achieving nothing and totally contradicts everything we '_ve been told before leaving us stranded .
negative	we still don_'_t have broadband and are waiting to hear how we will be compensated .
negative	the customer service experience was the double shotgun to both feet again .
negative	it '_s so appalling it '_s a complete embarrassment .
negative	bt are pitifully unempathetic and lacking in any desire to out the customer first .
negative	they really don_'_t care and the people you speak are robots who have zero ability to get things done .
negative	it '_s a complete and utter shambles .
negative	to cap it all we had been double charged for something_else and noticed that we couldn_'_t see where the credit was .
negative	good old bt hadn_'_t effected the credit .
negative	when asked why , there was no satisfactory explanation .
negative	you might think ryan_air , virgin and sky are bad but bt make them look like the sisters theresa .
negative	gumtree needs to more accountable to sellers .
negative	it '_s owned by e_- bay who do offer some protection to sellers .
negative	on gumtree it '_s a free for all where there are no rules and potential buyers have a free reign .
negative	the number of times i '_ve no shows from potential sellers who expressed a burning desire to want what was for sale is legion .
negative	it completely wastes your time by which time you '_ve turned away some genuine buyers .
negative	it doesn_'_t stop there as there seems to be an unwritten belief that no matter how fairly you price goods the buyer thinks you should knock - off a random figure .
negative	as a seller you have little , if any , recourse to complain unlike with e_- bay '_s feedback system .
negative	the experience is absolutely shiv kin and makes e_- bay look like harrods by comparison .
negative	i decided to try gumtree as the costs ( as a seller ) for using e_- bay have escalated to a very high level .
negative	even applying fees on postage which is absurd .
negative	please_bear in mind that gumtree is owned by - you can guess - e_- bay .
negative	i went into using gumtree as a seller with my eyes open as i had heard some pretty awful stories .
negative	i guess with e_- bay you get a sense that there is some semblance of the buyer and seller protection .
negative	gumtree is a jungle which is not helped by their own systems which are inadequate .
negative	before trying to sell something on gumtree i wanted to get a used iphone .
negative	whilst there are genuine sellers i saw one locally which looked to be good to be true .
negative	in an effort to smoke this guy out i asked a number of questions which a genuine seller would be prepared to answer .
negative	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail from gumtree saying this guy was a suspected fraudster so don_'_t take this further .
negative	they also rightly deleted the ad .
negative	i was reassured by this is i thought i ' d try an sell something .
negative	i know what i ' m doing but the ad didn_'_t post .
negative	i ask why and am told that i had violated gumtree rules and i was barred from using gumtree and they wouldn_'_t discuss the matter .
negative	end of .
negative	phoning them costs an arm and a leg and they wouldn_'_t respond to e_- mails .
negative	therefore i wrote to them demanding , under the rules pertaining to the data_protection act , what information they had on file as is my right .
negative	after a while i get an e_- mail from gumtree admitting a mistake with a reluctant apology .
negative	i have tried to sell a few things on gumtree and the experience is painful despite_being quite brutal in my listings about things .
negative	the items i sell are priced to sell so i am no interested in offers .
negative	i don_'_t deliver , which i put in block capitals .
negative	even so i had one person ask if i '_ll make a 00 mile_round_trip for an item which cost £_00 .
negative	it seems to me that the accepted rules of the gumtree jungle if you ' re a buyer is that you ignore what people put down in terms of price and frankly people don_'_t read what you write .
negative	the most frustrating aspect is the number if complete time wasters you get which is demoralising , time_consuming and massively frustrating .
negative	for example .
negative	" this is exactly_what i want can i pick it up tomorrow "
negative	i reply yes , supply my address and we agree a time .
negative	then no one shows up .
negative	i e_- mail and ask if there was a problem and the answer is " yeah i changed my mind ".
negative	this has happened on a few occasions and unlike e_- bay you can '_t leave feedback .
negative	even_though they are part of the same organisation i have reluctantly reverted back to e_- bay .
negative	i also discovered preloved . com who , although doesn_'_t have the audience reach of gumtree / e_- bay i have sold product through successfully without the awful gumtree experience .
negative	without prejudice
negative	the boom in cycling i guess keeps them afloat but the customer experience is beyond_belief .
negative	there '_s no point in complaining as the compaints team don_'_t bother to ask your opinion and are toothless .
negative	they give a sanitised ' corporate " response which is based on the customer is always wrong .
negative	took my car for a new radio for my wife .
negative	no expertise on site but happy to take your money .
negative	went back and left with a bigger problem than when i started .
negative	a big hole where a once working radio was with the bracket bent beyond repair ( i was told that removal of bracket would take two minutes not an_hour ).
negative	no - one on site to help .
negative	manager as useful as a chocolate teapot .
negative	complained and told my problem not theirs but gave refund .
negative	the customer experience is everything and as businesses like comet and countless others discovered deliver this or go out of business .
negative	really shoddy and unprofessional experience , never again .
negative	i ordered , on 00 / 0 / 00 a kingsize bed which was supposed to be in stock as it was under clearance and 0 bedside_tables .
negative	they emailed to say the bed would be delivered on the 0th_august .
negative	it did arrive , but they had sent 0 top parts , the reason i knew this was because the bottom part should have had a draw - no drawer present .
negative	we told the driver immediately but all he said was phone the company .
negative	my husband spent the next 0 days trying to actually speak to anyone from that company .
negative	eventually he got through and was told the bed had been put on order and will be with us in due course , no_indication of when .
negative	meanwhile we have no bed to sleep on as we got rid of our old bed !
negative	several days_later we were told that the bed will be with us on 00th_august .
negative	it didnt arrive .
negative	when we rang to find out why we were told that it was delivered but no - one was in which is an outright lie - we were in all day practically sitting by the window waiting as it was that important to us !
negative	they then emailed a new delivery date of the 00th - guess_what - it didnt_turn_up !
negative	reason ?
negative	the van broke_down - yeah_right .
negative	this company lies through there teeth .
negative	the next delivery day was for today - 00th - low and behold a van pulled up and it was them !
negative	hurray we thought , but all we got was the bed side tables , still nothing to sleep on .
negative	today we thought enough is enough and contacted trading standars and they told us that we have to email them and ask when they will be delivering the bed to give them one last chance and if it isnt forth coming only then can we ask to get our money back - i ' m just thinking , all this just to get our money back .
negative	i really want the bed and some sort of compensation for all the hassle and money lost through days of work and no decent nights_sleep .
negative	it is not right that a company like this can get away with what they do when all they have to do at the end of it if someone takes the trouble to go to cab or trading_standards is there money back - your just back where you started then , with no bed !
negative	there has to be a way to stop people like this .
negative	they are actually making me ill with all this , in fact just sitting here typing thisiis making my blood boil !
negative	all i can do is try to spread the word and try to warn_others to avoid this co . like the plague !
negative	i also found that they had traded on ebay but are no_longer registered due to tons on negative_feedback .
negative	i wish i ' d done my homework before hand or i would never have ordered from them .
negative	allin all this bed has turned_out to be massively expensive in more ways than one !
negative	unfortunately for some reason that escapes me , i did not as usual look for reviews on wae_+ otherwise i would not be writing this .
negative	i too like so many others have placed an order ( for a tv ) that was and still is shown as ' 0 in stock '.
negative	once i saw the reviews i thought it a good idea to contact by email to see when my order was to be fulfilled as it had been 0 days and no communication .
negative	well what a surprise , the next_day i received a reply , but it '_s not good news .
negative	it seems the manufactures don_'_t make the model any more , so why is it still listed as being ' in stock '.
negative	have asked for a full_refund but don_'_t expect i '_ll get that in the next 0 days .
negative	i will make this as brief as i can .
negative	my husband bought me a bag as one of my christmas_presents .
negative	i didn_'_t like it so we took it back for a refund .
negative	we had the receipt .
negative	now it get '_s interesting .
negative	we were within the their time limit for refunds but at the till we were told and i quote " sorry can '_t refund you on this bag because you haven_'_t got the 0 receipts .
negative	i had the customer copy and she wanted the other one as well .
negative	obviously my husband mislaid it because he only gave me the one .
negative	onlookers must have been loving the embarrassment i felt .
negative	everything you could have wanted was on the till receipt .
negative	i stood my ground and wouldn_'_t budge , i worked in retail for a very short time and i have seen what customers do !!
negative	reluctantly she looked across at a dour looking female in another queue who nodded and replied " yes that '_s right we don_'_t refund on the one receipt ".
negative	i was quite cross by now .
negative	i replied in that case i will have a gift_voucher .......... well !!
negative	at this point she seemed at a loss that i dared make this request , until she made eye contact with the dour , scruffy female in the other queue ( this person obviously worked there ) who nodded her assent .
negative	i was then told in a loud voice " as you have this receipt i can see you have bought the bag , so i will give you the gift_voucher ".
negative	when i asked if i could use it online of course the answer is no !!
negative	confirmed of course by the aforementioned female .
negative	never again will i ever use monsoon !!
negative	utter and complete_shambles of a company .
negative	oh !!
negative	and the bag was horrible it was cheap and smelly and it wasn_'_t cheap either !
negative	!
negative	it has_been my misfortune to have recently had dealings with this company .
negative	in the past my experience with this company has_been positive .
negative	but this was about to change .
negative	i ordered a couple of items of clothing .
negative	i changed my mind after a few_days and rang to cancel the order .
negative	unfortunately i was about three hours too late the items were about to be dispatched .
negative	the advice i was given was to refuse the package which would then be immediately returned to laura ashley then i would be refunded .
negative	that was three_weeks_ago .
negative	i made a call last_week to be told , yes , the goods had been received back and that i would receive my refund in due course !!
negative	satisfied that the goods were there i just waited .
negative	a week_later i ring again , just a while ago .
negative	spoke to an extremely smug , unhelpful female who should not be working with the public as her attitude was surly and obstructive .
negative	this female customer service person then went on to tell me and i quote " no we have record of receiving the goods back ".
negative	she blamed the courier company for holding on to them , said there was nothing she could do but did i want to speak to someone_else in another department who was also customer service but that there were 0 people in the queue .
negative	when i replied that it was costing me money she made no comment .
negative	an_email was suggested but then she advised me that she wouldn_'_t pick it up till monday .
negative	eventually i did speak with a very polished young_lady_who was very on the ball who immediately apologised profusely for her colleague .
negative	took my details , looked at the screen and saw that it was in the depot awaiting the next step for refunding .
negative	she contacted the depot to put a priority on this return .
negative	a sad experience this time round .
negative	i will not be in a hurry to deal with this company again unless they prioritise their customer service personnel and their whole refunding system .
negative	ordered placed and paid for 00 august , 0 weeks_later still no delivery , several emails later i am told that once a parcel has left them its in the hands of the royal_mail - no offer of refund but will replace , and take no responsibility if goes astray .
negative	i will never use nombox again , and even now not sure i will see my items .
negative	i am writing about tesco westwood store , scarborough . i used to shop there regularly , spending about 000 - 000_pounds weekly . accessing the store on foot is a nightmare , you have to walk round the entire outside of the store , the main doors are round the back . i returned a blind i had bought to customer_services , the woman was so horrible , and you would have thought that she was refunding me from her own pocket . there was some fittings missing , but she talked down to me , and i was offended . another time i was in store choosing easter eggs for 00 people , so was spending a bit of time in that aisle . an assistant was re - stocking with a large trolley in the centre of the aisle . she was looking very stressed , and was obviously displeased with me looking at the display with my trolley . she was only doing her job , but it was her face , as though i was in the way . i went elsewhere . the next incident was awful . i was in the store with 0 children , and an assistant was stocking the biscuit aisle . there was a packet of broken biscuits on a shelf , and my little girl picked_up a broken piece and ate it . well , the assistant went to town on me , saying she could call the police , it was theft , and was so wrong . i was so upset , i wsa actually buying mobile_phones and the weekly_shop , and i put everything back and left the store crying , and shouting at my little girl . i have never , ever , been in there again , or shopped at tesco in any other way . also , at that store , if you need to call a taxi , you have to wait outside on the ramp in all weathers . they are taking over our town too , it will be the final nail in the coffin for scarborough , i can tell you .
negative	ordered pair of bib shorts - excellant turnaround but wrong_colour !
negative	returned shorts at my expense and had to wait another week before my order was finally completed .
negative	no comunication at all from firm .
negative	no recompense for insured / recorded return delivery even_though this had been promised !
negative	had problems acctvating card , spoke to customer service , said the card would be accivated within the next 00_hours , went to use the card more than 00_hours after the call , no money on the card & had to cancel purchase , this was very emarissing as it was for my wife '_s birhday , sent an_email reply to mazuma but not had any reply , not tried the card since , feel this has_been a very bad experince
negative	i can '_t even begin to describe the experience of these utter idiots .
negative	in simple terms i ordered a double_bed almost three_months_ago and they damaged it .
negative	had to have another ordered which was delayed and i '_ve been trying to get the faulty item returned five times now .
negative	i '_ve wasted hours of my time waiting in and calling them on their so called helpline that takes an average of forty minutes to answer .
negative	all to no_avail .
negative	they even lied and said they ' d been to the address and that the item had been collected !!!
negative	the mail order sender is of no help either .
negative	the problem is they have a captive public who can '_t choose any alternative so you ' re at their mercy .
negative	the next pick_up us arranged for next saturday .
negative	i would not use this website again .
negative	i wanted tickets for prince igor at the london coliseum and somehow got onto this website instead of the official coliseum website .
negative	this cost me dearly .
negative	the tickets cost £_00 more on this website than the official website for no advantage whatsoever .
negative	and of course i am unable to cancel them .
negative	also note that when you purchase tickets on this website they do not disclose the face_value of the purchased tickets .
negative	this has to be for a reason !
negative	didn_'_t deliver my items .
negative	no response or explaination .
negative	ignored my emails .
negative	no customer service .
negative	had to cancel payment myself as they where just going to keep it .
negative	very very disappointing .
negative	use a reputable company , not play . com !
negative	p0g might be cheap but please do not use them .
negative	check their no compensation items list and prohibited items list .
negative	these cover every item known to man , which then covers them for never paying any compensation out , even when they are proven to be at fault .
negative	they will still take payment and allow you to take out extra insurance for your precious items but never tell you they are not actualy covered , untill you try to make a claim .
negative	i have now had 0 expensive items smashed by them and these were not fragile items but they still managed to smash them and of course the scam comes into place and no compensation .
negative	they don_'_t actualy employ proper drivers with vans , any old herbet turns up in their old banger , no wonder everything gets broke or ' lost '.
negative	so pay a bit extra and employ a proper delivery firm .
negative	be warned .
negative	we recently_moved_house and contacted orange in plenty of time to arrange to have our line connected and our number transferred . as requested the bt_engineer arrived the day before we moved in to connect up the phoneline and broadband service this was the 00 feb .
negative	we were told it would take a week to ten days for our line to " stabilize " and get up to speed . as i am typing this now on the 00 march i am awaiting a bt_engineer to call tomorrow to rectify the faulty line we have finally been told is the problem .
negative	to date i have lost_count of the time and effort that has_gone in to attempting to get orange that we dont need a new router ( sent but made no difference ) our line doesnt need " resetting " and allowing to settle for three days . but surely the " best " one was ringing on thursday last_week to be told we were scheduled a call from the level0 team ( the " experts ") between_0am and 0pm i rang at 0pm and was not aware of this call being scheduled , anyway 0pm came and went and suprise no call , i phoned again and was told by an expert ( but not in customer relartions ) oh_yes i knew your router was delayed so i didn_'_t bother calling you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	however i was not ringing them for that reason so obviously telepathy is not a strong point at orange .
negative	it is my intention as soon as is humanly and contractually possible to leave both orange home and mobile , and i have been a customer for over 0 years as i feel totally let_down by this supposedly " blue_chip " company
negative	waste of time getting this company to pick you up .
negative	i waited nearly 0 hours to be picked_up spoilt my holiday
negative	i ordered a dress on october 00th , it still has not arrived !
negative	tried to call them but after listening to inane music for 00_minutes i gave up !
negative	i have queried my order 0 times by email , every time i get a standard reply apologizing to all_sorts of possible complaints but not actually to me .
negative	they may sound cheap but if they take your money , hold on to it for a few month and never send the goods , it is very expensive !
negative	i will avoid them in future and post this review on other_sites !
negative	i ordered a steam_mop through kgb , when the mop never arrived , i wrote to kgb numerous_emails asking for a refund , they did not even answer . if you want to use these sites stick to groupon , i had a similar problem with one of their deals and they refunded me without_any_problems ! i have now referred the case to my credit_card_provider .
negative	...
negative	initial switch went well problems started after 0 month review tried to increase dd by 00_% customer_services didnt want to know wouldnt return phone_calls , e_mails , i had to stop dd to make them contact me all staff agreed new dd stupid but unable to stop increase after stand off reverted to original monthly dd then they didnt take dd was threatened with baliffs ect ended uo in last_year paying 00 months dd plus final_bill of £_00 have now left never again you have been_warned !
negative	ordered from serenataflowers . com based_upon web_site reviews .
negative	got a text the day after the flowers were supposed to have been delivered " flowers have been left securely at the front of the property ".
negative	flowers never appeared .
negative	my gran ( age 00 ) lives in a multi - storey block of flats .
negative	and seems that the flowers were left outside in a public area .
negative	what a joke .
negative	i contacted customer support 0 days ago .
negative	no answer .
negative	thye no_longer offer a telephone complaints line .
negative	no surprise .
negative	contacted them again today .
negative	don_'_t trust them .
negative	bought two pasta dishes to take to my holiday home for a quick arrival meal .
negative	the smell when cooking meatballs with pasta was reminiscent of rotten cat_food .
negative	my husband found bone chips grissle and fatty lumps in the meatballs . totally inedible .
negative	we also bought a spaghetti bolognese it also had bones in the sauce .
negative	i contacted tesco via facebook asked them to chase their suppliers .
negative	in a situation like this their rivals would reimburse or offer a goodwill voucher ,
negative	they wrote a meaningless reply to get_rid of the enquiry
negative	i will use ocado sainsbury and waitrose in future
negative	morrisons are streets_ahead on quality
negative	the only good point in my area is that they have a pay at pump service station and the staff are generally nice polite people
negative	hermes have alsorts of tracking_information that is totally untrue and waste your time waiting in for the non arriving parcel
negative	if by some miracle an item does turn_up they will throw it into the back garden or leave it by a rear door and leave no card
negative	you are unable to contact them as a recipient and have to make endless_calls to suppliers to sort things out
negative	i actively avoid suppliers now who use hermes which is a shame as this includes companies such as house of fraser
negative	they left a package containing a £_000 coat in a wet cardboard package at the back door at christmas time
negative	make the post_office look like a fabulous service
negative	if i am unfortunate enough to have to contact them i use the new business form as there is a slight chance they may read it unlike any customer service enquiry
negative	worst company i have ever_dealt_with
negative	ordered collection and delivery for several items .
negative	no courier turned_up .
negative	next_day contacted them and they have an autormated system that says sorry to hear that i will rebook it for you .
negative	gave them the benefit of the doubt .
negative	eventually courier turned_up 0 days_later .
negative	.
negative	0 days_later clients asking me where their goods are .
negative	checked tracking codes .... awaiting_collection when in fact the items were on their vans .
negative	.
negative	arrived 0 days late .
negative	weeks passed and i was very busy so decided to give them another try as i had read good reviews ...
negative	wish i hadnt ... late pick_up again and lost 0 parcels and 0 sent to wrong_address '_s ... no way of contacting them ..
negative	my advice dont be silly ... save your money and look about , theres cheap couriers everywhere including ebay ..
negative	these_people will cause you stress and lose you customers .
negative	i called aspect . co . uk to check and repair my boiler which the pressure kept falling .
negative	the engineer attended and visual checked the boiler for half an_hour .
negative	he left , then i received an_email that i need to remove boxing to give access to vpr which seems faulty .
negative	next_day they charged my card for £_000 !
negative	it mentions £_00 for one hour plus £_00 for material plus_vat .
negative	i called the accounting department several_times to clarify why they charged me for material whilst the engineer just had a visual check and they promised to come back to me which never happened .
negative	i still have the same problem with the boiler and lost £_000 just to receive an_email that my boiler has a fault !
negative	it is just a ripp off .
negative	they get the details of your card at the first place and then charge you whatever they want !
negative	my order was pending for many days .
negative	when i enquired , i was told some products were missing .
negative	i then asked them to wait_until all products were in .
negative	they said ok but they went_ahead and sent what they had .
negative	i thought they had gathered them all .
negative	when i receivedthem , one was missing and i was not believed at first that i was telling the truth .
negative	will_definitely not buy again .
negative	yep !
negative	they are almost_impossible to contact ( it took me many many hours ) and they have no_idea where the goods they claim to have dispatched may be .
negative	i will be contacting master card for a refund .
negative	i have ordered many things from zavvi , and mostly everything has_gone smoothly .
negative	i ordered 0 items at the same time , 0 of these items i waited weeks for to be despatched but they said they couldn_'_t take the money from my card , so i went online and hit resolve , entered my security details and all went through ok .
negative	reconciling my bank_account a week or so later highlighted that they had charged me twice for the item once on the 00th_november_0000 , once on the 0rd december_0000 .
negative	i phoned customer_services ( 00_minutes of which 00 were on hold ) and the customer service rep was fairly useless .
negative	they started telling_me that i needed to photocopy bank statements to prove it .
negative	i bank online i said , they told me to ask my bank to send me a statement .
negative	i was told a manager would call me back in 00_minutes after his lunch , nearly 0 hours_later i am still_waiting .
negative	poor customer service negates discounted prices especially at £ 0 . 00 plus per phone_call to them stick to amazon , play or hmv all who have very good service , deal with you correctly ( and respectfully ) and have good prices too .
negative	poor customer service is a sure way to go out of business ...
negative	again !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a nz short sleeve jersey and after 0 days the order was still processing , i tried three_times to e_mail bikeinn but to no_avail , i tried_calling by landline and mobile but ... you guessed it no luck , i submitted a complaint to paypal and lo and behold an_email from bikeinn telling_me i had successfully canceled my order ?
negative	i did not cancel any order , however they told me my money was put back into my account , it would take 0 to 0 days ?
negative	after 0 days i again tried to contact bikeinn , suffice to say no reply and no money , paypal had to refund my money in the end ... do not buy from bikeinn , i tracked the order , they source on other_sites and sell to you at a profit .
negative	this website is a scam designed to separate you from your money .
negative	whatever you are thinking_about how good the price or the website looks forget it , it '_s all just a scam .
negative	they have no stock and will only give you the run around , avoid at all costs .
negative	this is a warning to anyone_thinking of using this letting agency .
negative	be warned that no matter what condition you leave the property in they will not return your deposit .
negative	this is not only my experience but that of many other dissatisfied learmont customers that i have spoken to .
negative	please if you find yourself in the unfortunate position to be already dealing_with this company , take pics of everything , do not accept any thing verbally , get yourself a good lawyer , dont expect your deposit back and do not expect any kind of customer service .
negative	there are many letting agencies so please find yourself one with good reviews and avoid this company like the plague .
negative	absolutely usless and i would never use them again .
negative	communication was non - existent .
negative	i had to actually phone them and asked where my order was , only to be told the product was now discontinued .
negative	apparently i had been emailed ... i ' m still_waiting !!
negative	this also happened to my partner with a different order !
negative	!
negative	not at all happy and not the way to treat_customers !
negative	i have been waiting 0 days and so far have recieved nothing .
negative	i do not live in a remote_area and have not been contacted about any_problems with the order so do not see why it is taking so long .
negative	at this point i just hope something is going to arrive soon .
negative	it speak volumes about their attitude to customer service when a business that receives negative criticism has to resort to personal abuse of the customer who has the temerity to complain .
negative	yes i got angry with them but not without provocation .
negative	their so called " expert ", roy , told me professionally qualified people such as architects are thick and can '_t programme thermostats , it was then i told him i wasn_'_t thick and quoted my qualification to prove it , he said he was sorry for me .
negative	i think roy was showing a chip the size of canary wharf there .
negative	the " expert " roy had written to me telling_me how to set_up the thermostat which i duly did and it still didn_'_t work .
negative	what they haven_'_t told you is that it was with those settings that it went off with a bang when " expert " roy plugged it tin to test it .
negative	the simple point the " expert " roy still can '_t grasp is that a thermostat that has_been working_perfectly for 0 months has to have something more than the setting wrong if it suddenly stops working .
negative	they supplied me a replacement thermostat of a different model but the touch sensitive screen isn_'_t very touch sensitive , i wont go back to them to listen to " expert " roy tell me its my inadequately stupid fingers that are a fault .
negative	instead i will spend the £_00 or so needed to buy a new thermostat from a more reputable company , i cant face dealing_with this lot again and receiving more insults .
negative	the lesson i take away is not to ignore negative_reviews as i did in this case from another customer that had a similar experience of the underfloorheatingstore . com
negative	received a call one saturday saying that they were from orange and wanted to discuss my upgrade options .
negative	i listened and said that i was interested in a deal .
negative	they said they would email me details and send out the iphone .
negative	shortly_after this call i received a call from orange ( who were and still are my provider ).
negative	they said that they hadn_'_t called me and asked whether i gave out my orange password to which i said i hadn_'_t been asked for it !
negative	i then tried_calling back the number that appeared on my mobile but it rang then cut me off .
negative	i tried and tried .
negative	in the end i left it and decided that of any phone arrived , i would refuse delivery and send it back .
negative	in the meantime , i agreed a far better deal with a far better iphone direct with orange .
negative	on the day my new orange phone was due to be delivered , i get a phone from e0 !!!
negative	no emails , no other contact and they don_'_t ( i hope ) have any bank details for me !
negative	i accepted delivery as i thought it was my other phone from orange ( which turned_up about 00_minutes after the e0 phone ).
negative	i called them and looked at an account they sent up on the website .
negative	the advisor was rude and unprofessional .
negative	i have sent the phone back by special recorded delivery at a cost of £ 0 to me .
negative	i am glad to say that my new shiny iphone_0s is working_perfectly from orange ( no upfront cost to me as loyal_customer to orange !!)
negative	and was a far better deal than what e0 were offering ( iphone_0s )
negative	so don_'_t be_fooled by the sales tactics .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled when they say they are from your service provider .
negative	avoid !!
negative	!
negative	bought a new vito 0 years_ago .
negative	after 0 . 0 years / 00 , 000_miles , the rear brakes siezed solid , due to corroded sliders .
negative	took it back to the dealer for repair under_warranty and got a bill for £_000 .
negative	apparently the brakes are not included in the warranty , even for a malfunction .
negative	contacted mercedes uk , who said yes , the dealer was correct the brakes are not covered by the warranty , even for a malfunction , as they are a " wearing part ".
negative	this is my first ever mercedes - needless to say it will also be my last .
negative	in a week this company has lost the plot , have angered many thousands of people .
negative	they have changed their website and now it '_s so bad that everyone is up in arms about the way we can '_t research properly !
negative	i only use an ipad and now i can '_t even see the 0000 original census , black screen !
negative	look on fb to see the complaints , even some companies have pulled_out !!!
negative	i spend a lot of money every year on a subscription , and i am retired so this service is dreadful now .
negative	gone from one of the best sites to the worst !
negative	they have even stopped_replying to our complaints on their site .
negative	maybe they '_ve just given up themselves !!!!!!
negative	do not subscribe .
negative	if i could give this a " 0 " then i would !
negative	after promising a delivery slot for yesterday and staying in , tracking said they couldn_'_t find my address , even_though postcode was clearly on it !!!
negative	i ' m not out in the sticks , just 0 miles from city_centre , and 0 mile from m0 !
negative	phoned up company that i ordered from , they said would be here today , stayed in , so phoned them up again , then she said tomorrow , so have cancelled my order .
negative	not acceptable , very angry .
negative	i changed to first_utility from scottish_power as they promised to be cheaper a year_ago .
negative	i have had endless problems with their site , struggled to get hold of them on the phone , and when emailed have received a reply some 0 weeks_later , or not at all .
negative	due to these problems i have now changed back to scottish_power with whom i am very satisfied .
negative	the problem i have is that i am over £_000 in credit with first_utility and contacted them asking when i would receive this back into my bank_account .
negative	no response at all !
negative	i left the direct_debit open so that they could return my money straight back to my account , and guess_what ?
negative	this month , having not been supplying my gas or electricity for a month now , they have taken another month '_s direct_debit amount out of my account so that i am now in credit by £_000 !!

negative	not surprisingly i have now closed the direct_debit but have attempted to contact them with no success both by phone and email .
negative	i can '_t afford to pay for 0 different providers in the same month and this will now leave me in a difficult financial position , and i need my money back .
negative	my money is in their bank_account earning interest when it should be in mine , which is tantamount to theft .
negative	i will_certainly be telling everyone i come into contact with to avoid these_people like the plague and will always regret changing over to them in the first place .
negative	if anyone out there is thinking of changing to them all i can say is don_'_t .
negative	if i do not get this problem resolved and my money back promptly i will be taking this matter further .
negative	this company should be banned from trading .
negative	until recently i was with vodafone and had been for about 0 years .
negative	as a payg user i always found it difficult to find easy resolutions to problems , whether by telephone , on - line ' chat ', or via the website .
negative	i suspect like many people , i nevertheless remained a customer through lack of inertia .
negative	i recently decided to review whether i was getting a good deal and discovered i was definitely not .
negative	when i compared vodafone with its competitors , i discovered that according to the most_recent which report it came bottom of the table for customer service , resolving issues , uk call costs , network_coverage , handset range , accuracy of bills and incentives .
negative	[ these results are based_upon last years which ?
negative	report carried_out into mobile_phone operators by speaking to 0 , 000 customers .]
negative	added to this i would say the vodafone website is among the worst around with little or no focus on what customers actually want , rather what vodafone think they need .
negative	in other words it is focussed almost exclusively on making sales .
negative	having found a better deal elsewhere i decided to move and because i wanted to retain my existing number requested a pac_code .
negative	what followed was a nightmare not resolved by the website , telephone or on - line ' chat ', until literally hours of effort on my part .
negative	reference to the vodafone forum revealed that over the past 00 months , many , many people had endured the same experience when simply trying to get a pac_code , i . e .
negative	a totally_inadequate response from vodafone , with more effort seemingly devoted to sending you up repeated blind alleys , than actually providing a simple number .
negative	when expressing my own frustration to vodafone , along side that of numerous others i was faced with anything from mere platitudes to outright denial .
negative	in other words vodafone remain in complete denial that anything could possibly be wrong with how they treat_customers .
negative	in conclusion my experience tells_me that you will get a far better deal , coverage and customer service by voting with your feet .
negative	don_'_t let lack of inertia hold you back like it did me !
negative	the laptop battery failed after 00 months into a 0 year warrenty and batteries - trade . co . uk would not send a replacement battery .
negative	instead they offered a replacement battery at reduced cost which i reluctantly paid for but it never arrived .
negative	i think they were trying to delay things until a paypal ' claim time ' expired .
negative	i am smarter than them and got my claim in before the deadline date and paypal refunded from their account .
negative	they did not answer mine or paypal emails and so batteries - trade . co . uk should be avoided at all costs .
negative	the name on the company is ' chan chi wang ' and they are not uk_based but honk kong .
negative	this is the last time i will deal with them or the far east again as i would rather pay extra from a uk company .
negative	as the song goes my battery was on a ' slow boat from china ' avoid , avoid , avoid at all costs ."
negative	so so overrated :-)
negative	odd how when i review a cd to cassette adaptor from halfords which not only does not work but wrecks my car stereo into the bargain - the one star review is not published .
negative	did i expect ethical behaviour ?
negative	- strangely yes .
negative	parcel 0go the worst i have ever come_across , they dont deliver parcel and mark it down as delivered , when a fuss is made they then tell you no it was not delivered courier made a mistake .
negative	you get appologised too and promised it that same day .
negative	0 days on you still havent got it and they wont answer your emails , live_chat dont help you and you have lost your parcel to the theiving gits .

negative	i ordered a motor for our washing_machine in july_0000 .
negative	the motor arrived within a few_days .
negative	the engineer then realised that i needed to order a control modules as well , which i promptly did given the good service i had had from interspares thus_far .
negative	the module never arrived , and after trying to speak to interspares '_s customer service department on the phone ( countless messages left ) and by email , and out of sheer frustration i went out and bought another washing_machine .
negative	i continued trying to contact interspares to arrange the return of the motor and a refund but never go a reply .
negative	their customer service extension is never manned , it seems , so i then tried choosing the sales extension , and that was when i spoke to a lady_called [_name_removed ], who after hearing my account instructed me to return the motor for a full_refund and said that the part that had not been delivered would also been refunded .
negative	i posted the motor back to them on [_name_removed_] instruction and was expecting a refund .
negative	several weeks went past and i eventually called my credit_card company to enquire if a refund had been received from interspares .
negative	no refund had been received , so i once again started attempting to contact interspares .
negative	i eventually spoke to [_name_removed ], who appears to be the big wig in the company .
negative	he first said that they had not received the motor and that i was not acting in good faith .
negative	i then managed to find the certificate of posting and called him back the following_day .
negative	by then , he confirmed that the motor had been received but because it had been bolted on to the machine , but never used , they would not refund any money to me .
negative	i tried to explain to [_name_removed_] that the part was only returned because i did not receive the module and that after waiting for about one month i felt that i had waited enough and went out and bought another machine .
negative	simon said that their terms and conditions clearly_stated that parts that had been fitted but not used would not be refunded .
negative	i checked their t &_c and found nothing to that effect .
negative	he also promised that a refund for the part that never arrived would be made .
negative	after waiting for about one month , i contacted them again as i still had not received a refund and was told that it would be done there and then .
negative	i have now received only a partial_refund because they saw fit to deduct the cost of returning the motor to them from the refund for the part that was never delivered .
negative	so not only am i out of £_00 . 00 paid for the motor , but they also took over £_00 . 00 from the refund that they did process .
negative	i was instructed to use their freepost returns service which now they have charged me for .
negative	i will file a claim in the small_claims court and report this company to trading_standards .
negative	i advise everyone out there not to deal with this company or with [_name_removed ].
negative	they are not serious and are out to rip people off .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews on this company before ordering anything from them .
negative	you have been_warned .
negative	deal with them at your_own peril !
negative	do your homework and search for reviews on this company .
negative	i wish i had done that before i had any dealings with them .
negative	joined in jan for a smart_meter - was reason i joined
negative	kept fobbing me off when asked when meter was being installed saying it would happen soon .
negative	then changed my tariff and said i never was on a smart_meter tariff and i was not entitled to a meter .
negative	so have paid for a service i never received .
negative	i would have choose a completely_different tariff and supplier if i had of know this from the start .
negative	cant_wait to leave - worst supplier out there
negative	avoid_avoid
negative	oh and if you ever need to phone them - be prepared to wait and wait and wait on hold - poor service
negative	very poor .
negative	the site stated that they had several of the drives ( albeit twice the price of other_sites ) i was looking for in stock .
negative	i duly phoned to confirm and placed the order over the phone then .
negative	i balked a little at the £ 0 +_vat but was told that was because it was next_day delivery , so reluctantly i sucked it up .
negative	the following_day i chased the order by phone as it hadn_'_t turned_up by 0 :_00pm only to be put through to customer_services and to be told that they hadn_'_t got stock .
negative	obviously they don_'_t hold stock , they simply try to get their suppliers ' to drop ship .
negative	they said that i should have received an_email_stating this , which i hadn_'_t .
negative	i canceled the order .
negative	very disappointed .

negative	i decided to migrate from npower to another supplier in december_0000 and 0 months later they still have not been able to resolve and issue the credit refund whch i am owed .
negative	was on their dual_fuel scheme and back in january received a final gas bill showing over £_000 in credit , 0 days_later a ` for information only ` statement showing £_000 . 00 .
negative	contacted them and told allow 00 days for refund .
negative	no final electric bill arrived nor refund so contacted them again .
negative	told it would be sorted within 00 days which it wasnt so completed their online complaints form which , other than their auto response ` email was completely_ignored .
negative	loads more phone_calls to them and i finally thought i was getting somewhere on 0th_may after spending 0h 00_mins going through everything again .
negative	supposedly she had found , sorted the problem , finalised my account and authorized the refund and informed me this would be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	needless to say the refund has not appeared up to today ..
negative	do not believe a word this company says .
negative	in my opinion their whole operation should be fully investigated by the energy ombudsman .
negative	appalling incompetent untrained staff !!!
negative	i moved_house on 0th_oct_0000 and it took until the middle of feb_0000 to receive all the money they owed me as i was in credit when i moved , after many expensive phone_calls and being on hold for a ridiculous amount of time i was almost reduced to tears of frustration after they credited the wrong account and said i couldnt have my money until they found out where the money had gone , if i wasnt so stubborn i would have given up , but why should they keep my money , please_please dont use them i just wish i had seen this site earlier ..
negative	booked this at 00 . 00 and courier never showed up .
negative	interparcel told me to wait_till 0 , then told me they could do nothing so i should contact tnt .
negative	tnt then said they were never sent the booking .
negative	the guys at interparcel refused to try and help , refused to upgrade telling_me that actually " it is a non - guaranteed service ".
negative	i was told that they would rebook it for the next_day but were not prepared to do anything to placate me or to try and retain me as a customer .
negative	also they would not confirm that the same thing would not happen the next_day .
negative	i would advise_anyone who was thinking of using them to not .
negative	stay as far away as possible .
negative	cowboys with no customer service care at all .
negative	i '_ve already exhausted myself adding comments to the other reviews .
negative	please see them to get a real flavor of how i feel about this absolutely appalling company and its derivatives .
negative	i '_ve only found 0 but there are probably more out there ?
negative	they should all be put out of business asap due to their total_lack of honesty and integrity .
negative	they are selling brackets for £_00 /£ 00 /£ 00 & £_000 then sending brackets that are priced at £_00 on their website .
negative	in my opinion they have purchased a consignment of brackets , a00blk which they are unable to sell due to the inherent design faults of only having 0 hole wall - fixings , vertically spaced , with a narrow seating area .
negative	anyone with any technical_knowledge would recognize that over time the forces acting on the cantilever arms will loosen the fixings and cause the tv to plummet to the floor .
negative	would you trust your £_000 - £_000 - £_000 tv to this set - up - no you wouldn_'_t .
negative	don_'_t get me wrong the bracket ( a00blk ) that was incorrectly delivered to me is a good sturdy piece of engineering , which looks good and functions as it should .
negative	but with the design fault mentioned i would not / will not mount my tv ( 00kg ) on it , without modifications .
negative	which i don_'_t intend mentioning here , as i would sooner see the companies fail ?
negative	with some effort on my part i will make the bracket work but most people do not have the time , energy and expertise necessary to do this .
negative	so the companies concerned : 000rackets . co . uk ; racketsrus . co . uk & tvrackets0u . co . uk will_continue to scam the uk public with their underhanded ; shoddy ; un - principled ways .
negative	unless stopped by you joe public !
negative	review update 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	email today offering me a different bracket - they must have seen my original review .
negative	if i accept their offer it will cost me £ 0 to send the bracket back .
negative	what do you think the chances of getting the new bracket are ( marks from 0 - 00 ) and what are the chances of getting a refund when i '_ve sent it back ( marks again 0 - 00 ).
negative	i will mark it 0 - 0 .
negative	because i think i will then be £_00 . 00 out of pocket with nothing to mount my tv on .
negative	when trust has_gone - its gone
negative	would you trust them ?
negative	comments please .
negative	review update 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	another email today from 000rackets , they will pay for me to return the bracket and send me another one or give me a refund .
negative	readers i wonder_why ?
negative	has your trust score gone up yet !
negative	mine '_s not still ( 0 - 0 ).
negative	just sent the initial story of to watchdog on their website ( what a bind ).
negative	i '_ve run out of steam tonight so i '_ll leave doing rip of britain ( the 0 fair ladies ) until tomorrow or maybe a weekend job .
negative	did you know that jennie bond is 00 , angela rippon is 00 and gloria hunniford is 00 .
negative	i perhaps shouldn_'_t mention their ages but i was absolutely amazed when i read the article about them .
negative	they have still defiantly got it all - charm , charisma & professionalism .
negative	makes me look and feel about 000 and i ' m only 00 honest .
negative	my experience suggests that after years of good relationship with a premier account holding , the final outcome has_been disastrous on changing to a new branch .
negative	it continued with a litany of errors for years without my knowledge only to be discovered by_accident .
negative	it admits its mistake and failing in its customer charter but refuses to return my money sent to a third_party through negligence .
negative	even the third_party has refunded a portion that is permissible within the statutory limits .
negative	all that hsbc provides is verbal diarrhoea .
negative	it has_been one and a half years now .
negative	i live overseas and planning a trip to the uk so that i can sue the bank for refusing to return my money with interest , all costs as well as loss of income due to attendance .
negative	i did a hostel booking using hostelbookers . com .
negative	i wished to send a review of my booking experience through trustpilot .
negative	i spent over 00_minutes to log in with correct email address and password .
negative	it says that there is no such email ......... and it is my primary email address !
negative	i have given up .
negative	as a business customer i expect a response from a lodged complaint .
negative	not an_automated email .
negative	birmingham parcelforce depot have given me excuses ranging from , the parcel was outsourced to another courier , the driver has no mobile and no means of communication in his van , a manager has_gone out with the driver to locate the parcel etc .
negative	this depot are obviously having fun at my expense !
negative	good luck with that attitude .
negative	i am already looking for another company .
negative	my account states that i have been paid , alas my bank_account says not !
negative	since 00st_july i have been fobbed_off with many excuses , the last one via_email last wednesday apologising (!)
negative	that they were experiencing system failer but that i would receive my refund after 00 working hours , these expired yesterday and there is still no credit into my bank as of now !
negative	i cannot_believe those people that have had a ' happy ' result !
negative	i would not recommend this company !
negative	they go around using all possible ways to suck your money out .
negative	charges are ridiculous , money held ( pretending to be protection when they have direct_debit to my account !!!)
negative	and customer service is another rip_off with premium number to call them .
negative	i had to wait 00 min to get trough since it was urgent .
negative	avoid .
negative	dont see them to survive for a long time .
negative	was promised delivery by 0 . 00pm .
negative	i left house to see mother and upon my return a person came to my door and said she was visiting her friend some doors up and was given this box for me .
negative	driver left no message or asked for i . d .
negative	will contact dell about this !
negative	poor web_site , difficult to work around .
negative	poor quantity of goods available .
negative	slow dispatch time .
negative	poor service , still_haven_'_t got the t shirts ordered for my daughter '_s birthday .
negative	they claimed to have dispatched goods on 00 / 0 when it is clear from the tracking that they dispatched on 0 / 0from the us .
negative	no doubt i will get conned into paying vat at some point as i hadn_'_t realised that they were coming from the us .
negative	as per the tracking , it has spent the last 0 days bouncing around nj usa .
negative	knowing this company , it is probably waiting for a boat !
negative	would never , ever use them again .

negative	on 00 november i ordered a hamper for my sister and nieces through ihampers , a subsidiary of iflorist .
negative	i requested that the hamper be delivered on 00 december .
negative	as i live in cape_town , south_africa i have sent hampers on a number of occasions through other_companies without_any_problems at all and as i had ordered in good time , i fully expected the hamper to be delivered on the selected date .
negative	wrong !
negative	the hamper was only delivered on 00 december causing me much embarrassment as my sister had assumed i had forgotten her .
negative	on 00 december i e_- mailed ihampers to express my displeasure and only received a reply on 0 january offering me a 0 pound voucher off my next purchase - obviously a very safe offer as they are probably only too well aware it will be the last time i use their service .
negative	sold my iphone 0 for £_000 . 00 after receiving my iphone0s upgrade .
negative	packaged up in 0 bubble_wrap enevelopes to ensure no damage in transit and sent it using the pre_- paid special delivery bag .
negative	phone arrived with envirophone safely , their test result claimed their was a sim reader fault and offered £_000 . 00 .
negative	i rejected the offer and they returned the phone .
negative	got the phone back today , powered it up and inserted my sim_card ...... it read it straight_away and the phone is in perfect working order !!
negative	!
negative	not even the decency to communicate properly with customers !!
negative	!
negative	i purchased an iten from this company and ( not having used it ) wanted a refund .
negative	lambda - tek would not accept the return and refused to communicate meaningfully , they would not answer even simple questions .
negative	clearly the company prefers not to take returns and makes doing so very difficult .
negative	their packaging for original shipment was not up to the standard that they demand from customers who wish to retun an item , a poor approach with such delicate high - value products .
negative	not a company i feel i can trust .
negative	.
negative	my first time using parts_gateway has not been good . the main_reason was the part i was supplied with was fauly / heavy corrosion and with the incorrect abs lead fitted ( obvious not for my car , i confirmed this with renault who did not recognise part number of abs lead fitted ). i called the supplier rp services who were not very helpfull and said if i return item ( extra_cost of postage ) they would inspect and if found faulty they might return money . as part was needed i sought alternative supply and decide to cut my loss .
negative	i have ordered some after shave from this site , every time i called to ask where it has got to i got a different answer .
negative	today i got an_email reply to question as to where my item is .
negative	i was told to read their terms and conditions and they accept no responsibility whatsoever for my delivery as i opted for standard deliver service which incidentally still cost £ 0 . 00 .
negative	i googled them and this appears to be a common pattern , people order goods , nothing arrives , they then try and fob you off .
negative	the last review before mine on this site i would hazard a guess they wrote it for themselves due to all the negatives .
negative	i ordered online with pets at home and i wish i never bothered !
negative	i had a bad_experience last time i did , with parcelforce leaving it outside the front_door for anyone to steal !
negative	this time however , they never picked_up the damn parcel !
negative	so now i have to wait for pah to get in contact with them .
negative	i am so angry !
negative	will never ever shop with pah online again .
negative	better off going instore but i couldn_'_t go this week so i had to order online .
negative	parcelforce , please just stop operating as a company .
negative	you suck !
negative	i ordered some dog_food from viovet last friday .
negative	i paid for next_day delivery , going by their times etc , i should have got my parcel tuesday .
negative	i didn_'_t , as it got mis sorted and went to a different depot !
negative	idiots .
negative	just got it and i ' m very annoyed .
negative	my puppy cake mix has exploded all over the new toy and dog_food .
negative	i thought it was sand at first !
negative	maybe the packaging wasn_'_t quite right as i was expecting a box , but they shouldn_'_t be handling things bad in the first place !
negative	surpirsed they are still in business based on these reviews !
negative	so hopefully , i can get a new puppy cake mix !
negative	can '_t wait_until viovet change their delivery service !
negative	cash0phones is a company that you shouldn_'_t really trust .
negative	they make you believe that they will pay a decent price for your mobile but instead and by the time they have the device in their hands they make a counter offer to you which is 0 / 0 of the original price and at that point there is no going back unless you pay them £ 0 . 00 for your phone to come back to you !
negative	it '_s a win_win_situation for them and i just wonder_how the authorities allow such an immoral business practice .
negative	i recycled many mobiles in the past with different companies and i never had come_accross something like that .
negative	this is unacceptable and the public should be protected .
negative	we visited our local_store and ordered a fridge_freezer which we were assured would be in stock on 00 july and delivered the following week .
negative	by 00 july we had received no word so my wife phoned customer_services .
negative	it took many minutes for there to be any reply and eventually she spoke to a man who could find no trace of our order . after some time he decided to transfer us to the branch .
negative	they quickly found the order but said it would now be in store on 0 / 00 august .
negative	the call lasted 00_minutes ( most of the time with customer_services ) .
negative	on 0 august we received a call and it was arranged the delivery would take place on sunday august 00 .
negative	the following_day we received a phone_call saying delivery would be between 0 and 0 and someone would ring 00_minutes before delivery sunday_afternoon arrived and along came a white van which turned_out to be our delivery .
negative	there had been no phone_call and the fridge_freezer was left in the middle of our storeroom complete with packaging despite our invoice stating that it would be unpacked and all packaging removed . we sent an_email to curry '_s and their response was to tell us to phone customer_services and arrange for the packaging to be uplifted .
negative	we emailed back stating we were not prepared to make another long phone_call and that they call us .
negative	this they did and a day was arranged for the uplift .
negative	we duly placed all the packaging on the pavement on the day requested but no uplift .
negative	we eventually took the packaging 00 miles to a recycling centre .
negative	a few_days_later we received a phone message_saying that they had called as arranged but could find no trace of the packaging .
negative	strange they did not see fit to knock on our door as we were at home all that day !
negative	!
negative	the irony is that another fridge_freezer was offered for delivery after this .
negative	episode 0 we ordered a tablet online and received an_email_saying it would be delivered on or before 00 september .
negative	on 00 september we received a further email_stating " due to unforseen circumstances you may not receive the order within the stated timescale ....".
negative	; on 00 september we called into the local_branch who were unable to help us although they had the tablet in stock .
negative	i asked if they would give me one from their stock but that was not possible .
negative	they could sell me one but not at the internet price , i cancelled my order that same day but not until 00 september was a refund confirmed .
negative	episode 0 - i bought an ipad on november 00 and received an_email_confirming i could pick_up the item at the local_branch after an_hour .
negative	this was in the evening so i called into the branch the next_day only to be told they had none in stock .
negative	because of an error the one on display had been recorded as stock .
negative	no alternative was offered so we left .
negative	i was so disgruntled by this i sent an_email to the ceo outlining these cases on 00 november .
negative	i then sent him a reminder on the 00th .
negative	i received a phone_call on 00 november from tom who assured me they were taking action to prevent these issues occurring again and it was unreasonable to expect the ceo of a multi million pound company to respond !
negative	he offered me £_00 which he then raised to £_00 .. due to all the inconvenience and costs we incurred i declined his derisory offer .
negative	all i want is an ipad which surely should not be too difficult for this " multi - million company " to provide !
negative	the real irony is that a friend did warn us not to use curry '_s , i wish we had taken the advice !
negative	!
negative	i order for the first time from this company on the 0th_feb_0000 .
negative	it clearly_states that the vast_majority of our customers orders reach them within 0 days but allow 00 days for delivery .
negative	today 00 feb_0000 i rang this company to see why my order had not been delivered .
negative	after a 00 minute delay of waiting for an operator .
negative	i was cut_off .
negative	then when i finally got through a guy said he was unable to deal with my issue and put me through to someone_else .
negative	i was told because this product had been so popular there had been a delay and in fact the order had been dispatched today and would be with me in a week as it was coming from holland .
negative	no email to advise of a delay .
negative	goodbye healthspan you will not get another order from me .
negative	<<<<<<<<<<<<<< update >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
negative	................................... 00 / 0 / 00 ...........................................
negative	a bit of hope for you all
negative	just to update you all these_clowns have just refunded me in full
negative	damon the stress you have put all these_people including myself under i hope you have plenty of sleepless nights in the cells
negative	warning do not use this company they took £_000 from me and never sent my order
negative	they don_’ t reply to any emails at all , i have reported these to south end trading_standards and consumer direct these are getting investigated now by outside forces
negative	you have been_warned do not deal with these_cowboys
negative	sent in a customer request 0 day ago , my wife & daughter , were booked into days hotel on the 0th & 0th while i was undergoing a major cancer surgery , the hospital move my operation date to 00th & 00th_may , rang hotel they could not help as it was booked through alpharoom , rang alpharooms , the girl was not interested and told me to make a costomer service request , which i did for the both bookings .
negative	0th & 0th have passed and alpharooms have still not addressed this request ..
negative	arrived in tenerife followed the instructions given .
negative	no sign of taxi .
negative	asked police , information and other_vendors in the airport but no joy .
negative	spoke to the company providing the taxi on behalf of resorthoppa only to be told they stopped doing_business with resorthoppa 0 months_ago yet resorthoppa took money out of my account 0 days ago .
negative	we were left high and dry and ended_up an_hour of messing_about having to sort our own transport out which funnily_enough was cheaper_than what resorthoppa was charging for the same service .
negative	contacted resorthoppa who appeared to be blissfully unaware that the company they had alleged to have instructed to pick us up stopped doing_business with them 0 months_ago .
negative	the woman at resorthoppa stated she would speak to the director however i am yet to hear_anything nor have i been refunded - yet .
negative	be very wary about paying a company up front for these sorts of services especially when they rely_on a third_party .
negative	i ordered product from easygates and the delivery was fine .
negative	i have had the gate arms 00 months and have a major problem , in that the arm casing has broken ( 0yr warrantry ).
negative	these arms were replacements for the same arms , ordered from easygates 0 ( ish ) years previously .
negative	i have emailed them and they say that the arm has broken due to improper installation - when they were installed in the exact_same geometry as the ones that were there previously !
negative	they have been very slow in responding to my email contact and are being less_than helpful in assisting me .
negative	beware purchasing from them if you may need help after they have your money .
negative	having received the response below , i am staggered !
negative	i only entered a review on trustpilot , out of desperation at not having received a response from easygates , to my email .
negative	i havd tried to call them several_times on saturday_morning ( as i have today at 0 . 00pm ) but simply get a constant unanswered ringing .
negative	for them to reply to my review - yet still not respond to my email , is simply unbeleivable to me .
negative	with regard to my having bough a spare - i purchased two complete swinging gate arms ( seperately ) which cost £_000 each - not what i would call a " spare_part ".
negative	with regard to how the casing broke , i have suggested to them that there are a number of ways this could have happened - not least sub_standard metals used in the manufacture - or a fault in the manufacturing process - to which they have not replied .
negative	as these two arms were fitted to the exact_same fitting points that the previous two arms were fitted ( they lasted for 0 - 0 years ) then one would assume if the fitting is incorrect , then the previous arms should have broken !!
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t realy want to have a public conversation - so can someone from easygates please call me as i have gates that don_'_t open !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	yes i got tablets for my poor cat mac , he is very nervous and eating himself and his fur , but sadly the tablets i purchased form this site just didn_'_t work in fact since taking them he has almost stopped eating ,
negative	i ordered 0 chairs and paid in full on april 00th 0000 and the delivery date has changed 0times now due for delivery in may valerie what happened to your assurance that after 0 delivery failures you said you contacted the factory and they would definitely be delivered in jan_0000 the most_recent delivery time was week_commencing 00 april i contacted infurn last_week and was told the chairs were on schedule for delivery as planned however i checked the website and see delivery has changed to may 00 this is completely_unacceptable it will be 00 months since i placed my order i have commenced legal_action now as i doubt i will ever see the chairs it is illegal under european law what is going on in this company my money should be refunded immediately
negative	new review
negative	i now see my chairs are not due for delivery until march having received assurance they would arrive in january it will be nearly a full year since i placed my order and have had the delivery time changed 0 times this is unacceptable i have contacted the bank and my laywer there is no point valerie in contacting me unless you have a definite date for delivery or assurance of full_refund in the next week
negative	i placed an order for 0 grant featherson chairs on 00april and paid 000 . 00 euro delivery expected august when it came near to delivery time it was pushed forward to october 0 th and yet again when it came to near delivery time it was pushed forward again to december this is completely_unacceptable i have made numerous_calls and received calls from people who just sit at a desk and don_'_t know anything about company where the warehouse is based or who the manager of the company is i asked all these questions and was told the supervised would contact me heard_nothing since i just want to know where my chairs are and when they will be delivered someone must know that truthful answer i have commenced legal proceedings through european circles to prevent this company from trading they are not open honest and transparent just let me know where my chairs are and don_'_t get a guy sitting at a desk who hasn_'_t a clue to call me i want to speak to someone who will tell the truth
negative	i am yet another innocent customer who was drawn in by the false_advertising of this company .
negative	again goods instock ( supposedly ), delivery promised in 0 - 0 days , no answers to e_- mail and no answer to telephone_calls .
negative	i have now involved my credit_card company but this unfortunately can take months !
negative	!
negative	i presummed this was a genuine website ( so have thousands of others it appears ) it was only by not recieving any response to my e_- mails after 0 days and being met by a never ending engaged tone or ringing tone on the customer service contact number that i suspected fraudulent activity .
negative	there is a saying that what goes around comes around i sincerely_hope the cockney tossers who own this business get there come uppance given all the inconvenience so many genuine customers have suffered at the hands of these fraudsters .
negative	always mess up my monthly repeat order .
negative	customer service is terrible , they never know anything and are not prepared to chase up an order or find its whereabouts .
negative	emails_informing of pending delivery are few and far between .
negative	if i were a company i would never use them .
negative	i had two bedrooms fitted last_week .
negative	so much of it was dented , scratched , chipped etc so even before it was fitted i was told a french_polisher would be out to rectify .
negative	that was just the start of the problems though .
negative	now both rooms are finished i have two a0 pages of things which are wrong ranging from a top not being square on the chest of drawers to a shelf which was supposed to pull out being fixed as static .
negative	worse still i complained a week ago and the only response i have received so far is an_email to say if i don_'_t receive a response in 00 working_days that i can phone them .
negative	it '_s amazing to see hammonds response to another_reviewer that should would receive a response within 00_hours !
negative	my solicitors are being instructed today so fingers_crossed this can be resolved .
negative	in my view hammonds charge top prices for inferior quality goods .
negative	( canada ) my purchase : £_00 . 00 + £_00 . 00 for shipping cost by air service .
negative	they apologize for the delays , cannot supply the tacking number , try to save time and propose to refund .
negative	maybe they have not in stock items bought and make the customer wait .
negative	i am extremely disappointed .
negative	i received neither the refund nor the parcel .
negative	i was stolen .
negative	i shall say it to all those who intend to buy on - line at funkymoose uk .
negative	i purchased on november 00th .
negative	now , january 0th , always nothing received ( no refund no parcel ).
negative	they said me that the refund has_been processed december 00th .
negative	source : canadian and american quotation on the on - line purchases .
negative	firstly let me say the transaction was superb , my new dji000 naza lite quadcopter arrived quickly and they changed an incorrect item without_question .
negative	i had read some very positive_reviews of the company but they were quite old and i can only assume that now they ' re on the crest of the multirotor wave , they can '_t cope and the customer service has suffered .
negative	i assembled the kit and , when i couldn_'_t get it running tried to get help .
negative	they are very reluctant to talk to you on the phone and eventually harvey sent me an_email with a sheet of settings .
negative	he also said i should download naza assistant v0 . 00 .
negative	this wasted a day because i later found that the model i bought won_'_t use this version .
negative	i '_ve now managed to get most of the settings working myself and today tried to get a bit of final telephone help .
negative	i was astounded at the offhand manner with which i was treated .
negative	the lady on the phone said i shouldn_'_t really have bought a kit if i didn_'_t know what i was doing !
negative	she also said that harvey was with a customer who was spending thousands , so couldn_'_t be disturbed and that i should send an_email .
negative	he didn_'_t reply to the last one so i thought it was pointless .
negative	the icing on the cake was when john ( the director ) said that if it wasn_'_t working properly then it was due to my lack of experience , because they ' d set_up hundreds of them and had no trouble .
negative	basically , you get a sheet of settings and then you ' re on your_own .
negative	if it doesn_'_t work it '_s your fault .
negative	the conclusion of this is that i am deeply dissatisfied with the treatment i have received , i can '_t remember when i have experienced_such arrogance and poor customer service .
negative	if you are starting on this exciting new hobby then i would strongly_advise going elsewhere if you are likely to need after_sales advice .
negative	i ' m an experienced electronic engineer , designing medical equipment for the international space station , so it '_s not as if i ' m without relevant knowledge !
negative	i think argus_car_hire is a scam company .
negative	we booked our car_hire with plenty of room for our_luggage ( argus actually states people and luggage capacity on their website ) and paid .
negative	when we arrived in florida to collect our car , they said that what we had paid for was a much smaller car and would not hold the luggage we had .
negative	we confirmed that we did in fact pay for the right size stated on argus ' website , but they were not having any of it .
negative	in order to proceed getting the size we had originally paid for , we would have to pay extra .
negative	we were completely at a loss as to what to do , especially with the time difference , we could not phone argus up and explain the situation .
negative	anyway we paid the extra , which turned_out double what we paid for the car originally and we decided to take it up with argus when we arrived back .
negative	it took them ages to respond and when they did , all they said was we had upgraded .
negative	we did not upgrade !
negative	we appealed the decision but still nothing .
negative	so , it is either argus who are not describing the size of vehicle properly or it is alamo in florida who say you have undersized just to get you to pay extra , both mis_- advertising .
negative	either way it is extremely bad business and in my eyes its a scam .
negative	it is a terrible thing to have to go through this at the start of your holiday and we had not budgeted for this extra , so it had to come out of our spending money .
negative	as i hire_cars when i go away , i will never , ever consider_using this company again and i will tell as many people as possible to do the same .
negative	bestilte for 00 dage siden et lydkort .
negative	fik hurtigt en ordrebekræftigelse samt en mail om at betalingen var godkendt , min ordre stod nu som " pending ", disse mail er modtaget samme dag som_jeg bestilte varen , der skulle være på lager med levering 0 - 0 dage iflg .
negative	deres hjemmeside .
negative	siden har prøvet at ringe og skrive mail til dem flere gange , men har ingen respons fået overhovedet , så nu skal jeg i banken og spærre betalingen .
negative	synes det_er under al kritik ....

negative	it would appear that when my cousin unwrapped her flowers , she was , to say the least very disappointed - i had up graded the order too - so i am very , very upset and since she has tried to contact serenata , she has_been met with unacceptable communication and very unhelpful customer service personnel - she has tried to complain on my behalf , but has_been met with insolent and rude_conduct on the part of their staff .
negative	the first lot of flowers that i ordered from serenata she was so pleased with , but after this experience - i will not be using them again !!!
negative	i will be taking this further with serenata as i believe i should be given a full_refund otherwise i will be contacting " which " who originally recommended this company .
negative	:(
negative	i '_ve ordered tyres through blackcircles for more than 00 years and for a variety of our family '_s cars .
negative	mostly , they '_ve been efficient and cheap .
negative	but twice now , i '_ve had damage to the wheels of my porsche .
negative	once by a general garage in leeds and again recently by a mickey_mouse , country garage in somerset more noted for its restoration of old sunbeam cars than tyre_fitting .
negative	and therein lies the problem .
negative	when blackcircles uses experienced tyre_fitters they are very good , but unfortunately , the quality of workmanship can be very different with some of their less able fitting partners .
negative	you have been_warned
negative	my husband took out contracts on 0 phones in june .
negative	one , the samsung_galaxy_s0 mini , was for me , and it came with a 0 year_warranty .
negative	in december it started_playing up , either switching off at random or freezing when the only option was to remove the battery .
negative	i took it back to cpw who sent it to their repair_centre .
negative	it was returned last_week with a report stating that because it had water_damage it was not covered by the guarantee , and my only option was to purchase a new one .
negative	this was not entirely a surprise to me , not because the phone had ever been near any water and had not been carefully looked after , but because after sending it back to cpw i had looked at some of their reviews and feedback and found that " water ingress " is their favourite way of getting out of honouring guarantees .
negative	the staff in the shop could not care_less so i shall use another phone with my sim_card and not give them any more of my money .
negative	i also have a contract for a phone i got for my mum which is due for renewal , they phoned me today to try to sell me a new contract but obviously i will be looking elsewhere , so that '_s 0 customers they have lost ( husband won_'_t use them again either ).
negative	some of the worst customer service i have ever come_across .
negative	only gave one star as you have to enter something !
negative	i bought a battery from ebatterys aka ocean electrical .
negative	they use a uk domain_name but are based in china - at_least that is where my battery came from .
negative	they sent a battery which purported to fit my computer on their ad but it didn_'_t and was in fact a different one altogether to what i ordered .
negative	.
negative	when i contacted them they said they would give a refund if i sent it back at my expense .
negative	i pointed_out the mistake was theirs but they aren_'_t having any of it .
negative	then i saw feedback on a couple of web_pages from people who had returned batteries and heard no more .
negative	hope i can save others from losing good money .
negative	i bought a replacement from amazon and wish i ' d gone there in the first place .
negative	we bought a washing_machine from this company after_reading the product description and believing it would fit into our new_kitchen .
negative	when we tried to install it we found the depth was considerable more than stated on the website ( the drum sticks out quite a way )
negative	we emailed 000 .
negative	they didn_'_t reply .
negative	eventually we reached them by phone and asked if we could exchange it for another machine which would fit .
negative	they refused , even_though the replacement would have cost us £_000 more .
negative	they won_'_t give us a full_refund either and say we ' d have to lose 00_% of the purchase price .
negative	ordered my glasses , they came and were lovely .
negative	however they did not have a wide field of variofocal vision as their website claims .
negative	the viewing area was about 0mm at the bottom .
negative	the website claims show this as being about an inch .
negative	they were actually the narrowest field of variofocal i have ever_experienced .
negative	i sent them back the same day .
negative	seven weeks_later after numerous_emails and phone_calls , i still have no refund .
negative	once you '_ve ordered and paid you have to go to the banks or courts to get your money back .
negative	avoid like the plague !
negative	i '_ve had to go to my bank and register a dispute .
negative	the banks response ?
negative	this is a very dodgy retailer !
negative	that says it all really .
negative	don_'_t go there !
negative	ordered 0 tallboys from bedroom_furniture world on 00th_march still_waiting for them 0th_april 00 days_later even allowing for bank_holidays delivery is a joke .
negative	emailed the company on 00th_march asking where delivery was they replied_saying it would be delivered now after easter .
negative	used their tracking_system to find out delivery company used would be xdp derby .
negative	item finally reached derby apparently on 0th_april when it was apparently put out for delivery .
negative	derby depot apparently put the items out for delivery on 0th_april and apparently put a card through the door .
negative	they apparently were going to deliver it yesterday pm slot despite waiting in again guess_what its still not here .
negative	i use the word apparently a lot here because its a bit of a guessing game as at no point have i been emailed or texted or rang to say the delivery is on its way .
negative	off my own back i have attempted to contact the derby depot this alone is a joke .
negative	the depots landline_number is actually a voicemail for a mobile number .
negative	i have rung this number left numerous messages and only twice been rung back .
negative	i have been given excuses like they have a backlog , the driver isnt answering his phone , the drivers are behind because they cant go out until the hub arrives ?
negative	!!!!
negative	i phoned bedroom_furniture world yesterday after waiting in a queue for ages finally spoke to someone who said the item was definately out for delivery yesterday pm .
negative	well it never arrived .
negative	the xdp depot also state a card was put through my door on 0th_april well it most definately was not .
negative	at the time it was apparently carded on 0th_april at 00 . 00 my husband was in the house .!!!
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted with the apalling service i couldnt recommend to anyone .
negative	i have lost money on phonecalls and time waiting in for a delivery that never arrives
negative	dear prachi , i have already complained on your website on the same day i left the review .
negative	today i have received a mobile_phone answer phone message to say that the van that was delivering my items broke_down on friday another excuse !
negative	the van with my furniture is apparently at the garage being fixed and i may !!!!
negative	get it delivered tomorrow !!
negative	i wonder_if i am to put my life on hold just in case i may receive the items ?
negative	i also wonder what state the items may be in if they ever arrive having been out on the van for 0 days and now at the garage .
negative	my order no by the way is the one sent already to your website .
negative	i shall e_mail your site again to say that this must be escalated to senior level as it is beyond a joke .
negative	thankyou
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00 definately wouldnt use this company again shocking customer service !!!!!!.
negative	the only way to contact customer service is to sit in a telephone queue for approx 00_mins or e_mail them and expect a rubbish response in a couple of days .
negative	they are fond of posting a response on here that looks_like they are going to do something about it but then they dont .
negative	i eventually received my furniture after all this time .
negative	as soon as it reached my door i had to turn it away as the furniture was broken !!!!
negative	i then e_mailed world_stores to complain again .
negative	i asked for a refund which they are supposedly doing although it hadnt reached my card yet .
negative	despite me asking for some senior response to my complaints they seem to have ignored this all together all they did was send a brief e_mail apologising for my experience and stating they would refund to my card .
negative	so no response as to what they thought of it all , no response from senior_management by way of apology .
negative	so its seems their management arent really interested in customer service .
negative	what does this tell you ??
negative	rubbish company
negative	ordered some bedroom_furniture through bedroom world on 00th_march items still not arrived 00 / 00 / 00 !!
negative	items apparently arrived at depot in derby on on the 0th_april and was apparently put out for delivery on the same day .
negative	i say apparently because i had no phonecalls to say the delivery was coming out to me .
negative	the xdp website then shows as carded at 0 . 00 pm .
negative	this is a complete lie no card was put through our door and neither was any attempt made to deliver the items .
negative	on the 0th the item was put out for a pm delivery again with no contact to myself made by the company .
negative	i waited in until 0pm and guess_what the items didnt appear ?
negative	!!
negative	according to xdp website their driver must be working all night as its says its still out for delivery from yesterdays pm slot ?
negative	!!
negative	i myself have used bedroom world tracking_system and have attempted to phone the derby depot .
negative	the landline_number given diverts to a mobile voicemail .
negative	i have phoned the mobile number several_times .
negative	the majority of time it is not answered .
negative	on the odd time it has_been answered by a lady_who has told me they have been delayed because of waiting for a hub to come in so the drivers can get out , also they have a backlog and have taken on extra drivers also that the drivers dont answer their phones also promised the items would be delivered .
negative	it is an_absolute joke especially as bedroom world state you can watch a video to say how reliable their delivery is .
negative	i am disgusted with xdp and their service and not impressed with bedroom world either .
negative	my advice would be to use neither
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	items finally arrived .
negative	items damaged on arrival .
negative	had to return immediately !!!.
negative	i managed to find a number for head_office customer service .
negative	i spoke to a very helpful and polite lady_called barbara who was very kind .
negative	i have asked her to pass my complaints onto the regional manager who will address hopefully some of the issues i have had with xdp .
negative	obviously its too late for me now as i couldnt possibly face the process of going through a reorder of the item .
negative	so i have cancelled and requested a refund from world_stores who run bedstore .
negative	i am most unhappy with their customer service as well and have left them a seperate review on this site .
negative	i dont normally leave negative_reviews as things do go_wrong at times , i think i am a reasonable person but have been pushed too far on this occasion .
negative	i would also like to think by me complaining it may improve their customer service for the next person ?
negative	i can only hope so !!!!
negative	!
negative	too many_times now we '_ve bought goods from good honest traders only for them to be let_down by their choice of courier .
negative	the first parcel arrived 0 weeks late and it was thrown outside our from door , when i complained about their service to the driver he became aggressive and said i should watch myself because parcels can sometimes go missing
negative	every time since then parcels delivered to me by this company have taken a minimum of 0 weeks to arrive .
negative	it has got so bad that i now ask the people i ' m buying from if they use myhermes or not , if they do use them i politely refuse to buy from them .
negative	total_joke of a company
negative	we booked for meet and greet with gls .
negative	we called 0 mobile nos that were provided on the booking about 00_mins before we reached gatwick , but no reply on one of them .
negative	the other mobile was switched off !.
negative	this was between 0 . 00 and 0am .
negative	i had called one of the nos about 0 days before , and he had told me to call him about 00_mins before i get to the airport and they will pick_up the car .
negative	i must have made over 00 calls in total .
negative	talk about stress_free parking !
negative	we waited around .. spoke to all the wardens and other meet and greets no one heard of them ..
negative	we had to park in the short_stay as we were getting late .
negative	we had to pay £_000 for 0 days .
negative	i have asked to be compensated with the refund of the booking , short_stay chages and compensation for the stress it caursed me and my family .
negative	they are not prepared to refund the short_stay car_parking charges as they say they contacted us - which is a lie !
negative	i can get a proof of the calls made and received from my phone .
negative	now lets_see what happens : (
negative	this was at gatwick not at heathrow .
negative	got a reply from the company and they just come up with lies after lies , saying now that he was waiting for us before we even called him !
negative	now he can read our minds !
negative	!
negative	sent and faxed more security confirmation information than requested and still opodo couldn_'_t deliver .
negative	completely unhelpful line staff and managers - i wouldn_'_t recommend this lot to anyone .
negative	shame there isn_'_t a zero star_rating !
negative	lovely hotel great staff smashing food so whats missing ....... ah yes the generator that will keep you up all night with the drone and whine
negative	so i was told matainance is not the priority
negative	no sleep at this place ... yes you can get your money back but i could have slept in the car and got more sleep
negative	i purchased an item from lindy . uk and completed the transaction , including the credit_card approval .
negative	then a few_days_later i was then informed that the item couldn_'_t be sent to south_africa and i should get the item from lindy international .
negative	the item wasn_'_t available on lindy international .
negative	i have been a registered lindy client for ages and lindy know my home address so i can '_t understand_why i wasn_'_t informed as i attempted to complete the transaction .
negative	i have completely given up dealing_with maplin .
negative	i used to use them as an_emergency supplier for the small_quantities of particular values of components i need for development work .
negative	i don_'_t any more .
negative	their prices are ridiculous , and their sales staff don_'_t know or care about the things they ' re meant to be selling .
negative	their stock is invariably at variance with the data on their computer ( in every branch i '_ve ever been in to ).
negative	i '_ve given up trying to buy anything from them - even in dire emergency .
negative	i can get all the components that maplin sell at less_than 0 / 00th of the maplin price by shopping elsewhere .
negative	that '_s for small_quantities .
negative	when i want to bulk - buy , maplin are often 000 times more_expensive !
negative	please avoid at all costs !
negative	the sooner this company dies off the better for everyone .
negative	please boycott them and shop elsewhere .
negative	virgin took over our local cable tv network from telewest .
negative	telewest were just short of completely hopeless , but virgin actually manage to be worse !
negative	they claim that they can provide a " 00 mb / s " service .
negative	they can '_t .
negative	it '_s seriously restricted at peak periods , and never achieves the speeds they claim at any time .
negative	worse yet , they have arbitrarily applied download limits ( that are never consistent ), and when their random restrictions kick in , the speed is reduced to 0 / 00th of the maximum that you can get ( which is never as advertised ).
negative	their advertising is probably fraudulent - they fail to mention their random restrictions or that their network never really achieves the advertised speeds .
negative	they are also spectacularly expensive for a poor service .
negative	it is not a fibre - optic network ( as widely advertised ) - bits of it may be , but most of it is the cheapest , nastiest coaxial cable that they could find , and is rapidly rotting , giving all_sorts of intermittent faults and random reductions in their already compromised data rates .
negative	i gave up after the eighth or ninth major outage .
negative	vm '_s " customer service " assumes that the customer is clueless , and lies to their customers by telling them that there '_s " nothing wrong ", or " it '_s your fault - your computer must be faulty ", usually refusing to progress faults because " nobody_else in your street has complained "!
negative	back when this network was run by cable camden , the uptake in the neighbourhood was 00 %.
negative	their service wasn_'_t perfect , but at_least they didn_'_t lie to their customers !
negative	since the various changes of ownership , less_than 00_% of the households around here remain connected to the abysmal cable " service ".
negative	if i could rate them with 0_stars , i would !
negative	bad management , giving out spurious delivery information , out of date working practises , bargain_basement infrastructure , high staff turn over , cutting own throat with internet parcel firms as customers , and the majority of staff not caring a toss possibly make them the worst courier firm in the world
negative	vodaphone are bunch of thieves that can not be trusted their broadband coverage and customer_services are rubbish .
negative	do not enter in a dodgy contract with them as they do not negotiate and will set their debt bully boys on you .
negative	without a doubt the worst company i have had the misfortune to deal with .
negative	a month to receive an sd_card is crazy .
negative	i doubt i would have received it then without numerous_emails and a threat to cancel my order .
negative	believe me , you do not want to deal with this company .
negative	bought a deal on solar garden lights 00 in total for £_00 - 00 .
negative	saving over £_00 - 00 according to wowcher , however when i checked on the suppliers website ( kingfisher ) these '' expensive '' solar_lights were actually 00p ....... yes 00pence each if bought direct !!!
negative	so my wowcher '' deal '' was not a deal at all .
negative	i have already redeemed the wowcher but not yet received the goods so i emailed them telling them to cancel the order and refund me .
negative	surprise_surprise no reply at all .
negative	lucky i paid via_paypal i have asked them to step in and refund me .
negative	so as they say buyer_beware if it seems too good to be true ...
negative	it probably is !
negative	wont deal with them again custermer service would have been zero_stars
negative	phones were lost in the post , they refused to do anything about it , then 0 months later they found phones which had by this point been broken so i recieved 00 pounds less_than i should have !
negative	will never be using this site again and customer service was a joke .
negative	yes i had proof of posting etc they just refused to assume responsibility .
negative	ordered a samsung phone , order accepted but remained at that status for ages , then order being prepared for ages .
negative	very difficult to get through to customer service , 00mins on hold .
negative	most emails did not get a reply .
negative	excuses when you could get through were lots of orders for the same phone , however , stock level showed at 00 for most of the period .
negative	they were polite .
negative	emailed to cancel , and that process did happen , and the credit_card has_been refunded ( 0 weeks after order placed ).
negative	if you are not in a rush , might be worth the risk , but vb need to be more honest about their delivery status and stock_levels .
negative	buyer_beware !!
negative	!
negative	the mattress was good but the bed that we bought with it was rubbish , the slats broke and fell out when we wanted a refund they only gave us £_00 although we paid £_000 .
negative	do not buy this bed , no compansation even although they agreed the bed was faulty
negative	i tried these_guys once , fortunately paying through paypal so did not have trouble getting a refund .
negative	i have tried again as they have stuff i want .
negative	again they have debited my paypal_account immediately and my order now shows " awaiting picking ".
negative	not sure at this stage if this order will work .
negative	will update .
negative	however , do not attempt to purchase from them unless through paypal / credit_card or some other means of getting your money back .
negative	i did not receive what i ordered for a long time .
negative	i sent 0 - 0 emails asking where the product was .
negative	now , over a month after my bank card has_been debited , i telephone to find that my order has " been lost in the post ".
negative	in addition , the company is awaiting delivery of my item and will not despatch for a further week !
negative	i cannot understand_why the company has never responded to my emails - and when i telephoned i got through to something like a call_centre who could not actually do anything .
negative	i do not rate this company in terms of efficiency but cannot , as yet , comment on their product .
negative	update 00 weeks on from wrens response below :
negative	we are still_waiting for a larder door to be delivered and installed .
negative	i did speak to chris baker the area_manager , but he was unhelpful , failed to take_responsibility and also failed to call back .
negative	i believe that my original review below failed to make clear how endemic the poor management and customer service at wren is .
negative	we have purchased at_least 00 kitchens in the last 00 years .
negative	we have had a few problems and been frustrated at times , but these issues were always resolved quickly .
negative	wren is by far the worst kitchen company we have ever had the misfortune to deal with .
negative	they have had at_least seven attempts to get our order right , but we are still 0 items away from a complete kitchen .
negative	we do not know if we will ever get a complete kitchen .
negative	the account manager has_been disinterested and does not even bother calling back .
negative	the store manager is ineffective .
negative	he is unable to organise , or expedite anything .
negative	he has no_idea what is going on and hides behind that as an excuse .
negative	the area_manager is even worse .
negative	he takes no responsibility what so ever and is completely ineffective .
negative	this company is absolutely_useless at communication and customer service .
negative	it now looks_like the wait for the doors will extend to three or four months .
negative	we ordered the kitchen a couple of months in advance this would not happen if they had proper systems and procedures in place .
negative	wren give the impression that this is business as usual for them .
negative	if you don_'_t mind your kitchen being unusable for three_months , by all means buy from wren .
negative	if you want a professional service , then look_elsewhere .
negative	update_: it looks_like the years interest free credit will have run out by the time we have a complete kitchen .
negative	buy your somewhere_else !
negative	!
negative	please ignore wrens reply below - it just did not happen !
negative	!
negative	ordered 0 lights , so far have received only two good lights and six damaged lights .
negative	have spent over an_hour at a time trying to get through to their customer service line , but there is no customer service .
negative	i have reported this by email , but they do not bother to reply .
negative	there seem to be far too many reviewers reporting the same experience .
negative	look at the huge number of appalling reviews for this company and make up your_own mind as to their true level of customer service .
negative	my advice - for now , avoid this company at all costs .
negative	wait to see if the company either improves its service to , or fails .
negative	forgot to add that i also cut my hand on one of the broken lights - they do not bother to pack them properly .
negative	ps .
negative	i tried the [_private data ] phone number mentioned below , but it has_been deactivated now . hardly surprising .
negative	i ordered flowers for my daughter for her_birthday and while they did arrive on time when she told me the vase i had paid nearly_£ 0 for was plastic i was not impressed and when she shown me the picture of the flowers my heart_sank .
negative	i will not be using this company again
negative	returned jacket for replacement didn_'_t get confirmation had to ring to find out status .
negative	when replacement would be dispatched they couldnt tell me so i asked for a refund instead i am still_waiting .
negative	unacceptable
negative	this company offered the cheaper price by about £_00 .
negative	i took a gamble and placed an order .
negative	it was downhill from that point on !
negative	the item was quoted as ' in stock ' with delivery ' in three days '.
negative	it took almost two months to be delivered .
negative	note - there is no telephone_number to contact and eqnuire about an order .
negative	there is no address to write to .
negative	there is an e_- mail address , but a complete_waste of time as they don_'_t answer it .
negative	i wrote perhaps 00 or 00 e_- mails asking for the whereabouts of my purchase .
negative	no replies .
negative	please do not buy from this company .
negative	it just isn_'_t worth the risk .
negative	what if something_goes_wrong ?
negative	the item is faulty ?
negative	you can '_t contact them !
negative	completely useless .
negative	i would much rather have spent an extra £_00 and bought from a reputable company .
negative	i also wish i had paid more heed to the other reviews i have now seen on the web .
negative	only bad_reviews everywhere .
negative	faulty items .
negative	incorrect items .
negative	lost items .
negative	unable to contact them .
negative	unable to obtain refunds .
negative	they shouldn_'_t be allowed to carry on business .
negative	do not buy from them !
negative	item collected from basildon tues 00rd apr 0000 00 : 00 and arrived at hatfield terminal mon_00th apr 0000 00 : 00 - 0 days to travel 00 + miles ( about an_hour ), presumably the plants stayed in the truck over easter_weekend .
negative	as it has now 000 approx miles to travel ( without accounting for more depots stops ).
negative	000 / 00x0 = 00 days to delivery - shall not be happy if they are only fit for compost heap .
negative	ironically the plants are coming from a company called gardening_express !
negative	!.
negative	yodel tracking does say ' we are sorry , but it appears ?
negative	your parcel has_been delayed '
negative	whilst this website seems to have mostly favourable reviews same cannot be said for all web review_sites .
negative	will comment further on delivery .
negative	i had a three year contract with vodafone and not once did they treat me like a valued_customer until my contract was up , then they pestered me constantly with quite rubbish offers .
negative	when i started the contract i attempted to have my existing number transferred over to vodafone but after two_weeks it wasn_'_t done so i settled for another number .
negative	when i switched to another server i attempted to have my number switched over to my new server but vodafone has not done this and it has_been a month !
negative	i '_ve been without a mobile number for one month !
negative	i begrudge even giving them one star !
negative	i '_ve bought two phones from them .
negative	one for a three year contract and one for a pay as you go .
negative	there were problems with both .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again .
negative	ebay has a dismissive and very ignorant policy against its sellers and encourages buyers to act in horrendous ways by instilling them with all the power .
negative	i began to sell on amazon and quickly became frustrated with the allocated postage_costs on books which does not take into_consideration different_sizes and weights .
negative	this made me have to cancel two sales transactions of a large and heavy book and a five disc and booklet of a music cd box set .
negative	until the company deals with this complexity in a fair manner towards the seller i won_'_t be using it again .
negative	i used to website to book a holiday to kreta last_year .
negative	we got to the airport , were looking_forward to the holiday and - boom .
negative	the flight was changed to one day earlier - but they didnt feel the need to give us this information .
negative	i am still struggling with them to get my money back - even if this wouldn_'_t make up the dissapointment they caused us by this spoiled holiday .
negative	will not use this site again !
negative	i bought an ipod dock from superfi that had to be returned under_warranty .
negative	over a prolonged period trying to get the item repaired or replaced , the staff have been evasive & rude .
negative	i have made several visits & phone_calls to the shop and have not had a single call back .
negative	never have they taken any responsibility for the situation , blaming in turn the supplier , someone_else in the shop and sometimes even me ..
negative	truly awful customer service
negative	the worst aftercare i have ever had no help what so ever happy to sell the phone and as soon as it sold they don_'_t want to know never ever will i go in the shop again
negative	my tickets for the killers at wembley this saturday arrived on wednesday , i have been trying to contact double0 ever_since their phone line does not take messages just says they are very busy and promptly hangs up .
negative	i paid £_000 + for what i thought would be 0 x £_00 . 00 face_value tickets only to receive 0 x £_00 . 00 tickets .
negative	i feel i ` ve been stitched up like a kipper with top tier tickets that should be middle or lower tier and unable to speak to anyone about it .
negative	without_doubt the worst couriers i '_ve ever had to deal with and that '_s not just one experience sadly !!
negative	!
negative	i ' d sooner not deal with a company using them rather_than have all the hassle !!!
negative	virgin please take_note , as i won_'_t be re - newing my phone with you in future if you insist on using yodel , yodel !!
negative	more like whistle for it ...
negative	well , i made the same mistake , not once , but twice , will i never learn .
negative	every time my wife or i have a new mobile from virgin , yodel never deliver when they say they will ...
negative	i will only go to a shop in future , and pick it up there and then , at_least it '_s reliable !
negative	!
negative	i went into the shop and asked if i could have glasses the same day .
negative	they said yes if they had the lenses so i asked them to check if they had them for a pair of glasses and a spare pair .
negative	they had and produced them .
negative	i chose frames then had a fitting .
negative	at this point it was getting late so i asked again if i would have my glasses the same day .
negative	they said no because the lab was closed all day .
negative	i was annoyed but agreed to let them make the glasses up for me on the following_monday and post them to me first_class .
negative	the lenses were with the frames when i left the shop .
negative	the following wednesday i rang to check they had posted the glasses to me .
negative	they said they hadn_'_t because they only had lenses to make up one pair and were waiting for lenses they had ordered for the second pair .
negative	i asked to speak to the manager and complained .
negative	they are delivering the glasses for me but if i could i would have cancelled the transaction .
negative	it is one thing to have a problem but to blatantly lie about it destroys any trust .
negative	i will never deal with specsavers again .
negative	the flowers i ordered were delivered and looked nothing like the ones i had ordered , pink not purple and just filled with cheap vegetation not flowers as they were meant to be .
negative	and then it took 0 days a 0 emails to get a reply from the company .
negative	service ... i dont think so
negative	it has_been 0 weeks since ordered 0 bottles of perfume from this company , i have contacted 0 times , and allowed extra time .
negative	yes they responded twice .
negative	once to say i am sorry etc , the other time to say when it comes if i do not want them to send back for refund .
negative	how can i send back when i still have not received them .
negative	i have contacted asking for my money back , and they fail to respond .
negative	i have not received the perfume , and it cost me £_00 . 00 i am very disapointed in this company and want a refund of my money .
negative	i would avoid this in the future as payment goes quickly , they take days to so called dispatch and i have never received the parcel .
negative	i have given this company time to respond and rectify this problem , but they have not .
negative	they have no customer service techniques which is very disapointing .
negative	if you are reading this half price perfumes , please refund me , you have no right to keep my money !
negative	i ordered supplements for my dog .. in good time before they ran_out , as i live in the country and cant get to the shops .... they have well ran_out now !!!
negative	no answer to my numerous_emails .. tried there online help service ... thats a joke ... and as for tying to get an answer on the phone ... am i sick of hearing ' i ' m sorry ' etc .... will just have to order them from elsewhere and take the financial hit .... lesson_learned .. never use this company ...
negative	i just wish i had read these reviews first ..
negative	appalling fulfilment ruins this site and i potential_customers not to use it unless you want to wait weeks for your order to arrive and be fobbed_off endlessly by their ' customer service ' team telling you that " it will be there tomorrow ".
negative	they seem to show goods as available and then order them in to satisfy your order .
negative	then they blam ' supplier problems ' for the delay .
negative	i would have thought that if it '_s howing as available on their website then it '_s in stock but apparently not .
negative	seems to be run by a bunch of amateurs .
negative	0 out of 00 as this site and electrixworld . com are not trading !
negative	fraudulent
negative	warning to people who are visiting the greek side of cyprus , this company is bringing the cars over from the turkish side , when i spoke to the police i was told this was illegal .
negative	the main problem is that not only did the car not turn_up , leaving me and my friend stranded at the airport for over 0 hours , but after e_- mailing and phoning them numerous_times they did not reply and are seemingly refusing to give me a refund .
negative	in the end me and my friend had to resort to renting a car from the airport which ended_up costing us a lot .
negative	please don_'_t trust this company it has_been over two_weeks since i last heard from them .
negative	they sent my order to a different address and when the people from where it was delivered to some what eight and half hours_later when i got the meat it had all gone and was stinking £_000 pound gone and no one is taking the blame both party '_s have aid not there fault will be seeking_legal_advice
negative	00 / 0 /_0000 well someone called yesterday and still full of rubbish but that '_s ok as i will be getting my meat from you main rivals after have a long chat with then i am very pleased
negative	so looking_forward to that
negative	i ordered online from justoffbase and although the website shows stock they did not have any and no planned stock so they refunded my money .
negative	they need to work out their stock_levels and list it live on the website to avoid further inconvenience to customers .
negative	i placed the order online with a 00 - 00 day delivery on 0th_september and on chasing the order today , which is the 00th_september i am told the sent me an e_- mail on the 0th_september advising that delivery would be 0 - 0 weeks and because they never_heard back they never did anything with the order .
negative	on checking the email address they sent it to an e_- mail address that does not exist .
negative	would you not phone the client if you never received a response .... very poor !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a go kart from join0buy on 0th_september for £_000 . 00 with a delivery date of 00 to 00 days .
negative	no delivery received .
negative	i contacted the company on 0st november for an update on delivery as it was due for delivery to be told they were not able to get hold of the go kart so they would refund my money .
negative	then they had the cheek to tell me it would be 00 days for the refund .
negative	they have already had my money for over 00 days and now i am having to battle to get it back .
negative	i did not cancel the order you breached the contract by failing to provide the goods .
negative	i want my money back .
negative	i am still_waiting for the refund and have had to go through my credit_card company to try and get my money back do not give this company your business you will be disappointed !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered an office , they took my money quickly and gave me a date of 00th_october to have room ready for their fitter .
negative	last_week they phoned to say their fitter paul would be with us on monday 00th and make_sure room is completely cleared .
negative	0000hrs monday no sign of fitter or furniture , rang customer_services who rang paul and informed me that paul had not been told of my job and that there had been a communications breakdown and they would look into it .
negative	0000 no call from customer_services so rang them again still no resolution .
negative	also tweeted @ richard hammonds and no reply from him either !
negative	late_afternoon and we now have a fitting date of tomorrow and wednesday but it took a lot of explaining the hassle that we had clearing a room into the rest of the house and taking 0 days leave to be here when they decided to come originally and failed .
negative	we wait but any joy has now gone as can we really trust them to do a good job ?
negative	well after 0 days fitting my 0 day job they have left site with a string of issues still to be sorted_out some small but some completely_unacceptable .
negative	the printer cupboard should have 0 sliding shelves as stated on their design diagram , it has none .
negative	there are 0 cable hole covers missing , they have made an access hole in one unit to allow access to a power socket and have cut it with wavy sides just like an diy person might do , there is most of a large bar_code label still stuck onto the front of a cupboard , one screw has_been screwed in and split the veneer .
negative	there are other issues other than these and the whole_experience has turned from a joyous expectation to a depressing experience and both of us feel very down and not only that but we still cannot get our house back in order because we are now waiting for a solution , the company promised to get back to us today and fix a date for resolution work , surprise_surprise no call by 0000hrs .
negative	during friday we received an_apology for not getting back on thursday and told that a senior technician would be with us between noon and 0pm this thursday to finish installation and rectify issues .
negative	the senior technician arrived on the day stated and rectified approximately half of the 00 + issues leaving us now waiting for the french_polisher to be appointed to maybe finish the job fully .
negative	initial date when i contacted customer_services to ask how much longer we were expected to live with 0 of our 0 bedrooms and living_room full up with items from the office area , not unreasonable as so far our 0 day job has taken 0 weeks and living in this mess is very depressing especially when you read their brochure about their craftsmen taking pride in their work etc .
negative	we feel that so far we have paid more than enough for their below diy skilled installation !
negative	we were initially given a date of next friday for the french_polisher but after explaining once again our displeasure of living in a mess for so long already they promised to look into the diary closer , now we have got an_appointment for this monday .
negative	do these_people realise how depressing living like this is ?
negative	given that the issues quoted their expertise in their furniture should have made them realise that a french_polisher would be required , so why was one not booked to come with the senior technician ?
negative	once again ( 0rd time so far ) we have had to delay the flooring fitters , i suspect that they are starting to get fed_up with rearranging their day due to hammond '_s inabilities to complete their work .
negative	monday 00th , 0 weeks into the 0 day fit and french_polisher arrives and spends a lot of time and effort trying to fix things but despite his efforts we are still left with a door that due to it being squashed somewhen has a very noticeable damaged area and a dented cornice that any professional fitter would not have fitted in the first place so still trying to get a resolution .
negative	sent photos to their resolution team and have as yet not heard_anything other than standard we have received your message reply .
negative	wednesday 00th demand for final payment has arrived in post obviously this is being ignored until we are fully happy with the office .
negative	thursday 00th_november_0000 , 0nd french_polisher has_been and carried_out a repair to our new furniture , still have a panel that they owe us to come .
negative	is repaired new as good as perfect new and worth as much is the big question and will the repairs last ?
negative	my lawyer friend drafted a letter for me giving them until 0st december before we place a claim in a london small_claims court for breach of contract , we sent it recorded delivery but " surprisingly " they could not find the letter so had to send proof of delivery plus a copy of the documentation via_email to them as well .
negative	00th_november received text saying panel will be delivered tomorrow between 0000 and 0000hrs - do they assume we are just sitting at home waiting at their beck and call ?
negative	phoned to give times that we would be in and enquire as to how much there was outstanding to pay , as i wished to settle the final account on delivery of the panel and for some reason they were unable to tell me a figure but said that i would receive a letter with the details in and to wait_until that arrived .
negative	00th_november panel has arrived at last .
negative	awaiting decision on any compensation that they are willing to allow for the stress , inconvenience , especially arranging to be in when they wanted to turn_up , and refurbished furniture , we should have insisted all damaged parts were replaced and if the door did not match then they would have had to replace all 0 doors !
negative	do not use viagogo to sell your tickets .
negative	this is the first time i '_ve used them and i will not use them again .
negative	i had two tickets for sale for beyonce and checked back on the site after two_weeks to see if they had sold .
negative	there were no tickets listed for sale under my account so i re - listed them , this time cheaper_than before as time was running out .
negative	i had no email or text explaining why my tickets had been removed from sale .
negative	they sold for £_000 the second time i listed ( in my initial listing they would have sold for £_000 +).
negative	i posted them next_day delivery , no confirmation from viagogo that they had been received .
negative	beyonce came and went and i have just received my payment for my tickets ...£ 000 !!!
negative	this was my £_000 minus £_000 charges !
negative	i have contacted their useless customer_services asking for the charges to be refunded but they just keep sending me the same reply - its the charges from your sale which you didnt reply to which we had to find tickets for ????
negative	i '_ve explained that i havent a clue what they are on about but they aren_'_t interested .
negative	they are based in switzerland , have no telephone_numbers so obviously think they are outside all consumer_law .
negative	if you use these - dont expect to see good money for for tickets or any money at all !
negative	i cancelled an order 0 hour after_placing it .
negative	they still sent the item 0 days_later , numerous_calls / emails later they arranged collection but said i had to pay all carriage costs .
negative	they then denied having received item back .
negative	only after complaints to trading_standards and isis did i get a full_refund 0 weeksl later . they do not answer phone_calls or phone back when they say they will , only because i persisted did i get the refund .
negative	would never use again .
negative	i have never received the inks that i ordered and paid for , although i was informed by e_- mail that my goods were in th post . still unable to contact the company .
negative	i ordered a few_days ago keeps stating order initiated not heard_anything regarding payment_plan etc very frustrating
negative	paid for items 00st_december for delivery mid january .
negative	goods didn_'_t arrive so emailed them to be told delivery now 0st march .
negative	once again no goods and then told over the phone deliver end of march .
negative	i have now cancelled order as they have had my money for over 0 weeks .
negative	no correspondence from them at any stage of this saga and no apology just some rubbish about chinese new year .
negative	they should not be taking customers money , making promises that the delivery date would not be changed again only to let you down once more .
negative	will never shop_here again .
negative	interesting enough it seems to me most reviews on here are by people who have only written one review in the past .
negative	wish i had noticed this before ordering .
negative	thank_you for your reply .
negative	i have never received any emails saying i would have to wait 0 months or that the delivery date had changed 0 times .
negative	i understand that you have had supply problems but the chinese new year has not lasted for three two months plus .
negative	thank_you for the refund .
negative	i have ordered elsewhere and they are arriving tomorrow .
negative	just so disappointed i have waited all this time and given you the benefit of the doubt .
negative	goods not received .
negative	rang twice and told it was going out today .
negative	ended_up cancelling order .
negative	no communication received from them .
negative	no apology and their attitude is one of couldn_'_t care_less .
negative	keeping my fingers_crossed where my refund is concerned .
negative	would not shop_here again .
negative	this company will not make it in the internet_shopping world with this level of service .
negative	shop elsewhere .
negative	even_though i provided all the requested information i have still not received my cash_back from october_0000 .
negative	no reply to my further emails .
negative	case is still pending on top cash_back as they havent heard_anything from go electrical .
negative	this company should not advertise on cash_back web_sites if they have not intention of paying .
negative	wish i had read this review site before dealing_with this company .
negative	i will not bore readers with all the details as its pretty_much what previous reviews have said .
negative	all i will add is that returns are not £ 0 . 00 .
negative	their returns_label does not include postage_costs so you foot the bill .
negative	plus they deduct the £ 0 . 00 from your refund even_though i sent proof of postage .
negative	in total it cost me £_00 . 00 in postage to send back poor quality dresses .
negative	i would give no stars to this company if possible as their customer service is awful , they ignore your questions and queries and only answer what suits them .
negative	no phone number which is very convenient for them , although i guess you would never get through with the number of complaints they must receive .
negative	i have sent 0 emails and am awaiting a reply , which i suspect i either wont get or they will ignore the content .
negative	i will be reporting this company to trading_standards as very false_advertising and statements are made on their web_site .
negative	do not buy from this company as you will regret it .
negative	dont order flowers from serenta go to your local supermarket you would get better flowers for less money there
negative	i could cut costs and run this company better if i was company director
negative	what an embarrassing low quality service .
negative	smashed screens were insured , but refused to compensate saying items not packed properly , had to sue them via court before they paid up before meeting the judge .
negative	hundreds of unnecessary numbers for diff departments and they cant seem to put you through .
negative	terrible pricing data spread over unintelligible sheets with unusual formatting , same with ridiculous invoices .
negative	just a bad bad_experience , and i have used them regularly for a good few_years to know this .
negative	i ' m off after yet another failed collection .
negative	why take the order if you feel you cannot deliver ?
negative	i have had this problem twice with them .
negative	i place the order and they dont have the item in stock so they will source it for you .
negative	i was willing to wait , 0 week , then two_weeks .. was told it will arrive by a certain date when i queried .
negative	still , no delivery but the usual update message " will be slightly_delayed with shipment till ..."
negative	in 0000 it is unacceptable for a company in the channel to take money off a customer promise delivery and miss that schedule by 0 weeks .
negative	surely you could have sourced that item in 0 weeks ?
negative	oh_yes they could have , but they dont care to because clearly im not a priority .
negative	or they cant source it below the price they offered it to me at .
negative	will not use them again .
negative	they had their chance .
negative	they should never have taken my money or promised to supply it .
negative	so we get their guy out to visit for an easy sale as mum needed blinds for her new apartment , and we were recommended the firm by the new building manager .. ( bad mistake ).
negative	he comes in to measure up and price .. they then called me to take deposit and so we thought things were rolling .
negative	0 weeks passes by , nothing .
negative	another week passes by and nothing .. so i call to investigate and was advised that actually the blinds have not been ordered .
negative	so i ask them why , only to be told that the person who came out wasnt the right person to take the measurements ?
negative	apparently he was only there to give a rough estimate and that the proper measurements will need to be taken ?
negative	incredulous at the incompetence and lack of willingness to be orderly i had to insist on cancelling the order and that my payment be returned immediately .
negative	im speechless at such incompetence after they took a hefty deposit and " ran " ater taking my money .
negative	i had to call to understand the items were not in stock !!
negative	that they were to be delivered next week , from 0rd_party who " had them in stock " but with no guarantee they wouldbe despatched today !
negative	utter madness , purchase cancelled never again wasted 0 week for system upgrade .
negative	after being informed that my delivery would be with me between 0 & 0 on a monday , which in my opinion is unacceptable in this day and age to expect the customer to hang_around all day , regardless of work commitment , to await a delivery which does not materialise , i waited until the thursday , when a battered and water damaged item arrived , i received no communication whatsoever from uk mail to advise me of even what day my parcel was arriving , the item after being dropped several_times by a driver who was very rude arrived damaged and had to be sent back , this being the 0nd damaged item i have received via this courier firm , not impressed in the least with this company
negative	suite à un vol annulé reporté au lendemain , impossibilité de récupérer le véhicule réglé 0 mois auparavant .
negative	et oui , vous comprendrez bien , après l ' heure c ' est plus l ' heure !!
negative	!
negative	a celà , pas de possibilité d ' avoir un contact téléphonique , ni de retour au formulaire mail sur leur site !
negative	quant aux relations avec le prestataire avis , lamentables : contacts désagréables , mises en attente à plusieurs reprises , refus sans considération de_la situation ...
negative	conclusion : arnaque assurée ; a eviter si on veut des vacances sans soucis
negative	merci à l ' inconnu qui ne nous a pas abandonnés à 0h00 du matin dans un aéroport sur_le point de fermer ( aéroport de funchal à madère le 00 mars )
negative	been in o0 shop today at blackpool worst service ever .
negative	trying 0 cancel my contract which is up this month jan , stupid people .
negative	endid u sending me a pay and go sim .
negative	why would i want one of those .
negative	i would not recommed them 0 anyone .
negative	the only reason i got o0 in first place was shawn bean .
negative	lol .
negative	i had a repeat order for dog_food that was " guaranteed " fixed price and free_p_&_p for life of the order , in place since may 0000 .
negative	had no issues , although sometimes a little_slow with delivery , until today , out of the blue , they have decided to discontinue all brands of dog_food except their own_brand and they expect me to buy that instead !
negative	aint gonna happen .
negative	my wife enquired_about talk talks deal on their phone , internet and tv packages for her farther , the sales girl quoted free for the first three_months ( payment of line_rental only ) and if they signed_up today the cost after 0 months would be £_00 . 00 including line_rental and they would provide an engineer free of charge .
negative	i thought this is a good deal and decided to contact them to enquire_about the same deal for ourselves .
negative	the salesman seemed surprised when i explained the deal my wife was offered by
negative	another sales adviser , he was insistent that no such deal was available , i asked to speak to the manager and asked him to listen to the recorded conversation , he firstly looked on their system and
negative	informed me that my farther in laws details were on their system however no such deal had been recorded .
negative	to make_matters worse there was no apology , my conclusion was that this companies sales advisers cannot be trusted , so i decided not to pursue my interest further and told the manager to delete my
negative	farther in laws details from their system and not to proceed with this enquiry .
negative	when sold eye cataract surgery was told i would not need glasses , my eyesight has improved only slightly and i keep going back and complaining and just get fobbed_off with excusess the latest thing is giving me some glasses to wear .
negative	on my last visit i was told i have too high an expectation £ 0000 for a slight improvement and still need glasses i dont think so .
negative	0 monthes since operation unlikely its going to improve .
negative	regards
negative	john_lewis
negative	ps my sister angela lewis wants the operation what do you think i should say to her ?
negative	update to this review
negative	yesterday the 00th of may 0000 i had another appointment with a optomerist who said nothing can be done but he will make an_appointment for me to see the surgeon who performed the operation he also said my eyesight had greatly improved which is a lie these_people fob you off with excuses and try to make you believe your imagining things .
negative	i put on my old specs and guess_what i could see perfect and without glasses i get ghosting i also get wicked dry eye '_s i told this to the optomerist and he said thats just because he had been messing_around with my eye '_s .
negative	i really wish i never had this done
negative	i have used ryanair twice and on both_occasions i found the service to be unacceptable even for a bargain airline .
negative	once i took my bike with me for which i paid twice as much as for my flight , but they treated me like i was some sort of parasite .
negative	i got no help whatsoever , the desk person was extremely rude , i had to find the man to do the outsize check in and find out where to take the bike afterwards .
negative	compare this to jet0 who are always welcoming and polite and make the experience easier .
negative	it usually costs me about an extra £_00 - 00 pounds to use another airline - well_worth it .
negative	i ordered goods 0 weeks_ago .
negative	they have taken the money from my credit_card account but so far i have received nothing .
negative	not even an_email to say what has happened .
negative	website has no phone number to contact , email gets an auto response .
negative	still hoping to get the goods , but not counting on it .
negative	never use again .
negative	will report to trading_standards if i don_'_t get something from them soon .
negative	on 0 june i purchased 00 tickets from viagogo for a concert at somerset house on 00 july for a total_cost of £_000 . 00 .
negative	not sure what the mark up on the face_value was but probably substantial .
negative	on 00 july ( ie the day before the concert ) " diego " from viagogo telephoned to apologise and say that they would not be able to supply me with the tickets .
negative	huh ?
negative	a huge disappointment and inconvenience for me and the 0 friends and work_colleagues i had invited to the concert .
negative	please do not be_fooled by viagogo '_s claim that they give a 000_% guarantee .
negative	they do not guarantee that they will supply you with tickets .
negative	only that they will try to get you tickets and if they fail to do so they may give you your money back .
negative	eric baker you fat greedy fraud - one day you will pay the price for your crimes .
negative	numbergroup '_s t &_cs say that " at_least thirty ( 00 ) days notice will be given prior to suspension for non - payment " but in my case they cut_off my business lines on february 00th after one ( 0 ) days notice for a bill that had been due for payment ( they allege ) within 00 days of february 0st ( previous invoices had allowed 00 days to pay ).
negative	does that look like 00 days notice prior to suspension to anyone ?
negative	the functionality of the web_site is good , but the customer service ( and the abilty to add up !)
negative	are from the dark_ages .
negative	i ordered self_assembly guest beds .
negative	goods delivered ok
negative	when unpacked 0 item missing
negative	when constructing found that 0 piece had been incorrectly drilled and was unable to continue .
negative	called customer_services held on for 00_minutes , finally hang up without and answer at the cost of £ 0 : 00 .
negative	e_mailed customer_services explaining the position and asked them to call me back .
negative	they sent me an e_mail stating that their spares team will contact me within 00_hours but i ' m not at all confident that this will happen , i ' m_sure that i will be calling them .
negative	i find that the product is of poor quality and their customer_services are very inefficient compared to other on line companies .
negative	i suggest that argos follow the example of other on line companies e . g .
negative	pine_solutions , appliances on lines and , bath store for proactive customer_services and efficiency .
negative	booked car for our trip to be collected at cape_town airport , collected car & drove to hotel .
negative	next time we used car was to go into cape_town & that '_s when problem_arose .
negative	we completed our business & went back to car which would not start at all .
negative	phoned dollar / thrifty to report problem , they came back & said they ' re sending replacement car .
negative	the replacement car took more than an_hour to get to us , we had to pay extra for parking & when car arrived the tank was not full as they had driven from the airport to cape_town , speedo reading showed more than 00kms driven .
negative	returned car on the due date with a full_tank of petrol .
negative	car checked & agreed that there would be no further charges for us .
negative	on checking credit_card statement we now find that an additional fee of r000 . 00 for petrol has_been charged .
negative	i have registered a dispute with my bank & now wait for outcome .

negative	they sold a laptop to my friend who is blind , he had special software to help him use the machine until the hard_disk died .
negative	although the laptop had on site warranty , they refused to send someone out .
negative	the asked him to dismantle the laptop ( something most people with full vision would struggle with ) to check the hard_disk , when told he was blind they still refused to honour the onsite warranty until this proceedure had been carried_out
negative	bought 0 items from amazon over 0 days , the delivery companies they use govern when or if we receive the item , home delivery network are a useless buch of scruffy oiks that lie on the delivery sheet , turn_up if an when they feel like it , and faced with a 000mtr dive up the lane to my house would rather mark the item undeliverable and send it back .
negative	amazon issues a refund then emails you to say if you still want the item then you have to re - order it .... hello muppets >>>> thats_why i ordered it in the first place .... wont order from amazon again as if i order on line i expect it to be delivered
negative	i did order with another on line shop and had it delivered next_day
negative	should have a negative star system one star is far too generous for these amazonian muppets
negative	bought two_sets of decals one set was fine , the other were clearly ancient stock , with a white residue on the printing and signs of water_damage .
negative	emailed hannants requesting return and refund , and was completely_ignored .
negative	after a couple of email '_s i gave up and reclaimed the money through paypal .
negative	they ignored paypal too , so ( eventually ) i got the refund under paypal '_s default system .
negative	clearly these_people are happy to send out rubbish and ignore any complaints in the hope that people will give up .
negative	i certainly won_'_t use them again .
negative	i advise you not to as well , and i have forwarded all the emails to their local tso for their consideration
negative	this company have wrecked my home .
negative	had windows fitted in february , they turned_up and put lots of dust sheets down which i thought was good .
negative	what i found afterwards was they shook them out in the rooms we had crap everywhere .
negative	the fitter then ask us to sing some paper_work tell us that it was the delivery note for the windows that needed signing on 0 form as there was no carbon copy 0 form was placed over the first with just the signature line showing .
negative	what we signed was a satisfaction form to say we were satisfied with the job .
negative	at this point we had not looked at any widows other than the one in the kitchen where we were stood this looked good from the inside and the fitter told us he would be back the next_day to finish of around windows with some trim which he did not have on van .
negative	at this point it was starting to get dark so we thanks and off he went .
negative	this is when we found all the crap spread over the rest of the house along with mastic spread all over the frames and window revels .
negative	it took me and my wife nearly 0 hours to clean up .
negative	the next_day we looked outside what a " f *** ing mess .
negative	there was mastic all over the bricks around windows it looked like he had removed the nozzle from the gun and spread it around with a trowel .
negative	we are now trying to get it resolved they have so far sent 0 different fitter '_s around but neither of them were prepared to try and put this right in the time they had .
negative	after sending a email to the ceo and sending copies of complaints letters to them via recorded delivery we had a visit from a manager , who has agreed to replace 0 window with a new one take out another one and refit correctly and clean off some of the mastic .
negative	we have a date for this for 00 may , 0 months after the first installation .
negative	will up date this after this date .
negative	sent my blackberry after they quoted £_00 . 00 on website , emailed me back with revised offer of £_00 . 00 due to excessive_wear & tear ( it was in perfect_condition ).
negative	had to pay £ 0 . 00 to get my phone back , then sent to mazuma who paid £_00 . 00 same day they got it .
negative	my advice don_'_t go near !!!!
negative	!
negative	this company promises every but delivers on nothing . order placed 00th_january with a 0 to 0 day delivery , but after waiting for over a month ( with usual long list of excuse e_- mail ) i cancelled this order their response was this dear customer , dated 0th_march

negative	to - date 00th_march they still have not refunded the money ( 000 . 00 )
negative	do not deal with them they are acting like a company in trouble
negative	sent iphone and payment and then heard_nothing for the best part of 0 weeks .
negative	no replies to my phone_calls or emails , of which i made or sent many .
negative	phone came back today ( not repaired ) via_royal_mail - thank_you for that .
negative	no work completed but payment still processed by rotten apples .
negative	now taking steps through trading_standards to report the fraud and claiming via credit_card company .
negative	please beware .
negative	three_weeks before moving_house i emailed fu ( perfectly named ) to advise them that i would be sending them a final reading .
negative	on the due date i did this but heard_nothing .
negative	eight emails and three phone_calls later they have still not managed to send a final_bill , let_alone credit me with £_000 that they owe me .
negative	i have of course received an estimated_bill reducing my credit by £_00 for a month i have not lived in the house .
negative	i am so frustrated by their useless customer service who cannot deal with the problem or send any kind of specific reply to emails .
negative	i can see that i shall have to sue them for the credit as they clearly have no_intention of accepting the fact that i have moved_house nor that i am owed money .
negative	do not get involved with company - they are thieves and should not be allowed to remain in business .
negative	after 0 weeks has elapsed from the beginning of your complaint , you should contact ofgem with all available evidence .
negative	it is unlikely that they will do anything being useless too , but at_least it logs into the statistical volume of complaints about these rogue companies .
negative	we ordered a leather sofas which was delivered on time .
negative	sadly one of the delivery_men managed to smash a picture on the wall .
negative	he promised that laura ashley would pay for it and took photos as evidence .
negative	00 days_later a claim form arrived asking for two repair estimates which we sent immediately .
negative	after several phone_calls , they claimed that they never received the form and asked for a copy which was sent recorded delivery .
negative	however despite another letter promising to pay followed_by five phone_calls to customer service and more recorded delivery letters , we cannot obtain a reply .
negative	it is now 0 months since delivery .
negative	i guess a solicitors letter is now the next option and / or a claim through the small_claims court .
negative	also it is time that watchdog took a serious look at the appalling stories .
negative	please read this honest account of my problems
negative	after checking out previous reviews and visiting the showroom we decided to go to one place to order everything as being disabled my hubby thought it would be easier although somethings were more_expensive despite_being on sale ...
negative	how wrong can you be or am i just very unlucky ?
negative	paid extra on top of delivery charges for delivery on a certain day because we were going away while bathroom being done with me being disabled .
negative	day 0 - half the order arrived and one pallet was damaged - and had been cobbled together with odds pieces of wood and huge nails sticking out - all the items were damaged very noticeably .
negative	why did it leave the warehouse in that condition ?
negative	after numerous phone_calls which nobody returned despite promising an_hour ... eventually ( after having to scan in my delivery note copy re damaged and missing items and email it to prove it as delivery company said nothing reported !)
negative	the rest of order and replacements items were sorted_out in the nick of time and promised next_day ... items delivered seemed okay except one item missing - nothing important just the shower_cubicle
negative	next_day after phone_calls again the shower_cubicle arrived - on a pallet huge and secured - on my own and disabled and driver left it on pallet ( just like other goods ) on my front - no noticeable damage at this time .
negative	had to go away - fitter found a hole in bottom of shower_cubicle box when he lifted it off the pallet with glass pieces trickling out - photographed it and rang and to ask about returning easy plumb tray - told to ring back monday - went through rigmoroll again and eventually the following friday another cubicle delivered .
negative	all this and on top not been able to return the easy plumb kit for a refund that was not used but we did not know until too late because of delays caused by the company .
negative	all in all a thoroughly horrendous experience .
negative	company did agree to a short_term credit_note to exchange the easy plumb kit but seeing as they do not have much to exchange for having purchased everything else i needed am a bit stuck and credit will only last a couple of weeks provided i can get it back to the warehouse within a deadline ...
negative	the customer service lady was quite good but no - one else has_been in touch and i have been told policy is policy ....
negative	i just hope to goodness we do not have any_problems with the goods once installed as it does not forebear well with the experience i have had so far .
negative	so - check everything in minute detail - record everything - and be very quick about it and make_sure you return everything broken with the driver .
negative	if you do as the company suggests and get stuff delivered before you get a date for fitting then check everything and thoroughly - do not wait for your fitter and if you are disabled then get some strong men to be there for delivery and check it for you .
negative	do not trust that the box seems okay so the goods must be !
negative	i am very very stressed about the whole_thing and i certainly cannot recommend this company .
negative	one thing broken or missing in a large order - perhaps , but not this much_trouble .
negative	addition 0 . 00 . 00
negative	another huge joke - the agreement states exchanges within 00days yet i was told a different tale when i asked about exchanging something saying i only had another 0 days for an exchange and they then only hold the credit for 0 weeks or i would lose it all , despite_being away on holiday and being disabled which is why we were going away while the bathroom was being fitted .
negative	the item was the 0nd time it was delivered ( first one broken ) and it was finally delivered again with no box within a pallet of cling filmed other goods - i was as good as called a liar by the warehouse in that they never ever send out unboxed goods when i invited him to comment on our other problems ...
negative	they never ever break anything and that my goods were never missing - nothing ever went wrong in his warehouse !
negative	please_please be aware of this disasterous company
negative	there were 0 people queing to complain when we were there and also when my fitter had to go to pick something up they never bothered to tell us was necessary he was also in a queue of complaints .
negative	when i invisted customer service agent to pass on my complaint to a manager and either speak to me or email his comments i was told
negative	" unfortunately a manger isn ’ t going to advise you any different , this is a company policy and we all abide_by the same rules ."
negative	so no - one cares at all .
negative	i have a faulty tap and no doubt i will get nowhere with that !
negative	i am very angry , very tearful and bitterely dissapointed in their disinterest and complete disregard of customer_satisfaction once your money is taken .
negative	i stayed in best western in chicago and it was awful .
negative	i complained to corporate headquarters and they were worse_than useless
negative	they kept handing it back to the hotel to deal with , if they are corporate hq the deal with complaints
negative	so be warned if you complain you will get bumped around from pillart to post !
negative	!
negative	cal themselves cheap ?
negative	?
negative	yeah till you see all the extras you get charged for !
negative	!
negative	food , luggage etc ..
negative	do not fly ryan_air , if you do it '_ll cost you more than with ba or any other company !

negative	i placed this order for a special bouquet of flowers for my mother in law for mother '_s day .
negative	the flowers should have been delivered on either saturday or sunday , as specified when choosing the option " mothers_day weekend ".
negative	unfortunately , i discovered on the following_monday , that nothing had been delivered .
negative	i immediately contacted iflorist and spoke to a customer_services rep , who could provide no explanation , no satisfactory solution to the problem .
negative	the date for delivery had apparently been set for several_years previously , and the rep implied that the error must have been caused by user fault with my laptop date being incorrect .
negative	i looked into the date issue and it is not possible to choose any date other than in the future .
negative	the rep seemed clueless and so i insisted on speaking to the customer_services manager .
negative	i was told the manager was not at work , so i asked for someone senior to contact me back within an_hour .
negative	0 hours_later , i telephoned again - nobody senior available yet again - i was promised that someone would call back that same day ,
negative	an_hour later , calls were being directed to an answermachine message and no online_chat_facility was available either .
negative	i am beyond exasperated with iflorist .
negative	i have been completely_ignored , accused of lying , error making , disbelieved , lied to , fobbed_off and iflorist have totally failed to adhere to their contract , accept any responsibility for the blunder and have made no attempt to apologise .
negative	i have only today received a full_refund - weeks after the company failed to deliver the flowers .
negative	needless to say , i shall not be using your company again and will be ensuring family and friends are aware of my experience .
negative	as you can imagine it takes a great deal of thought about leaving a negative_review - however despite_repeated attempts to contact this company to make changes to an existing document - they made no attempt to either acknowledge or respond to our request .
negative	divorce is at best an emotionally tempestuous time , even an incredibly straight_forward one as our own , so its really disappointing to find them so unhelpful despite paying for their best service package and being promised to be fully supported throughout the process .
negative	perhaps they will respond to this note ?
negative	this product was purchased in july_0000 - i have documented proof of purchase .
negative	i booked my christmas flight at the end of may .
negative	then beginning of november i start getting emails from opodo that my flight has_been changed and i should call them .
negative	i had booked using opodo extra which means they will support you in case something_goes_wrong .
negative	but to no_avail .
negative	opodo only emails you to ask you to call them on their premium_rate number .
negative	previously when i booked with a different agent but also with ba directly they got in touch to inform me of changes .
negative	opodo extra emails do not get answered despite the promises at the time of booking and they do not call you either .
negative	in the end they called me back as i put the phone down after 0 minutes on hold and told me that i couldn_'_t fly on the day i wanted because the flight was fully booked .
negative	so they booked me on for another day only for me to see the flight that i originally wanted still available on their website .
negative	this is not my first bad_experience with opodo .
negative	in the past they refused to refund me my money , £_000 , when malev went_bust .
negative	i thought that the whole point of booking through an agent was so that your flight and money is secure but this certainly is not the case with opodo .
negative	they just take your money and are not interested further the only good thing seems to be that they call you back if you give up holding .
negative	i will not book with them again as it is the most frustrating thing ever and your flight is not guaranteed .
negative	they say they '_ve been when they havn '_t
negative	they say they will deliver and they won_'_t
negative	they promise the earth but won_'_t deliver
negative	avoid at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve read bad_reports about poor service from delivery companies before , the likes of yodel and parcel farce , but these really take the micky , if you do use them and they let you down i told you so !
negative	firstly i had to chase my order .
negative	secondly i returned my item , 0 months later i still_haven_'_t received a refund .
negative	they haven_'_t logged off my return so even_though i have proof of return i am still without a refund !!!!!!
negative	firstly i ' m told i need to make a claim from the po when it was their postage label i used then i ' m told that i should take it up with my credit_card company !!!!!
negative	what !!!!!!!
negative	are you mad !!!!!!!!
negative	any other company i have dealt_with sees a pop and promptly refunds customer !
negative	the company then takes it up with the po not the other way around !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	customer service is dire , emails aren_'_t answered , phone_calls are pretty pointless !
negative	well if this sees the light of day i '_ll be suprised but no matter the www .
negative	is a great way to air ones grievances !
negative	phoned 0 times today waited over 0 minutes each time only for someone to put down the phone at the other end !
negative	when i finally did get through i was transferred to a south african gentleman whos english was not the best he didn_'_t know or could help me with my account .
negative	i was trying to fond out why a statement was asking me go pay 00 . 00 in two days for goods ive yet to receive .
negative	he was adamant that i owed this money from a previous order even_though 00 per_cent of the order was returned over a month_ago and was showing on my account as returned .
negative	i asked to speak to a manager or a supervisor but he said there wasnt any .
negative	so after being on the phone for over 00_minutes i was still mo wiser .!

negative	i find the fact i purchased my mobile and they didnt give me my cashback i should have earnt they are obviously very decietful they promise something and give you nothing and before they try to say i didnt buy the phone i have the reciept for £_00 . 00 and the phone i will not be using this company again and will be advising friends and family against it
negative	if i could give no stars , i would .
negative	my story is very similar to paul and dawn below .
negative	i ordered on may 0nd and didn_'_t receive my summer house until july .
negative	they constantly blamed shires , who make them .
negative	mine had a b_& q sticker on it when it arrived !
negative	they told me " squires hadn_'_t picked_up the order " when i rang to ask where it was .
negative	even after that , the order wasn_'_t fed through .
negative	as they take the money the moment you make the order , i think they make their profit on the interest rather_than selling garden_buildings .
negative	when it arrived , one of the gables was damaged .
negative	i ' m trying to get hold of squires but will probably resort to getting it repaired locally .
negative	i think they assume we will give up if we get no response .
negative	it '_s all very dispiriting !
negative	city_link recently lost a consignment of ours worth over £ 0000 and when we claimed for our losses they quoted their t '_s &_c '_s and paid us a paltry £_000 in compensation .
negative	last_week a requested before 0 . 00 am delivery to our customer only left their depot at 0 . 00 am .
negative	today they were supposed deliver to a manchester city_centre office block and when the package didn_'_t arrive on time they said that they " had left next door ".
negative	lazy drivers , non_existent account managers and an impregnable phone system that can keep you on hold for up to an_hour .
negative	total rubbish .
negative	avoid at all cost .
negative	ordered an xhose through wowcher ( my first time ) didn_'_t receive wowcher code through email so i couldn_'_t redeem item which has now expired . got in touch with wowcher and they offered to credit me 00_% of the cost of the hose , where else can a company just take your money and run putting all the blame on the buyer , will_definitely not be using them again and will be advising everyone_else against using them .
negative	have used valueshop on a number of occasions over the years and always thought they were good .
negative	however , the last order i placed for ink_cartridges was handled very poorly .
negative	they sent another product with lower ink volumes and that was cheaper_than i paid for with no explanation in the package .
negative	ok everyone can make_mistakes so i e_- mailed their customer service address explaining what had happened expecting them to either send me the correct product or at_least refund the difference in cost .
negative	- no reply
negative	emailed again - still no reply !
negative	that was over two months_ago !
negative	so they appear happy to take your money but not dela with things when they go_wrong .
negative	i shall not be using them again
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	they cancelled my direct debt which they said was due to technical problems did not advise of any_problems until getting a letter asking for payment .
negative	resolved problem by making due payment but was still chased by their debt_collectors for payment which had already been made and whose non payment was the fault of talk_talk .
negative	frankly they are then worse firm i have ever_dealt_with , cannot be trusted and would advise any body not to touch these with a barge_pole .
negative	ordered a pair of alpinestars joey waterproof shoe tarmac in suede , unfortunately shiny leather arrived .
negative	they are ok but given the cost to return and the associated hassle i am better off keeping them , especially when they can '_t even be bothered to reply to my email .
negative	no way would i use this company again
negative	a very thick cast_iron manhole !!
negative	it was before parcel0go and insurance we '_ll see - not much hope .
negative	i order an ipad retina 000gb wifi and cellular on 00th_december via pay and collect ( not reserve and collect ).
negative	they took my money immediately of course .
negative	email arrived saying 0 - 0 days for delivery .
negative	no call by 00rd dec to come and collect .
negative	this was a christmas_present .
negative	rang and was advised waiting for stock and as soon as they came in they would be sent out .
negative	this prompted them to then send an_email about delayed delivery .
negative	by 0th_january still no ipad .
negative	i rang and was advised there still was no stock and did i want to cancel .
negative	i replied no i wanted my ipad .
negative	an_email was sent to advise of my concern .
negative	anyway to cut along story short , today ( 00th janaury ) they have finally admitted they have no stock and are cancelling the order and refunding my money .
negative	( they still tried to get me to cancel the order though because then they would not have been in breach of contract ) well that is simply not good enough .
negative	they have had use of my money for nearly 0 months .
negative	could you imagine if it had been the other way around ?!
negative	i have also spent hours emailing or ringing them , to say nothing of not having the use of the item !
negative	they are a complete disgrace and customer_services is a waste of space .
negative	selections took payment 00 days before delivery , and took 00 days to despatch with no notification of delay .
negative	so i have been financing their business and my apples have been rotting whilst awaiting delivery of the storage_unit .
negative	if i could rate with no stars , i would .
negative	never arrived although booked days in advance .
negative	operator that i spoke to acted as if all in a days work .
negative	pathetic , really truly pathetic .
negative	recorded conversation and shall upload to youtube .
negative	pathetic .
negative	i believe their adv .
negative	about fast delivery .
negative	0 days still_awaiting delivery .
negative	i contacted customer service 0 times as going away , very poor and useless .
negative	i have now had 0 horrid expericences .
negative	unless you pay by cash then don_'_t bother .
negative	first expericence i ordered food and restaurant was closed .
negative	paid by debit_card .
negative	no refund .
negative	complained .
negative	was told refund was £ 0 less_than i paid .
negative	instead of refunding me just eat debited my account then said they couldn_'_t actually do that .
negative	that was a complete lie because after many weeks of telephoning and emails finally my refunds were sorted .
negative	no apologies by the way .
negative	today i have guests and decided to try ordering again after many months of not trusting just eat .
negative	big_mistake !
negative	!
negative	paid by debit_card but the restaurant is too_busy .
negative	i now have no food and have to wait for a dam refund .
negative	omg !!!
negative	i want to scream out very loud .
negative	do not pay by card do not pay by card do not pay by card !
negative	now why didn_'_t i learn the first time ?
negative	needs lessons in customer_care
negative	service agents with communication difficulties
negative	fobbedoff all the time
negative	trying to speak with talk_talk customer service is like sticking needles in your_own eyes while sitting in a vat of acid .
negative	i '_ve given up and have written to the chair
negative	sir charles dunstone ,
negative	talktalk telecom group plc
negative	00 evesham street
negative	london
negative	w00 0ar
negative	and suggest you do too .
negative	this has to be the poorest delivery company to grace this planet .
negative	i ordered an item on 00th_december and got an_email to say it would be delivered to me on the 00th_december .
negative	i checked the tracking on the 00th and it had not even reached their delivery depot which was only 00 miles from their hub .
negative	i live 00 miles from the company who sent me the item .
negative	i called dpd and they said it would not be delivered until tuesday 0rd_jan no reason given .
negative	tuesday came and went with still no delivery , ok it was stormy that day so i could forgive them for that as many of the bridges were closed .
negative	however , no information sent to me whatsoever about the delivery it finally arrived wednesday at 0 : 00 pm .
negative	is it no wonder this country is going down the pan when we have to deal with incompetent companies like that .
negative	god help us .
negative	whatever you do dont use this lot
negative	ordered a laser tape_measure on 00 oct . on 00 oct i phoned for a refund as the web_site still says my item has not been fullfilled .
negative	minimum wait time is 00_minutes on the phone .
negative	there is no way to cancel an order online so phone is the only way .
negative	wae cannot tell me when the refund will be processed .
negative	" as soon as possible " the lady said - and that is all she could tell me .
negative	a good company would have sent an_email to unfullfilled customers warning them of any delays .
negative	i don_'_t know if something more sinister is occuring with this company but it only appears interested in hanging onto the money as long as possible .
negative	ryanaiir '_s motto is ' cheapest airline ' and that '_s all it is really .
negative	they have managed to remove any civility or enjoyment from flying in my opinion .
negative	i am obliged to use them for business , but i will no_longer use them for private use .
negative	in my opinion they finally have mangaged to make the whole exerience uncomportable , from booking on line with all the £ extras , restricting hold_baggage to 00kg and insisting on their cabin_crew selling cheap features and offers in flight !
negative	ryanair .... re - think please !
negative	one whole week with collection being promised every day .
negative	completely arrogant attitude form chat staff .
negative	no response to my feedback .
negative	£_00 for overnight delivery and it will now be 00 days .
negative	feedback is crucial so if my customer now leaves bad feedback , my whole business is affected .
negative	this is the second nightmare i '_ve had with them and i tried them again because the boss promised me that the poor service i had last time was unusual .
negative	i '_ve had to click 0 star but by choice i would clinck none .
negative	i thought i was doing a shrewd bit of business by not going to specsavers but how wrong i was .
negative	the glassess i ordered were fine but to be honest november order beginning of feb delivery was rubbish .
negative	i originally chased up my ordfer after waiting the required time and then asked if i could have a refund .
negative	i was told that selectspecs have no responsibility once the hong_kong order has_been shipped so no way hose for a refund .
negative	i found the attitude disgraceful and to be honest i saved a fiver and wished i had never bothered .
negative	would not recoment selectspecs to anybody .
negative	still_waiting for item 0 month of placing my order for an item that was shown as in stock .
negative	promote their buyers and sack their operations director
negative	ordered item on 00 / 0 / 00 and received it on 00 / 0 / 00 at which point i no_longer needed it .
negative	chemist_direct now refuse to refund my order and are ignoring my emails .
negative	i will never trust chemist_direct again !
negative	no stars , for a truly ' diabolical ' ' service ' ???
negative	no service at all really .. despite saying no to a 0am delivery in the first_instance , told on 0 further occasions that that would be the delivery time .
negative	this was by the ' delivery company ' used ( yodel ) who were truly atrocious .
negative	they did turn_up at 00 . 00 one morning , blocking my cul - de - sac , and , after a twenty minute ' perusal ' of paperwork , and a search of the van , told me they did not have ' my product ' ( a washing_machine ! )
negative	on their van !
negative	went back to k & co , and complained .. they said they would ' sort it out ', and asked ' when ' we would like it delivered .. we said " anytime after 00am , any day of the week " .. it turned_up , a couple of days_later , @ 00 . 00 !
negative	.. at_least they did have the washing_machine this time , and , luckily , we were in to take delivery !!
negative	.. on 0 separate_occasions ' after ' taking this delivery , we were rang up by
negative	yodel , to say that they were going to deliver it ' 0 days hence ' from the phone_call !!!
negative	...
negative	truly unbelievable , and atrocious , ' so
negative	called ' service ...
negative	absolutely appalling ...
negative	order no 000000
negative	0 weeks have passed since i posted my review and i florist have still not replied or refunded my money .
negative	take my advice go else where for flowers they are getting more and more negative_reviews and are just ignoring it .
negative	thats not a way to run a company ....
negative	i found that i was getting phone_calls from 0 different people during the day and i was confused as to who i was speaking to .
negative	then i was subjected to high_pressure_sales tactics trying to sell me goods and services which i did not need , at very imaginative prices .
negative	first i was told that my tyres were illegal because around the outer edge of two tyres the tread was less_than 0 . 0mm deep .
negative	i knew they were worn at the edge , but i also knew that the majority of the tread , within the 00_% of the width measured from the centre of the tyre was well in excess of 0 . 0mm .
negative	i had just had my tyres checked at a tyre supplier garage and they said they will need renewing in the near_future but were ok for a while yet .
negative	the legal requirements for tread depth are that the tread must be a minimum of 0 . 0mm across 00_% of the tread width so the garage was lying when they told me they would fail the mot because the outer edge ( only ) was less_than 0 . 0mm .
negative	i hate being_lied to .
negative	the garage told me that when the tyres are changed the tracking must be checked which they wanted £_00 for , plus_vat .
negative	that is another lie ; the outer treads of front_tyres wear more than the inner edges because of the extra scuffing load put on the outer edges when turning sharp corners .
negative	i had within the last_year had the tracking carried_out and i have not hit a kerb or pot hole or had any track rod ends wear so this was another lie .
negative	i hate being_lied to and i hate being told that something i can have checked free of charge will cost me £_00 .
negative	i was told that they would fail the mot test on the tyres if i did not have them changed so i agreed to pay their costs of 00_% more than i can have the work done locally for .
negative	the tyres they fitted are of an unknown make : i can get unknown makes for a great deal less_than they are charging .
negative	i hate this .
negative	i was told that the front brake_pads were worn below the legal limit .
negative	this is strange because there were no brake warning lights showing on the dashboard .
negative	as the pads have wear sensors i am left to wonder_if the sensors are faulty or the garage is once again lying to me .
negative	the garage did not return any worn parts to me .
negative	i think i must have been charged what i consider to be an excessive amount for this , because of the total that i was required to pay before i could have the car back .
negative	however i have no way of knowing because servicingstop refused to tell me what i was being charged for .
negative	i despise this and will publicise the fact as far and wide as i am able to .
negative	the manufacturer ’_s servicing book with a schedule of work required at each service was left on the passenger seat .
negative	it clearly says that the brake fluid should be changed at 0 years or 00000 miles , but apparently the garage did not consult the manufacturer ’_s servicing schedule .
negative	they told me that it needs doing because it is 0 years old with 00 , 000_miles on the clock and it would cost £_00 plus_vat .
negative	the fluid costs approximately £ 0 and i think that charging £_00 labour for a 00 minute job is excessive .
negative	in fact the fluid was two years old and they could have checked the moisture content of it as my local ford main_dealer does , and seen that it did not need changing .
negative	the windscreen washer bottle was not replenished .
negative	i added over a pint of fluid when the car was returned to me .
negative	one screen washer jet was blocked and two others partly blocked .
negative	no attempt has_been made to unblock them so i am left to do it myself .
negative	lastly in spite of my protests when i was called to say the car was ready servicingstop refused to tell me what work had been done and what i was being charged for .
negative	they said i must pay £_000 . 00 , but would not say why .
negative	i presume that they dream up a number ranging from £_000 to who_knows what and that is how they price their jobs .
negative	apparently they will send an invoice listing what was done 0 days after i have paid and the car returned .
negative	i am a gas central_heating engineer .
negative	if i come to a house and fix the boiler and ask for £_000 but i am not going to tell the customer what it is for , would they pay me ?
negative	of course they wouldn ’ t .
negative	i cannot_believe that servicingstop think this is a reasonable way to run a business .
negative	i hate to think what they are doing to other innocent customers who know little about cars .
negative	they get one star purely because - 00 stars is not an option .
negative	purchased capella bedroom_furniture on 00 / 00 /_0000 home delivery .
negative	several emails later not received confirmation for delivery .
negative	finally they found order saying it was lost in system . the day arrived , guess_what 0 wardrobes missing , several emails later again they manage to locate order . delivery date 00 / 00 /_0000 another day off work , money lost . the point being all thi hassle but i noticed they never lost the money transfer in their system . i would not buy anything from this company as the tratmment is very poor .
negative	g chester . 0 out of 00 .
negative	despite the order summary of my tablet showing a certain value , with no sign of any delivery charges , days_later i got a letter from dhl asking for £_00 !
negative	this was for importing item into uk .
negative	this was never mentioned on the order summary and is not mentioned anywhere on the shipping and delivery section of the website .
negative	i will not be using this site again as the tablet turned_out to be more_expensive than buying from a uk store .
negative	i have had many experiences of the very expensive parcelforce .
negative	all of them terrible .
negative	i '_ve watched them from my office just post a missed delivery card without even knocking the door !
negative	they claim then to have delivered the package to a local post_office , who themselves have refused the delivery !
negative	then a wild goose chase ensues with phone_calls to an_automated system , visits to post offices & parcel depots trying to find the package .
negative	hopefully now they have to answer to share holders their service will improve .
negative	if not , they won_'_t last 0 years .
negative	i use tnt , personable , reliable and reasonable_prices .
negative	ordered my camera on 00th_april expecting a dispatch within 0 - 0 business days as stated on simply_electronics website .
negative	the money (£_000 ) was taken out of my account the following_day .
negative	three_weeks_later the order is still_showing a new status with no_indication of dispatch date .
negative	my first email to them requesting an estimated dispatch received a general statement relating to problems they were having but they would do their best to dispatch as soon as possible .
negative	my second email was more specific relating to an estimated delivery but again received a response informing_me that they could not give an indication but as a gesture of goodwill they would expedite the order at no extra_cost to me .
negative	well i am glad i didn_'_t have to pay for this service since it made no difference to the order status .
negative	seeing that others had problems waiting for a refund following cancellation i decided to raise the issue with my card company and received a refund within 00_hours .
negative	they are no doubt the cheapest supplier in this market but one of the worst service providers i have come_across .
negative	their website is festooned with acceditation on service which in my case they didn_'_t live up to .
negative	if your priority is cost and you are prepared for a long wait for your goods then they may be the suppplier for you .
negative	otherwise stay_away .
negative	my son looked up the best price for his iphone_0s and this company came top .
negative	sent the phone off , and when we called them to find out what was going on , we were told it can to up to 00 days before the get a chance to looke at the phone , a few_days_later my son called again and was told the phone is know worth £_000 not the £_000 stated due to water_damage , which i find hard to beleive as the phone is only 0 months old .
negative	spoke with a lady_called raj who told me that we had to go onto the system and cancell the order , which we did , that was last tuesday , today we call them again only to be told that payment has_been sent to my account for £_000 , after a long chat raj told me that she would give me their account details so that i could put the money backm into their account .
negative	when i aske her the account number they had sent the money to see then told me it was a cheque has_been sent out .
negative	asked if i could speak to a manager and she would not put me through , asked if any body regulates them and raj refused to answer .
negative	the up shot is that my son has had phone for nearly 0 weeks and to top it all off they want £_00 of me so they can sebd the phone back .
negative	please do not use this company they are the shocking ...
negative	ordered some disco lights from a company in london that dpd collected on 0th_december that still havent arrived .
negative	received an_email yesterday informing_me that the parcel was at thier depot in birmingham along with the usual lame_excuse about the weather .
negative	its not bad for a delivery firm when you consider theyve managed to get a parcel 000_miles in nine days and still no sign of it getting here .
negative	and it was sent on thier next_day service !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	this firm would make an ideal candidate for the tv program dont get done get dom .
negative	the choice of viewing offered on the instant service is very poor indeed , netflix , although new to the uk , has more current offerings than lovefilm instant ( that i would want to watch ).
negative	lovefilm viewing window is totally rubbish , i cannot express how disappointed i was with the choice to view through a tiny little on - screen box or to go to ' full screen ' which distorted the picture so badly as to render it un - viewable !
negative	of course this was not a problem with the very latest releases , they were perfectly viewable in full screen but anything by an indie film studio or anything older than 0000 just did not work in full screen .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	the price is reasonably competitive with the other online streaming offerings available in the uk but there just is no comparison on quality , lovefilm fails and it fails on choice too .
negative	i used the above " company " as i wanted a next_day delivery .
negative	i submitted the order and within in seconds realised that the address '_s postcode was incorrect .
negative	i went back into the confirmation order page to edit this but guess_what you can only alter the first line of the address not the postcode
negative	so i immediatley sent and e_- mail giving the correct postcode only to be told ( via_email ) that i can '_t alter anything as the order had been dispatched .
negative	how crazy is that ?
negative	so now after numerous_emails back and forth i can '_t establish what address they have been delivered to - as it certainly wasn_'_t my friend .
negative	*** do not use this company they are not customer friendly **
negative	purchased a dedicated server from them £_000 for a year but paid monthly + £_00 to setup magento .
negative	magento never worked due to server not being set_up correctly .
negative	no one at easyspace understood magento and only a few about servers so after 0 - 0 months of trying to get it to work decided enough was enough and said " i am not happy with the product or support i am going to have to cancel ."
negative	was told i would still have to pay until the end of the 00 months quoting terms and conditions which i have yet to find .
negative	they are quick and helpful to sell you a product but not so helpful to support you even in the initial start up stages .
negative	avoid this company .
negative	i ordered approx £_00 goods a week ago , i noted they do not dispatch items at weekends so assumed this would be sent on monday .
negative	therefore based on 0 - 0 days delivery i should have my items , but i don_'_t .
negative	i have used chemist_direct , boots , pet at home , pets supermarket , amazon , play . com , the hut , tesco direct , wilkinsons , thortons , hotel chocolat , debenhams , marks & spencers , wallis , sports_direct , & others & received better service .
negative	superdrug get your act_together before you become the next company to bite the dust !
negative	customers vote with their feet & will shop elsewhere .
negative	this company phoned me and said they were from google and that they were phoning me as my " free year '_s google period " is expiring .
negative	i specifically_asked if they were from google and the woman said yes and that they would extend my free period by two_weeks , i didn_'_t even know i had a free period ...
negative	i find out later this is all lies .
negative	after the sales rap i told them that i would not be entering into any agreement until the end of the two_weeks so i can see if the google site had any benefits .
negative	they have not ( funnily_enough ) got a recording of this part of the conversation and nor do they have a recording of the initial call where they say they are from google , they deny they even said it , looking at previous reviews there is a pattern here as they have said the same thing to other people .
negative	they put the phone down on me when i tried to explain about this and their bullying tactics and the reviews that correspond with my report , how unprofessional .
negative	apparently they know all about the bad_reviews but keep on misleading people .
negative	anyway i have reported them to trading_standards for this and also fraud and misrepresentation .
negative	i needed to return a package to amazon for a refund and arranged for yodel to pick it up from me on a thursday .
negative	i took time off work to wait in for them and of course after waiting all day from 0am ( in retrospect just a little bit optimistic i admit ) no one showed up .
negative	i emailed them via the link on the original confirmation_email address and eventually received back a couple of apologetic replies for the apparent hitch .
negative	they told me that sometimes a van driver can be delayed and it might be as late as 0pm before anyone arrived .
negative	however in an_email from a different yodel employee i was told the latest for collections was 0pm so as far as operating times is concerned with this lot it '_s anyone '_s guess .
negative	anyway , they re - scheduled collection for the next_day and , once again i arranged time off work to wait in for them .
negative	well of course - yes you got it - no sign of any yodel ' ers all day .
negative	i emailed back the company at around 0 :_00pm to get some idea of what was happening and to get confirmation that there would definitely be a collection but this time didn_'_t receive any replies back at all .
negative	in frustration i phoned the local yodel depot and asked if they could shine any light on all of this .
negative	the assistant , whom i admit was very pleasant , asked me for my name and post_code so as to check on the status of my collection .
negative	thinking it would be more efficient if they used the customer reference_number which had been supplied in the original email , i offered that instead .
negative	" oh we can '_t use those on our system - they never worked anyway " was the reply !
negative	dear god !
negative	anyway having punched my name and address into the computer it eventually said ' no '.
negative	incredibly they could find no record of me at all .
negative	in the end i contacted amazon , explained the problem and with the help of amazon '_s customer support staff have arranged for another carrier to pick it up in a few_days time hopefully with more luck this time .
negative	i have also sent a letter to amazon asking them not to use this carrier in the future and i would suggest everyone_else with similar_experiences of this company do the same .
negative	amazon '_s business reputation is going to be tarnished by even being associated with these_cowboys .
negative	i '_ve also had similar_experiences to those mentioned by others with this company regarding deliveries .
negative	' you were out ' cards left in our underground car_park for us saying they had called and had tried to deliver a parcel when i know with absolute certainty that they didn_'_t - my door buzzer is as loud as a ww0 air raid siren .
negative	like black holes , the mere existence of this company is a complete and utter mystery to me .
negative	once anything gets sucked into it , it '_s nigh impossible to get it back out again ( that '_s the black_hole of course but you see the eerie similarity ).
negative	i purchased 0 deals from this company before_christmas and received 0 of them !
negative	i have contacted them 0 times and have yet to receive a reply , have also tried to ring them without_success .
negative	people need to be warned about this shambolic company .. will keep on at them till i either receive my goods or a full_refund
negative	my partner recently had a shocking experience with a mobile recycling " company " cash0phones
negative	i left an honest appraisal of the company on here and was shocked to find my review had been taken off as it had been reported as false .
negative	any negative 0 star reviews on this company are always reported and subsequently removed whilst the amazing but obvious false pr driven 0 star reviews are still there .
negative	it '_s a sham that a company can just report the negative_reviews and have them taken off
negative	i complained to trustpilot and they did nothing !
negative	this company is 00th out of 00 in their list of recycling firms so to have no negative_reviews showing is a farce .
negative	it '_s also eye opening that trustpilot is also bottom in the marks of their own rating comparison !
negative	trustpilot , if you want credibility then you have got to clamp down on these companies that report all their negative_reviews and post pr spun 0 line 0 star reviews .
negative	a review site is supposed to be impartial but this one isn_'_t !
negative	please_please_please do what a review site is supposed to do and show reviews good and bad - dont make it so easy to block a bad review just because a company is paying you to be on your site .
negative	for pages and pages of reviews to have been reported and subsequently removed on this one company surely shows that there is something amiss ??
negative	?
negative	i immediately realised once i ' d placed an order late last_night that i had put my own address instead of the intended recipient '_s address .
negative	i emailed straight_away and rang first thing this morning only to be told that it was not possible to amend the delivery address as the order had been processed even_though the delivery is not going to be delivered until tomorrow .
negative	no room for error and no customer service - completely unsympathetic to what was a genuine mistake that could easily have been rectified given the fact that i had realised and informed eflorist immediately .
negative	thanks a bunch .
negative	i will not be using you again .
negative	i bought a ticket to see the rolling stones in stockholm .
negative	it was easy to buy and pay for but what happened then was a disaster .
negative	first , the ticket never arrived as it was lost in transit !
negative	second , the replacement ticket ( seemingly not to the same value of the first ) turned_out to be fake and i could not get in to the concert !
negative	what with the added expense of flights , hotels etc the whole trip was a total failure .
negative	and i am still_waiting for viagogo '_s response !
negative	ps my order id was 0000000 , and the initial one was 0000000 .
negative	what a crazy carry on over a mere booking that didn_'_t work out on 00march0000 .
negative	i booked a ryanair ticket stansted to karlsruhe online through bravofly , only to receive a jumbled email the next_day saying payment had not gone_through , querying something to do with my credit_card .
negative	alarmed , i phoned my bank , to find all absolutely fine with my card .
negative	phoned bravofly : first operator could not speak_english - i asked him to repeat , and then even to spell what he was saying , but even that made no sense .
negative	i phoned back : different operator , very thick accent , he simply kept repeating my money would be returned in 00 days to my card .
negative	when i told him no money had been taken from my card , nor did i want any to be as i was cancelling , he spoke over me in a loud monotone voice , endlessly repeating " your money is freezin .
negative	money will return to you in 00 days .
negative	bank rules , not us .
negative	your money is freezin ...." on and on .
negative	i asked to be put through to a supervisor and he just kept repeating on and on over me .
negative	final phone_call to bravofy and got charming woman with good english who told me payment had never gone_through because ryanair had upped their prices and bravofly could not get ticket .
negative	i told her previous 0 operators had been disasters , and she explained they are not able to refer a caller on .
negative	presumably that is why they insult the caller by endlessly repeating the same - incorrect message at them .
negative	my conclusion ?
negative	don_'_t go near such a poorly serviced travel company whose phone operators are clearly struggling , even to find out what has happened , never mind communicate it to the customer .
negative	i booked an oil and filter_change on - line and got a booking slot for some 0 days_later , had to pay in advance for some reason , and within 0 hour was called by custmer service who said that the branch manager did not have any of that oil in stock !
negative	how can it take more than 00_hours to get some ?
negative	very poor .
negative	i have been with 000 - reg over 00 years now buying domain_names
negative	to host on my servers and not there '_s by the way .
negative	i renewed one of my domain_names
negative	on 00 mar 0000 outofthebloom . com to be precise paid in full and have a
negative	receipt for the payment .
negative	the domain is still off line while they are
negative	changing registrars is what they told me .
negative	to put insult to injury they
negative	have the domain_name pointing to a site that is ppc .
negative	i phoned them on monday 00th
negative	and was told it would be up by the thur 00 mar to confirm that they told me to look
negative	in my 000 - reg control_panel .
negative	i took a copy of the details so could show me client .
negative	i then called today to find out why it is still not showing only to be told the domain
negative	will not be up until tue 0nd_april .
negative	because i took a copy of the web_site when it was showing 00 / 0 and now 0 / 0 that now makes the
negative	domain_name that i have paid for in full will be off line for 00 days .
negative	my domain_name off line for 00 days i you cannot do nothing about it with 000 - reg .
negative	the administrative contact has also changed to @ domainbox . net by the way is a company that
negative	000 - reg recently bought .
negative	i realy had high regards for 000 - reg and recomended all my clients to them .
negative	this has totaly
negative	changed the way i feel about the company plus i have now lost a valuable client because of all this .
negative	don_’ t use 000reg .
negative	this company has lost my trust completely .
negative	try to use a direct / root registrar if at all possible .
negative	call_centre aren_'_t in touch with the products being offered and i had to instruct them where to look on their own website .
negative	despite my efforts i nearly ended_up with two phones neither of which where on the correct tariff .
negative	tip : go to carphone_warehouse and talk to a human_being .
negative	i ordered a bouquet , chocolates and a balloon for my mum .
negative	only the bouquet arrived and it was frankly rubbish .
negative	i have complained twice and am still_awaiting a response from customer service .
negative	having been a good customer for christmas and birthday cards i am very disappointed by this shoddy service .
negative	i wouldnt recommend this company .
negative	first_utility never transferred my accounts from the old supplier , yet still charged me for a whole new bill with them .
negative	i then got bills from my old electricity and gas suppliers .
negative	obviously i complained and cancelled my direct_debit with first_utility .
negative	first_utility didn ; t cancel my direct_debit though , so it went out for four months .
negative	i then tried to get a refund , they claimed they had transferred the account from the old electricity supplier , i contacted the old electricity supplier , and they said never_heard of the transfer .
negative	this is now a year later , they are still not refunding me the whole amount .
negative	as for compensation ?
negative	frustrated .
negative	the cheapness of their offers , has cost a lot .
negative	update , finally i got my full_refund + some compensation .
negative	brilliant , you might think but wait , no , a bill arrives today for an overdue energy account of £_000 . 00 , energy accounts that never existed , even a year and a half ago , when i did try to join first_utility , with all the associated trauma that went with it , unbelievable
negative	i think they are rob dogs they charge to much for using papal .. i wont have nothing paid into paypal as they want a arm & a leg for using them . no thanks
negative	my husband and i booked what was supposed to be a two week holiday in portugal , however due to thomas_cook '_s lack of attention to detail and disgraceful lack of staff knowledge , we ended_up in one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in , in spain !
negative	we '_ve fought with them for compensation since may and have finally had to admit defeat , accepting a miserly payment of £_000 for a holiday that cost us in excess of £ 0000 .
negative	this despite the fact that they fully reimbursed two ladies who went to watchdog on bbc with exactly the same issue .
negative	obviously i should have done this but i mistakenly believed that , after admitting that it was their mistake , they would treat us fairly .
negative	i have never been so wrong in my life .
negative	one thing though is certain - i will never book with them again .
negative	well what can i say , i have some late deliveries in my time but have never had to collect a parcel from a courier services depot , they had contact number if they had problems and for some strange reason couldnt even find my address and have many deliveries to this house , the worst ever courier service i have ever had a due to that will be changing the company who used them to send my items .
negative	they wernt rude to me infact couldn , t even get to speak to a human on the phone as it was automated ( wonder_why ) , im generally a placid person but this got my blood boiling , sort yourselves out !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	after having booked a holiday to florida with my daughter and 0 grandchildren to celebrate our 00th_wedding_anniversary , my husband was diagnosed with cancer i emailed the hotel to see if i could get an electric scooter delivered direct to the hotel to help him get around , the hotel was great no problem they would see to it and looked forward to seeing us in august , imagine my surprise when i got a email from the hotel to say sorry we had cancelled our booking ( we hadn_'_t ) contacted alpha_rooms who apologized and said they had changed supplier but all was now ok .
negative	emailed the hotel back and was told there is no booking for you , contacted alpha_rooms again kept on hold for over 00_minutes there is not a problem the booking is confirmed , emailed the hotel still no booking showing for us , i have rang alpha_rooms again on hold for over 00_minutes at premium_rate , i asked for a call back to confirm everything was in order sorry i have 0 customers in a queue cant call you back well sorry is not good enough i am stressed enough without all this , customer service is appalling , unable to understand the indian service advisor very broken accent , stuck as have paid money and leave in 0 weeks we just wanted a break with our family before my husbands surgery , sort your act out , you should be_ashamed of your total_lack of service , i have contacted hotel to see if we have a booking or not i am disgusted with you
negative	despite several phone_calls i am still_waiting for a printer i ordered before_christmas .
negative	three_weeks plus now .
negative	i was told that snow was to blame a week ago .
negative	but 0 ) they managed to deliver the toner .
negative	0 ) the snow was over by then .
negative	they have made no attempt to contact me with an update .
negative	no stars greenpod , i have used this compay before without_any problem for laser_printer_ink .
negative	i liked their green credentials , so last month i ordered a rainbow set of inks , paid by paypal ( thank_goodness i did ) no ink ever arrived and even after contacting the company via_email they did not respond in any positive manner .
negative	their phone no voicemail was always full so i could never leave a message .
negative	i needed the ink for my business so had to order from another supplier .
negative	fortunately , after raising the issue with paypal the payment has_been refunded .
negative	sorry greenpod , such awful service for you will mean i never order from you again .
negative	i wanted to arrange a multiple destination ( and quite costly ) trip to the usa at fairly short_notice , as my son was interested in finding out about us universities .
negative	i had pretty_much worked out what flights and train journeys we needed to book but thought i ' d just call to check if a discount would be available in recognition of the number of flights involved .
negative	i never got a straight answer to that question and that '_s when the real nightmare_began .
negative	when i received confirmation of the flight details i noticed one of the flights was booked for the wrong time and we would miss our appointment .
negative	when i called them they said they would need to check the recording of the call , which they would do very carefully .
negative	i thought that was fair_enough and was confident that everything would be sorted_out , as i knew i had been totally clear about the timings .
negative	then they told me it would take several days for them to get back to me with their findings , which meant the flight might become full in the meantime or the ticket price would increase .
negative	they said they quite understood my concern and would be prepared to change the flight to the correct time , provided i paid a change fee in advance of of £_000 which would be refunded if i was vindicated by the call recording .
negative	i reluctantly agreed , then they later called to say this would apply per person !
negative	i tried to contact them several_times afterwards but they never responded and never let me know the outcome of their investigation into the detail of the call .
negative	in fact i never_heard from them again and an entire year has now passed .
negative	their customer service is appalling , completely lacking in any sensitivity and their behaviour borders on the criminal .
negative	somehow i don_'_t think this reflects the original vision and passion with which martha lane fox established the company and i ' m_sure she would be mortified if she knew how they treat their customers today .
negative	i have used lastminute . com for the last time in my life .
negative	i wish i ' d read these reviews before placing my first ( and last !)
negative	order with this company for two ink_cartridges .
negative	with no product and no contact to tell me what was happening i ended_up called them three_times .
negative	their call_centre is so noisy you can hardly hear_anything .
negative	the first time they said they were arranging for another supplier to provide the product because they didn_'_t have it in stock .
negative	it would have been helpful to know that before i had to call in .
negative	following another couple of weeks and another unanswered email , i was told in a second call that the reason i still had no product was that the third_party supplier had failed to respond ( could they not have tried a different one ?)
negative	but they would definitely get in touch and call to update me - as if !
negative	in the third call they complained that they had been " dealing_with a backlog of orders " and were experiencing " problems with our new systems ".
negative	after nearly seven weeks they finally agreed to give me a refund which i am still_waiting with eager anticipation .
negative	their upbeat website gives the impression of a company that will deliver - and quickly .
negative	my experience was nothing of the sort because they delivered nothing whatsoever .
negative	i '_ve never had to wait that long for cartridges from anywhere_else .
negative	what a complete_waste of time and energy .
negative	we are waiting for 0 reading festival ticket which is for thursday but its tuesday and no sign of delivery .
negative	there is only an_automated voice at the end of the phone line and no reply to e_- mail , my daughter is heartbroken that her ticket doesnt look like it will arrive .
negative	why cant there be a person at the end of the line who can help us ?
negative	what can i do ?
negative	as an update viagogo phoned tonight to offer a refund as the tickets will not be delivered .
negative	we are grateful for that but now have to try to find a ticket elsewhere .
negative	i ordered a goodmans digital recorder that when it finally came i found that the remote did not work ( i tried a friends remote and found that it worked with that one ) and when i contacted the company they said that it was up to mighty_deals to sort and mighty_deals are just ignoring me .
negative	this has now been going on since october_0000 .
negative	secondly i have paid for voucher for a set of 0 swan saucepans with a 00 piece cutlery set but when i try to place my order they are trying to charge me another £_00 for the cutlery .
negative	supplier has ignored me and mighty_deals seem to be taking ages to sort this for me .
negative	i have been in touch with mighty_deals over the last month ( since 00th_march ) but so far although they have promised to send me a remote_control nothing has arrived and as far as the 00 piece cutlery set goes i have heard absolutely nothing .
negative	mighty seals are a total_rip_off
negative	as a business i would recommend that no one use carphone_warehouse for business contracts .
negative	they do not provide the same offers for businesses , yet charge more the privaledge .
negative	this company are a joke and obviously staff members write most of there reviews .
negative	had major problems with a mobile_phone , was told to return it , dpd turn_up to collect the phone , i no_longer had the box for the phone , dpd were asked if the phone was fine on its own and i got told yes .
negative	now get told by utility_warehouse that phone was broken in transit and they will not be replacing it because in there opinion i did not box the phone !!!
negative	learn something from this folks , when this company mess up they will not take responsibilty .
negative	as an ex courier when a customer hands me an item , i and the company are then responsible for that item and it is then covered by the courier insurance liability .
negative	customer loyalty mean nothing to this company even taking into account i have 0 phones from this company and pay £_00 per_month for a shit service .
negative	be aware people because i for one will be taking this to consumer advice , trading_standards and will also be letting everyone know on review_sites what this company are really like when things go_wrong .
negative	i recently had enough of intermittent internet and decided to move isp .
negative	i telephoned the number on there website which they state " if you require a mac_code please telephone ........", to be told we do not deal or issue mac codes so just tell your new provider that you do not need one .
negative	three days_later i received a termination letter telling_me that as i had applied to a new isp they would now be disconnecting my phone and broadband , even_though i am paid up to date .
negative	be very careful when moving to a new isp as this crowd dont know the meaning of the word smooth transition !!!!!!!
negative	my advice , dont go with them in the first place .
negative	i purchased a coffee and side table which took almost 0 weeks to be delivered although they took payment the minute the order was placed .
negative	on receiving both of the above after numerous call re delivery i may add , i received the goods but minus several parts to build the coffee_table with .
negative	i had to phone umpteen times only to be promised they would be sent out first_class post the following_day but to no_avail .
negative	i eventually gave up and threatened to cancel the order and request a refund and goods to be uplifted , only to be given another long_drawn out story about short staff etc and the missing_parts would yet again be sent out first_class post ..... guess_what they never arrived next_day but five days_later !
negative	had i not been out of the country this company would have had a very nasty phone_call from me and a request to uplift their goods and refund my money .
negative	i have spent extra pounds on the calls , let_alone the stress of not having the goods purchased , which i may add were not cheap .... did i receive any compensation or refund of delivery costs ?
negative	no , a follow_up call to see if missing_parts had been received ?
negative	no .
negative	i purchase a lost of goods online and i must_say this is the worst customer service i have ever had .
negative	i would stay_clear of this company and will never use them again .
negative	in january_0000 a bottle of tesco finest fresh orange juice exploded all over my kitchen within an_hour of buying it splattering the ceiling , walls , units and pile of ironing with orange juice .
negative	i claimed against tesco for redecorating and produced the offending bottle .
negative	another new bottle of which the cap was also at great risk of exploding .
negative	a set of photographs showing damage caused and a decorators quote for £_000 .
negative	on the 00th_october_0000 tesco admitted liability stating the £_000 would be in my account within ten days .
negative	by the 00th_december_0000 it still had not been paid and tesco continued to say - the payment is still being_processed .
negative	which year are they actually intending to pay the debt they owe me ?
negative	order ref_: q0000000
negative	i am still totally unsatisfied with the most dreadful service i have had from your company
negative	i still have had no clear explanation as to my last queries regarding my non delivery .
negative	it was the right address
negative	i was not informed that it was the wrong_address , i was informed that there was a delivery hitch your end and you would retry the following_day ... why would you state to do that ?
negative	why for 0 weeks did the tracking of my order status state left base out for delivery .
negative	the response links you send do not work on email only on an iphone .
negative	the flowers i received from mrs kohberger on the thursday to my address only lasted 0 days before they died .
negative	i will_continue to spread the word to friends and colleagues via trust_pilot and facebook of how dreadful your company is unless i receive a refund out of sheer politeness on a customer service level for the dreadful communication i have endured .
negative	to make_matters worse i receive emails daily from a lily calyx trying to sell stunning bouquets ... what a joke .
negative	regards

negative	had 0 different experiences with collectplus - alas , both extremely poor .
negative	a ) someone sent a parcel to my local collect_+ shop - it arrived quickly and i got an_email to say it had been dropped_off .
negative	luckily i went to the shop later that day , as the parcel had been put in the pile to be returned to sender !
negative	!
negative	b ) i sent a parcel to a company on an industrial estate in glasgow on 00th_may - i booked it online and dropped it off at a collectplus shop .
negative	they tried delivering it 0 times between 00th_may and 00th_may - tracking shows that they cannot find the address .
negative	they never thought to look up the company on the internet , or contact me for instructions .
negative	luckily i thought to see if it had been delivered today ( 00rd may ) - phoned the contact centre and they could not tell me where the parcel was being returned to and asked me where i asked for it to be returned to when i booked it - despite there being nowhere on the website to enter this information that i can find !
negative	the contact centre said they never contact the sender if there is a problem but sit on it until either the sender or recipient contact them .
negative	appalling service on both_occasions .
negative	one star but should be less !
negative	this must be one of the worse companies out there .
negative	i ordered a pair of boots which were " in stock " two days_later i get an_email_saying they are refunding as they are out of stock and my money will be refunded in three days , so what with the weekend this gives them and interest free loan for a week .
negative	i emailed them as they still show as being in stock and they offer me 00_%_off my next purchase of non sale stock .
negative	and still they show as i ' m writing this as being in stock .
negative	do not order from here it is all an excuse to expand their data base and spam you !
negative	i just had my licence renewal through ,,, it seems the bbc in an effort to save_money will no_longer be sending out tv licences ,, they just keep on record the fact you have paid ,, now that is the ultimate in bad customer service ,,
negative	i thought it was expensive before when i got just a piece of paper for £_000 ,, now it seems i will no_longer get the piece of paper ,
negative	does anyone know a way of getting round the system of licences ?
negative	?
negative	we bought tachodisc software and installed it on a pc which unfortunately died ,
negative	tachodisc will not re - licence the software even_though it is being installed on the same computer with a new hard_drive ,,, they insist we buy the software again ,, i seriously doubt that is going to happen
negative	order placed around 00 . 00pm gmt
negative	time now 00 . 00pm gmt
negative	after about 00_minutes waiting sent ticket to support
negative	took 0 hour to answer the ticket .
negative	send this for security was the responce .
negative	no problem sent 0 hours ago .
negative	still no key
negative	porque sera uma propaganda enganosa no site tem a foto do mesmo quando comprei meu fone ( 000 ) 000 0000 0000

negative	juno mark items as dispatched on 00hr delivery , you take day off to wait for delivery only to find out the item wasn_'_t actually dispatched .
negative	stop deceiving customers with false information .
negative	the item is now too late for an event .
negative	ruined my day juno .
negative	bad customer service .
negative	they dont reply to your emails either .
negative	i booked the wrong date thanks to a confusing web_site and when i called to explain .
negative	i was told sorry nothing we can do .
negative	so money down the drain
negative	customers beware .
negative	people rely_on being_able to get hold of me - today '_s and friday '_s network and website outages are terrible .
negative	hours of call and text outage is almost_unheard of these days .
negative	giffgaff need a more resilient model and should think about whether their model is capable of offering a professional , resilient service .
negative	i ' m leaving for one of the major providers .
negative	the only smooth part of the whole_transaction was the efficient transfer of money from my account to theirs .
negative	ordered ( and paid ) for tickets 0 months prior to the concert and i had to chase them all the way right up to the day of the concert to find where the tickets where .
negative	a believe me they do not make it easy to contact them .
negative	in the end they told ( not asked ) me to collect the tickets from the venue .
negative	when i got to the venue they knew that ticketweb had sold a number of tickets but had not been told who had what seats despite_emailing them for the information .
negative	out of frustration i asked ticketweb if they would be refunding the ' delivery ' cost considering they did not deliver them and i collected them and was told ' unfortunately , we are unable to refund your handling as the collection charge is the same cost as the delivery charge '.
negative	so be warned the service charge is a levy applied for the privilege of receiving such a sterling ' customer service experience '.
negative	i ordered a bag from website that implied it was in stock .
negative	it wasn_'_t and would take 0 - 0 weeks to deliver .
negative	they then took a few_days to reply to my e_- mail about an_alternative .
negative	this was also available on the website but i then had an e_- mail back to say this was not in stock and would take 0 - 0 weeks to deliver .
negative	i have subsequently asked for my money back which again has not had a reply .
negative	absolutely abysmal service , communication and overall experience .
negative	after i rejected bozowi '_s new offer , which suddenly was a lot lower_than first agreed for my iphone ,( basically they changed their offer once they had my phone ).
negative	i wrote a review sharing my concerns .
negative	bozowi did not like this and so they have threatened to sue me and have kept my phone and refused to respond to my emails .
negative	why you ask ?
negative	simple , i refused to allow them to rip me off !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i have informed trading_standards and bbc_watchdog .
negative	use bozowi at your_own peril ........... you have been_warned !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	avoid auracall as their landline deal is terrible value .
negative	they have it in the small_print that their option 0 only allows 000 inclusive call minutes .
negative	yet their website misleads you by comparing their prices with bt and talktalk who allow unlimited minutes in their call allowance .
negative	they start charging for their call package even before your line is switched to them !
negative	customer service chooses to answer or not emails .
negative	they answer easy emails and ignore difficult ones !
negative	my order was delivered with drooping flowers , buds that were going brown and a pathetic number of flowers that were bulked out with loads of branches .
negative	if you dare to complain , they won_'_t believe you unless you email photos as proof .
negative	unfortunately my 00 year_old mother is not tech - savvy so customer ' service ' refused to take any further action .
negative	do yourself a favour and order elsewhere .
negative	way back in early march i ordered a piece of furniture .
negative	after two promised attempts of delivery the furniture did not arrive .
negative	after several appalling attempts of apologies i gave up and cancelled my order .
negative	achica owe me £_000 which i still have not received .
negative	if you want to be robbed , misery and grief , then go_ahead and use this atrocious attempt of a company .
negative	i am unable to give a positive review as i feel let_down and very disappointed .
negative	upon placing my order i was informed that it would be unavailable for dispatch for two months , this was undesirable but agreeable and expected before_christmas .
negative	it was only a month and a half later that i was then informed that it would not be delivered before the new year in the middle of january .
negative	this has put me in a predicament , which could of been avoided if levels of organisation and customer_care within the cotsworld company were at a satisfactory level ; in this time i could have had the product designed and built from scratch .
negative	needless to say i would advise others to take their delivery estimates with a pinch of salt .
negative	ok if you haven_'_t got the idea by now , do not use ecar !!
negative	unfortunately i didn_'_t have the foresight of these reviews !!
negative	to cut a long_story short , i took out a policy with them , within about 0 weeks of starting the policy we too got bombarded to submit proof , which was done by email and confirmed at the start of the policy !
negative	then they decided to put the price up , by £_000 !!!
negative	at the time i did not have enough money to chance insurance providers so had to continue with the monthly_payments which started at around £_00 , later rising to £_00 . 00 , then we were told that we would be getting a refund taking the monthly_payments down to £_00 then another letter to say no , sorry , your monthly_payments will remain £_00 . 00 .
negative	ok so grumble grumble we carried on paying .
negative	then when we moved to a better area , with driveway , cul - de - sac etc i contacted ecar to change the details ( needless to say i haven_'_t rung them once as their call charges are just unrealistic !)
negative	you can do changes online and it gives you a quote .. so proceeded to do this , to find out that an additional £_000 would be required to make the change !!
negative	( not including the standard £_00 odd change to policy fee ) so i decided to get quotes from elsewhere .
negative	having done this i found a quote for £_00 per_month !!
negative	i therefore cancelled my policy but of course the online quotation wouldn_'_t say if i would be owed or if i would owe money .
negative	however , having paid the monthly premium on 00th_october and being a months payment in advance and my policy ending on the 00th_october i presumed ( stupidly ) that i would be getting money back from them and the premium would cover the £_00 cancellation_fee .... ooo no .. like getting blood from a stone !!
negative	i '_ve now received a letter saying i owe them £_00 . 00 and to call their £ 0 . 00 per min number to make payment !!!!
negative	absolutely fuming ..... needless to say i am now going through all the paperwork and will be making a complaint to trading_standards or the motor ombudsman ( if there is one !!)
negative	absolutely atrocious !
negative	also non of my correspondence has ever had a reasonable reply , only directed me to their website !
negative	when my change of details quotation was received i sent an_email to their customer_services and was directed to their website , no help what so ever as it would have required someone to talk to me and go through the file to resolve the issue !
negative	!
negative	waited all day for delivery .
negative	then checked their website which had previously said " out for delivery " to see it had been amended to delivery attempted .
negative	i had been waiting in all day , no one called , no card left !
negative	total con .
negative	waited months for orders to arrive ............ when one did was awful ....... sent the bag back ............ no refund .
negative	still_waiting for refund and second order ........ what compounds the issue is i paid nellypot p_&_p and extra £ 0 for what i ' d thought would be a lovely bag !!
negative	! they were having a laugh and this has made me much wary of buying kgb & groupon deals
negative	this is a terrible comany .
negative	after promising immediate delivery nothing has_been heard of from them in the last three_weeks .
negative	the telephone is not answered and they do not reply to e_- mails .
negative	i suppose my money is lost and i will have to look_elsewhere for the product .
negative	i could perhaps take legal_action .
negative	they do not deserve the one star_rating that i have given them
negative	worst customer service ever_experienced !
negative	i made a substantial order to restock all my cat_food for a few_months .
negative	a bozita cat_food box weighs 000gms & there are 00 boxes in a case .
negative	i ordered 0 of these cases along with 0 of each of whiskas anti - hairball , whiskas temptations & whiskas katzinis .
negative	the containers for the whiskas items are very thin & weak & therefore should not be packed with an item weighing 0 . 0kg ( weight of a bozita cat_food case ), as anybody with common_sense would know that the whiskas containers would break & damage the contents .
negative	well someone who had no common_sense did just this !
negative	they packed 0 whiskas containers with a case of bozita cat_food .
negative	this resulted_in the whiskas containers being smashed into tiny shards & the contents to granules , not to mention the amount of cleaning up i was left to do !
negative	i therefore contacted pet_supermarket by email in the 0nd week of january .
negative	i received a couple of emails to find out if i still had the remains of the damaged goods & with every email i received i responded .
negative	however , i have had no reponse whatsoever since 00 / 00 / 00 despite replying 0 times !
negative	it has now been over 0 month since i had a response .
negative	worse still 0 weeks_later ( today '_s date is 00 / 00 / 00 ) the issue has not been resolved & i have received no refund or compensation !!!
negative	!
negative	i will not be using this company ever again !
negative	their packing service it sub - standard & customer service shambolic !
negative	i suggest that others do not use pet suupermarket as you will lose money and get ripped_off !
negative	was actually refused an account even_though i have the highest possible credit rating .
negative	asked for explanation and was fobbed_off .
negative	wrote and sent copy of credit ratiing just to prove a point .
negative	have not even had the courtesy of a reply .
negative	my story is as follows :-
negative	interlink_express driver fraudulently signs for parcel
negative	courier given access to a block of private flats , customer appears not to be in , does not leave card but does decides to ( fraudulently ) sign for it himself and then leaves it somewhere - parcel goes missing .
negative	interlink_express couriers - all lies
negative	my local interlink depot spokesperson has told me that the courier involved , says he went back to the flats yesterday ( 00st jan ) to investigate and sort_out with the customer but could not gain_access and that the customer was not in - completely false as the customer has_been there since sunday and is still there .
negative	i was then told that the courier left a card this time - completely false again as the customer has his own numbered letter_box , and he has just been to check this on my advice , and nothing is there .
negative	i have a contract with my customer who has purchased my goods and expects to receive these , i shall honour this and make_sure that he does .
negative	interlikexpress . com breach of contract
negative	it appears that interlink who has a legal contract with my business , are more than happy to employ staff who blatantly break the terms of this contract and then lie through their back teeth to protect themselves .
negative	they then inform me that there is nothing further that they can do and that this is now an insurance claim , i advise them that this is not an insurance case and that this is fraud and ask what they are going to do about it , i am informed to take it up with the insurance department so the buck is passed on further and i , my business and my customer can go and get *******
negative	people beware !
negative	if you have similar stories , please share these ....
negative	i decided to use collect_plus to send a parcel to scotland .
negative	i booked my delivery and got the parcel posted straight_away .
negative	so far so good .
negative	i followed the tracking and the item was delivered on tuesday according to records .
negative	this of course was untrue .
negative	after telephoning their offices i was told the item had gone to the wrong_address and they were unable to recover it .
negative	this has to be the worst courier ever and i urge_everyone who is thinking of using them to think again and go back to a reliable service like royal_mail .
negative	i would also like to add that trying to claim a refund is just as bad .
negative	would it not be easier to simply credit my paypal again rather_than having me need to gather so much information and then email this to you .
negative	i am not very good with computers .
negative	you already have the tracking_number and have admitted losing the item .
negative	update .
negative	your answers to my complaints have shown just how much attention you really do pay .
negative	i am the seller and its me that is complaining .
negative	you are not in contact as you say in your statement .
negative	i have been told to fill in a complaint form and gather all the information to get my money back .
negative	you should return my money with paypal and stop messing me around .
negative	you company collect_+ really are incompetent and hte replies you are sending should be read by all future clients before they make the same mistake i did .
negative	sold non working samsung_galaxy_note for £_00 , then got email_saying that engineers had valued it at £_00 !!!
negative	and if i want it returned it would cost £_00 !!
negative	totally_unacceptable !
negative	very misleading , scamming company !!
negative	!
negative	the worst site on the internet .
negative	they support sucks they have no intrest at all .
negative	stay well clear use amazon or any other site .
negative	firstly the " returns service " via named shops - none of the shops the parcel was taken to knew anything about the returns services !
negative	one of the shops didn_'_t even exist .
negative	then went on to return part of my order via_royal_mail , which cloggs are denying having received .
negative	will never use this company again !
negative	i ordered a pair of fitflops from this company on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) i '_ve finally lost patience .
negative	i suspect they ' re simply ' boxshifters ' - if it '_s in stock , fine but if not .....
negative	the problem is they won_'_t bother to inform you of what '_s going on and they left it to me to chase them .
negative	several of my e_- mails were simply ignored but eventually i got a reply telling_me they were awaiting stock and would contact me - the problem is that they don_'_t and it '_s left to you to chase them ( again ).
negative	their only redeeming feature is that they refunded me promptly .
negative	i was left with a promise that the ' d contact me when the goods were in stock and i could re - order but of course they don_'_t contact you ....
negative	take my advice : before ordering , check with them by phone that the item '_s in stock or better still , order from another company who actually do what they promise .
negative	postscript : shortly_after posting the above review , the owner of shoetique contacted me to apologise .
negative	he offered to send me a free pair of fitflops if i would delete my review .
negative	to my shame , i accepted his offer , giving him my word that i would delete the review upon_receipt of the goods .
negative	he then asked that i delete the review first - this was the final_straw and did me a favour by jolting me back to reality !
negative	i '_ve declined his offer and stand by my comments .
negative	we '_ve now ordered from running bare instead - i suggest you do the same .
negative	i ' m extremely upset about the mother '_s day bouquet that was delivered to my elderly_mother 0 days before mothers_day .. not on the day as i had requested ..... the bouquet was a disgrace ... looked like it had been thrown together .
negative	in less_than 00_hours many of the flowers had died although it had been kept in perfect conditions .... i emailed iflorist twice ... no answer ... i phoned them and was told that no calls were being taken and that i should email them again ... which i did ... no answer .. i tried to live_chat with them .. no answer .
negative	what do i do now .
negative	this is probably the worst service that i had ever received from any company .
negative	be warned unlimited data usage at home is not applied to europe .
negative	just received 000 . 00 in data roaming charges , as a gesture of good will vf said they would refund 00 %, which i was not happy with .
negative	i now read on watchdog and eu websites that there is a 00 euro monthly cap on data roaming charges .
negative	are vf contravening my human rights ?
negative	so i have made 0 complaints via phone and internet chat and now an_email .
negative	carphone warheouse under the auspices of mobile . co . uk automatically set_up a subscription to a gadget helpline which is deducted from your bank_account every six_months to the tune of £_00 . 00 just enough not to notice but a nice little_earner ...
negative	i ordered 0 items , signed for the delivery , but when opened the box only 0 item , nothing about other item , packing slip - didnt get one .
negative	awaiting a reply fr om them :(
negative	i purchased a hotbox shilton 0 . 0kw electric greenhouse heater from greenhouse warehouse and put it in our greenhouse on a low setting .
negative	when the weather got colder we started to get regular power outages in the house where the main rcd in our fusebox was tripping out .
negative	after investigation i found that it was the heater causing this .
negative	what was happening was that a fine , metallic dust was coming off of the element when in use .
negative	this dust , being metallic , was getting on the power contacts in the unit and causing an earth loop tripping the rcd .
negative	the amount of powder was a lot .
negative	my electrician told me that is unit was dangerous as the dust , being conducting could be lethal if it got wet ( it was laying all over the floor ) and was stepped on .
negative	given than the user of this greenhouse is my 00 year_old mother - in - law , who would never have seen the powder , the potential of this to be dangerous is huge !
negative	i contacted greenhouse warehouse as soon as we realised what the problem was , but its been a month and still no reply .
negative	i ' m very unhappy with both the product itself ( it being potentially lethal ) and the post sales support from greenhouse warehouse .
negative	if they read this i would be very happy to ( finally ) hear from them .
negative	avoid this company if you ever expect to get any kind of after_sales support !
negative	i ordered and had delivered a very expensive garden set of furniture .
negative	unfortunately , two of the threaded bars that fix the legs to the table were of the wrong_size - i reported this to them and was told by email that i would get a call on the 00th to arrange replacement parts .
negative	after chasing by email ( multiples times ) and attempting to chase by phone ( you go into a 00 min wait in a paid for 0000 number to still get no reply ) and via their own contact form on the website , i still , as of this time ( 00 : 00 on the 00th ) have had no call or email from them to sort_out this problem .
negative	made worse by the fact that the only reason we ordered from them was the quick delivery as we had guests for last weekend , who ended_up sitting on the chairs ( which were pre_- built ) looking at an un - assembled table with their lunches on their laps - thanks for a ruined weekend worldstores !
negative	so i '_ve had to wait for days with still no resolution and with a decent weekend coming up will have to spend it looking at the uneless pile of aluminium and wood on my patio .
negative	worldstores make even bt '_s customer support look professional and that '_s saying something !
negative	i placed an order on 0rd february .
negative	arrived 00 days_later .
negative	the item was faulty .
negative	have emailed them and recieved no response .
negative	they knew the item was faulty before they sent it , they just sent it anyway .
negative	£_00 down .
negative	save your money and find a decent company to buy from .
negative	be warned - if something isn_'_t right the company won_'_t entertain you and you will lose your money !
negative	!
negative	can say nothing good about them .
negative	very slow to respond .
negative	wont recommend
negative	we received an_email in the morning saying our item was out for delivery that day , and on checking the tracking it was showing it as on the van out for delivery .
negative	so , i waited in expecting to see the item sometime that day .
negative	after wasting a whole day waiting for this delivery i checked the tracking again and there was a note saying it had been returned to the service centre at 0 . 00 despite supposedly being_able to deliver up to 0pm .
negative	imagine our dismay the next_day when we again checked the tracking and an additional line had been put in before the line about its return to the service centre saying " could not gain_access at 0 . 00am ".
negative	what an utter lie - our place is so easily_accessible its not true .
negative	shocking duisgusting behaviour to just lie about a non attempted delivery .
negative	we have had yodel deliver to us on many occassions without a problem so why was this so difficult ???
negative	.... and to then lie is outrageous and totally_unacceptable !!!!
negative	we are so angry about this we will take it up with customer_services and complaints_dept tomorrow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	bought a used car from stratstone saab birmingham just before_christmas , were fine until i paid then just seem not to be bothered and just wanted to usher me out of showroom as soon as possible , i was told when purchasing from them that missing owners manual and details of warranty would follow in the post , the dealer closed not long after this but stratstones were very quick in sending a letter telling_me which other of their dealers i could visit to get my car serviced , repaired etc , but i never recieved the promised items in the post , so i emailed them , after a couple of days i got a reply saying they would look in to it and asking for further information and stating that their finance manager was at stratstone saab that day so would chase it up .
negative	since then despite several emails to the person who responded to me and via their website i have heard_nothing from them at all .
negative	a bit strange since one of the items i was missing was details of an extended_warranty that i was looking to take out with them .
negative	i know the car i purchased wasn_'_t a £_00k range_rover or jaguar ( it was only £ 0000 ) but surely every customer should be treated fairly .
negative	i will think_twice about setting foot in a stratstone or evans halshaw dealership again .
negative	btw the car i purchased has also developed a fault since purchase it looks_like the dual mass flywheel is failing and according to people who i have spoken to this would have been noticeable at a service ( which was supposedly done just before i picked_up the vehicle )
negative	i have so little faith in stratstones that i would rather pay to get this fixed myself than bother trying to claim on the 0 month warranty given as i was told this was very basic and didn_'_t cover much and the limit on it was £_000 being as the repair will be more than double this i ' d rather go_elsewhere with my custom .
negative	lastminute . com have totally messed_up a 0 day trip to lisbon fior me and 0 of my friends .
negative	tried booking flights / hotel package online , saw a good deal , entered details for 0 people , names , dates of birth etc_etc , by the time i pressed confirm , the flights had gone .
negative	found alternatives , went down same process , same result .
negative	did this 0 times , with no luck .
negative	frustrated , i thought i ' d phone them .
negative	deal with a real human .
negative	little did i know .
negative	again , gave the guy details of what i wanted , told him i had seen something at 000_quid each .
negative	hey , i can do something better he says .
negative	000_pounds .
negative	great says i .
negative	gave him all details again for 0 people , by the time he spelt out and repeated every detail i gave him , the flights had gone .
negative	he finally found something at over 000_quid , i told him i was not happy , as i had started at 000_quid , he offered 000_quid , now , after 00_minutes , i ' m at over 000_quid .
negative	he explained that the flight prices move up and down , ok , i understand that .
negative	but if lastminure . com employed a call_centre that had people speaking decent english , the transaction could have been conducted quicker , meaning i would have got my flights .
negative	spoke with supervisor , he said he would call me with something within half hour , its now been hour and 00_minutes and nothing , not even the courtesy of a call telling_me they cant help .
negative	thanks lastminute . com , you have messed_up our midweek break , and basically you couldnt care_less .
negative	i will not be using you again , and i recommend that other people dont either .
negative	voucher was not reconised ................. much communication to sort_out
negative	to get set_up to advertise ( among other things ) you have to put in the address of your property .
negative	it won_'_t accept mine , and correspondence to an anonymous person or computer come back over and over that ' they have set_up the address ' - they don_'_t acknowledge that when i try to validate it the " next " or " continue " button is greyed out ( even_though i have sent screen prints ) so i can '_t set_up my ad .
negative	hence - no listing , and no bookings … and nearly 0 weeks worth or repetitive e_- mails getting no where .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	and all this effort for me to give 00_% of my hard_earned income - if i ever get any !
negative	useless .
negative	( i will be forward a link of this review to them to make a point )
negative	virgin_media , the company that suddenly offeres cheap deals to people when i used to pay thru the roof for half bit 0mb bb service with no sky_tv channels .
negative	the ic and tv connection kept disconnecting every 00_minutes and caused no end of headaches , plus the callcentres in india do not help .
negative	they never fixed the probelm after 0 weks and 0 engineers and i will never use them again .
negative	i was on telewest for 00 years and had excellent service but overpriced !
negative	then virgin step in and we lose sky_tv and we get v + box with 0 hd channel - bbc hd !
negative	i vcannit stress enough how bad an experience they provided , thank_god for sky .
negative	they have been no problem .
negative	i ordered duvets , covers and pillows from this company via amazon .
negative	the pillows were not in the parcel so i tried_ringing them .
negative	each time i phoned the answer machine cut in , i tried over and over again but no reply .
negative	i looked on their website and found an_email address , so i emailed them , still no reply .
negative	it was only after contacting them via amazon that they eventually sent an_email_saying they had sent the pillows with the other stuff - no they had not , and so they would have to investigate via their despatch department and carrier .
negative	what a load of rubbish that is , the cost of pillows is under £ 0 .
negative	the goods were okay as you get what you pay for , but there is no customer service whatsoever and are the worst company i have ever come_across .
negative	it is not worth the hassle of dealing_with them .
negative	ordered a pair of shoes which i would of thought would of been new .
negative	to my disappointment the one shoe was new - the other shoe looks_like it was over 00 months old and been in their shop .
negative	be careful - although the items may be in the sale they may not be 0000 saleable .
negative	disappointed !
negative	here '_s a big warning not to use rentalcars . com .
negative	we pre_- paid £_00 . 00 for 0 days rental .
negative	we took all the documentation that rentalcars . com told us to , including driver '_s licence and credit_card .
negative	when we turned_up , the company would not rent us the car because we didn_'_t have a second part of of our driver '_s licence .
negative	rentalcars . com never mentioned this .
negative	we had to get a taxi because we couldn_'_t get a rental car .
negative	not only did rentalcars . com not apologise for not bringing to our attention all the documentation that we would need , but they refused to give us our money back .
negative	the rental_agreement was never fulfilled .
negative	it cost rentalcars . com nothing except the processing of our payment and yet they still keep our money .
negative	they have a specific paragraph in their terms stating " where the vehicle cannot be picked_up due to insufficient documentation ... this will be treated as a cancellation ... a 000_% cancellation_fee will be charged where we are not notified of cancellation prior to the start of the rental ."
negative	they must have had numerous customers not know that there are two parts to a uk licence that they need to take to the rental company and yet they do not bring this to the attention of their customers .
negative	why would they have that paragraph about a 000_% cancellation_fee in there terms of agreement ?
negative	easy money for them ?
negative	do you know of any other company that charges a 000_% cancellation_fee ?
negative	told buy this rubbish company to basically go away .
negative	dont wish any bad on some people but go_bust your rubbish ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	purchased ajax tickets and was gutted to find out after spending money on flights and hotel to find the tickets were fake and lost a lot of money ..!!!
negative	thanks for nothing ..... dont trust this lot .....£ 0000 up in smoke , can '_t began to tell you how bad i feel , just put it down to experience .
negative	i have been reluctant to write a poor review about this company , because i was sure they would resolve my problems .
negative	i believed the customer service centre , when they told me numerous_times , how sorry they were for not replying and that they have once again forwarded my request for refund , to the accounts_department .
negative	i had returned two_separate packages of ink_cartridges for refund , because they refused to be accepted by my printers .
negative	no problem with that , these things happen .
negative	i just wanted a refund , i could then decide if i would order some more from a different batch .
negative	i did not receive any acknowledgement of receipt , i had to email several_times to find out if they had been received .
negative	no problem , we have received them and a refund is on it '_s way .
negative	more emails sent , eventually i got a refund for one of the packages , i don_'_t know which one , they were both the same price .
negative	many more emails sent and assurances that the remaining refund would arrive soon .
negative	now despite getting the automated_reply , and then a read receipt for my emails , no one will reply .
negative	this has taken over a month and still not resolved .
negative	so i guess the answer is yes , i am gullible to believe that this company are professional and honest .
negative	les leech
negative	ltk0000000000000x
negative	order number : pl - pi0000000 [ 0000000 ]
negative	order number : pl - pi0000000 [ 0000000 ]
negative	my experience is similar to many others here , place order , money taken , thats the last i heard from them !
negative	the very few positive_reviews on this site indicate a company trying but failing to offer customer service , if you are lucky_enough to order something de cuisine have in stock then i am sure they will send it .
negative	however in most_cases your money will be taken and that is the last you will see of it .
negative	please , if you happen to hit the jackpot and are among the chosen few who do get what you ordered , do not recommend this company to friends , yours was an isolated transaction your friends will lose money , if in any doubt or subscribe to the conspiracy theorists , contact devon trading_standards or your credit_card company they will know de cuisine , you have been_warned !
negative	long_story short .
negative	i wanted a hd camcorder , due to bad_experience with other online_retailer i turned to best cameras .
negative	i sent email before purchase to check stock and also to ensure stock would be ' pristine stock ' with factory seal intact !
negative	i was assured this would be the case .
negative	( i have email as proof ). when camera arrived , there was no factory seal , just a ' shop seal '
negative	i rang to complain , and explaination i got was that it was a ' shelf model ', but that it had never been turned on , and seal was reliable . i ' m sorry , but factory seal means , factory sealed .
negative	by their own explaination this was not factory sealed .
negative	considering i requested assurance regarding this particular issue before purchase , i consider this a breach of trades description and will be contacting the appropriate trading_standards to investigate . very very disappointed .
negative	another case of new is whatever we say it is !!
negative	all i want is what i paid for , like most of us .
negative	i have no axe to grind against this company , but poor service from online_retailers is becoming a major issue for us all , don_'_t you think ?
negative	i ordered tickets to a boxing event weeks_ago and paid in full up front .
negative	i have been waiting ever_since and twice queried where my tickets are .
negative	they tell_lies and say that the promoter has not released them .
negative	i know they have cos i know loads of people who have had their tickets in hand for ages .
negative	the status of my tickets has_been showing as ' prepared for dispatch ' for about a week now .
negative	i cannot fathom how long it takes these useless numpties to put 0 tickets in an envelope with my name and address on ?
negative	would never use them again no matter what .
negative	i would rather miss the event altogether than use eventim . co . uk
negative	the initial experience was more than acceptable , with next_day delivery .
negative	however , if you wish to return items , as i did , the nightmare begins .
negative	there is entirely inadequate arrangements for the return of items , lack of communication by all concerned and incompetence on a level which is more or less prevalent wherever you go these days , but nonetheless unacceptable .
negative	this has caused me so much stress and is still not yet resolved , two_weeks after i requested the return .
negative	i am also nearly_£_00 out of pocket on the deal
negative	absolutely the worst ever service , from customer service to no service , several complaints resolved in aparently no line faults , then an engineer came round and confirmed there were several , up to 00 times in one min ... after trying to make them understand , that they had charged me more than i signed_up for after two months of incorrect bills , and many calls from the mobile , for which they had the number , said i was not entitled to compensation for the costs .
negative	they would not let me lodge a complaint after 00_mins on the phone , and said they would call me every day until i agreed to close it , well i won_'_t .
negative	only offered me what they had overcharged in the first place .
negative	they wanted 00 . 00 for me to end the contract that they are not supplying , well i will take it to the ombudsman first . oh and as if by magic the line came back for 0 mins , and low and behold their systems are always down so you can '_t be transferred to someone with a brain and have to keep pressing 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 and repeating all your details over and over , so frustrating and angry .
negative	don_'_t go with this lot .....
negative	have used cheapsmells a few_times now but never again !
negative	on a recent_purchase , back in april i found the edt had no smell , when i asked if its poss its old stock or fake i was assured all items sold are brand_new and genuine , i sent the product to the manufacturer for examination and was told it was 00 years old and been discontinued many_years_ago !
negative	!
negative	cheapsmells have so far failed to comment after i have sent them 0 more emails
negative	i received my itams and the batterie on one did not work and the atamizers were faulty i have emailed three or four times but did not get a reply and i even rang but waited 00 min but got no reply so very disapointed indeed i will wait and see if i get a reply to this email ..
negative	they left a note yesterday , didn_'_t turn_up as promised today .
negative	different stories from different " customer service " representatives .
negative	i have no_idea if and when the package will ever turn_up .
negative	the second rep i spoke to told me categorically that yodel has no press office - i asked because i write for several magazines on consumer matters such as this .
negative	he told me that someone would phone back about my complaint .
negative	nobody did .
negative	i have since emailed their online publicised press office but don_'_t expect to hear back .
negative	it is shocking that companies such as this are entirely unaccountable to the general_public .
negative	i booked and paid £_00 . 00 online with parcel_monkey to get a parcel sent to coventry next_day on 0 / 0th_feb_0000 .
negative	it was collected by city_link no problem but i was amazed to find parcel arrived back to me 00 days_later - no explanation , card or phone_call apologising or even giving me a reason .
negative	tried_calling parcel_monkey but no telephone_numbers avail .
negative	contact has to made via their online support which is slow and unresponsive ..
negative	i gave a detailed email explaining the problem but it has taken 00_hours for someone called ' may ' to ask if they can be of any help to contact them !
negative	for crying out loud , all i want is for my parcel to be collected and to be delivered to its destination .
negative	unhappy customer .
negative	ordered a karcher , washer and hose , no delivery or order history on my account , have not received items so cancelled order 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	order for refund , 0nd payment charge , 00 / 00 /_0000 ,
negative	they owe me two payments for none delivery of goods , poor service from india
negative	put you on hold at your cost and failed to deal with the refund .
negative	very poor service and overlay charged to be put on hold and not dealt_with .
negative	called karcher head_office received a good reply ,
negative	but no real help in the matter .
negative	no better deal than shop deals ,
negative	better to buy in a good shop with good customer service .
negative	after over 000 transactions i '_ve stopped using ebay .
negative	it was once a place for a bargain or a niche product , now it '_s full of traders , used products cannot properly be separated from new ones in the search and you are forced to have a paypal_account .
negative	new auction sites are springing up , se of which are totally free to use .
negative	once a great place to shop but amazon is now my first_port of call .
negative	i ordered a camera from simply_electronics 0nd_april and like the bulk of the reviewers on trustpilot have had the same appalling experience with non delivery , even_though there was always stock showing on their web_site .
negative	i had over 00 e_- mails on my computer with all_sorts of crap from simply_electronics , and in the end asked for a full_refund as the camera was not being sent out .
negative	in the meantime i ordered the same camera at a cheaper price from a uk supplier and received it within two days .
negative	my refund was not forthcoming , and in the end after receiving advice from hong_kong cyber crime which stated i had to make simply_electronics aware that i had contacted them about the non refund of my payment , i did receive back in my account 00 days after the payment had been taken .
negative	reading other reviews this seems to be how they use honest payments to be able to dishonestly ply their trade on the net ,
negative	ordered a a boot mat on 00th_november_0000 .
negative	still_waiting for delivery on 00rd_december_0000 despite 00 ( ten ) phone_calls to the company .
negative	a different_story every time and not one promise kept .
negative	i am starting to wonder seriously if this is a scam .
negative	update , it is now 00 january but still no boot mat .
negative	colin at mrcarmats promised me a refund and claims that it went through at one minute past ten on 0th_january .
negative	of course it has not arrived .
negative	telephone_call count now at 00 .
negative	avoid this company all they do is take your money .
negative	refund finally received at the end of january , so not a scam but seriously bad service .
negative	no card was left behind after three delivery attempts and then the item was immediately returned to the sender .
negative	how was i supposed to know that they had tried to deliver the item if no card is left whilst im out !
negative	the tracking website contained inaccurate information saying that the item had been delivered when it hadn_'_t .
negative	i contacted the customer service helpline who were very unhelpful .
negative	they said they would email me a break - down on what had happened to the parcel , but never did .
negative	they were rude , very dismissive and did not try to help resolve the problem at all .
negative	do not use this service unless you never want to see your items again .
negative	i am very unhappy .
negative	i ordered a bouquet as a thank_you gesture to a friend .
negative	upon_receipt of order & notification of despatch , i ordered a further bouquet for my mother in law .
negative	late on in evening i received a generic email & text to inform me the flowers were on way .
negative	just by chance i looked into the tracking .
negative	i was so upset to read the flowers had been messed_up .
negative	they had sent wrong bouquet & wrong message to recipients .
negative	i tried in vien to resolve this but the email only customer service were useless .
negative	no matter how i tried , even posting them my receipt and acknowledgement , they just reply chapter & verse a generic reply of no use nor ownership of the mess up .
negative	the whole_experience & flowers received were a total disgrace .
negative	if you are considering purchasing flowers , please choose wisely .
negative	serenata promise a full 000_% guarantee / refund of not satisfied .
negative	this is not the case nor are they interested in their customer_satisfaction .
negative	there are lots of reputable florists on line ; serenata are not in the running & they should be_ashamed of their service !!
negative	!
negative	sent my sons sony ericsson after been quoted £_000 . 00 .
negative	however , after many emails they quote the phone was never received .
negative	having recorded the delivery and questioned them about having actually signed for package , they now claim they had received the package but the packet was empty ( no handset ).
negative	we have managed to use the tracking device which was still in use on handset and shall be sending our proof of this been a fraudulent company to trading_standards as they still deny handling / received handset which evidently is not the case .
negative	i ' m surprised they believe they can actually continue trading with such unethical and underhand deception to unsuspecting and goodwill on customers behalf '_s .
negative	watch this space , better still watch watchdog or similar as that is the reality for these_crooks ....
negative	.
negative	currently trying to resolve matter with post_office resolutions , not a good service nor an expected outcome .
negative	i do not recommend mobilephonexchange , nor do i approve them having trading
negative	placed my order on the 00th_november , paid extra for saturday delivery .
negative	received an_email at 00 . 00_hours the night before advising that my order delivery date had been changed .
negative	contacted them by phone on the saturday_morning to complain and was asked when would i like the order to be delivered again .
negative	said the following saturday but i was not willing to pay another extra_charge for a saturday delivery and i wanted a refund of the extra_charge that i had already paid .
negative	they took the full_amount out of my account so had to contacted them again to request the refund again , finally got it .
negative	the following friday received another email at 00 . 00pm advising that my order would not be delivered yet again .
negative	when i contacted them again they could not tell me why my order was not delivered as it was sitting in the deport waiting to go .
negative	i said that i wanted this before wednesday the following week and they said that would be arranged .
negative	advised i wanted it delivered in the afternoon .
negative	got an_email today to advise that my order had been despatched and would be delivered tomorrow between 0 . 00am and 0 . 00pm , so much for requesting an afternoon delivery .
negative	will wait and see if it actually gets delivered this time .
negative	booked a hotel through this company .
negative	a few_days_later i discovered that the price i was paying was actually billed in pounds , not euros .
negative	ok , this was my mistake .
negative	however , when i wrote to them explaining this fact , it was too late because their price guarantee only lasts 00 hour !
negative	absolutely_useless .
negative	i tried to explain to their head_office that i could easily cancel the booking without_any charge and book with hotels . com and save myself at_least £_00 .
negative	but they just didn_'_t care because 00_hours had lapsed .
negative	either that or they did not understand because they are based in spain .
negative	i wish i ' d booked with hotels . com because their price guarantee lasts right up to the hotel '_s cancellation window .
negative	brilliant !
negative	not only that , i can '_t even log in to their system to view my booking !
negative	i will never use hotelopia again .
negative	i called a week ago to ask where my loyalty cheque was ( after waiting 00 days ) response was its on the desk waitingto be posted - may be another week - on complaining was informed youre lucky to get a cheque not all companies offer a dual_fuel discount !!!!!!!
negative	sorry but thatwas the reason i chose this company , cheque still notarrived after 00 days called again at my expense - no one in accounts and there has_been a problem with some cheques - you may have to wait another 00 days !!!!!!!
negative	this is unnaceptanle disgraceful management and i feel that you no_longer deserve my custom - i made a commitment toyou topay in full - on time for dual_fuel - wheres your commitment to me ?????
negative	not good enough
negative	just read due to unprecedented demand response to emails could take 0 days ah ah ah unprecedented complaints more like
negative	update no promised call_backs and not surprisingly still no cheques !!!
negative	!
negative	wish id looked on here before i signed_up - avoid at all cvost
negative	do not book with credit_card , you will be surcharged and they don_'_t tell you until after the booking is confirmed .
negative	this is devious , and i won_'_t use this company again .
negative	tried to buy jewellery at end of nov .
negative	paid by paypal and credit_card debited immediately .
negative	nothing arrived .
negative	e_mail and answer machine correspondence repeatedly went_unanswered .
negative	we reported this to paypal who investigated and luckily for us have refunded the money .
negative	useless waste of time
negative	your customer_services department has just lost you a customer for good .
negative	as an individual and on behalf of 0 gp surgeries i have purchased ‘ 000 ’_s of pounds worth of goods from you over the past years .
negative	i have 0 x_0gb dim0 ram - bought as pair .
negative	0 has_been crashing my computer with memory malfunction .
negative	i have run memory tests on the individual units and identified that one is faulty .
negative	you state that i have to return the pair - which means i will not be able to use my computer . i would have purchased another set from you and would willing have done this for a credit reimbursement when the defective pair had been returned .
negative	e buyer refused - just wanted me to end up with 0 x_0gb_ram which i dont want or need .
negative	i will now purchase something from elsewhere and then return your defective item as apair as requested .
negative	you are in breach of the sales of good act through the unnecessary significant inconvenience_caused entirely by your application of a silly policy .
negative	under the sale of goods_act , the retailer must either repair or replace the goods ' within a reasonable time but without causing significant inconvenience '.
negative	0flats . com is a horrible service !!
negative	!
negative	i had my listings on instant booking where they ' re charging 00_% commission but when the customer booked i realized they have taken 00 %.
negative	i tried talk to them , their web form doesn_'_t work at all , anyway after couple of days i managed to contact them and all they do is quoting their own polices .
negative	now , i '_ve just wanted to login to my account but it doesn_'_t exist anymore .
negative	i guess i ' m not gonna get paid .
negative	anyone knows_how to deal with scam like this ?
negative	regards
negative	they make money from me phoning them as they insist on using a chargeable number , unles you subscribe to the sky phone service , then they keep you waiting for 00_mins before someone tells you to ring a different number or makes you reboot the box which ive already done .
negative	there is no e_mail address for this company which is ridiculous given that they supply internet services and expect me to use the online service to order from them !!
negative	!
negative	parcel arrived in inverness on the 00th_april and still no sign of it so far today , the 00th .
negative	we live less_than 00 miles from the inverness depot !
negative	tried_phoning but no answer after 00_minutes so i assume the office is not manned , god_knows_how they take orders etc .
negative	avoid this company like the plague and use a reputable one or the [_external_reference_removed ].
negative	my sister has had a recent bereavement and i wanted to send her some flowers as a little surprise to help cheer_her up .
negative	at 00 . 00 i had to ring and ask her if she ' d received anything because i felt sure she would have rung if they had .
negative	the surprise now spoilt , she then had to go out and hunt around the house to see if she could find them .
negative	there was no card through the door and so it was obvious no one had attempted a delivery .
negative	i wrote to customer_services who said they would contact the couriers but it would be 00 to 00hrs before they could let me know !!
negative	!
negative	at 0 . 00hrs this morning , my sister found the flowers dumped on the doorstep .
negative	no card or explanation and no_idea how long they had been there .
negative	the whole_experience was upsetting and embarrassing and as far as the company was concerned ( as i '_ve no reply ) the flowers are delivered , end of story .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use this company again and the company certainly need to review the couriers they currently use .
negative	all the bad_reviews on twitter are mainly regarding delivery , so that should tell them something ..... hopefully !!
negative	!
negative	what a disaster !
negative	my boyfriend and i were left stranded in the middle of london with a very important function to attend .
negative	easytobook . com just sent us from one non_existent booking to another .
negative	we ended_up staying in a b_& b that we found ourselves and missed the funcition .
negative	take my advice , use anyone_else !
negative	!
negative	i would give lower if possible .
negative	ordered a sink they delivered an_alternative without telling_me .
negative	the one delivered was £_000 cheaper and they didnt tell me .
negative	0 weeks_later i am still_waiting for them to collect it and refund my money .
negative	i needed to change my rental period .
negative	i booked a 0 week rental at the very good price of 000_euro .
negative	i needed to defer the start of my trip by one week and the cost quoted was an unbelievable 000_euro !
negative	the girl on the phone said she couldn_'_t believe the price and actually queried it with her supervisor .
negative	the reason given was that it was closer to easter .
negative	needless to say i cancelled and was able to book with another company for £_000 .
negative	i did not read anywhere that my suits is coming from shanghai and that i did not expect additional customs invoice of + 00 , 00 € for my orders worth 000 , 00 €.
negative	foremost , it arrived late , then , i received this surprisingly high invoice from the german custom .
negative	it is not worth at all ............... a big_mistake that i would not want anyone to go through .
negative	my review was deleted for investigation and they confirmed the authenticity of my review so they told me to open a ticket .
negative	but what will it help me ?
negative	i still have to pay the custom invoice !
negative	thai is why , i still want to warn everyone out there who might be misled like me - be aware that the product is coming from china and that you will receive an invoice on top of what you pay to your order .
negative	i checked the faq of the webiste and still did not locate these conditions .
negative	hence , i think that this is very important to be shared for consumers like me .
negative	purchased £ 0000 worth of furniture last_year .
negative	poor delivery service ,
negative	promised a mirror which never arrived even after several phone_calls to customer_services .
negative	sideboard was damaged , engineer made an attempt to fix and company offered £_00 discount which again we never received .
negative	can not recommend this company due to poor customer service .
negative	update
negative	after_reading this review the company has_been in touch and all issues has_been resolved but that took over 0 months
negative	dyson actually searched around the internet for a part for me , called me to say there was a part in stock at espares . co . uk , so i went to the website , checked that it was definitely in stock and placed the order with an expected delivery date of 0 to 0 days .
negative	two_weeks_later , i call them ( note , not the other way round ), only to be told that suddenly the part is out of stock , that someone must have coincidentally ordered the same ( very rare ) part at exactly the same time .
negative	the guy on the phone told me i didn_'_t understand how stock worked , but if he knew what i did for a living , he ' d be embarressed .
negative	so how long would they have left it before calling me and offering to return my money ?
negative	do i believe the coincidence of someone biuying the same part a nano second before me ?
negative	meanwhile , espares . co . uk have had my money in their possession , all be it a small_amount , but if this happens to many people , that can add up .
negative	was the part really , truly , in stock when i ordered .
negative	doesn_'_t smell good , so won_'_t be ordering from them ever again .
negative	i have taken four flights last_year with ryanair , two to portugal from doncaster and two to dublin from birmingham .
negative	the two to doncaster were perfect , great staff i got what i paid for .
negative	the two to dublin were never again to be repeated i will fly with air lingus from now on .
negative	scumbag company as many other_reviewers have said .
negative	i '_ve been unable to obtain a refund for a cancelled order and have been palmed off with " we are processing your refund " e_- mails from someone called leslie grant .
negative	looks_like i '_ll have to write this one off as a bad_experience - the first time i '_ve had any_problems buying online .
negative	the company does not have a postal_address ( because it is clearly not a uk company ) and its customer_services are a sham .
negative	don_'_t buy !
negative	!
negative	for the second time i '_ve had the same problem with yodel , after 0 delivery attempts i waited in all day today for them to make the 0rd .
negative	at about 0pm i decided to look at the tracking_info and it had been returned to the service centre after a failed 0rd attempt !!
negative	categorically no attempt was made and no card was left !!
negative	after trying to sort it out with customer_services i just got fobbed_off with with " we have made 0 attempts so i will now have to collect " !
negative	!
negative	that would be a 00 mile_round_trip !!
negative	as with all the other comments , avoid this company at all costs .
negative	i will be complaining to amazon us who the parcel is from , to make them aware of what happens when they send a package to the uk .
negative	yodel are ****!
negative	!
negative	in the last two years i have purchased a long wool cardigan and a polo neck jumper .
negative	within a few_days of wearing both items they became pilled and began to lose their shape .
negative	i was attracted_by the photos of both items in woolovers catalogue .
negative	what a mistake !
negative	both items have fallen apart , mainly under the arms and at the neck .
negative	i have repaired the cardigan myself . the polo neck i have worn no more than twice , and the seam at the neck has a hole in it .
negative	i am really appalled at the poor quality of both items given the prices .
negative	the polo neck sweater ; is supposedly lambs wool but it is very itchy and unpleasant to wear .
negative	perhaps woolovers could_learn a few lessons in quality sweaters from places like marks and spencer and topshop .
negative	ordered flowers in good time for delivery for valentines_day , only to be let_down big time by inter flora got email_stating due to high_volume of orders they were unable to fill my order .... i will never use this company again and advise_anyone_else not to
negative	ordered items from this company , waited a week then was told item out of stock after i called them , but was told would be in stock with in 0 days and order would completed , waited another week still no item , called them again only to be told item still out of stock but would be in that day .
negative	another week has_gone past and still nothing called a third time and told no sure on when stock would be in .
negative	total_waste of time and although item cheaper_than else where i would rather pay the extra and get items delivered with in a week not 0 plus weeks .
negative	will never use this site again and would advise others to avoid like the plague
negative	shocking customer service .
negative	i have been unable to access my online talktalk account for over a month despite_numerous_emails & phone_calls .
negative	if your looking for a service provider i would strongly urge you to look_elsewhere !
negative	purchased a vehicle workshop manual online download .
negative	it was supplied in some unknown format for which you are then pointed towards a further software download in order to make it work , this software then will not load properly and i am still left with a product i can not use .
negative	i would steer_well clear of this company .
negative	ordered my giffgaff simcard put it into my smart phone , purchased £_00 top up credit and a £_00 goodybag which gave me unlimited internet , unlimited_texts , and god_knows_how many free phonecalls for a month .
negative	the first 0 days i checked my account balance , it was still £_00 all well and good showing all calls i made were coming from the £_00 goodybag add on just as they should .
negative	all of a sudden 0st august , balance dropped to £ 0 , i contacted their online help agent who informed me that i dialled a premium number 000000 on 00 july at 00 : 00 & 00 seconds whilst i was in bed and the phone was downstairs with no other person having access to it , this call cost £ 0 .
negative	i did not make the call , i have no_idea or interest who is on the other end of 000000 , what a con , needless to say once my credit runs out with giffgaff i will be putting another networks simcard in my phone and they won ’ t con any more money out of me .
negative	i advise you to beware of this network before your pocket gets hit .
negative	if i could give them minus 0_stars i would .
negative	totally_satisfied with deepblue , i have ordered a number of items of dive equipment during the last four years and have no compaints about the service , the equipment , or the response from the crew of deepblue .
negative	bed bought with next_day delivery option , only problem was , the bed mysteriously went missing on the day of delivery .
negative	when i spent over 00_mins on their automated expensive customer call number , i ws informed that the mattresses was missing in transit so would not be delivered as planned and another date for me to stay in doors from 0 - 0 pm ( no am or pm delivery approx time is given ) on friday was given to me .
negative	i explained i could not take another day off work and if they could not deliver it the following tue or wed morning , i had no option to but to cancel the order .
negative	it was agreed the delivery time could not be given , so i asked for a full_refund which the processor put through .
negative	today , thursday , a man stood at the door with my mattress !
negative	i did not take delivery as i bought on wed afternoon , when worldstores could not deliver .
negative	.
negative	i told the delivery guy , had worldstores told me they could delivery thursday instead of friday , that would be ok , but too late now as i have a mattresses .
negative	it '_s taken me two calls 00_mins 0st time to see where bed was and another 00_mins to chase them again to find out where the bed is , on a premium telephone_call rate .
negative	, i have called my bank and lodged a complaint as i don_'_t believe a refund was put through , otherwise the bed would not have turned_up today !
negative	leave well alone .
negative	trading_standards and asa should be informed of this mis_- selling company .
negative	unless you want to waste valuable time calling them up on their premium_rate number to see where the bed you bought with promised delivery is , don_'_t touch them .
negative	my son wanted to buy 0ds with his_birthday money , ordered it may 0000 , like others have said , when they eventually answered an_email kept saying would be despatched in 00_hours , never received anything , very quick to take money out of your account , not so quick at answering the telephone .
negative	i am so glad that i had the hindsight to buy it on my visa_card .
negative	anyway after over 0 months disappointment , i had had enough and i contacted my bank and had to fill out some forms detailing all my emails and the correspondence i got back from them , and i received refund in full from my bank , we then managed to buy a 0ds much_cheaper with extra games from well_known high_street store .
negative	booked resorthoppa return_journey from dalaman to marmaris .
negative	travelling alone which was a problem for their website as it seems you can only book in pairs , but to be fair their office in london go it sorted .
negative	going out was no problem but coming_back was a disaster .
negative	they ask you to confirm 00_hours before you travel but the local office was useless , kept on cutting me off and didn_'_t seem to know what was going on at all .
negative	my fears confirmed when the bus failed to turn_up and the numbers they provided were not recognised or did not answer .
negative	i gave it 00_minutes but in the end had to get a cab which cost me another £_00 .
negative	tried to ring the london office to complain but in just rings out .
negative	my advice book them out and try to arrange something locally for the return
negative	ordered a pair of wellington boots online very competative price hence the 0 star however when i failed to receive the order on their same or next_day delivery promise or even a notice of despatch i called the company to be told - no they are out of stock , there was not even an offer of a substitute pair , that was the end of the call as far as they were concerned .
negative	leads me to believe wellies at that price probably do not even exist .
negative	i made an order for a chair on 00 / 00 / 00 and cancelled it the same evening .
negative	since then have sent repeated emails and have had several conversations with people who tell me i can expect a full_refund in a few_days time .
negative	having looked into the company further i think the people i spoke to work for another company , and that infurn are a very dodgy set_up .
negative	i reported them to the british police for fraud .
negative	i since found out several others have dine the same and that they are being_investigated .
negative	i suggest you think very carefully before parting with any money to this company .
negative	you can view my reviews under webuy . com
negative	wecertainlydontcare @ webuy . com would be more appropriate in describing cex
negative	gerard corlay
negative	how many emails does one have to send to get a reply from cex wecare ??
negative	@ webuy take your money quickly . com
negative	i was originally very impressed when sending in 00 xbox games for sale and opted for the e_- voucher as i wanted games from their listings .
negative	what a lot of hassle trying to reedeem voucher for £_00 . 00 which was posted recorded delvery to their e_- commerce dept .
negative	as instructed in their terms & conditions , received and signed for on behalf of cex at 00 . 00am on 00th of feb receipt confirmed by conrad of cex on 00th of feb via_email to myself .
negative	to this date 00th of march , my bank has still not received the £_00 . 00 rightfully owed , nor have i had any response to umpteen emails since feb 00th !!
negative	!
negative	the 0 games i ordered value £_00 . 00 for which my visa_card was debited for on 00th of feb duely arrived over 0 days 00 , 00 & 00th of feb impressive !
negative	shame i can '_t say the same about their e_- voucher system and their email repsonses to queries !!
negative	!
negative	future dealings with webuy . com cex ?
negative	lets_see what sort of response , appology , recompense , good old_fashioned customer service i get because at present it looks highly unlikely !
negative	g . corlay .
negative	( not a happy_bunny )
negative	had relply from conrad at cex webuy . com today 00th of march at 0 . 00am
negative	quote : we can confirm that we have received the voucher and it will be processed at the earliest .
negative	exactly the same as was emailed to me on 00th of feb by the very same person !
negative	no mention of other emails sent to them or any kind of definitive answer to the ongoing saga !
negative	this kind of " after " sales service is appalling , not to mention illegal and against their owm policies / terms & conditions .
negative	shame really because their choice of goods , prices and delveries are amongst the best but oh , the total disrespect to after_sales customer service is one , if not , the worst i '_ve ever come_across !
negative	!
negative	so , after ignoring my other emails in which i mentioned taking_legal_action , i have replied to this latest email from conrad at webuy . com by reitterating this line of action wil proceed as of 0 . 00am tommorow 00th of march if the situation is unresolved by 0 . 00pm today .
negative	they have had ample time and had my money for far too long !!
negative	!
negative	will keep all you other disgruntled viewers updated .
negative	latest update 00 . 00pm sunday 00th_march .
negative	received further email from conrad at cex wecare ??
negative	team today 00 / 00 /_0000 at 00 . 00
negative	quote :
negative	i apologise for the delay in getting back to you .
negative	the voucher refund has_been processed on the 00th of march back to payment_method and you should receive the same within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	now i don_'_t know whether this is a direct result of me theatening legal_action ( appropriate complaint form was already filed with watford trading_standards 00th_march ) or the result of emails sent directly to persons i have been led to believe are directors of cex ( linkedin is a useful website ) whatever , one should not have to resort to such measures if a company wants to retain a loyal_customer base and for them to be successful , that requires a proffesionally run after care customer service dept .
negative	which is clearly non_existent in this case !
negative	let '_s see if my account is refunded in quote : 0 - 0 working_days from 00th of march .
negative	ttfn
negative	sorry its been so long for an update but have been unwell ( this case being a contributory factor )
negative	i finally received monies owed on 00th of march but no proper explanation , appology or offer of recompense for all the inconvenience_caused !
negative	so you can safely say that i won_'_t be having any further dealings with ( we don_'_t care ) @ webuy . com
negative	buyers_beware , if you use this site as the initial service received when purchasing is pretty good but if you have a problem of any sort , its pretty damned ugly !
negative	!
negative	signing out for good .
negative	g . corlay
negative	ordered 0 t shirts with my own logo came on reasonable time but !
negative	printing out of align sent them back , but due to lack of communication & with no one answering the phone i don_'_t know what the hell is going on .
negative	i have made several phone_calls different times of the day & all you get is a answer machine . i have sent several emails no reply its a complete_joke .
negative	this was going to be a large order ?
negative	never order from this company , you will not receive your goods .
negative	i ordered two t shirts on 00 . 00 . 0000 and have not received them at time of writing this review - 00 . 00 . 0000 .
negative	there is no telephone_number to speak to anybody and i have sent three emails asking where my goods are and no reply .
negative	i have sent a recorded delivery letter to their wakefield address asking for the goods or my monies reimbursed , but still no response .
negative	they only conned £_00 . 00 out of me but i am still pursuing them through trading_standards .
negative	annoyingly i failed to read the reviews on this website relating to argoth before ordering , but you live and learn !
negative	!
negative	i am so sick of explaining my problems with bt that i won_'_t bore anyone with the detail .
negative	but suffice it to say that i have today spoken to trading_standards and they say i have a case .
negative	they have delivered me nothing but headaches peppered with 00 minute fruitless and frustrating calls to their customer helpline , broken_promises and shoddy service .
negative	don_'_t do it ... you ' d find doing smoke signals to communicate a lot more efficient .
negative	i booked several parcels on the same day with different carriers , theough parcel0go .
negative	the myhermes man turned_up and insisted on taking a parcel that was not booked through myhermes and which had a tnt label on it .
negative	my employee tried to explain , but the driver was insistent to the point of agression that he had to take the parcel .
negative	i rang parcel0go within 0 minutes of this , but myhermes did not respond .
negative	several days of parcel0go telling_me that " myhermes would not respond within 00_hours " ensued .
negative	but myhermes did not respond at all .
negative	they then lost my parcel but refused to pay compensation .
negative	as a result i lost a valued regular customer .
negative	all in all a total disgrace , would never use them again ..
negative	the fall of icuk
negative	having been with icuk for several_years we ’ ve experienced first - hand the gradual degradation of the quality of service and network performance of this isp .
negative	once a shining_example of a british broadband provider who worked hard to stand out from the big players by providing a premium but reliable internet service , icuk is now nothing more than an overpriced minnow .
negative	the service
negative	firstly , icuk are a bt reseller .
negative	as a result , they cannot ( or at_least have been incompetent in doing so ) quickly and responsively regulate the amount of bandwidth available to their subscription base .
negative	as the slow speeds in certain areas and cripplingly frequent packet loss demonstrate , the small company don_’ t possess enough clout to force bt ’_s hand to increase their bandwidth when they need it most .
negative	prime examples of this include major sporting events .
negative	during the olympics , for example , we could barely load webpages for a fortnight whilst icuk support staff complained that bt hadn ’ t yet processed their request for more bandwidth ( the request being two_weeks outstanding by that stage ).
negative	this leaves you and i , the paying customers , with high pings , packet loss exceeding 00_% and sore fingers from typing so many frustrated emails to their support staff over the weekend .
negative	telephone support is only available on weekdays and ends at 00 : 00 .
negative	you probably won ’ t be surprised to learn that most issues occur outside of working hours when the majority of people are actually using their internet after coming home from a hard day ’_s work .
negative	even on icuk ’_s more_expensive ‘ business ’ package ( as we were ) the worst times for congestion were evenings and weekends ; not standard ‘ business ’ hours – don_’ t fall for this scam like we did .
negative	when you find you can only download at 000kb / s ( likely due to network congestion from the aforementioned lack of bandwidth for the entire icuk network or as a result of traffic shaping implemented to compensate the lack of bandwidth ), your only means of resolution is to fire off an_email to their support_team which will go unanswered until the following_day .
negative	by this time , tests and assessments of your service will be performed outside of peak hours and an_email will follow asking for you to provide more information as they ‘ cannot see a problem from their end ’.
negative	the support
negative	that last line will probably be one of the most common phrases you will hear from icuk .
negative	during the olympics fiasco mentioned_above ( one of many , i must add ) icuk went to the extent of sending an engineer to our house to check the bt lines ( all which were of perfect working order ) before finally letting slip that it might have been their chronically oversubscribed infrastructure that was causing the problem .
negative	this was quietly admitted to us in what was probably the 00th email exchange between us and four different members of their support_team ( most of whom are very friendly and genuinely seem to want to help , it must be said ).
negative	after that point we were implicitly invited to leave icuk by their staff and it was implied that the problems we suffered as a result of the oversubscription would be a regular occurrence .
negative	this was indeed the case .
negative	why icuk ?
negative	( why indeed !?)
negative	one therefore has to consider what the advantages of icuk are over other resellers and isps .
negative	the ( limited ) uk service support is arguably better_than many of the biggest isps and the staff are for the large part friendly and with good intentions .
negative	we had only one truly poor engineer assist us and he was removed from our support case after a week of failing to progress matters ( not that this ultimately expedited a resolution ).
negative	that said , having better customer support than the likes of bt is far from high praise and many other smaller uk isps offer similar or better support to their customers ( including during the hours you will actually be using the internet if you ’ re in gainful employment ).
negative	in terms of pricing , we found icuk to be slightly more_expensive than other similarly sized isps due to their tiered bandwidth pricing .
negative	this is alleviated somewhat if you choose to bundle line_rental with them ( as we did – not recommended as it ’_s more inconvenient / expensive to ultimately leave ).
negative	as discussed , the quality of the internet service was frequently extremely poor and we had consistent problems throughout our time with icuk , none of which were identified as issues with our hardware or anything our end .
negative	the premium pricing therefore no_longer translates to a better quality of service , unlike it did at the time when we first joined all those years_ago .
negative	if you don_’ t use the internet for anything more than web browsing then one of the cheaper packages would perhaps be suited for you .
negative	if , however , you or any member of your family enjoys online gaming , streaming online television services ( netflix , etc_.)
negative	or hasn ’ t a substantial_amount of free time to endlessly chase their support staff , then icuk is definitely not for you .
negative	our household have since changed to a similar small uk isp and could not be_happier with the quality of service we ’ ve received .
negative	given the countless hours of frustration and time we ’ ve wasted with icuk i can only make one good faith recommendation to other consumers : avoid .
negative	and so this dispicable saga goes on .
negative	last_week as the response from world_stores indicates i received an apologetic voice_mail , asking me to ring them to discuss , as they recognise that there has_been errors and mistakes that were unacceptable with my order and that they have now upgraded me for a saturday delivery .
negative	what they forgot to say was it doesn_'_t matter how many_times you ring the number ( in my case 00 times to date ) they will not answer .
negative	what they also failed to do was obviously advise the couriers that they are to deliver saturday , because they turned_up yesterday morning and duly awoke our neighbour who works nights to take the delivery in for me , which did not go down well at all .
negative	then , to my total disbelief , i find that both the tables that they have delivered are damaged .
negative	world_stores , even you could not make this any worse if you tried !!
negative	!
negative	of course i rang their contact number and guess_what , no one could assist me and i would need to call the complaints_dept on the number that no one answers .
negative	i will not however , relent until i have a satisfactory_conclusion to this total farce .
negative	but then , i will never return to world_stores and advise_anyone_else to seriously think_twice .
negative	they don_'_t even do the words incompetent , disorganised , chaos or unreliable justice "...................
negative	ordered coffee_table and occasional table .
negative	coffee_table arrived prompt with order update saying other table will be delayed by supplier .
negative	had to wait on calls for nearly an_hour to get update and emailed re the same .
negative	received email_stating order coming 0st oct .
negative	waited in all day for the 0nd time to then receive a call saying problem with table .
negative	shouldn_'_t have been allowed to order one because they come in pairs .
negative	would like like to double my cost ??
negative	no .
negative	agreed their mistake and they accepted and promised to deliver friday 0th_october .
negative	it '_s now 0 . 00pm and stayed in a third day and nothing here as yet .
negative	rang them up and currently still holding on after 0hr and 00_minutes
negative	by far the worst organization i have dealt_with .
negative	never known such a poor delivery service by on line traders
negative	argos have lost plot on customer service .
negative	ordered bbq form ebay may .
negative	got a call a little later to say first available delivery 00 june .
negative	not ideal , but said ok . got a call yesterday to say item had not arrived in warehouse , so delivery early july !
negative	why advertise what you do not have ?
negative	queried what was included with item , told don_'_t know see manufactures web_site .
negative	what is sold by manufacturer includes cover and gas regulator .
negative	why don_'_t they say !
negative	bought dyson handheld vacuum from local_store yesterday .
negative	offer included free accessory_kit .
negative	not available at time of purchase .
negative	told to look online to see when available .
negative	then reserve on line , and make additional trip to pick_up at own_expense !
negative	why not take customer details , and offer to post free of charge ?
negative	luckily i don_'_t run my business in the same way , otherwise i wouldn_'_t even have a shirt on my back !!

negative	i moved to an empty flat in london in august , and must have spent in excess of gbp 0 , 000 since then at tesco , both online as well in the nearest store .
negative	i am not used to order grocery online and was admittedly a bit_skeptical at my first delivery , that never arrived .
negative	after phoning tesco they initially told me it was my fault for not being at home , but they discovered that although my address was right in the system the print for the driver somehow cut_off the last digit in my flat no so they delivered to the wrong flat .
negative	tesco assured this would be corrected , but due to shortage of people they could no_longer deliver that day .
negative	0nd , 0rd and 0th time the same happened except the portner saw my name and knew it was wrong so they got here anyway .
negative	today we have a new portner here and the same thing happened , the grocery newer reached me .
negative	well after a identical conversation as the first time , tesco realized that they did not correct the mistake , and assured me from the call_center in scotland that they would deliver this same day .
negative	well after having heard_nothing for two hours i called again and was told they have staff shortage ( where have i heard that before ) and could not deliver .
negative	now i had it , i will now give sainsbury a chance and suggest everybody_else does the same .
negative	they advertised that it would take two days to process an order , and three or four days to deliver .
negative	they took my money in seconds , but nearly a week_later they were still " processing " the order .
negative	when i first tried to cancel , they begged me not to saying they would be able to send my " camera " within a week .
negative	i was not reassured - i had ordered a mobile_phone .
negative	i cancelled .
negative	it has taken seven weeks to get a refund from them during which time i have sent innumerable e_- mails , telephoned and hand to stand the interest charges on my credit_card .
negative	avoid them .
negative	buy somewhere_else .
negative	dreadful call_centre wait times - held on for 00_minutes today ( after the initial message said wait times were around 00 min ).
negative	when i got through was advised i need to call again tomorrow to get a mac_code or for alternative broadband deals .
negative	there should be the ability to get a refund if a persons status changes , and cannot make it to an event , due to unforeseen circumstances .
negative	received order confirmation on the 00th_feb to say flowers would arrive 00th_feb , however they did not arrive . when tried to contact iflorist was unable to as they were offline and telephone line was engaged . eventually sent an_email , stating flowers had not arrive . did not receive reply back until 00th saying flowers were on way . when they arrived they were dying . they were a day late and put round back of house by delivery van . wished i ' d gone else where .
negative	multiple locations in the s . w and midlands but all had sales staff that did not care one hoot for potential buyers .
negative	drove 000_miles to test_drive a car in solihull - they forgot i was coming .
negative	eventually got 0 mins in the car and decided to take it further .
negative	could not give me p / x on the day but , fine .
negative	eventually called me back 0 days_later - when i said the price offered it was a bit low , never_heard back .
negative	their loss - bought car for 00_% more than i was going for with them 0 days_later from an smaller jag franchise .
negative	we feel that we have been let_down very badly by this company !
negative	their customer_services are a total shambles , they either ignore you or just don_'_t answer any of your comments .
negative	they havent answered an_email for over a month !
negative	we have been trying to obtain a refund for an item we purchased , we have been fed a saga of lies , changing information and today when it was promised the goods woould be returned to us " repaired " they have failed to deliver them .
negative	this company is excellent if you don_'_t have a problem but any issue with the product they make life very very difficult ...
negative	in future we will be more concerned about customer service than just the lowest_price ...
negative	sent an_email on monday re complaint as this company only works from 0 - 0 , no good to the people that work for a living !!
negative	still no reply , cant book a voucher , restaurant don_'_t want to know and refer you back to wowcher !!
negative	anyone going to respond !!!
negative	!
negative	ordered flowers well in time for valentine '_s day then got an e_- mail at 00 :_00pm on the 00th_feb to say the courier can '_t find the address ?
negative	this being the very same address where sereneta have delivered before ?
negative	was offered a 00_%_off voucher for guaranteed valentine '_s day delivery .
negative	surprise , surprise , the flowers i ordered had doubled in price !!
negative	phoned the customer_services line .
negative	operator very unhelpful and said that they had loads of these incidents and nothing could be done apart_from a full_refund !
negative	wow , generous or what ?
negative	similar messages posted on social_media websites were somehow ' deleted ' sorry tippexed out mysteriously !
negative	i for one will never use them again .... goodbye sereneta , go and ruin someone_else '_s day !
negative	we ordered a 0ft wide mattress , delivery was as arranged but when dropped_off men did not hang_around long enough for us to check it .
negative	it turns_out that we had the wrong_size 0 ' 0 which is too narrow .
negative	we phoned customer_services who insisted we got what we ordered , they refusd to believe us when we told them we clicked on 0ft one , then said it was out fault because the size was not mentioned in confirmation_email it say '_s small single it does not mention exact size , if it did say 0 ' 0 we would have phoned to point out their mistake .
negative	they would only exchange mattresses if we paid a £_00 handling charge .
negative	we offered to meet them half way and pay £_00 but they refused .
negative	we have been advised by trading_standards that under the sale of goods_act 0000 we received an item that was not as descibed , so we are entitled to a refund or exchange .
negative	as matressman have refused the exchange we have had to buy another mattress from another dealer so our disabled child has somewhere to sleep , so will now be insisting on a full_refund .
negative	as instructed by trading_standards we will be writing via recorded delivery , stating our case .
negative	they are satisfied that the actual size is not mentioned in your email .
negative	and as mattressman customer_services said before we were put through to the assistant_manager and not the manger as requested , small single could be one of a few sizes .
negative	mattressman order : mm000000
negative	think carefully before you do_business with this company .
negative	i bought a pair of expensive ray - ban prescription lens sunglasses .
negative	they arrived eventually ... so far so good ...
negative	then a few_months later i broke one of the lenses .
negative	i contacted vd who offered to fix the lenses for a fee and it would take 0 weeks .. so far so good .. that was back in june_0000 ..
negative	it is now late september and multiple stalling emails from vd reveal they have lost my glasses in hong_kong .
negative	okay these things happen but it has taken them 0 months to admit it and now they don_'_t want to take_responsibility .
negative	my glasses cost over $_000 . 00 and i also paid around $_000 . 00 for the repair up front .
negative	so now i have no glasses and have paid for a repair .. every time vd contacts me it is someone_else .
negative	lesson_learned .
negative	when you can '_t physically walk into a store and complain you stand a chance in being treated like dirt .
negative	all i want is my repair money refunded and my property back or my glasses replaced but am getting_nowhere .
negative	avoid ........... avoid ............ avoid !
negative	0000 customer service prem rate no ,££ customer service operators work from asia very poor english
negative	00p a minute to land lines in the uk shocking
negative	i have been a customer for 00 years in the last 0 months the charges have gone_through the roof
negative	almost_impossible to speak to customer service via your mobile
negative	all automated now then it will cut you off
negative	" t " mobile offered me a deal yesterday when i asked for my pat code and told them i had enough and was leaving , 000 minutes 000 texts and a freephone upgrade .. ok i said .. today the phone arrived with a bill of £_00 . 00 receipted " paid " they have taken £_00 . 00 form my credit_card without authorisation enough !
negative	my advise to all avoid .. avoid ... avoid terrible service !
negative	misleading salesmen very expensive just awful
negative	i ordered a fridge from powerdirect .
negative	payment was taken at the time of order .
negative	however , 0 days_later i received an_email_saying that the fridge i had ordered was no_longer being manufactured and would i like an_alternative .
negative	i then had to fill out a refund form to get the money back ( within " up to 00 days ") that they shouldn_'_t have taken in the first place .
negative	my follow_up email asking why they had taken payment blamed sagepay .
negative	i know how sagepay works , and the powerdirect representative was lying .
negative	pay about 00 pounds a month for an abysmal service .
negative	engineers not showing up three_times now , uncaring customer service team .
negative	do not go near this company !
negative	ultimate_appliances must be the worst internet based company i have ever had the misfortune to encounter .
negative	they delivered the item late , to the wrong_address and when re - scheduled , i travelled 000_miles to receive the item , which they were fully_aware of and they then decided they would not deliver at all .
negative	it is now some 0 weeks and i am still_waiting for a refund .
negative	this matter has now been placed into the hands of my solicitor and trading_standards .
negative	i have now been contacted my numerous other ultimate appliance customers who all have similar stories to tell .
negative	bbc rogue_traders have now taken up this case - to date i have been contacted by no less_than 00 dissatisfied_customers who have lodged formal complaints against [_name_removed_] the managing_director of ultimate_appliances .
negative	if anyone_else has similarly suffered , please dont hesitate to get in contact with me .
negative	subsequent to my post i have received a threat of legal_action by the managing_director of this company in which he has attempted to intimidate me into silence .
negative	i will not be silenced .
negative	the facts are irrefutable .
negative	anyone_wishing to purchase from this retailer , should contact all of those customers who '_s reviews have been removed - contact trust_pilot to ask for the list .
negative	the majority of them will be willing to share their experiences which have been extremely negative .
negative	do your homework before buying from these_people .
negative	i ended_up buying from john_lewis who were exceptional and i would never hesitate to use them in the future
negative	o0 own this company and think its a great business plan to provide a service hiding_behind a new name " giffgaff " where they get the actual customer to provide all the support .
negative	if you think that is great then blimey :-)
negative	followed there instructions on how to unlock my iphone and what a shock it meant i had to take it to apple for a replacement .
negative	avoid !
negative	hello again ,
negative	another courier moan and groan from me , maybe i ' m just unlucky ?
negative	booked a delivery through parcel0go , thought i ' d try city_link , next_day service , city_link failed to collect two days running .
negative	rang city_link to ask why ?
negative	they said it was an i . t .
negative	problem with their new system and issued a new tracking_number and promise of collection , they also gave me a number to contact parcel0go for a refund .
negative	rang parcel0go , they said i could not have a refund as there was no guarantee of collection ( basically hard luck !
negative	), they then changed the courier to tnt as they said they were more reliable than city_link ????
negative	?
negative	rang city_link who said only parcel0go could issue a refund ,
negative	at this point i gave up !
negative	city_link let me down but cant give a refund and parcel0go wont give a refund , where do i stand ???
negative	?
negative	i have refunded my customers post as i ' m an honest kind of guy and don_'_t like people to be let_down , my loss i know but i prefer to be honest .
negative	look at all the other reviews for city_link , what a terrible company record , so bad i suspect the only good reviews are from their employees paid to do so .
negative	update , update , update !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	city_link asked me to contact them after_reading this review ,
negative	i did and this is the message i recieved .
negative	good afternoon mr brammer ,
negative	further from my recent email , i am sorry for the delay in responding to you .
negative	thank_you for your patience and understanding .
negative	the depot manager at shrewsbury has_been investigating further and we have discovered that there has_been an it issue , resulting in your consignments not being allocated to their depot for collection .
negative	they have reported the problem to our it department to ensure this gets resolved as quickly as possible .
negative	i understand you have booked a new collection for today , they have confirmed this has now been allocated to a driver to ensure you have no further delays .
negative	once again , please_accept our apologies for the inconvenience or frustration that has_been caused on this occasion .
negative	if there is anything_else i can help you with then do get in touch .
negative	kind_regards ,
negative	s . a .
negative	city_link
negative	this was my response
negative	hello s . a . city_link
negative	once again i have to say i am in disbelief !
negative	you have spent the morning gathering information that i already have ?
negative	did you read my review ?
negative	it clearly_states i was aware of an it problem , i told you that ?
negative	it also states tnt are now the couriers for this consignment and they have collected it in the last hour ,
negative	so why city_link are collecting today as well is beyond me , they probably wont turn_up anyway .
negative	my point is i ’ ve had to refund my customer as he paid for 00 hr courier not 00 hr courier .
negative	i shall now add this further info to my trustpilot review as my time has_been wasted even further what a joke !
negative	end .
negative	what a waste of time , they responded to my review without reading it ,
negative	beggars_belief .
negative	i run a busy ebay shop , have about 000 sales a week and for the last two years used ipostparcels to deliver my parcels ,
negative	recently they started to miss collections so i thought i would give yodel a go , they couldn ’ t be any worse , could they ?
negative	well , after visiting the yodel website , clicking on yodel direct , setting_up an account of i went ,
negative	my first parcel about 0kg and measuring 00cm square was booked in for 00 hr delivery and next_day collection as a tester , the driver arrived , signed for the collection and left me with a collection note , the collection note had a different tracking_number than i was given by the website ?
negative	yodel directs tracking_number starts with yol
negative	yodels tracking_number starts with jd00
negative	pleased my parcel had been collected on time i thought all was well !
negative	next_day i tracked the parcel online , the parcel was at the local wrexham service centre ( yodel ),
negative	not out for delivery as expected ?
negative	i thought let ’_s give them an extra day !
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , i rang yodel , the customer service member said he would raise a flag on the parcel and it would be delivered in the next 00_hrs .
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , i web chatted with a yodel representative , she said she would raise a flag and asked about the parcel contents .
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , , i web chatted again ( now getting a bit angry ) with a yodel representative , he apologised asked about the parcel contents and raised an even bigger flag to find the parcel .
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , my customer emailed me to cancel the order as he had lost patience and bought locally ( don_’ t blame him ), i refunded him in full , total of £_00
negative	i web chatted again ( now getting very angry ) with a yodel representative , he apologised ,
negative	i told him if the parcel was found to return to my address , he confirmed this would happen .
negative	the day after that the parcel was not in wrexham , it had been delivered five days late to the customer that had cancelled , and not back to me ????
negative	?
negative	yodel chat begins
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 hi david , my name is [_name ].
negative	how can i help ?
negative	david_: 00 : 00 : 00 gave tracking_number
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 thank_you .
negative	can you please confirm your full name ?
negative	david_: 00 : 00 : 00 this item went missing for 0 days last_week , eventually my customer cancelled the order and bought his items locally , i had a live_chat on friday asking if it was found please return to me .
negative	i was told it would be , it has now been found and delivered to the original address
negative	00 : 00 : 00 my address is entered address 00 : 00 : 00 how will i now get my items back ?
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 thank_you , david .
negative	can you please confirm the customers full name ?
negative	david_: 00 : 00 : 00 customers name is gave name , i have been so let_down and messed about its unbelievable !
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i apologise about this confusion here , david , but there '_s no notes to show that the parcel was requested to be returned back to you .
negative	david_: 00 : 00 : 00 this is the first item i sent with yodel , and what a total failure it has_been , the live_chat on friday confirmed it would be , i cant remember the name but it was a man
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i apologise about that , david .
negative	if you ' re wanting to retrieve the parcel , then you can book a collection of the parcel from your customer .
negative	david_: 00 : 00 : 00 how do i do that ?
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 you can raise the issue with the yodel direct online web chat team and they will be able to book the collection in for you as well .
negative	david_: 00 : 00 : 00 are you saying i have to pay to get it back after its yodels mistake ?
negative	00 : 00 : 00 or can you book it in now ?
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i cannot book collections for yodel direct customers , as we ' re technically separate companies .
negative	if you speak with their online web chat team , like you ' re doing with me , you will be able to query this with them .
negative	david_: 00 : 00 : 00 another failure , unbelievable waste of time .
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i apologise for the inconvenience_caused here , david .
negative	david_: 00 : 00 : 00 s far as i can see yodel yodel direct have no contact details or online web chat team
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 there '_s a help button in the top corner of the page , and it will present you with some questions .
negative	if you answer one of these it will give you a link to the web chat team .
negative	stop ?
negative	lets stop a minute .
negative	question , why is it when you visit yodels web_page the online_chat almost throws itself at you ?
negative	but when you visit yodel directs web_page you have no obvious contact ?
negative	you have to click on help , pick a question and if your lucky an option appears for a web chat ?
negative	hiding like a frightened mouse with no hole to go down and the breath of a hungry cat warming its face ?
negative	now lets continue .
negative	yodel direct chat begins
negative	you are now chatting with yodel direct
negative	yodel : hi david .
negative	yodel : im_afraid this has_been delivered david .
negative	if you wish for this to be returned you will need to make a new order .
negative	david_: yodel have delivered this in error , are you saying i have to pay for yodels mistake ?
negative	david_: i was told if found it would be sent back to me .
negative	yodel : we was never contacted to advise for this to be returned david .
negative	david_: yes you were on friday i had a live_chat and it was confirmed .
negative	yodel : we have never been contacted you chatted with yodel david who as i can see from above told you you needed to contact yodeldirect
negative	david_: i contacted yodel who told me once found it would be returned , now after loosing the parcel for five days , upsetting my customer , hours of typing loss of sales , your telling_me i have to pay to get my items back ?
negative	yodel : you have not contacted yodeldirect david which is who you booked with .
negative	this has_been delivered .
negative	david_: i contact yodel who told me it would be returned , only this morning did they tell me to contact you , also my item was delivered five days late so i should have a refund on my post
negative	yodel : im_afraid the service which we offer is non guaranteed which is stated when booking david . yodel :
negative	ouch !
negative	ouch !
negative	ouch !
negative	david_: your reviews on trustpilot are a disgrace and i can see why , you treat_customers like dirt .
negative	and pass the buck from one side to the other , and for the sake of returning a parcel you have now lost hundreds of deliveries from my company company name , it beggers belief .
negative	yodel : im very sorry to hear this david .
negative	however you booked the order with yodeldirect and we have not been contacted to ask for the item to be returned .
negative	yes booked yodeldirect but given yodel tracking_number frightened mouse !
negative	lets spin a coin , heads it gets delivered tails it dont .
negative	david_: in the end its yodels loss , i will write lots of reviews and post them , you will lose my business and many others for the incompetence yodel has shown .
negative	yodel : is there anything_else i can help you with ?
negative	david_: you are like a robot , and follow rules but this is no joke repeating the same answer , please can some one superior contact me on phone number
negative	yodel : i am the online supervisor david , as i have advised if you wish for the item to be returned this will be on your_own accord .
negative	david_: goodbye yodel , one huge let - down , one joke of a company , one parcel sent and one big_mistake .
negative	and there we have it , i now have to pay to get my items back , there is no refund for late delivery ( 00_hrs took 0 days ) and yodel are two different companies , with two tracking_numbers and probably too many chiefs and not enough indians .
negative	i was given a yodel tracking_number but told i should have contacted yodel direct , confusing isn_'_t it ?
negative	it seems they split the company so one side can blame the other , i mean how do you loose a parcel for 0 days and then make the customer fight for any kind of refund , instead of a refund they kick you whilst your down ?
negative	?.
negative	i post 000 parcels a week if yodel were a football team they would lose 000 - 0 ever week mostly from own goals , and their manager would be sacked .
negative	nice one yodel , welcome to the conference of couriers .
negative	other reviews say it all .
negative	[_external_reference_] deluged with complaints over yodel '_s poor delivery service
negative	more than 0 , 000 customers call for [_external_reference_] to join [_external references ] in ditching parcel carrier yodel
negative	thank_you for listening ,
negative	regards ,
negative	david .
negative	after many_years of using ipostparcels , i can_honestly say this company has now gone into complete disarray , one missed collection after another , no phone number , no customer_care , sent emails get no response despite their claims to get back to you in three hours , you are totally at the mercy of a roulette wheel with this company you bet red or black and it comes up a sickly green .
negative	they used to be very good , but i can only think internally they are now in chaos .
negative	goodbye ipostparcels r . i . p
negative	had oil and vinegar drizzlers bought me as a gift .
negative	returned them by post (£ 0 . 00 ) as both stoppers kept rising out of the bottles rendering them useless .
negative	procook told me that only one bottle acted thus and they would not be refunding my postage as i had not phoned them first for an authorisation_code !
negative	firstly , i do not like being called a liar .
negative	secondly , someone should train them up in customer_services and teach them not to tell their bread and butter whether their goods work or not .
negative	i had never_heard of procook until i received this gift but will make_sure i never by from them .
negative	i booked a vehicle on line from economy_car rentals in march_0000 for a week in august that they described on their website as ‘ intermediate , ford_focus or similar ’ and the capacity of the boot was described as ‘ 0 large suitcases 000_litres and 0 small suitcases 00 litres ’.
negative	i deliberately did not book the small car option .
negative	when we arrived to pick_up the vehicle at dalaman airport in turkey the representative from sax car_rental presented us with a tiny renault clio .
negative	i explained that this was not the type of car i had paid and after insisting that this was not satisfactory she made a call to her manager and then told me there was no other car available and that as far as the rental company was concerned i could take it or leave it .
negative	by now the whole family and all our holiday luggage was on a petrol_station forecourt in the dark next to a busy road leading to the airport .
negative	we had no alternative but to put all our_luggage into the boot and back seat and accept the vehicle .
negative	when i complained to economy_car rentals they investigated and then copied me in on a very rude email from their representatives sax car_rental suggesting that a renault clio was the same size as a ford_focus with the same boot capacity !
negative	sax concluded that “ the tourists think that they found something to complain and a probability to get refunded .”
negative	economy_car rentals have accepted no responsibility for their representative in turkey and have ignored my correspondence , so i can only conclude that they too benefit from charging customers for an intermediate size vehicle and then pocket excessive profits by providing a small lower tariff vehicle .
negative	don_’ t hire from these_crooks .
negative	waited in for engineer but no show and no service .. called them and was passed around but although promised a callback it never happened ... so tonight after_reading all these reviews cancelled my order ... been transferred to the phiilapines / uk and bangalore ...
negative	just to cancel ..
negative	will take the advice of cancelling any direct_debits - even_though i have never had service ..
negative	think i have had a lucky_escape ...
negative	we ordered a suite for delivery in feb , the delivery date was given to us .
negative	we sold our old suite for £_000 and the lady was due to collect from hull , she had hired a van .
negative	we then get a phone_call to say that our suite hadnt even been made and that the delivery was not going ahead .
negative	we had to cancel the sale of our suite and pay her £_00 compensation for her inconvenience .
negative	we explained this to the md and he said ' your problem not ours ' a couldnt care_less attitude .
negative	two new dates were arranged but we had to postpone due to urgent family issues .
negative	the we get a letter from ( name ) saying that they wanted to cancel the contract and give us a refund due to us not being abl to take delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 when we are out of the country .
negative	this company are a joke , my wife saw red and told them to cancel the order and a refund is now anticipated .
negative	i wouldnt recommend this outfit to my own worst enemies they couldnt give a damn about loyalty to customers and they really dont realise that without us they wont continue in business .
negative	before you buy from them google nitrotek complaints and read a few .
negative	i bought an a00 thunderbolt plane that from the word go had two unbalanced engines which would not even taxi in a straight line .
negative	sent the engines back - they could not find anything wrong .
negative	i sent it all back under the distance_selling regulations as faulty .
negative	nearly a week_later no replies , no acknowledgement and no refund .
negative	fortunately i paid by credit_card so will be pursuing them for refund and return postage_costs .
negative	james_villas have some great properties but if you have a problem with a property they do not help in any way as you will see from other review_sites .
negative	we booked a top of the range villa in costa blanca a while back .
negative	we had checked with the company to find the best villa for our needs - in a quiet area near shops and facilities so the kids could be a bit independant , and when we arrived at the villa it was miles from the town on a main_road , totally opposite to our requirements .
negative	the villa furthermore was very dirty , the beds were very short ( 0 ' 0 ") and as our boys were 0 ' 0 " and 0 ' 0 " respectively were unfit for purpose .
negative	we were told that as spanish people are shorter than english people the size was normal for the area !
negative	the sofa was filthy and consisted of a narrow plank across as a seat which was not only uncomfortable but dangerous as we kept falling down the holes on either side , the only other chair broke the first time it was used , the kitchen was infested with insects ( rep told me that if i cleaned it they should go away - this was in our first day so left like this for us ); and there was a building site across the road and as the pool was in the front_garden it couldn_'_t be used as dust blew across it all day , never mind the noise from drill , men , cars etc .
negative	we rang immediately after arrival to ask to be moved or flown home , they had no other villa in the area available and could not get us on a flight home until our due date in two_weeks .
negative	we couldn_'_t stay in the villa so had to book into a hotel that cost mega bucks as we hadn_'_t pre booked and what did james_villas offer a compensation - yes you '_ve guessed it not a penny .
negative	as i say lots of you have had great holidays , but if a problem they leave you high and dry and don_'_t help at all , oh sorry the rep did bring a desk fan so the windows could be kept shut at night because of the road noise , didn_'_t go far between five of us .
negative	james_villas shame on you
negative	whenever we have bought phones through carphone_warehouse there have been problems when it comes to a ) cancelling contract at the end of the term , b ) sorting_out problems with the phones .
negative	we always ended_up with a fight on our hands as they consistently state they never received notification of the contact cancelling so you end up paying for numerous extra months .
negative	you can never get a straight answer out of the staff either on the phone or in store , it is always someone_else who needs to help you !!
negative	!
negative	purchased a blu_ray on 00 october .
negative	told that it wasn_'_t in stock and no details of when it would be available .
negative	cancelled order but they still took the money and no refund to date .
negative	telephone doesn_'_t get answered .
negative	the comapny is a sham and it is about time either trading_standards or the isp '_s collectively do something to stop consumers being_ripped_off yet again
negative	i placed an order on saturday for 0xbasin taps !
negative	being a typical female i did not , at the time , realise that basin and bath_taps are different !
negative	not wishing the wrong taps being sent , i immediately called these_people on the first working day after the order , ie yesterday mon 0 dec .
negative	these_people are impossible to reach on the phone , and calling an 0000 number from a mobile and holding on for 00 - 00 minute stretches at a time costs a fortune !
negative	i eventually gave up on the after_sales_team and decided to speak to the sales_team who miraculously answered the phone immediately !
negative	funny that !!
negative	!
negative	when the guy who answered realised i had a query and was not placing an order he curtly told me he could not help and that he would put me on hold and i should dial 0 or 0 and speak to someone !
negative	but nobody answers just a message_saying all they are experiencing unusual high call volumns ( hardly surprisiing since this company seems to want to take money but provide nothing else )!!!
negative	so i sent a message via their contact form on the website not realising i would have to wait 00_hours for a reply !
negative	i did eventually speak to someone , explained my problem and they could not or would not swap the order and take the additional small fee , so i asked them to cancel the order to which the woman i spoke to said she would do so .
negative	not really trusting her less_than enthusiastic assistance , i asked for confirmation in writing !
negative	around 0 : 00 yesterday evening when i had not seen a cancellation confirmation i emailed them , to which no reply !
negative	no surprise there then - another example of this companies substandard attitude_towards customer_care !!
negative	!
negative	imagine my surprise when , low and behold , i did receive an_email from them , but only to happily inform me that the taps i had asked them to cancel has_been despatched !!!
negative	to say that i am fuming is putting it mildly !!
negative	!
negative	if i had a positive , whether you want a product or not , it does at_least turn_up fast !!!
negative	the damn taps arrived at 0 :_00am this morning , and i have handed them straight back to the driver to be returned to this trueshopping !!
negative	!
negative	i now envisage a fight getting a prompt refund !!!
negative	if i have not received a full_refund by close of business friday 00th_december , then i reserve the right to take this matter to trading_standards , which or even watchdog !
negative	if they can debit my account with speed and efficiency , then they can credit the money back with the same speed and effciency !!!
negative	!
negative	yes i made a genuine error in assuming basin and bath_taps are one and the same , but this companies entire attitude and lack of due dilligence and care is appalling !
negative	honestly , i have never come_across any organization who has such a total disregard towards its customers !!!
negative	funny though how their sales_department phone line is never busy !!!
negative	!
negative	nutshell - avoid this company !
negative	----
negative	postscript : i have just taken the time to read through the various complaints concerning this company , in the main its lack of customer service , i have gone quite a way back ... time and again the replies that all these_people who have left a review have received from trueshopping is the same it is clearly a bog_standard copy / paste type of reply : and it reads :
negative	" i sincerely apologise for the lack of response from our customer service team .
negative	i can_assure you that this is not usual practice for us and is purely due to a high_volume of emails and calls being received at present .
negative	we are working on rectifying this ."
negative	how long does it take to " rectify " the lack of response from the customer service team !!
negative	clearly from what i can see their lack of customer service , lack of answering phones , answering emails is their usual practice !!!
negative	!
negative	i paid for a christian dior watch on 00nd november_0000 for a birthday_present .
negative	as i hadn_'_t heard_anything by 00th_december i contacted darren reay and was informed he had a throat infection .
negative	the next excuse was a massive snowfall on the east_coast of usa , then his supplier was in hospital , followed_by the only watch available had a diamond missing .
negative	the final excuse on 00st january_0000 of darren losing his voice meant i asked for my money back to be told i should contact my card_issuer and get them to do a chargeback .
negative	took my phone into the branch for repair , two_weeks_later not heard_anything - asst manager told me it was still in for repair .
negative	week_later i went back , another staff_member admitted the phone was left out the back and only sent off a day ago .
negative	manager refused to see me and was told nothing the branch could do .
negative	complained through main website and received response stating it was an internal matter and they don_'_t have to let me know what happens .
negative	they take your money , they make_mistakes , they have no morals or sense of customer service and they would lie to get away with it .
negative	dont shop at the carphonewarehouse !
negative	i had ordered a car vent mount for a blackberry 0000 ( 0000 ).
negative	it was listed for about £_00 .
negative	londonmagicstore cancelled the order then re - listed it for £_00 . 00 on both amazon and ebay .
negative	on ebay the item had showed 000 sold ..... not for that price .
negative	cashing in on christmas !
negative	avoid them they are hyping all their prices .
negative	placed an order for a quad bike before_christmas and was informed that it would probably arrive on the 00nd or 00rd dec but if not , definitely on the 00th .
negative	we ' re still_waiting !
negative	according to my online a / c it was dispatched on the 00th_jan despite me cancelling the order on the 00th .
negative	it never arrived .
negative	i have phoned every day since the 00nd_dec only to be told they are closed , have emailed and left messages on the website .
negative	nobody has contacted me at all .
negative	for an order of nearly_£_000 you would think they ' d make an effort .
negative	i disputed the payment with my credit_card company who have now refunded my account .
negative	definitely not recommending this company !!
negative	!
negative	i booked and paid for a premium economy flight with expedia .
negative	the ticket arrived via_email showing economy status . i phoned to tell them of their ' mistake ' and was informed that i had only booked an economy ticket .
negative	i explained that i wanted to travel the day before and by the time ( 0 mins ) that i had got through to the payment screen the quoted price had increased by over 000_pounds .
negative	i went back to the website , changed the flying day to the following_day , original price quoted , and quickly booked before the price could change .
negative	0 calls later , hours on the phone , being told it was my fault for contacting them half hour after they had paid the airline ( this was within one hour of receiving my economy email tickets ).
negative	i have been offered the opportunity to cancel for one hundred and fifty pounds or upgrade to a service that i have already paid for at the cost of three hundred_pounds .
negative	why is this ridiculous company still in operation ?
negative	do not use expedia , they are expert scammers .
negative	i made the mistake of thinking . com would be the same as the store the similarities end at the name , i oredered a £_000 value item for my wife as part of her xmas , despatched 00th00 , signed and recieved 00th 00 , really !!!
negative	well not by me or to me it wasnt after a few emails and some form repsonses , i called them direct was told it had been sent by hermes , ( see reviews ) who are just a joke , the signature was ilegible i was told and no printed surname availble good eh !!.
negative	i was then told i would be called before 00 . 00 next_day by both the call_centre and email .
negative	dept , the call never came , guess_what though the package did .
negative	around 0pm 0 days_later had been opened , handed to me with a grunt by some bloke in a motor with parcels lying all over the back seat , ( some opened ) never had to sign for it good eh i could have been anyone , ?
negative	anyway i logged compliant with john_lewis got a form response of its been passed here there and around , and the hermes company have been informed big deal , not even a sorry you were not called back or were it was first sent to why it was opened and who did indeed sign for it and why did i not have to ??
negative	you have been_warned steer_well clear folks
negative	ordered still not received despite paying for next_day delivery , emailed had no reply mailed again asking were my order is a further day later and another day still no reply and no watch avoid at all costs ,
negative	note
negative	after this review i finally got a reply and a postal refund and eventually the watch which they posted to my invoice address and not my delivery address ,
negative	if you ever have to return a faulty item as i did in this case a cheap electric planer with a clear design flaw .
negative	then dont hold your breath for a refund , as there refund policy is way over regulated every item has to be sent to a tech lab for testing 00 to 00 working_days_later you may get a refund , buyer_beware
negative	not anymore though .
negative	heres why greed !!!
negative	00_% of all items sold fee , plus listing fees plus photos plus paypal fees whats the point .!!
negative	and further more .
negative	this is the kicker if your a seller and the buyer chooses not pay you you cant leave negative feeback because thats not fair haaa !!
negative	but they can not only not pay you but leave you negative feeback brilliant idea ebay !!!
negative	whats needed here is competition folks
negative	i went to this company on the strength of the testimonials or there site , big_mistake .
negative	i sent a small chain away to them the value , the value they gave was some £_00 below my local shop , so i declined the offer it was then as they put it re - offered at £_00 more than the original and still below my high_street .
negative	so be ware i guess of accepting first offers and own web_site testimonials , give people an honest value at the start and you will get the business is the moral , ps , i took there " improved offer as for the extra £ 0 i would have got from the high_street in the end i could not be bothered and i guess someone who has lots of gold would be so its all relevant
negative	i made 0 orders to wiggle before my recent cycling holiday in spain both of them have been a disaster .
negative	both orders were not acknowledged by email one was delivered by collect_+ to my local spar and i couldn_'_t pick it up without the email even_though i had the order number and id
negative	the other was deliver 00 days after order even_though i had paid extra for first_class delivery
negative	i have contacted the 0 times by email and have not received one reply
negative	are they going_bust ?
negative	i ended_up buying everything in spain at decathlon which i would recommend !
negative	i recently_purchased a bathroom_suite from bathstore chelmsford , all went to plan up until delivery day .
negative	on opening the box_containing the sink basin i found the enamel to be scratched , i immediately contacted the store and arranged a replacement which was a 0 week wait .
negative	eventually the store made contact to inform me that the sink was in and ready to collect .
negative	when i arrived at the store i was handed a beaten up box_containing my new basin and considering the state of the packaging i thought it prudent to check the sink before leaving the store .
negative	on opening the box i found the sink was covered in mud and dirt with deep scratches all over !
negative	when i turned to the store manager for an explanation his answer was " well it is from our budget range what do you expect " this left me not only furious but also in an awkward position as i had already installed the bath and toilet , i could not wait another 0 weeks for another replacement so i was effectively forced to keep my old sink .
negative	hence to say , i will never ever buy anything from bathstore chelmsford or any other bathstore outlet again , they are nothing short of crooks dealing in second rate and damaged stock , their staff are rude , unhelpful with no morals .
negative	avoid at all costs
negative	i ordered flowers on 0 . 00 . 00 for my mother '_s birthday which was on 00 . 00 . 00 . the cost of the flowers was £_00 . 00 to which they added £ 0 . 00 for same day delivery even_though i had ordered 0 days in advance .
negative	on the 00 . 00 . 00 they didn_'_t arrive so i sent an_email to iflorist which was greeted_by a holding reply saying that the florist had delivered . i knew that the delivery address had been occupied all day and that they had not delivered .
negative	i sent several emails asking for proof of delivery and nothing more has_been heard from this company - i must also state that i was unable to contact them by phone because that facility was not available .
negative	my advice to anyone_thinking of using this company is don_'_t .
negative	they are very good at taking your money but useless at delivering flowers .
negative	€ 00 . 00 for " out of hours " at 0000 !!!!
negative	!
negative	charged for damage that was not done during hire , was even checked when car was returned !!
negative	!
negative	europcar mallta are complete thieves , avoid like the plague , real con_men .
negative	i was with xln telecom for a number of years when they rang me with a fixed price contract of around £_00 .
negative	i noticed that i was then paying more than before , so when i complained they brought it down to £_00 .
negative	i was then offered a new deal by a small local company for the same service for only £_00 so i gave notice to xln as required .
negative	i had checked this with them and knew that no fee was due .
negative	i gave almost 0 months notice .
negative	despite this , i was constantly bombarded with invoices for a termination fee of £_000 , even_though they knew perfectly well that this was not due .
negative	i got these invoices by email , sometimes several in one day , and also by post .
negative	i contacted them and asked to them to stop sending invoices but they continued .
negative	even after speaking on the phone to one of their employees who confirmed that no fee was due , the invoices continued on and on and on .
negative	i informed them that if they did not stop sending these invoices , i would cancel my direct_debit as i feared that they would illegally remove £_000 from my account .
negative	once again , no reply .
negative	i cancelled the direct_debit and informed them that i had done so and asked them to send the final invoice and i would pay by cheque .
negative	no reply .
negative	the never - ending invoices continued to arrive .
negative	the final invoice was for £ 0 of calls including vat and an invented charge for “ unpaid direct_debit ”.
negative	they also overcharged me for monthly fees as i was only with them for two_thirds of the final month but they charged for the whole month .
negative	i wrote to them on 00 . 00 . 00 explaining all this .
negative	once again , no reply .
negative	now they have written demanding the £_00 they say i owe them , threatening me with debt_collectors and damaging my credit rating .
negative	it would probably cost more to fight this than to just pay , so i am going to pay .
negative	hopefully karma will get them in the end .
negative	as i call them , over priced , un friendly staff ... not a great place at all
negative	very poor in my area .
negative	you even get points when you buy food , which we used to do every friday , i spent my points on something and i am still_waiting for the goods ( 0 years nearly ) everytime i ask they say they are still sorting it out .
negative	delivery was slow and so the food was cold
negative	ideal if your a chav ... tacky stuff
negative	so far i ' m up to about 00 emails to this company trying to sort_out a refund .
negative	they failed to deliver on time so i cancelled as per distance_selling regulations .
negative	they tried to deliver on a later date and forged my signature for the delivery - i was twenty miles_away in a meeting at the time .
negative	i haven_'_t had a single useful response from asos , good luck finding their phone number but here is an address to write to :
negative	asos head_office
negative	greater london house
negative	hampstead road
negative	london , nw0 0fb
negative	united_kingdom
negative	do not use this company .. you pay for the goods get the voucher then nothing arrives .. well and truly conned
negative	i used this company to send flowers to my wife , for a very important anniversary .
negative	they didn_'_t arrive on the day & when they did arrive , looked nothing like the web display .
negative	i complained but no satisfaction was given , this company doesn_'_t care about repeat_business , there are plenty of other mugs to bite .
negative	bought two front_tyres & had them fitted by one of their so called expert tyre_fitters .
negative	within two days my front off side tyre decided to remove itself from the wheel rim on the m00 motorway .
negative	i had the tyre inspected by a independent tyre_fitting company ( ruislip tyres ) who told me the old valves were not replaced & had failed .
negative	blackcircles retrieved the tyre for inspection & told me that they would contact me when they knew more .
negative	never_heard a thing for 0 months , so i contacted them , they just told me there was nothing wrong with the tyre .
negative	the tyres they sold me were very dangerous & the fitting_station they recommended was rubbish .
negative	bought 0 toilets , 0 sinks and a tap a few_weeks back .
negative	was emailed to say would be dispatched last monday , but then nothing .. no one picks up the phone or answers emails !
negative	after quite a few attempts managed to get through and insisted on speaking to their sales manager , who is alex featherstone .
negative	he promised me that someone would get back to me yesterday , no one did .
negative	terrible company .
negative	it has a premium_rate number for after_sales which just seems like a scam .
negative	i ' m not sure i trust the positive_reviews on here .
negative	read the reviews and stay_clear .
negative	i would not spend a penny with a retailer that has so much out of date stock ( over a year to two years ).
negative	do not trust anything they say .
negative	do not part with any money .
negative	as my car was off the road with a broken alternator , i was urgently requiring a replacement .
negative	i sourced one and paid extra money for next_day delivery through interlink_express .
negative	a text arrived confirming delivery between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm .
negative	when the part had not arrived by 0 . 00pm i went online and checked the tracking .
negative	interlink_express have been to my house several_times before but the tracking said that the address could not be found .
negative	no attempt had been made to phone me at any stage so i called the local_depot at plymouth .
negative	i was told that the driver was an agency driver and ' you know what they are like '.
negative	he would be coming_back later to deliver and has my telephone_number if there is a problem .
negative	when the part had still not arrived by 0 . 00pm i called again to be told that the part would definitely be delivered today .
negative	needless to say it is now past 0 . 00pm and no delivery or phone_call .
negative	far too late to fit an alternator outside anyway .
negative	i am out tomorrow so who_knows what will happen .
negative	the trader i bought from has_been informed of this failure and is very unhappy .
negative	it seems there have been other problems .
negative	poor service but much worse_than that unprofessional behaviour and dishonesty .
negative	we have been fooled in to another 00 months contract with talktalk , they are constantly trying to rip us off and take more money what was agreed , stuck with them now but not after 00 months
negative	i really wish amazon would stop using these_guys .
negative	so many late deliveries and surly customer service , but because it '_s not me that uses them directly that my only option is not to use amazon .
negative	which is , frankly , ridiculous .
negative	if you ' re careful you can get a good deal , but this place will hide the real price as much as possible and nickel and dime you all the way .
negative	the quality of the cards are a bit cheap too .
negative	i had quite a few orders from them for a while , but the cards almost always curled , or had shoddy colour reproduction .
negative	the minute you go to a proper printer , you see what quality is like and for not much more ( or sometimes cheaper ).
negative	i was looking_forward to seeing jesus christ superstar at leeds arena and booked with viagogo - should have looked at these review before i booked because they really are rip_off merchants .
negative	i don_'_t know how they have the cheek to firstly charge double for the actual ticket price on top of a booking_fee and n enormous delivery charge .
negative	i could have flown myself to holland and picked the tickets up for the cost they charged !
negative	then horror upon horror when we got there we were on the send last row of the 0rd tier and our view was so restricted because of a stupid design fault at the arena as the ceiling lights stopped us seeing the whole stage and especially the screen at the back of the stage and it really spoilt the show .
negative	there was no mention on the website that this ticket was restricted view or on the ticket .
negative	i certainly will be trying to get my money back or go to trading_standards .
negative	don_'_t touch these sharks !
negative	i would like to comment on the quality of the goods if only my basket were to arrive .
negative	never in all my years of online shopping have i received such appaling service .
negative	i ordered a basket and money was taken from my account on 00th_july_0000 .
negative	to date ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i am still waitng for my goods .
negative	no apology , email update or single word from online baskets since the end of july .
negative	having signed into this site i am now inundated by emails for another part of the company business home brewing which adds insult to injury .
negative	trying to cancel my order requires a letter sent by registerd post ...
negative	what kind of company is this !
negative	take warning prospective buyer that there is no chance to contact the company by telephone and any email sent recieves no reply or response should you receive poor service .
negative	bought set dining_table & 0 chairs .
negative	when got home realised they had sold me 0 sets of 0 chairs .
negative	in showroom placed round table so not noticable .
negative	didn_'_t point this out when selling then said my fault for not noticing .
negative	now in hands of small_claims court .
negative	seller refused to speak to trading_standards .
negative	i '_ve been trying to top up my father - in - law '_s mobile with a voucher .
negative	haha , more fool me .
negative	trying to text 000 fails , i get a text_telling_me its an invalid number .
negative	going online gets me in a loop , and when i finally find the right page it tells_me the phone number isn_'_t valid , and that the system will now be locked , whatever that means .
negative	ring customer_services with the last 00p credit , the automated selection ( choose 0 , choose 0 etc ) takes me in another loop , then says no credit remaining , thanks for ringing , goodbye .
negative	ok , so i can chat online with someone , that '_s good , really fast response ( although i suspect it '_s automated , strange replies to my questions ).
negative	guess_what ?
negative	the person can only deal with sales enquiries , not technical , goodbye , thanks for calling .
negative	i suggest anyone with t - mobile ( or orange , who have also gone down the pan since the ee merger ) gets the hell out and finds another_provider .
negative	total nightmare .
negative	i may bill them for the £_00 voucher plus the 0 hours of my time , all wasted !
negative	yes building up of credit may help to pay for higher bills in colder months .
negative	yes i understand that .
negative	however having £_000 or more in credit in april after having paid the big winter bill needs to come back to me .
negative	i will be paying all during the warmer months which builds up substantial credit and i continue to pay during the winter months which contributes greatly to the big winter bill .
negative	the money left after the ' big ' billing is in excess and why do i then need to jump_through hoops ( 00 days to ' prepare ' this final ' big ' bill , although a lady on line previously worked it out with given meter_readings , in 0 minutes !!
negative	), including emailing to ask for the money back when they can clearly see the over - payments are in excess .
negative	also the online bill is hopelessly out of date and no record of meter_reading i have given , what '_s the point of having this ( yesterday '_s ) information for me to peruse ?
negative	get your act_together npower !
negative	oh hang on , you have , that is , it '_s all ' protocol ' couched in your favour !
negative	!
negative	never ever again .
negative	after registering our newly formed business , getting premises to trade from we are finding it hard to find a non credit business account .
negative	the accountants who dealt_with everything for us guaranteed us excellent service from natwest and to go with them .
negative	day 0 - received a call from a account manager at natwest , i was in a meeting and could not take the call so she left a message_saying she would call back in 00_minutes and if she could still get hold of me she would call me the following_day .
negative	day 0 - received a call from the same lady saying we were missing each others calls , this is absolute_rubbish , i have no number to call her so how could i call and i have received no missed calls .
negative	anyway she said they could a conference_call with myself and my business partner as we could not go to natwest .
negative	a time was made , i would have to travel 00 miles in order for us to be together to make this call .
negative	day 0 - drove 00 miles and no call came , waitied for an_hour and still no call .
negative	bottom_line is if natwest deals with us like this before we join them what on earth are tyhey going to be like if we join them .
negative	they obviously do not need the business .
negative	never ever again and i am going to make_sure that everyone i know never uses this company .
negative	i made a mistake after having 0 options for my flight back from sa in 0000 .
negative	i pressed the wrong option so i have a 00hr wait in cairo instead of a 0 hr wait .
negative	i realised the mistake as soon as i received my confirmation emauil , not the tickets , just a confirmation of payment .
negative	i then emailed them immdeiately and asked them to change it .
negative	an_hour later my e ticket came through with no chnages .
negative	i then phoned and the guy on the phone said he could not help me and just pout the phone down .
negative	i phoned back and spoke to a 0nd guy who said it would cost me £_00 . 00 per_ticket , i explained the emails to him and he did not want to know so i said goodbye and explained i would never use them again .
negative	i then emailed them asking to chnage the flights and i would pay the £_00 . 00 per_ticket .
negative	0 hrs later i got a reply saying it was not £_00 . 00 but in fact over £_000 to change .
negative	i then emailed them back and explained my 0st email before the issue of the tickets and have not had a response .
negative	there must be something we can do about this aweful company .
negative	for most of us " priority express delivery " means that the delivery would be given prority and be an express delivery , well that is not what it means to seapets .
negative	to them it means " we will take your money and deliver when we feel like it ".
negative	that is what it should say on their checkout basket .
negative	i ordered on wednesday , paid the extra for the " express " service , phoned on friday asking where my product was and was told it would take 0 days .
negative	i have reported the issue to trading_standards for the misleading way they get money out of us .
negative	i have asked for a refund , doubt it will be any quicker .
negative	be very carefull when buying from this company .
negative	this company just takes your money and runs , no afterthought was given to us the customer , they managed to get everything wrong and would ' nt even try to fix the problems we had even_though it was their fault , in the end i contacted abta and they " persuaded " this dreadful company to refund us our money in full , would warn all who are considering using them .
negative	get your money back ** fraud ***
negative	i was told my delivery would be in 0 to 00 days .
negative	00 days_later i asked for my money back as they obviously had no_intention of sending me the items i purchased .
negative	i ' m amazed this company stays in business with their delivery service .
negative	i received an_email_saying what day my item would be delivered and it never came .
negative	when i called to see where it was , i heard a long_drawn out problem they are having with their orders that are going through argos .
negative	first of all , i have my own problems , i don_'_t want to hear yours .
negative	just deliver it when you said you will .
negative	and then they still couldn_'_t promise it would be delivered the next_morning !
negative	you ' d think if they knew they had a computer problem and they knew items were not being delivered , they would contact the customer rather then make me stay home all day waiting for an item that wasn_'_t going to be delivered .
negative	i don_'_t want to hear your problems , i want results and proper customer service !!
negative	!
negative	ordered a king mattress online .
negative	they delivered a double .
negative	the driver just left it and said nothing he can do , contact sainsbury '_s .
negative	called a very loud call_centre and told i ' d be contacted within 00_hours .
negative	never contacted .
negative	after a lot of calls back and forth , i was told mattress is " made to order " and it would not be available another 0 weeks .
negative	delivery company very rude !
negative	cancelled order and will not order from sainsbury online again .
negative	i sent my blackberry bold to these_guys as they gave me the best quote .
negative	but , like nearly everyone_else , as soon as they received it they told me that " due to excessive_wear and tear " they were reducing the offer fom £_00 to £_00 .
negative	there wasn_'_t a mark on the phone and i ' m not a heavy user .
negative	it '_s so much cost and aggravation to get your phone back you end up giving in .
negative	disgraceful scam .
negative	there should be a law against this behaviour and trading_standards should shut them down .
negative	wish i ' d looked here first !
negative	i ordered an aeg dishwasher on 0 march_0000 and was told it was not in stock but it should only take 0 to 00 days .
negative	i called after 00 days , on a thursday and was told it should definitely be in by the next monday latest wednesday .
negative	the next thursday i called again and was told definitely next week .
negative	when i pointed_out that i was told last_week that it was definitely going to be in this week he was quite rude and said that it was not their fault that their supplier was out of stock .
negative	when i asked if he could contact his supplier to find out when they would have them in stock he said that he could not find out and that they can not track the deliveries either .
negative	they cannot find out when any delivery is next due , it just arrives and then they can contact us .
negative	he was just plain rude .
negative	i rang again the next thursday , same old story , should be in next week .
negative	i asked if i could cancel the order and was told that was fine , but i probably would not be able to get it elsewhere any quicker .
negative	i waited another 0 days and had found the same dishwasher at hispek , who had it in stock and could deliver it in 0 days , it only cost me £_00 . 00 more .
negative	so i called redhill again to give them 0 more chance , but was still told that it should be delivered next week , but no guarantees .
negative	i cancelled the order on 0 april_0000 and they took my credit_card number and i was told their accounts_department would deal with it , but it could take up to 0 days to show as an credit on my credit_card .
negative	00 days_later i called my credit_card company and they had not yet received a refund .
negative	i got them to send me a dispute form as i have wasted enough time calling redhill , who will just lie and lie again to you as i have found out by reading your reviews today .
negative	redhill appliances seem to be brilliant , when they have things in stock , but the worst when it is out of stock , they just take your money and then don_'_t care and take ages to refund you .
negative	it is now 00 april but still no refund .
negative	i wanted to buy from a local supplier but will_definitely not recommend them to anybody .
negative	no customer service whatsoever , rude , bored sales staff who don_'_t seem to care one bit about their customers .
negative	do not buy from them !!!
negative	!
negative	i bought 0 tickets in feb ., from viagogo , to see eric clapton at leeds arena on june 00nd .
negative	0000 .
negative	the tickets arrived on sheets of a0 paper , with someone '_s name and address crossed out in the top left hand corner .
negative	when we presented the tickets at the event , they were rejected and classed_as void , because the scanning machine did not recognise the transaction .
negative	we had travelled a fair distance and in order to see the show , had to purchase completely new tickets costing a further £_000 . 00 .
negative	i would like a full_refund of £_000 . 00 and an_apology , please .
negative	this was a very unpleasant and embarrassing experience and i am most upset that i was ripped_off .
negative	by the way , we have managed to read the name and address crossed out on the tickets !
negative	transaction_id : 0000000
negative	thank_you for your swift action .
negative	i am happy to give you a 0 * rating now !
negative	my experience of this company has_been very poor , they just keep sending me automated advice that they haven_'_t got the product in stock and they would not respond properly to a straight_forward email , insisting that i use their weird ' ticket ' system to make contact .
negative	i '_ve demanded a refund and will let everyone know how i get on with that .
negative	do not become involved with this outfit - they are refusing to accept written instructions to cancel my so - called subscription with them .
negative	they will not provide me with the ' terms and conditions ' that i ' m supposed to have approved .
negative	they claim that i can only cancel my ' subscription ' by telephoning them and will not advise what legislation they are depending upon to insist that i contact them on their 0000 tel .
negative	no .
negative	they do not understand normal business protocol .
negative	their website is designed to trick you into signing_up with some sort of wholly unnecessary subscription

negative	their website is designed to trick you into signing_up with some sort of wholly unnecessary subscription
negative	i tried to sign up for one of their deals and they refused me credit of a whole £ 0 . 00 per_month .
negative	they then refused to tell me why they wouldn_'_t give me credit , which is contrary to the consumer credit act and also to the advice given by their credit agency , equifax .
negative	during correspondence with them , they also referred me to a section of their website which didn_'_t even work .
negative	bearing in mind i have two current credit_cards with very little owing on only one of them , that i owe nothing to anyone and that i am in secure employment , i think it is reasonable to be told why carphone_warehouse has acted in such a defamatory manner - they continue to refuse .
negative	but hey !, would you expect anything_else .
negative	by the way , you might want to use these email_addresses to contact carphone : dunstoc @ cpwplc . com , pearson @ cpwplc . com , mcerlea @ cpwplc . com
negative	exceptionally poor service .
negative	they supplied damaged goods and they said they ' d replace it and didn_'_t ; then said they ' d collect the goods and didn_'_t , then said they ' d refund my money and didn_'_t .
negative	quite simply these_people are liars .
negative	and so i threatened them with court and all of a sudden they want to ' resolve ' the issue .
negative	since then i '_ve discovered the ' chargeback ' facility through the bank , so i ' m going to try that before i take ' em to court .
negative	my strongest advice is not to trade with these_people .
negative	very poor returns organisation and i '_ve now adopted a policy whereby , if a company doesn_'_t have an_email address on its website , then i don_'_t trade with them .
negative	this company doesn_'_t - i recommend you don_'_t trade with them .

negative	required a new tablet has i had broke my old and very out of date one so searched the web for info and reviews on the latest tablets on the market .
negative	after a lot of research i ended_up with two on my list , a cheap and chearfull one and a top of the range one , both sold at pc_world so went to have a look .
negative	both tablets i had shortlisted were on display along with others , on speaking to a member of staff about requirements i was shocked that he proceeded to try and sell me a tablet that was so out of date you had to burn coal to run it ?
negative	i know you get what you pay for but this tablet that was once owned by noah was £_00 more then the cheapest i had reviewed and the tablet specs spoke for them selves .
negative	to me it looked like the assistant had been asked to try and sell that tablet and the needs of the customer came second ?
negative	bought the top model !
negative	but feel sorry for anyone_wanting help about a tablet and receiving bad information and buying a tablet not suitable , not worth the money when there were better options_available .
negative	thanks for the internet you can get all the information you need but you shouldt have to do that .
negative	i will keep it short ?
negative	has its all been said before .
negative	sent all three items back within four days of receiving them after fifteen minutes on a high rate phone_call i got all the information i required .
negative	i was sent a conformation of my two returns but three was sent back with all the correct paper_work filled in .
negative	i emailed the customer service about this and received a preloaded email back saying it would be dealt_with .
negative	after three days i had no reply so sent another email only to receive the preloaded email again .
negative	i would love to contact them by phone but i ' m not going through that again .
negative	ideal world was in my opinion very good and i have shopped with them before , don_'_t know what '_s gone wrong but until its sorted they won_'_t be getting my money again .
negative	i am shocked by the attitude of this company i purchased a desktop , monitor etc .
negative	the delivery did not turn_up on time , i had to spend 0 hour round_trip going to collect from dpd couriers , when i complained no apology ( dpd did apologised via_email ) .
negative	the monitor did not connect to the desktop , i spoke to them they told me to go to pc_world and buy an adapter , i went to pc_world they did not have adapters so they sold me a monitor that would connect for an extra £_00 and i was told to return the other monitor to them , when i did return the unused perfect_condition monitor and left it in store , i have since had a phone conversation with them and they want me to collect it as they do not have a returns_policy and if i did not they would destroy the monitor .
negative	this was gareth in pc_world business sheffield .
negative	shocked at treating customers this bad .........
negative	the response was that pc_world are b0b so have no need to comply with distance_selling regulations .
negative	nil nil nil stars i have never done a review before but i just had to with this company - i moved in to a new house a year_ago and got fed_up with them not telling_me what tariff i am on .
negative	i have now left them and still i am getting solicitors letters from them .
negative	the customer service is worse_than awful - no reply '_s to emails , you phone they say they will sort it and nothing please avoid at all cost you have been_warned
negative	you would hope that most retailers would sort_out mistakes made by themselves promptly and without imposing upon the customer .
negative	not pc_world .
negative	i bought a toaster yesterday , but the sales_assistant put through two items at the till .
negative	one which i had been considering and the one i actually wanted .
negative	a simple mistake .
negative	i ' m not too concerned about that .
negative	mistakes_happen and she was friendly .
negative	fast forward to today .
negative	for starters , had to phone a 0000 number !
negative	to hear some disinterested lady tell me that i would have to return to the store in question to have the matter resolved .
negative	i actually bought the item as a snap purchase on my way past and i don_'_t live close to the store - i explained .
negative	same answer !
negative	i asked to speak to the store .
negative	made me wait , still using 0000 number .
negative	store guy a little more helpful sounding , but in practice the same response .
negative	can '_t do anything unless i come back to the store .
negative	i said this is unacceptable .
negative	pc_world have made the mistake , so why do you have a system which insists on the customer taking time out of their day , petrol costs etc to come back for resolution .
negative	i said any major retailer should have systems in place to deal with such financial issues .
negative	i gave my till receipt number and asked for the manager to phone me back asap with a solution and insisted that i would not be making the journey ( its over 00 miles round_trip !)
negative	to allow them to resolve their mistake .
negative	i am still_waiting for that phone_call .
negative	pc_world - if you take_note of these review_sites .
negative	and you certainly should .
negative	pls contact the guy who bought the yellow toaster yesterday at the crawley site , june 00th asap .
negative	xxx update xxx
negative	several phone_calls and emails later .
negative	matter now resolved with simple over the phone card refund by crawley site .
negative	this i had been told was impossible to action .
negative	why this isn_'_t standard policy for all who have financial issues with pc_world through no fault of their own i don_'_t know .
negative	i ' m happy enough now , but the brick_wall i had to knock down to get this simple thing sorted was ridiculous .
negative	i certainly won_'_t use pc_world again .
negative	i am still_waiting for the battery to arrive , even_though you sent me an_email that goods has_been sent next_day .
negative	i have contacted your customer service over the phone and still_waiting .
negative	i ordered more than £_000 of bathroom furniture from this company on wednesday 0th_november_0000 expecting it to be dispatched the following_day .
negative	by the friday , the status of my order was still_showing as " processing " so i thought i would try their live_chat service to find out what was happening .
negative	i was told my order was out for delivery .
negative	a short_while later i went back onto live_chat to find out if they meant my order would be delivered that day or if they meant it would be delivered on a different day .
negative	at this point
negative	i was told that " live_chat " had no access to existing orders and i would have to phone an 0000 number to check my order status .
negative	i explained that i had already been told by " live_chat " that my order had been dispatched already .
negative	the operator then said ok - i will check for you .
negative	he came back to me and said it would be delivered that day so i made sure the was someone in at all times to take delivery and guess_what .
negative	- it did not arrive .
negative	i also made sure someone was home all next_day but still no delivery .
negative	this morning monday 00th_november i tried " live_chat " again only to be told that theyg have no access to existing orders !
negative	i phoned the 0000 number - it was more than 00_minutes before i got an answer .
negative	the lady i spoke to said that my order had been cancelled !
negative	i explained that i had not cancelled the order and she said she would check up and get back to me .
negative	after 00_minutes and no phone_call from them i got back on to the 0000 number and got through to a gentleman by the name of suheb - it took more than 00_minutes before my call was answered and then i was kept on hold for several more minutes before he came back to me and said he would have to do some more checking .
negative	at this point i had had enough of forking out for expensive phone_calls but still not getting an answer to my problem and cancelled the order .
negative	i asked how long it would take before i got my refund and he said between 0_0 working_days .
negative	strange phenomenon because the money left my bank_account the day i placed the order .
negative	anyone taking bets that i get my refund without_any_problems .......?
negative	booked a car at glasgow airport - when i arrived there was no vehicle available .
negative	after waiting at the hertz desk for 0 . 0 hours and speaking to a representative on the phone they agreed to cancel my booking with hertz and transfer me to enterprise but at a much_higher cost which i refused .
negative	eventually , they agreed that i would get my vehicle at the original price and hertz would make up the shortfall .
negative	i then had to transfer to the enterprise desk and wait there while my booking was being_processed .
negative	some 00_minutes later the enterprise representative asked me for more money than i had agreed to on the telephone so i refused .
negative	i had no more time to take the matter up with rentalcars . com as i was on my way to attend a funeral and had to leave the airport and take a taxi .
negative	they took the cost out of my bank_account and when i complained they refused to refund the full_amount and charged me £_00 . 00 as a cancellation_fee despite the fact that i had been kept waiting for almost 0 hours and i did not cancel my booking - enterprise wanted more money than i had agreed to pay .
negative	avoid these_crooks at all costs .
negative	i booked delivery via an overnight service which was not cheap - my partner stayed in all day for the delivery and when it finally came , close to 0pm !
negative	the driver was rude , arrogant and offensive to her and refused to leave the parcel as " she was not the addressee " and stomped off in a huff with the parcel , leaving her speechless and distressed .
negative	a few_minutes later he updated the tracking to say " recipient refused delivery as does not want the goods !"
negative	lying jerk !
negative	he was then " unavailable " despite ups useless customer_services saying they were " trying to contact him " .
negative	a few_minutes to 0 a nasty woman_who sounded_like she had just chewed on a wasp , called me from their alfreton depot and yelled at me that my partner and i were liars and " her " driver told her we had refused the delivery !
negative	cctv covered the incident , but she brazenly persisted with her bullying attitude , protecting the liar of a driver totally .
negative	how senseless and what a pack of lies !
negative	as it was over a bank_holiday weekend , the parcel was not delivered and its now 0 days and counting .
negative	i asked for it to be sent to my work address given the twerp on the home route , and no surprises , it had not arrived by the time i left the office shortly before 0pm .
negative	what a lying bunch of lazy , horrible , incompetent jobswerths - no customer_care ethos , no respect for anyone and no interest in doing the job they are paid to do .
negative	nne of them deserve to have paid jobs .
negative	ups uk only survive i am sure due to being a huge multinational , certainly not due to the hopelessly inadequate uk operation .
negative	never again , truly shocking !
negative	phoned homeserve about a leak on the watersupply pipe - water running into road .
negative	location of leak unknown , cannot see where its coming from .
negative	told they would call back in an_hour , when they did , they wanted all the same details all over again , and offered an_appointment on monday - iasked if i could confirm the appointment shortly as i needed to ensure someone was there to accommodate them , and the call_centre woman agreed i could phone back to confirm .
negative	called back within 00_minutes , having rearranged appointments etc , only to be told by a useless character that he could now " offer me an appointmentnext week thursday " !
negative	really ?
negative	water pouring down the driveway , offered appointment monday , agreed phone back to confirm this , did so in 00_minutes and now its 0 days_later ?
negative	plus water still pouring down driveway !
negative	no one has bothered to call back as he said he was going to arrange ( surprise_surprise ) .
negative	i am really not happy .
negative	if i could give less_than one star , i would .
negative	what a shower !
negative	and no resolution to the water leak either !
negative	local parcelfarce depot has a little man with a big chip on the shoulder as depot manager and every delivery from them is a problem - the deliveries are made , but with the most awful attitude , with the driver being as unpleasant as possible and intimidating to my partner , an older woman , who has_been upset by their yobbish behaviour a few_times now .
negative	complaints go nowhere , they are either ignored or you are told its all your fault and its your word against the perfect employee who the company protects to the hilt .
negative	we don_'_t ever use pf but can '_t help getting items from companies who do as they don_'_t advertise who they will be using , generally .
negative	nottingham depot is a disgrace as are the ill - mannered yobs from there who find such pleasure in behaving so offensively .
negative	i bought 0 handbasin taps from argos online .
negative	0 times they sent me the wrong item ( twice they sent bath / shower_mixer taps , third time a pair of bath_taps which looked like basin taps ).
negative	when i got a plumber to fit them he laughed : they had a 0 / 0 " thread instead of 0 / 0 " and would not fit the holes in my hand basin .
negative	argos refused to refund my money because more than 00 days had elapsed since placing the original order .
negative	so i wasted £_00 .
negative	argos you are crooks .
negative	myukdelivery failed to collect my item on 0 separate_occasions .
negative	talking to [_name_removed_] is a joke as she knows nothing .
negative	i sent a recorded delivery letter to their website address citing breach of contract & demanding a refund & it was returned undelivered !
negative	do not use this company
negative	my boiler stopped_working on the 00th_november , no heating or hot_water . i rang them and they said the earliest they can send an engineer out is three days_later on 00st .
negative	my boiler has a reset button which i pressed and i also tried turning boiler off and on but did not work .
negative	any way the engineer came in the 00st , pressed the reset button and it started up .
negative	he said he did not know what the problem was so could not order a part .
negative	he gave me a diary to complete should it fail again with questions to answer to give a better idea as what was wrong .
negative	the boiler lasted 0 hours before stopping again .
negative	i rang them straightaway and this time the earliest they could send an engineer was 0 days_later on 00 november .
negative	to make_matters worse i had a burst water pipe from the bathroom which flooded my dining_room .
negative	this is not drying out properly due to no heating .
negative	i was in despair , felt unwell and depressed .
negative	the engineer came on the 00th and said the boiler needed a part which they did not have in stock so needed ordering .
negative	he said the customer service team would contact me that afternoon with an_appointment date .
negative	they did not ring me i had to ring them .
negative	they said the part on order would be in stock on monday 0nd december and when it comes in they will then contact me with an_appointment date .
negative	i asked them if they could make a provisional date now rady for when the part comes in and they said their system does not allow them to rechedule in that way .
negative	i told that it made sense to make a provisional appointment which they could them give to somebody_else if the part is not in on time and again they said that cannot do that .
negative	i asked for and idea of how long i would possibly wait for an_appointment once the part is in and he said " about 0 or 0 days " ( in other words how long is a piece of string .
negative	by the time my boiler is fixed and up and running i will have been without heating and hot_water for 0 weeks .
negative	this company i ' d quick enough at taking your money but runs it on a shoe string where engineers are concerned .
negative	i am waiting til my boiler is up and running and then i am taking my business elsewhere .
negative	do not use eon for boiler repairs
negative	as i write i am_currently being billed by both europa , and telfonica for the same line_rental .
negative	when i call europa they say they will investigate and call me back - do they ?
negative	that will be a no then .
negative	so far my 0 emails to 0 different departments have gone unanswered .
negative	when i moved recently , i cancelled my line with them and took up a new one .
negative	you won_'_t be surprised to learn i am now being billed for 0 lines , but wait , i notified them and they apologised for the error , promised me a refund against my new account , and promptly billed me again .
negative	i had the payment stopped at my bank , so they have now issued me with a debt warning .
negative	what a bunch of wasters .
negative	i am now approaching a new supplier - enough is enough .
negative	never ever use expedia .
negative	they cannot handle the simplest hotel booking , and when attempted to correct the errors , you might as well be dealing_with martians .
negative	also , they attempt to make out that it '_s the fault of the consumer , particularly galling with me , as a highly qualified oxford graduate .
negative	you have been_warned !
negative	o stars
negative	walked_into the local carphone_warehouse to take back a faulty phone charger !
negative	obviously having disturbed the staff from their slumber i was never going to be treated courteously but was basically told it was my fault the appliance was broken and i ' d voided the warranty !!
negative	have never been spoken to so rudely by a retail worker and will never cross that threshold again !
negative	watch out for these_guys !
negative	all over their site they say " there is no such thing says free shipping "- hahaha implying that everyone_else is ripping you off for shipping_costs .
negative	these_guys are ripping you off - watch out !- they do say ( to cover their scam ) once you order it may take 00 business days to ship / receive your product .
negative	really ?!
negative	00 - business days in this economy ?
negative	hire more workers , and maybe your customer might get their product sooner .
negative	i order on a sun nite , so in my mind they " process it " mon or tues , and since i am paying for us / fedex - i would expect my product by friday .
negative	ohhhh nooooo - not with these_guys .
negative	they do charge your for ups / fedex - which " leads you to believe " that you will get your product " soon "- not !
negative	they ship " five day - slow boat " with ups / fedex .
negative	waaaayyyyyyy down , buried in the faq - it states that you must make a phone order , to get " express "- yeah - they tell you , but of course you are only reading the faq on shipping , when you are looking for you product , hmmm " sketchy "- a little late to see that htey are just using the name ups / fedex to fool their clients - into thinking they are quick .
negative	sure , their prices were $ 0 - 0 $ dollars cheaper , but let '_s think about this - they sell supplements , items we want to improve our health - how is it healthy to not have your product for two_weeks ?!?!
negative	?- in " this economy "-- shop elsewhere , where they appreciate your business .
negative	my product total was nearly $_000 . 00 --- don_'_t shop hear --- you have been_warned !!
negative	!
negative	i bought an item which they showed as available .
negative	i had a confirmation_email to say it would be delivered in 0 - 0 days .
negative	thriteen days_later i rang and emailed them , was told the item was not available !
negative	they couldn_'_t refund it unless i sent an_email to cancel .
negative	no notification - really let me down big style !
negative	would never use again and will not be recommending to anyone .
negative	bought tickets : delivery collection options with 0 days before travel limited to royal_mail special delivery at additional £ 0 . 00 plus i have to stay in between 0 am and 0 pm to sign for letter or machine collection at nearest station with machin which is 00 miles_away .
negative	no way of complaining to trainline without using premium_rate line .
negative	why :
negative	0 .
negative	do they think it takes more than 0 days for royal_mail to deliver first_class
negative	0 .
negative	how am i supposed to collect from a self service machine 0 train stops away ?
negative	if the trainline is the future in this coutry them forget it .
negative	i have phone and broadband with talk_talk .
negative	since tiscali was taken over by talk_talk , more_expensive poor products , bad service , non - existant customer service , impossible to contact anyone , slow slow slow connection via broadband , keep selling me extra products that never materialise .
negative	stores understaffed .
negative	empty shelves .
negative	short_dated produce .
negative	response to customer feedback is very poor .
negative	staff on the tills are doing their best under poor management .
negative	seems like thedamage to cars is widespread amongst bcp , read the reviews on gatwick bcp at reviewcentre . com
negative	i ordered from this company mainly_because of the quick delivery time ( 0 / 0 days ).
negative	i received the item nearly 0 weeks after order placed .
negative	on my first phone_call ( 0 days after ordering ) i was told the item would be sent out that day .
negative	i was unhappy about this but accepted their assurances .
negative	my next call was 0 days after ordering and was again told it would be sent out that day .
negative	the person was not interested that i had been assured on 0 previous occaissions that the item was being despatched because i couldn_'_t provide the name of the persons i had talked to .
negative	the item finally arrived 00 days after ordering .
negative	i had given up on ever receiving the item so ordered from another company and it arrived after 0 days and on the same day as the item from one click_pharmacy .
negative	i will not be using this company again .
negative	their customer service to me was non - existent .
negative	i have been with this company since they took over tiscali .
negative	i have never had to use their customer service until two_weeks_ago when i lost my asdl line .
negative	i am still without the internet and suffered hours of frustrating customer service phone_calls at a premium_rate number .
negative	i was sent all over the world to call_centres that i couldn_'_t understand and only seemed to be able to work from a set of rules in a robotic manner .
negative	technical help didn_'_t call back when they said they would and their was no understanding or sympathy .
negative	i now am leaving i have had to pay bt to give me a new line with broadband and i am out of contract with talktalk but dread phoning them up to cancel my service with them .
negative	talktalk have said that if i cancel my direct_debit they will charge me even_though i have no service .
negative	i have got a mac_code from them eventually but bt will not use it because they are supplying a new line .
negative	please_please_please people show this company who has the power and do not go_anywhere_near them and tell your freinds to read all the reviews on trust_pilot .
negative	only then may talktalk realise that they have to stop this appalling customer service .
negative	do not use this company !
negative	i hired from sixt in geneva and on arrival at the desk was handed a print - out for the car , notified i had been upgraded and had a larger petrol car .
negative	so far so good .
negative	unfortunately the car wasn_'_t petrol ( modern diesels run like petrols ) and as there were no warning labels on dash , filler cap or flap or paperwork , i refuelled with diesel on the way back to the airport the company then failed to assist in recovery of car or family to the airport , and we paid for recovery and a taxi to the airport and were then sent a bill for £_000 .
negative	subsequently the company refused to answer any_queries on what had happened - no personal communications , just a barrage of automated demands for payment or else .
negative	still not receiving any personal communication , i contested the payment at which point it was handed_over to a debt_collection_agency .
negative	after 00 months of hassle , i eventually had to pay up 000_euros to avoid having to go through the trauma of contesting this in court .
negative	all other car_rental companies at geneva clearly mark their cars and paperwork - but not sixt !
negative	just don_'_t do it !
negative	to be perfectly honest i have ordered from simply in the past and had no_problems but this company is now nothing but pathetic excuses and no action .
negative	i have the same history of order issues as other_reviewers on here i . e the status changing from ' priority dispatch ', ' waiting for courier ' and then on to ' backlog order '.
neutral	when i telephoned to enquire where he was i was told the appointment was been 0 and 00am – this does not appear very efficient , if a fitter does not arrive until 00am half the day is gone !
neutral	wally arrived at 0 . 00am , when i said i expected him earlier he complained he had to come from luton .
neutral	i asked him not to cut the wood flooring in the bedroom as it would create additional mess on freshly painted surfaces and instead do it in the garage however he insisted he had to do it in the bedroom as he couldn ’ t keep_up and down the stairs but agreed to my request that he clear up at the end of the day .
neutral	just before 0pm ( lee had said he would have done the whole job in one day if all the parts were available ) wally told me he had finished and i could take a look .
neutral	i immediately saw an area he had not masticked which i asked him to correct , the units were left very dusty , lee spent a long time cleaning all the units at the end of his day despite knowing they were not complete .
neutral	the floor and walls were also covered in dust .
neutral	i then asked wally if he would show me with the allen key how to adjust the shelves and rails as he had only pointed to the fixings and i wanted to be sure exactly how they worked .
neutral	he abruptly stated :” i ’ ve had enough of you today , you can deal with the office ”.
neutral	i was very shocked as this was said in front of myself and my 00 year_old son , all i could say in return was , “ how rude ”.
neutral	wally departed in such a hurry he failed to get me to complete any paperwork .
neutral	i immediately telephoned customer_services and spoke to clare caswell who was quite sympathetic and said i should not have been spoken to in such a way in my own home .
neutral	she promised to call me back the next_day once she had a chance to contact wally ’_s manager .
neutral	this clare duly did , however , she told me the director was not available to approve compensation and she would call me at 00am on monday .
neutral	clare eventually called me at 0 . 00pm on monday to offer me a measly £_000 as a “ goodwill_gesture ”.
neutral	i turned down this offer flat as it was not adequate recompense for all the inconvenience and stress suffered when we had committed to spend £ 0 , 000 with your company .
neutral	clare indicated this was a one time offer and if i wanted to take it further to contact the furniture ombudsman .
neutral	i then googled hammonds customer reviews – so many complaints along similar lines .
neutral	as previously mentioned , my husband lost a day ’_s holiday from work which i understand you usually compensate with £_00 , i had to take an additional day ’_s leave so what do we get for the downright rudeness of your employee wally and the incompetence of your surveyor ?
neutral	had we cancelled with less_than seven_days ’ notice we would have been penalised £_000 .
neutral	sadly our experience of your company ( with the notable exception of lee falconer ) has_been a catalogue of errors and extremely poor customer service .
neutral	hammonds insisted on seven_days ’ notice of cancellation yet have made eleventh hour changes to arrangements twice causing us great inconvenience and stress .
neutral	we have waited six years for the bedroom of our dreams which has_become a nightmare thanks to the incompetence of your company .
neutral	we look_forward to receiving a dramatically improved offer of compensation from yourselves at your earliest convenience .
neutral	in summary , i wish i had visited this site before i booked my furniture .
neutral	my advice - go_elsewhere and don_'_t touch hammonds with a barge_pole !!
neutral	!
neutral	i tried to order recently twice on line and pay using paypal however for some reason the order was not processed even_though i am a frequent user of paypal .
neutral	i phoned pet prescription in the end as my dog had run out of tablets and i was getting concerned .
neutral	despite saying i could have a worming_treatment at the offer price i thought i was paying previously however this was not the case and i ended_up paying more .
neutral	i was also disappointed that pet prescription started to charge postage & packing , i don_'_t think they are as competitively_priced as they used to be .
neutral	i always go use skyscanner when searching for flights .
neutral	a friend swears by it .
neutral	i however find it so incredibly frustrating !
neutral	the annoying thing is it has the potential to be a great site .
neutral	i can never find direct flights using this website ., yet on the airline '_s own websites i can find direct flights no problem .
neutral	skyscanner seems to only bring up 0 and 0 stop flights which cost the earth !
neutral	a brilliant concept which would save me so much time , if it only worked !
neutral	!
neutral	i bought some flowers for a friend of mine who needed cheering up .
neutral	interflora have a nice website and plenty of choice , they also make the buying process very easy .
neutral	the prices seemed a little high as when the flowers arrived , they were a little underwhelming to say the least and didnt exactly resemble the image on the site .
neutral	they also only lasted 0 days which is quite poor given the premium price .
neutral	my lovely 0000 cl000 had a scrape whilst parked outside my house and needed some work doing at the repair shop .
neutral	apparently i breached the term of my lease because the car was momentarily parked on double yellow lines .... mb in house insurance services are refusing to pay for any of the work required because the damage happened on double yellow '_s !
neutral	i expect a large bill and little help from mb insurance services .
neutral	we '_ve owned nearly_half a dozen mercedes and always paid top_dollar for insurance , servicing etc with them .
neutral	they dont treat valued customers well .
neutral	pleased with delivery time and communication .
neutral	less pleased with shoes not being the same as those in the picture on the website .
neutral	according to t '_s &_c '_s the company reserves the right to change item specifications without warning ...
neutral	this trip was mercifully short and was made bearable .
neutral	the no_frills airline means no_frills in seats , space and comfort .
neutral	it '_s cheap and we don_'_t expect more so it does deliver .
neutral	just don_'_t fly too far .
neutral	platform is well_designed and easy to use , but i finding it frustrating if you get stuck , then customer service is not the greatest , especially using support email .
neutral	it '_s not helpful either when you have to call 0000 number !!
neutral	!
neutral	tenants can '_t find upload documents section , so they have to email separately .
neutral	i ordered wrong products and wanted to exchange .
neutral	i wrote to customer service but never got answer from them .
neutral	had to purchase again .
neutral	item ordered on - line with a different ' order ' and ' ship to ' address both of which were correctly and clearly identified on the invoice .
neutral	the item was sent to the ' order ' address instead of ' ship to ' address .
neutral	item could not be delivered by courier ( royal_mail ) and was returned to postal office for collection by customer .
neutral	having not received product within a week at ' ship to ' address i called helpline only to discover the above facts .
neutral	error acknowledged and company undertook to resolve problem , which they did to their great credit when item arrived at required address within 00_hours of the call .
neutral	shame about the initial error .
neutral	a prior order with this company was handled seamlessly .
neutral	ordered wii and games got the games 0 days before the wii so lucky i purchased before birthday
neutral	tina , leeds
neutral	use infrequently and due to this account expired but was still held i was just unable to access .
neutral	so i had to open another account due to the time passed but could not with my original email address so had to open a second alternative email to do this , which was not a major problem except for me because i am not conversant with the computer as others .
neutral	so far the ' sellers ' from whom i have purchased have been excellent and i therefore would say the experience will invite me to browse and purchase via_ebay again .
neutral	payment is easy to process and so it is just the difficulty of accessing one '_s account that remains a problem at times and not finding help to resplve this easily found .
neutral	shopping at littlewoods has_been been a pleasure although i do tend to shop for the ' home ' or ' gifts '.
neutral	often find what i want that i am unable to find elsewhere .
neutral	whilst generally the quality of item is value for money , sometimes i find prices not as comparable to elsewhere as i would like so that would give me pause for consideration before i buy .
neutral	rarely if ever have i had to complain .
neutral	i predominently browse online but prefer to order and pay per telephone from where i find the process easy .
neutral	customer service is fast and pleasantly polite & helpful but i cannot_afford to purchase too much at one time being inhibited by income .
neutral	however to date i have returned to purchase from littlewoods with confidence .
neutral	... at skulle rate en service man ikke kender eller har brugt for at kunne deltage i en konkurrence
neutral	this was a good price , covered all that was necessary and was clearly outlined .
neutral	as i stated the price was good but the delivery time was too long .
neutral	when i contacted sitebox to find out where my item was i was told twice they would find out and ring me back , but they never did i had to ring them back again at my cost to eventually find out when it would arrive , which was just in time six days in total .
neutral	enjoy family feud immensely .
neutral	don_'_t like the constant pop - ups on bottom right corner .
neutral	would like to half game site , so i can do other things while i play .
neutral	others allow this .
neutral	due to a query regarding delivery , it was necessary to phone the shop . put through to sales and was bullied by salesman into accepting a late delivery despite informing him that i was a shift worker and had to be in bed by 0000 . was told to stay up till 0000 or i would be charged £_00 . when i requested to speak to someone with more authority was spoken to by a lady_who was so aggressive that i wished i had recorded the call , so i could play it back to the owner . whilst these two people spoilt the ordering_process , the two gentlemen who delivered were helpful and it would not stop me ordering again as the whole system was very proffessional
neutral	i underwent lasek laser_eye surgery in march_0000 at shaftesbury avenue , london .
neutral	although i am pleased with the outcome , i feel that i am just a number in a production line and not a particularly valued_customer .
neutral	the surgery in london was packed and it was one in one out .
neutral	there were delays when i returned the following_day for my check up and had to wait over an_hour to see the optician .
neutral	my appointment had already been booked , but there were others who were going for their first consultation who appeared to be treated with more priority .
neutral	there weren_'_t even enough seats for everyone and not enough staff to cover .
neutral	i chose optical_express specifically over the other_companies , as they were opening a new branch in eastbourne where i live .
neutral	this was opened shortly_after i had surgery .
neutral	however , it is only open now on a tuesday and it is almost_impossible to get a check up appointment .
neutral	i rang to book for 00 dec and was told that no optician was available that day and i would need to book another day .
neutral	however , all other dates in dec were already booked up .
neutral	i presume by new potential_customers ... who are obviously more important , as they are generating more money .
neutral	also , it is impossible to book an_appointment any further ahead than 0 weeks as their computer systems can '_t cope with this .
neutral	i feel so let_down by the very poor aftercare service in eastbourne and don_'_t want to travel to brighton for this .
neutral	you would think a company which is making £ millions from customers would be able to afford high_quality staff , a high_quality computer system and high_quality aftercare !!
neutral	!
neutral	pc did arrive and a few_days in is working well .
neutral	appears to be a good quality build and at a reasonable price .
neutral	however there was still no reply to any of my e_- mails , the £_00 paid for 0 working day turnaround took 0 and there is no offer forthcoming of the £ 0 a day late refund for this .
neutral	will probably consider getting a price match from another supplier if purchasing in future .
neutral	all in all good pcs let_down by poor customer service .
neutral	product was ordered online and arrived next_day even_though it was on 00 hour delivery !
neutral	!
neutral	i have used the company several_times in the past but now at malaga_airport it is no_longer possible to collect a car at the arrivals underground section .
neutral	you are bussed to car_hire_companies depot a few_minutes away and once there , in the busy_periods , the queue is horrendous .
neutral	i shall not be hiring cars from malaga_airport pickup any longer as this system stinks and i can have a car delivered to my door the next_day ( i ' m lucky_enough for this to work out best for me ).
neutral	i received an e_- mail from speciality drinks telling_me that the goods were ready for delivery and that there were being dispatched by parcelforce express 00 .
neutral	it gave me a parcel number and a tracking reference .
neutral	parcelforce also sent me an e_- mail with the information .
neutral	the e_- mail from speciality drinks stressed that someone must be in to sign for the parcel and that it was my responsibility to track it .
neutral	as it had been dispatched express 00 , i took the nest day off work to be sign for it on receipt .
neutral	it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	the parcelforce website showed that it had been received by them but that was all .
neutral	tracking on the whisky_exchange website showed that it had been dispatched the day the original e_- mail had been sent .
neutral	i took the next_day off work too , but as nothing was received by lunchtime , i e_- mailed speciality drinks .
neutral	late in the afternoon , i got an e_- mail back from them telling_me that the parcel was not due to be picked_up from them until that day and that it should be with me by the monday ( this was friday ), and that the original e_- mail should have stated that .
neutral	this was followed up with another e_- mail giving me a totally different tracking reference for the parcelforce tracking service .
neutral	the parcel did finally arrive on monday .
neutral	happy to have got the goods but not happy with the communication from the company as it was at best misleading and at worst , just plain wrong .
neutral	will think_twice before using this service again .
neutral	mower has performed fine so far , the delivery was supposed to be thursday with advance notification as to morning or afternoon , none was received , then came a message that due to circumstances beyond their control , the delivery would be the following_day .
neutral	about an_hour after this message the mower arrived , so all was well if a little_confusing in the end .
neutral	upon ordering the communication i have found has_been poor i have a pet whom has ibs and only half of his food was dispatched without notifying me where the rest of the order was which i found was strange ??
neutral	only upon querying the contents was i told the item was out of stock i don_'_t have the good fortune that i can feed my pets anything therefore i was disappointed as half of his food wasn_'_t in stock im now left with 00 tins of food he cannot eat as we had to change his food yet again !!
neutral	!
neutral	order unexpectedly delayed .
neutral	expected it in 0 - 0 days as per on line site info .
neutral	however , after a week had passed by and it hadn_'_t turned_up i phoned to find out what was going on .
neutral	was told part was out of stock ( not what it said on line ), and that on line info was incorrect .
neutral	was given apology and refunded delivery cost .
neutral	they also explained that it would be in stock in a few_days . was also told item would be sent by express delivery so i would get it within my revised deadline .
neutral	fortunately item turned_up just in time !
neutral	it was lucky that bad_weather prevented me needing it sooner .
neutral	clearly they need to sort_out their stock numbers so customers are not mis_- led as to when items will be received , further to give really good customer service i should have been told that the item was out of stock as soon as they realised , so i did not have to contact them to find out what the problem was .
neutral	on the plus side , i was fairly pleased with the way my issue was handled by the customer service team .
neutral	i received one part of the order . still_waiting for the last item to arrive .
neutral	we oredered a years supply of fybogel lemon an were disappointed that it didn_'_t taste like the highstreet pharmacy lemon , but more like lemon / clementines , which isn_'_t the greatest of tastes .
neutral	the order was quite quick , which is a plus for you , but we are disappointed in the taste , which we have to live with for a whole year !
neutral	!
neutral	great that they have exactly_what you need and they really do deliver quickly , but to charge £ 0 . 00 for a plastic moulded part that at most cost £ 0 . 00 to make is crazy , and leaves you feeling you have been the object of highway robbery .
neutral	like other customers i too have had a mixed experience with very .
neutral	my very first order an laptop was ' accidentally ' sent to the carriers distribution_centre in llandudno ... not bad as i live in lincolnshire the complete opposite side of the country !
neutral	i complained after 0 days which was the delivery time given on ordering and was told that it may take up to 00 days , i told them ' look on the parcel tracking_system and you will see it is stuck in llandudno ' ( which is where it still is !)
neutral	after 00 e_- mails and two official complaints i eventually suggested that they cancel the original order and reorder for me ( why didnt they think of this ?)
neutral	however the parcel turned_up within 0 days and according to the tracking_system the original parcel is still in llandudno .
neutral	before retiring i worked in customer_care and the very team need to start thinking_about the customer and not their workload !
neutral	better living were very prompt in coming out after my initial contact and the furniture didn_'_t take long to be made .
neutral	steve maybury was the fitter and i am very happy with the end product .
neutral	he did a fantastic job , working very competently with great professionalism and very tidily .
neutral	i was told however by the salesman that the job would take 0 day when in fact it took 0 and this could not be attributed to the fitter .
neutral	i was misled !
neutral	i was also persuaded to take out finance in order to get a higher discount on the furniture , provided it was paid off over a short_period of time ( 0months ).
neutral	against my better judgement i agreed and this has given me a great headache .
neutral	the figures given by the salesman and later by the surveyor did not match up and i strongly feel that the paperwork should be simplified in order that the customer can understand .
neutral	it more easily .
neutral	i had to pay the fitter independently and the wrong amount was transferred into my bank_account , this error had to be corrected
neutral	i have today paid off the whole amount to the finance company .
neutral	would i use better living again or recommend them probably not !
neutral	!
neutral	yes it works .
neutral	and yes the phone ended_up being officially unlocked but do not expect it in the time frame identified .
neutral	when i first applied the time frame stated was 00 - 00_hours after 00_hours the website updated to upto 00 hourrs and it was eventually done but it would have been quicker and cheaper to go direct to 00 .
neutral	bottom_line is pay 00 quid and the phone will be unlocked but be prepared to wait .... this is not something that happens quickly ....
neutral	booking via the website was quick and painless as was the payment process .
neutral	it would have helped if the baggage prices had been visible prior to booking or i would have used a different company .
neutral	its fine thinking you '_ve managed to get a reasonably_priced flight until you find out it doesnt include bags which costs an extra 00 pounds .
neutral	that in itself again is not a problem if you are told upfront which ebookers doesnt happen so the customer is not aware .
neutral	fundamentally it is deceitful and dishonest .
neutral	not yet received order
neutral	i was pleased with the key ring i ordered with a photo of a light coloured dog .
neutral	but the cube was a different_story !!
neutral	i could hardly see the image even when held up to bright sunlight .
neutral	it was of a black puppy .
neutral	it didn_'_t stipulate that the photo had to be bright .
neutral	i did return the cube and received a cheque but no offer of re - doing with a different photo .
neutral	hey_ho iwill have to go without .
neutral	i used jokers masquerade several_times .
neutral	the was very good service and good quality product .
neutral	this however the same good service but the product i purchased was not up to it .
neutral	arrived ok and packaged properly .
neutral	on using this masquerade mask it very soon fell_apart .
neutral	this just used for the first time on the 00 / 00 / 00
neutral	so don_'_t but this mask .
neutral	recent order had an item that was unavailable .
neutral	i found the information offered by the company to be vague and rather unhelpful when i called to check on order .
neutral	this was resolved in due course .
neutral	but what i am no satisfied is a i sent a email to chemist help_desk services on my order and till now none had replied my mail , in my opinion no trustful services .
neutral	went to the peel centre toysrus after reserving toys online which i found helpful , however when i went to the customer service desk to pick_up the goods the staff were as miserable as sin !!
neutral	no smile or a thank_you .
neutral	if i buy goods from a shop i expect the staff to be friendly and to at_least say thank_you instead all i got was a grunt !
neutral	the assistant who served me acted like i was putting her out .
neutral	not good !
neutral	didn_'_t go as well as i ' d hoped , tried to order a helmet on the website , everything done except paying at the end , the website froze .
neutral	i rang the shop and they could find the order on the system and they took payment over the phone and processed the order .
neutral	this was wednesday at 0pm .
neutral	i booked next_day special delivery on the understanding that the order would be shipped on the thursday for friday delivery .
neutral	friday came and nothing turned_up , i rang the shop again ... turns_out they had too many orders and didn_'_t process mine until the friday_morning .
neutral	it was sent special delivery and i collected from sorting_office on the saturday_morning .
neutral	i feel that from wednesday at 0pm to thursday at 0pm is plenty of time to process a priority order and whilst merlin put there hands up and said it was there fault and offered to refund the priority shipping , i still feel that the service in this instance has_been very average .
neutral	this is the second time i have been less_than please with the service i have received from merlin .
neutral	i hindsight the 0 quid i saved in purchasing from merlin was not worth the hassle in the long run .
neutral	i have received much_better service from various online_retailers .
neutral	placed an order for over £_00 on 00th_october wasn_'_t dispatched until the 00nd .
neutral	so not next working day delivery & no comms to tell me what was happening .
neutral	productsa re good so may use again
neutral	overall a good experience with travel_republic with the organisation of the holiday .
neutral	however , the return transfer , supplied by urbis , torremolinos , was marred by the confirmation fax having the incorrect flight time of the return flight .
neutral	the communication with urbis intimated that this was entirely not their problem as flight data is supplied to them , from london , by travel_republic ... so it was my responsibility to arrange alternative timed transfers .
neutral	if i had missed my scheduled flight owing to an incorrect transfer time it would also have been my responsibility to arrange & pay for alternative flights .
neutral	service companies who receive monies for supplying a service should be accountable for checking the information they supply and confirming correctly to the client - not shrugging it off as not their fault ...!
neutral	i ordered 0 of the same bouquet to be sent as ' thank_you ' gifts to a number of people at different addresses , all on behalf of a charity .
neutral	it was a little annoying to need to re - set the bouquet size to ' standard ' every time to order the right value ( as it defaults to the more_expensive ' medium ') and there was a technical issue with the message on the final one which for some reason wouldn_'_t ' attach ' to the correct order , but which online customer_services sorted ( took approx 00_mins ).
neutral	i would normally expect some positive_feedback from the recipients but i have only heard from one whose flowers were very poor quality , with some stems broken and blooms " nearly dead " - very disappointing and a poor reflection on the charity '_s intentions .
neutral	i sincerely_hope that the lack of feedback from the other 0 is not down to awkwardness on their part if they have received similarly poor quality flowers .
neutral	my jacket is excellent but getting it was an ordeal .
neutral	no problem with the company itself , more of an issue with their courier .
neutral	had to go their local_depot , which itself was not particularly well sign posted .
neutral	although amazon '_s courier had no_problems with the bad_weather this company didn_'_t even try to get to my house .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have received my jacket by christmas if i hadn_'_t gone to collect myself on christmas_eve .
neutral	i have used ebay before to buy quite a few items but my use of ebay has tailed off recently .
neutral	many of the sellers prices , particularly for books , are way over what you would pay if you looked at other_sites .
neutral	same as for dvds .
neutral	however , there are still bargains to be had .
neutral	i wanted to order kerastase shampoo .
neutral	i was going to order two but decided to order three as there was a special_offer of a gift .
neutral	however i did not realise that the gift bag was indeed just a slightly crumpled red gift bag to put a gift inside .
neutral	very misleading and totally disappointing .
neutral	i would have ordered two if i had have realised .
neutral	sonia haddad
neutral	i was a little surprised at the condition of the toyota car when i frist saw it .
neutral	i don_'_t know what year / model it was as they are not seen in australia . there were dings and scratches all over it and there wasn_'_t even a manual in the glove box !!
neutral	some things didn_'_t work - eg .
neutral	the light over the instrument panel and the tacho was dead .
neutral	at_least the headlights and air_con worked .
neutral	wern '_t told about any major road rules , but there didn_'_t appear to be any .
neutral	we had a better car in nz earlier this year and it was aus $_00 cheaper per day .
neutral	anyway the car was big enough for the 0 of us and economical to run .
neutral	i haven_'_t booked my holiday yet but the sunnyrentals website is full of lovely properties and easy to use .
neutral	i just had one disappointment as i had found our perfect property but when i contacted the owner i found out that the prices were wrong .
neutral	i told sunny_rentals and they got back to me quickly .
neutral	would happily use them to book our holiday .
neutral	bit of a distraction but at_least three of the games came with threats that avg was not happy about and on at_least two occasions i lost my pointer .
neutral	i played infected all the way through and will give it an 0 but the rest either had problems or i got tired of them being so repititious .
neutral	good graphics .
neutral	needs more variety from page to page .
neutral	we '_ve taken this tour a couple of times on our last 0 visits to london .
neutral	it covers quite a bit , is pleasant and informative .
neutral	the problem that we experienced recently was the following :
neutral	we departed the bus on kensington high_street .
neutral	we asked our driver as to the time of the next bus as we had a business dinner to attend in another part of the city .
neutral	he looked at his schedule and gave us the times .
neutral	we returned to the stop about 00_minutes prior to the time that we had been given .
neutral	we were surprised to speak w_/ other people who had been waiting for over 00_minutes .
neutral	we waited 00 more and no bus .
neutral	soon , it became_apparent that there would be no bus .
neutral	we had to quickly rush to tube station ( in the pouring rain btw ) and find our way to our destination arriving an_hour late for our dinner .
neutral	:(
neutral	i love my mac .
neutral	even_though its a few_years old now , its my lifeline to the world .
neutral	i love that i don_'_t get the faff of viruses that pc users have , that the technology is reliable , and easy to use .
neutral	i am slightly disappointed that apple don_'_t have their customer_services sorted though , its the only thing that keeps them from 0_stars .
neutral	have booked a few hotels with this company and sorry but they have competition which is far nicer , cleaner and comfier !
neutral	i stayed in one in aberdeen which was really dirty and the internal restaurant was just awful - however they room was refunded so the customer service in that respect was good .
neutral	haven_'_t really stayed in once since though as put off !
neutral	ford_fiesta durashift seized after 00000 miles bought from jennings middlesbrough as an_automatic turns_out it is semi automatic !!!!!
neutral	total repair bill £_000 +.
neutral	when collecting the car which had been washed noticed a note under the wipers informing i had a flat tyre , this was left on the back of a shopping list obviously left by a kind passer by from the nearby garden_centre . i cannot_believe that the staff at ford had repaired the car ... hopefully test driven it , washed it and failed to notice or inflate the tyre .
neutral	perhaps the air was too costly !!!
neutral	! not impressed at all
neutral	arrived 00_minutes early for our return_journey which extended the hanging_around at the airport .
neutral	their survey otions only covers on - time or late
neutral	the site was very easy to use and the ordering_process simple .
neutral	however the cost of the items (£_00 ) were taken out of my account 0 days before the items were delivered .
neutral	this may have been due to the inclement weather , but did seem rather excessive .
neutral	i will use the site again , but if delivery takes another 0 days , the delay would out way the small savings made .
neutral	delivery did not meet the final 00 day deadline and i chose a 0 wheel vehicle to make it easier for the company to deliver which meant i did not receive discounts .
neutral	other_companies have managed to deliver in a large tanker .
neutral	no calls were made to me informing_me that i would not get my delivery and i had to spend time chasing it .
neutral	bearing in mind that the account is paid in advance and there is very little security in paying by debit_card i was becoming increasingly worried_about my delivery .
neutral	the prices quoted are not any different to local companies who all provide a more efficient service with an account you settle once delivery has_been made by credit_card at no extra_cost .
neutral	hargreaves and landsdown is well marketed and one of the leading diy pension platforms in the uk .
neutral	it is easy to use and in many ways works well .
neutral	where i have been very disappointed with the company is the hidden_charges in purchasing mainstream companies in foreign stocks such as the us market .
neutral	whilst the cost of trading appears to be relatively_low_cost at £ 0 , the amount they make on the exchange_rates is considerably higher .
neutral	you typically end up loosing just over 0 % on a transaction on purchase , add another 0 % when you come to sell you '_ve paid 0 %, which is significant .
neutral	add to this the trading platform costs and the service starts to look pretty pricey .
neutral	like many financial services these transaction charges are less_than transparent and it would be preferable to charge a more realistic higher trading rate , rather_than make money out of customers through hidden_charges .
neutral	the call_center i assume based in india is hard work with the language barrier , especially if you have any query outside the norm .
neutral	unfortunately the language barrier takes a long time to explain .
neutral	everything has to be painfully spelt out and the operators , continually have to refer to a more senior person .
neutral	on a positive_note when it works and you don_'_t have to call them it '_s great value and in london speeds seem adequate .
neutral	pay your money and take your choice , but it could be a lot better !
neutral	goods very good , price a bit high when you add up the bits in the end solution , but their contracted dpd driver misdelivered resulting in a three day extra delay and if i had not tracked the item it might still be out there .
neutral	also , second person i spoke to regarding the mis delivery could do with some customer_care training .
neutral	i have tested several album packages and the top one for design , value for money , fast turn_around , accurate image rendition and the quality of the album is albelli .
neutral	i always use the high gloss option , which is always favourably commented upon by customers .
neutral	i actually agree with the above template but the gloss option on a large book is becoming too expensive and makes you look for alternatives .
neutral	booked my ferry link to find out how the former seafrance ships were doing after they became part of eurotunnel .
neutral	in general the ships are pretty_much dead .
neutral	there '_s absolutely no atmosphere to be found anywhere on board and it feels_like travelling on a ghost ship .
neutral	it takes you from a to b but that '_s just about it .
neutral	staff on board are mainly french which is a nice change compared to the cheap labour on board of other ferry companies but use it !!!!
neutral	france has got so much to offer and you ' re wasting it .
neutral	it won_'_t be long before someone pulls the plug out of this operation if there '_s not going to be some major changes ......
neutral	i went for the buy one get one free offer , however , it should have been 00 . 00 and it comes up at 000_pounds , why , i contacted them through live_chat and they told me that the tyre is free but the fitting is not , i still bought the tyres , even_though i think this should have been made clearer , i am having the tyres_fitted on tuesday , just hoping for a good experience then , will keep you informed .
neutral	not as expected - bit disappointed as didn_'_t have my favourite flowers which is why i chose the specific bouquet called princess as shown on teleflorist website .
neutral	probably would have had the same at half the price if i ' d ordered the moonlight bouquet .
neutral	i suppose the florist is limited in what they have and what percentage they receive from teleflorist .
neutral	i bought with 00_%_off which was probably passed onto the florist so less allowance for the flowers they had to supply .
neutral	i will enjoy the flower none the less .
neutral	won_'_t be in a hurry to buy via teleflorist again .
neutral	ordered 000 personalised xmas cards which are great and arrived 0 days_later .
neutral	also ordered pack of 00 with different picture & message , unfortunately i received someone_else '_s xmas cards .
neutral	phoned up a few_days_later as i was away when order arrived and was told they would re - print & resend , that was last thursday .
neutral	if they don_'_t arrive tomorrow , i will probably miss the last posting day - i will have to send 0st_class & hope they arrive in time for xmas subject to the cards actually arriving with me ,
neutral	like all mobile_phones the screen brightness in sunlight is terrible ,
neutral	i bought a desire after being told it was the best ... of a bad bunch
neutral	i ordered a phone from this company on the 00th of february .
neutral	it was supposed to ship in 0 - 00 working_days according to the order confirmation .
neutral	i complained when my order was not even despatched by the 00th working day and was told delivery would be to my door within 0 - 0 working_days and a free card_reader would be included with the order to restore my confidence in the company .
neutral	this deadline was missed too .
neutral	friday 00th of february and my order was moved to priority despatch .
neutral	monday 0rd of march and stock is being allocated to my order .
neutral	so an order that was supposed to go out and was at one stage ready for despatch but not sent was re - opened , a card_reader included , re - packed moved to priority despatch then mysteriously disappears .
neutral	and my order is yet again at the stock allocation stage .
neutral	frankly its very poor .
neutral	this company is unreliable as far as delivery schedules are concerned offering excuses and apologies but simply doesn_'_t ship the goods when they say they will .
neutral	i don_'_t mind waiting as long as the information i am given is accurate and that is where they fall down .
neutral	in that regards its the worst experience i have ever had with any company so far .
neutral	i will say this , their customer_services department responds very quickly to emails which is helpful .
neutral	update 0 - 0 - 00 : received my order today .
neutral	very well_packed .
neutral	was notified by the carrier on monday by text that a package was booked for delivery but it said es parcel rather_than se so it wasn_'_t obvious that it was my simply_electronics order they were talking_about .
neutral	so in the end i saved quite a lot of money and got a rather nice nokia_lumia 000 phone with a uk charger .
neutral	i just had to wait longer_than_expected so one star for price , another for good communication from customer_services and a third for delivering the parcel but they lose two starts for terrible performance with the time it took to deliver the order .
neutral	a company like amazon is only as good as the services they provide .
neutral	sadly amazon charge for a prime delivery service but simply cannot live up to the promises they make when they take your money .
neutral	twice in as many months goods i ordered on the prime account were not delivered on time .
neutral	i don_'_t expect miracles but i do expect to get next_day delivery on goods marked prime next_day when i pay so much per year for prime membership .
neutral	having been let_down and highly inconvenienced by amazons failure to deliver , i cannot be anything other than disappointed with them .
neutral	when a customer writes or emails a company and demonstrates that they are probably ready to spend money if the company is able to supply the appropriate item , only a foolish company fails to respond .
neutral	sadly that is precisely what i experienced .
neutral	i emailed wifigear . co . uk explaining the problem i had and asked for a solution .
neutral	no reply of any kind was received .
neutral	after 0 days i emailed them again and suggested that they ignore my first email as i was no_longer prepared to do_business with a company with such an appalling lack of customer service .
neutral	dreadful !
neutral	update_: wifigear eventually got in touch and said they had not seen my email and it must have gone into a spam filter so progress !
neutral	0 till open with 0 customers in queue , shelves very bare on my shopping day , basics like beans and cheese unavailable , staff doing the home shopping block aisles and got no regard to customers , probably going to give another supermarket a go after writing this
neutral	flew out on a very tatty plane , staff were excellent though , hotel was fantastic , pick_up for return flight left us with 00_minutes to spare at the airport , no time for duty_free , all in all a good company to book with , upgraded planes would make things a whole lot nicer
neutral	sorry tesco , but your web_site needs refining .
neutral	i have given up trying to buy from you on line as the site doesn_'_t seem to like me and won_'_t let me back when i click for more information on an item .
neutral	i have no such problem with sainsbury and ocado .
neutral	+ ve - great price , delivered on time
neutral	- ve - poor customer service , e_mailed 0 times after part went missing , only replied once
neutral	although the price of the rangemaster and hood were excellent i was not happy with the cost of the 0 man delivery .
neutral	basically whether you are spending over £ 0 , 000 . 00 or just £_000 . 00 with cookersandovens , cookersandovens charge the same for 0 man delivery , in total £_00 . 00 !
neutral	most online purchases have a structured delivery charge dependent on how much you are spending with the company - spend less , pay more delivery , which is acceptable and fair .
neutral	i would also appreciate that should a company be delivering to a top floor flat then the delivery charge would be more .
neutral	i would recommend cookersandovens but i would also recommend people search the internet for a better deal as my purchase from cookersandovens was due to wanting a specific oven that most others suppliers did not stock .
neutral	paula williams , cheltenham .
neutral	i '_ve been looking for my new ski boots .
neutral	found them in the right size and colour on ellis_brigham web_site .
neutral	i '_ve placed the order , made the payment , only to find out on the very next_day , that the boots are not longer available ... feeling bit disappointed .
neutral	p s
neutral	few_days earlier i was visiting ellis_brigham shop in milton_keynes , although didn_'_t purchased what i wanted , i left the shop under impression that people who works there are really care about costumer , and they know their job .
neutral	we booked flights from luton to tenerife with monarch .
neutral	the cost for 0 adults ( after adding all the taxes which get added to the basic price ) was £_000 . 00 each .
neutral	then there was a charge of £_00 . 00 for paying by credit_card .
neutral	then you have to pay £_00 . 00 each way for each bag you want to go in the hold .
neutral	the website says you are allowed 0k each for hand - luggage , which is barely enough for a laptop + case - although in fact at both airports our hand_luggage was not weighed .
neutral	if you want to check in on - line so you can reserve your seats it costs ( i think ) £ 0 . 00 per person each way .
neutral	you also have to pay ( around £ 0 i think ) if you want a meal during the flight .
neutral	and of course you can pay for extra leg - room .
neutral	after all these extras you may well think that this is not such a budget_airline after all .
neutral	and the stress of worrying_about having hand - luggage weighed can be considerable .
neutral	the check - in at both_ends was painless .
neutral	the plane itself is of course very basic , and leg - room is a joke - i ' m just over 0ft tall and even i found it a squash .
neutral	interestingly , if you look at the overhead lights , you can see that they do not match up with the seats - it '_s obvious that the original seats have been removed and extra rows put in .
neutral	on board they will charge you for everything .
neutral	you even have to pay if you want a blanket !
neutral	as i was paying for 0 seats , it was worth choosing a budget_airline , but if it was just the two of us , i would prefer to pay a bit more for a bit more comfort and less stress .
neutral	i purchased a 0 / 0 in ' drive 0 / 0 in ' 00 point socket this was one of only a few places selling this item ( well_done for that ) and the cheapest price on the internet , unfortunatley the cost of the post doubled the price .
neutral	i ' m_sure postage cost are reasonable for larger items but this was a very small packet and first_class poatage would have been sufficent !
neutral	got an_email_saying that only one pair ( of two ) was ready but that they would be delivered shortly , no problem .
neutral	unfortunately it took nearly a month from placing the order to get the second pair , which were nothing special .
neutral	i think amazon have a fab website and payment system .
neutral	the recommendations and other ideas are also useful and effective .
neutral	i do think that amazons pricing is expensive in some areas - i picked_up an exercise machine that i saw on amazon for 00_% less for the exact_same item by going to an_alternative website .
neutral	this delta is too large and should be addressed .
neutral	otherwise good work amazon
neutral	purchased a lg 00 " tv plus a motion grey stand on sunday which is the first time that we have purchased from this company .
neutral	the sales_person dale was very knowledgeable and extremely_helpful in us making the right choice .
neutral	we paid for the goods and waited in the collection area and then 0 guys accompanied us to the car and put the goods in the back for us .
neutral	however , ................. when we arrived home i immediately noticed that they had given us the wrong_size of tv so i rang and spoke with dale who apologised for the error .
neutral	he asked me to return it but i asked if they could deliver the correct tv rather_than us having a further round_trip of 00 miles .
neutral	i was told that it would be wednesday at the earliest before they could do that .
neutral	i required the goods before then and said that i would bring it back to the showroom on the monday .
neutral	dale exchanged the goods and once again apologised for the error but what upset me was that the company never offered any sort of compensation for the error that they made or the inconvenience that it caused me .
neutral	this lack of customer after service will make me think about purchasing from them the next time .
neutral	i purchased the miss amazing handbag deal through wowcher at the beginning of february .
neutral	after waiting over 0 weeks for my order i tried to contact miss amazing by email ( no response ) and telephone ( number unobtainable and mailbox full ).
neutral	with alarm_bells ringing i contacted wowcher for assistance and they too contacted miss amazing on my behalf to request they contact me asap .
neutral	after receiving no response i contacted wowcher again only to be advised that miss amazing are no long able to fulfill the deal .
neutral	wowcher have arranged to refund my credit_card with the £_00 i paid for the deal but i have lost out on the £ 0 postage i had to pay to miss amazing to fulfill the order .
neutral	i am unable to claim this amount on my credit_card due to it being less_than £_000 and nochex who processed the payments do not enter into disputes between buyers and sellers .
neutral	over 000 people claimed this deal - that is a lot of £ 0 '_s and i am beginning to wonder_if it was just a big scam .
neutral	not blaming wowcher - they did what they could to rectify matters but they obviously need to scrutinise their merchant partners better to avoid this situation happening again .
neutral	poor service in the vip lounge .
neutral	staff went on break on sailing la vernada bar shut at lunch_time !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a nest of tables from argos about 0 weeks_ago .
neutral	when i ordered i chose the delivery date and although it was about 0 weeks in the future i was happy to wait as the tables looked nice and the price was reasonable .
neutral	the tables arrived on the specified day of delivery so i was happy but on opening the package they looked very different to the picture on the website !
neutral	i was quite shocked as the tables looked to be poor quality and definitely couldn_'_t use them so i contacted customer_services to see what i could do .
neutral	the lady was very helpful and told me that the full_amount would be refunded to my card within 0 days and they would come and pick_up the tables in about 0 weeks .
neutral	i was a bit puzzled as to why it would take so long for them to pick them up ( and a bit annoyed to have to store them for so long ) but customer_services were very helpful .
neutral	i '_ll definitely_use argos again but perhaps for a product like this i '_ll use a different company where i can inspect it before i buy .
neutral	wouldn_'_t process a few things but eventually went through .
neutral	good routes , aircraft and staff .
neutral	sensible prices except trying to make an extra few bob on baggage and seating .
neutral	as a regular cyprus commuter , the constant moan one hears is the bun fight for boarding .
neutral	for goodness_sake , add £_00 to the fare and let folks take a bag and give them a seat number !
neutral	great prices and own_brand products are good quality at bargain prices .
neutral	however the amount of time i have had to wait for delivery is totally unnacceptable .
neutral	i ordered a list of goods valued at several_hundred_pounds for a school music department on 0th of january .
neutral	items which were marked for dispatch on 00th_january have still not arrived and the bulk of the items are not marked for dipatch until the 00th_february .
neutral	i may use them again because of the quality and great prices but i will_certainly be shopping around for an_alternative supplier first .
neutral	give them a try - once they were always the cheapest but sometimes it '_s cheaper on amazon .
neutral	sorry folks it '_s all about the money !
neutral	part . arrived broken .
neutral	had to access printer , print label , re - package and return .
neutral	requested refund which arrived some days_later .
neutral	disappointing experience overall .
neutral	was a fantantistic company to deal with -- now going the way of wiggl , too many advertising emails . also attractive prices shown as bait which when you look closer is only for one extreme version of the product eg size xxl or s . usually prompt delivery and good at sorting_out problems . would be 0_stars if they stopped acting like wiggle
neutral	promotion price appeared to be withdrawn before end of advertised period ?
neutral	product arrived in terrible packagaing .
neutral	had to return it and then is when it went from bad to worse .
neutral	ridiculous returns system .
neutral	very slow customer service .
neutral	needs some serious attention to detail .
neutral	easy to use website and many goods are cheaper_than competitors .
neutral	i chose this retailer because i was looking for a particular lipstick which i couldn_'_t find anywhere_else on the web .
neutral	bit miffed at having to pay postage , so decided that as i was going to have to pay for this i might as well increase my order and make good use of it .
neutral	lo and behold , as a previous review mentioned , i got an_email that 0 of the 0 goods i ordered were out of stock .
neutral	sadly , one of those items was the lipstick i had been searching for .
neutral	why should this happen with computerised stock control ?
neutral	to be fair i was asked whether i wanted them to cancel the order and make a refund or whether to carry on and deliver the one item they did have in stock .
neutral	good communication , but should not offer goods which they do not have in stock .
neutral	the whole_process has_been a waste of my time and i ' m now being showered with unwanted sales emails and still trying to unsubscribe from this company . that was the decider for me that i will not use this company again .
neutral	i have booked with low_cost holidays several_times and always find them very good on price and documentation always comes straight through .
neutral	howecer this time i have been charged twice from my bank_account for the holiday -- not good .
neutral	then when asked for a refund customer service not very helpful .
neutral	hope the holiday is better_than the booking system !
neutral	!
neutral	the photo was very difficult to upload to fit he photo frame
neutral	i booked parking on my smartphone and paid with visa_card .
neutral	i input the dayes and wet througb the various screens before inputting card_details .
neutral	bookibg was for 00 feb . booking was confirmed by email .
neutral	i noticed that the dates had defaulted to the date i had made the booking .
neutral	i sent an_email straight_away to cancel and amend the dates but wqs tol this was not acceptable .
neutral	they would not refund my payment .
neutral	therefore i paid for car_parking and never used it .
neutral	they got my money and did not provide the service .
neutral	despite several phone_calls to explain the situation they would not give me a refund or change the booking .
neutral	after sending this review , compnay got in touch and refunded my money , i have now booked correct dates with them as they were the most competitive price .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	bought this peplum as a gift .
neutral	the person is of average height etc but the top may as well have been a bra top .. quite a lot shorter than_expected .
neutral	the standard mail boxes of 000mb is a total_joke and is a constant issue with my clients .
neutral	other than that , i think personal name servers should be free and reseller package could do with a price review , many strong competitors like blue host , host gator etc are much_cheaper and they include unlimited mailbox size and free personal name servers as standard
neutral	initial booking was cancelled by skifrance after we had paid ( don_'_t believe they even had the chalet available to them !)
neutral	and we were offered an inferior chalet with pretty_much a " take it or leave " attitude from the uk sales_team .
neutral	eventually we took it and arrived to find stipulated single beds in all rooms was not what was there .
neutral	not an issue for some but 00 blokes on a skiing (& drinking ) holiday was not what we wanted and what had been agreed and paid for .
neutral	sorting this out was left to the resort staff , which with no help from uk skifrance they eventually did .
neutral	jo ( resort manager ) and flora and ollie ( our chalet staff ) were fantastic - couldn_'_t have been more helpful and looked after us royally .
neutral	shame the uk sales_team don_'_t share the same attitude - i doubt we will book with skifrance again .
neutral	parking is good but 0 % credit_card charge is a bit much .
neutral	booked glasgow airport_parking the week after and they do not charge anything for paying by credit_cards .
neutral	i like the range of products , and free delivery and returns .
neutral	the range of payment_options is good too .
neutral	but everything is far too expensive .
neutral	i ' m after a new phone and they are selling the 00gb nexus 0 for £_000 more than elsewhere !
neutral	i ' d buy more from them if the prices were lower .
neutral	the holiday inn at manchester_airport was very comfortable and the only complaint was that somebody damaged my car in the long stay car_park , my rhs rear bumper had a lot of white paint on it and several scratches obviously caused by a collision , it may polish out but the hotel accept no responsibility for any damage .
neutral	my phone arrived swiftly - quicker_than i had expected .
neutral	it is in full working order but i was a bit surprised that in addition to the unlocking , it seemed to have wiped many of the phones settings / features etc during some reformatting - so in fact there were no_longer any nokia themes , wallpapers , tones etc left on the phone .
neutral	also the order i put in was for a pink 0000 but i received a black one !
neutral	oh well , never mind ....
neutral	0 : if i wanted chrome , i would ask for it .
neutral	please stop trying to make us download it all the time .
neutral	0 : censorship for political reasons , regardless of who '_s opinion it is , is never in the best interest of the people .
neutral	there are lots of things that advertisers cannot offer on google and i do not appreciate your agenda stopping me seeing stuff i want .
neutral	if it is illegal - then fine .
neutral	otherwise , back off .
neutral	ordered a few engraved memory_sticks to sample out for business use ( engraved with company name etc and to go out to customers ).
neutral	claimed they came with a fitted presentation_box .
neutral	not the case , supplied in cheap dog - earred cardboard_boxes .
neutral	no response to emails sent regarding the above , was going to order around 00 but glad i got just a sample few now .
neutral	with the amount of suppliers online , won_'_t be using this company for this product again .
neutral	if the items are in stock , they are sent very fast .
neutral	quality is very good .
neutral	but if the items are not in stock , which i have been told after i placed the order , they have not been good at letting me know when i might expect delivery .
neutral	i have had to chase them for updates .
neutral	cheap phone and monthly charges have kept me with 0 for several_years .
neutral	all is well if you don_'_t have to deal with customer_services - who are useless !
neutral	i ordered a phone on 0 december and it finally arrived just before_xmas day .
neutral	my emails were ignored and i could not get through on the helpline - every time i rang i was placed even further back in the queue !
neutral	my son eventually managed to get through in the middle of the night after which the order was despatched , with no explanation of the delay .
neutral	customer service very poor so would not use again .
neutral	the htc phone i recently bought off them is excellent , definitely the best price in the uk , the only thing i did not like was the way they add on '' free '' insurance for one month which thereafter is chargeable , mainly_because you don_'_t have the option to say no initially and can easily forget .
neutral	also , why should we have to pay for a phone_call to cancel something we did not want in the first place .
neutral	a few seconds ago
neutral	not as good as expected
neutral	i ordered two_pairs of glasses on 00th_october .
neutral	one pair haven_'_t arrived yet , the pair that arrived yesterday were broken .
neutral	so not a very good start .
neutral	especially as the ones i had before broke after a year ( so they were out of warranty ) makes me think i should use high_street opticians in future even_though a bit more_expensive .
neutral	i think yodel seem to be improving as there are more positives here these days and , i have to say that , i have had a series of no - problem deliveries by yodel .
neutral	however , yesterday it was my turn to be left in the lurch .
neutral	basically the driver didn_'_t read the address correctly , thought he knew better_than the post_code and tried to deliver my parcel to the wrong_address .
neutral	the tracking site then said " address problem - please contact sender " which is pretty unhelpful .
neutral	luckily i ' d seen yodel '_s team on here and emailed for help .
neutral	laura was superb and the parcel was delivered today .
neutral	the driver claimed that the label was wrong and that he had had to reprint it - sorry that was complete rubbish .
neutral	the company is at the mercy of the free - lance drivers it hires and if they don_'_t care much we finish up with low scores on here .
neutral	if the rest of the company was as good as laura , she ' d be redundant .
neutral	i ordered 0 items of the knightsbridge bedroom range .
neutral	you were told on the website that you could choose your delivery day however that never happened and the items were delivered when i was not there to sign for them .
neutral	i rang the delivery company and took a day off to accept re - delivery , but that didn_'_t materials .
neutral	when the items did arrive there was severe damage to the boarding to the back of the 0 drawer chest .
neutral	i rang customer service and was asked to take a picture and email it to them , this i did and i received a reply to apologise and a replacement part would be with me in 0 - 0 working_days .
neutral	a replacement part ?
neutral	i emailed back to clarify if they meant a replacement unit as having paid a lot of money for ready built items i would not expect to have to repair a damaged item myself .
neutral	i received a reply to state they appreciate my frustration but as only the back of the unit was damaged a replacement part has_been ordered .
neutral	i really am shocked by this and i am investigating further with regards to my statutory_rights as the item delivered was not as_described and should be replaced and i certainly should not be expected to repair it .
neutral	unless i receive a satisfactory response from this company i would would think very long and hard before ordering from this company and advise anybody to do the same .
neutral	having phoned the customer_services department again i have mananged to resolve the issue .
neutral	i also received a personal telephone_call from the company '_s customer_care representative on this website with a sincere apology which was a pleasant_surprise and has_gone some way to restoring my faith in the company .
neutral	i spoke to soon .
neutral	although the customer_care lady appears to be very helpful she is not able control the quality of the item .
neutral	the replacement 0 drawer chest has turned_up today in worse condition than the 0st as the whole of the inside of the top_drawer is damaged and does not stay on the runners and there are two very clear visible marks to the top two drawers .
neutral	almost wishing i got the replacement part now as least i would have a useable chest of drawers .
neutral	0 / 0 / 00 update .
neutral	the 0rd set of drawers were returned and i have been refunded .
neutral	i must_say that when the customer_services reperesentative got involved in the case she did her very best , i do not necessarily think that world_stores are to blame but either their supplier or carrier but this should be investigated so that what happened to me does not happen to other customers .
neutral	due to high level of customer_care i received i would consider_using world_stores again but not for this product .
neutral	online ordering and service was efficient ..
neutral	i didn_'_t think the product i received matched the proof i looked at online at the ordering stage and as a result some of the image has_been cut_off and spoils the result .
neutral	i found the site easy to use and access the best rate of mexican peso '_s .
neutral	ordered through travel_fx 00 / 0 and paid travel_fx with an expected arrival date of 00 feb_0000 , plenty of time allowed for transaction .
neutral	was very pleased with the compare the market however what a shame the affilated parties used by compare holiday money failed to communicate , deliver on time and didn_'_t deliver the expected level of customer service , very different experience to the level of service from compare the market
neutral	my gift for a friend arrived on the same day as indicated on my order .
neutral	however , my order status was rather confusing at the summary ( header ) level it said despatched , but on checking the detail ( line ) level it said awaiting despatch .
neutral	the order status on the web_site appears not to be in real time as the order was updated on the day of delivery leading me to question the delivery date .
neutral	clearer and more upto_date information would have meant a more relaxed shopping_experience .
neutral	i ordered rye and spelt grain and coconut water and was impressed with the speedy delivery of the order .
neutral	the products i ordered are of very good quality .
neutral	however , i was shocked about the packaging of the goods .
neutral	there was so much plastic and bubble_wrap around each item .
neutral	what is the point of buying organic products when the packaging of the trader destroys what ever good the organic farmer did .
neutral	i understand that products need to be packed securely during transport to avoid damage , but this packaging was excessive and unnecessary .
neutral	i will not order from healthysupplies because of this , unless they change their packing procedure .
neutral	i called jaques to get a new cover for my foldaroll tt and mentioned that it was stored outside but under cover .
neutral	was advised to buy the black one which i did but when it arrived it was very thin and would rip easily .
neutral	on calling back i was advised that the clear one would be better ( but was made of same material ) and unfortunately out of stock .
neutral	i therefore had to return the item ( at my cost !)
neutral	and am still_waiting for a refund ....
neutral	i made a criticism of amount of water in chicken .
neutral	cost was fully refunded which was unexpected & more than fair .
neutral	i was less impressed to buy celebrity chef steaks & irish steaks to find both were exactly same but former cost £ 0 more !
neutral	felt that was misleading
neutral	purchased my sandybridge computer in march_0000 and very pleased
neutral	with the speed of the build .
neutral	however when i returned home with the
neutral	computer i discovered that the cpu cooler i had ordered and paid for
neutral	had not been fitted , had to return the item to have this mistake rectified .
neutral	but in general the computer looks great , performs great and i am very
neutral	pleased with it , if the above had not of happened then i would have had
neutral	no_hesitation in giving a full rating to this company .
neutral	i have been with vodafone for many_years now but i dont think vodafone values my loyalty at all :-(
neutral	i , foolishly , understood that this was the uk division of the company due to their ' co . uk ' internet address but - beware - this is not the case .
neutral	even worse , they do not supply uk goods !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i was caught_out by the purchase of a lumix tz00 camera which , had it been a uk model , would have been eligible for a £_00 cash_back .
neutral	panasonic uk refused to honour this for the supplied non - uk model .
neutral	august_0000 .
neutral	after my last review , pixmania have addressed the situation to my satisfaction , i have therefore increased my rating from 0 star to 0_stars .
neutral	i paid for two parcels to be delivered to my turkish home full of tesco ’_s goodies for christmas .
neutral	they were picked_up on the 00th_november , plenty of time you would think for christmas .
neutral	after using the tracking & seeing that the parcels had not moved after 0weeks i emailed parcel 0 go
neutral	got email back said they were asking parcel_force what was happening .
neutral	then after many more emails and 0mth later i got an_email that said that 0 parcel was in istanbul ( over 000_miles_away ) and the other were still in essex awaiting_collection ?
neutral	?
neutral	cutting a very long_story short one parcel did get to me well after 0mth but the 0nd one was still in essex i asked for that one to be returned to the collection address and my payment to be refunded as this is now 0mth after i sent them .
neutral	i was told that i had to arrange for someone to pick it up from the depot .
neutral	so i paid for it to be picked_up but they were told they could not find it !!!
neutral	!
neutral	then a few_days_later it turns up looking like it has_been run over by a bus !
neutral	!
neutral	email form them said they was talking to higher management about my refund and would email be the next_day or so but still 0 weeks_later no news i did get an_email in reply to a letter sent by my sister in law about damaged goods saying that as the parcel had prohibited goods i could not get any compensation !!
neutral	!
neutral	so even_though the parcel never got outside of the uk and the parcel was booked as a food hamper and it was identical to the one that customs cleared & they got me to pay someone to pick_up the parcel that was not there .
neutral	parcel 0 go will not return what i paid
neutral	email ’_s are never answered before 0weeks if at all i think the customer service is diabolical i would advise_anyone not to touch them with a barge_pole even if like me you pay extra for insurance
neutral	j mack
neutral	i have no issue with ebay except for feedback .
neutral	why is it permitted for the seller to wait to add feedback until the customer has left feedback .
neutral	surely once i have paid , and usually that is immediately , then i should be left excellent feedback rather_than the seller waiting to see what i leave for them .
neutral	surely it should not be possible to leave any feedback for a seller until he / she has left it for the buyer .. unless of course there is no payment from the buyer which should mean negative_feedback can be left by the seller after a week for exampl
neutral	like everything with screwfix just a shame i got to travel seventeen miles to a store
neutral	still a great place to go items at christmas it has great items
neutral	prices are very reasonable but i was disappointed with the product which didn_'_t work reliably .
neutral	the company did attempt to resolve the problem but couldn_'_t replicate the fault so offered a refund for the product but not postage_costs .
neutral	cheap products , fast delivery , however i ' m now getting loads of unwanted spam which
neutral	is related to the products i purchased from chemist_direct .
neutral	this includes a spam email to my contacts list !?
neutral	!
neutral	so thanks for that !
neutral	it was ok and i enjoyed shopping with littlewoods until i got delivered a bunk bed with only one mattress although the original order was for two mattresses and from then on its been total confusion .
neutral	i have booked a holiday and paying in two parts after the deposit .
neutral	i was about to pay them today over the phone as i can never make a payment online !!!
neutral	and i had an_email_saying that my payment had been declined and if i didn_'_t pay my holiday would be cancelled !
neutral	!
neutral	they had tried to take money from my bank , which was not agreed !
neutral	and now i have a £_00 bank charge .
neutral	today , the 00rd was the due date that i had to make the payment so i wasn_'_t even late with the payment !!!
neutral	!
neutral	when i rang , the girl said that we owed less_than what i said , it appeared that their site was not updated , so no its not the best , that '_s why they ' re cheap !
neutral	!
neutral	been dealing_with cpc for a little over 00 months and as a whole quite a good company to do_business with if you are ordering off the internet but because we also require catalogues this can cause problems as after numerous phone_calls to request new literature with promises that these will follow in the post we are still_waiting and with no explanation when we ring up to query .
neutral	not good business .
neutral	my only big problem is they use hermes as carriers ; they are impossible to contact if there is a delivery problem and they never bother to contact you .
neutral	they never deliver to our farm , citing ' access problem ' on their web_site .
neutral	there is no access problem as every other uk carrier delivers with no problem !
neutral	i have bought many solwise homeplug items for myself and my family .
neutral	it is not often you can pick_up a piece of it kit and it just works out of the box but to my surprise my solwise homeplugs just did .
neutral	i have a range of solwise products in our house providing wired networking .
neutral	they are fine most of the time .
neutral	occasionally one plug drops off the network and has to be reconfigured .
neutral	the 0 * would have been 0 if it had not been for the fact that my piggy0 had an issue .
neutral	after emailing solwise and following their advice it had an even bigger issue .
neutral	i arranged to return the item to solwise for repair .
neutral	even_though i had contacted solwise for advice as the device was faulty within the 0st year , because when i returned the device 0 weeks_later to them it was 0 weeks over the 0 year_warranty they refused to replace the device as it was not repairable .
neutral	it was a software fault caused by following the advice given whilst still under_warranty .
neutral	seemed harsh in my book .
neutral	solwise agreed to return the device free .
neutral	pity this little incident let them down really as generally their products are good and their support has_been strong with good technical_knowledge and assistance .
neutral	my first experience of ordering from healthspark was ruined by a lack of communication .
neutral	i placed my order in good faith , there was nothing to suggest the items were not in stock .
neutral	over a week_later my order was still_showing as being_processed , so i phoned to ask what was causing the delay .
neutral	i was informed someone would ring back .
neutral	they didn_'_t .
neutral	a subsequent phone_call revealed that the items weren_'_t in stock but a delivery was imminent , the reason for delay given as bad_weather .
neutral	someone would call me .
neutral	they did and left a very brief message on the ansaphone , saying the items should be despatched by the following_day .
neutral	they weren_'_t .
neutral	another more irate phone_call illicited an_apology for the lack of service i ' d received and a promise to enclose an extra item free of charge by way of recompense , when the items were eventually available for despatch .
neutral	the items eventually arrived and i ' m very pleased with them , but an improvement in communication wouldn_'_t go_amiss , especially as it was my first order , online and i became worried it might have been a scam .
neutral	basically a good service but ...
neutral	i have learnt not to order my fresh_fruit and veg as i always get substandard and in one case mouldy product .
neutral	it appears that my local_store ( eastbourne ) uses the online shoppers to get_rid of the substandard products that they cannot sell in store .
neutral	for other products a good service , just need to watch the sell by dates as some are short !.
neutral	delivery driver is always polite and friendly .
neutral	extremely pleased with the price and simplicity of the system however the configuration of my phones was causing one not to register , the tech files did not explain the connection of more than one phone in a network , despite soho00 being designed for businesses .
neutral	the tech_guy said take a screen_shot and email it .
neutral	this is not the attitude .
neutral	i fixed the phone myself by changing the port number from that listed in their files .
neutral	love the system improve your customer service and it will be 0_stars .
neutral	excellent value , but when tried to contact by phone was told upto 00 minuite wait , with a call back function that would save your place in the queue if you phoned back later , this does not appear to work .
neutral	other than that no_problems ,
neutral	many_thanks

neutral	worth purchasing tyres on - line for the discount offered .
neutral	had a free brake / suspension check done when having 0 tyres_fitted due to a mysterious squeak from the front end - appeared to be quite thorough when check carried_out . unfortunately they couldn_'_t pin point problem .
neutral	not a bad reflection on them as they were the second garage to check this and the first one could '_t find the problem either .
neutral	reassured me that the car is safe to drive and probably wear somewhere but it is too early to tell as squeak has just started and to come back in a few_weeks for a follow_up inspection .
neutral	overall - quite helpful but they did keep me hanging_around for nearly 0 hours and initially told me that it would be about an_hour and a half in total .
neutral	i paid extra for the fastest service so i wasn_'_t impressed when the phone was not returned as quickly as i thought it would be .
neutral	i telephoned to be told that the white casing was out of stock .
neutral	i settled for black but why wasn_'_t i informed there was no white casing in stock when they received the phone ?
neutral	why did i have to phone and chase .
neutral	why wasn_'_t the £_00 fee for the fastest service refunded to me ?
neutral	the phone looks good , albeit i settled for the black because i urgently_needed the phone back .
neutral	the phone still switches off when it gets to 00_% battery but i don_'_t think that can be blamed on the iphone surgery .
neutral	we ordered 0 blinds first time round and couldn_'_t be_happier .
neutral	then we spent some serious money on 0 more .
neutral	one of these was a bit bent on the frame and both the toggles on the long blinds to change the slat direction aren_'_t working for both_ways .
neutral	my husband will endeavour to fix it himself as you appreciate it '_s such a pain to take them down again to complain .
neutral	but this second experience may make us think_twice before purchasing again .
neutral	i ' m a long established customer of tredz so feel i can speak with some authority .
neutral	their service over the last few orders has_been poor .
neutral	one order consisted of two items and as one item was not in stock the other item was not sent .
neutral	no explanation given for the delay in delivery until i rang and queried non delivery .
neutral	ther free delivery service compared to other competitors is slow .
neutral	sometimes having to wait over a week for a delivery .
neutral	hopefully , things have improved .
neutral	i have started to ring to see if goods are in stock before ordering as there is no way to check if items are in stock on their website .
neutral	i placed an order before_christmas after checking the goods were in stock and this time prompt delivery was received .
neutral	prices are very competitive at the moment .
neutral	bought a box of 0 tiles for my kitchen as the price quoted was good .
neutral	however unfortunately 0 box didn_'_t arrive at all .
neutral	a quick phone_call and this was sorted , a new box was sent .
neutral	not a problem on their side , probably the courier , and quickly sorted .
neutral	however the reason for the 0 / 0 rating is because they refused a refund on another product i bought alongside this , that didn_'_t turn_up until many days_later - even_though i paid for next_day delivery so it should have come the same day as the tiles .
neutral	i had to buy the product from elsewhere in the end , with a view to returning it for a refund to wallsandfloors . co . uk - however to my surprise the lady declined my refund request outright " we dont offer refunds on accessories ".
neutral	of course it cannot be their fault if a courier fails to deliver on time , however it is illegal to decline a refund ( less the p_&_p costs ) if requested within 0 working_days under the distance_selling ( 0000 ) regulations .
neutral	in short , they are acting illegally , so that '_s something to look out for .
neutral	it isn_'_t worth me taking further for the sake of a few_quid , but it left a bad taste especially as the cs lady wasn_'_t too friendly .
neutral	tesco have done as asked when i have ordered from them .
neutral	they have even delivered to other people '_s addresses when i have sent a gift .
neutral	the process for this is , however , fiddly and you need patience to set it up .
neutral	overall , the website itself is poor and the range of things available surprisingly small .
neutral	on the other hand , when i complained at a tesco store despite polite responses , i had to go in and repeat the complaint to a further polite response .
neutral	neither complaint was dealt_with .
neutral	i was pleased with the quick delivery but my email to customer_services was never answered .
neutral	communication was smoothly done .
neutral	good service and saved me a lot of work .
neutral	but very expensive .
neutral	much_cheaper to have external_hard_drive back up
neutral	second time i have used them , delivery time is average and i think the
neutral	glasses i just received are not as good quality as last time but have only
neutral	paid about £_00 for a pair of reading_glasses that are useable .
neutral	i ' m impressed with the service from tooled up , less so with dpd who were used for delivery .
neutral	i got an_email to say delivery would be on wednesday , on tuesday i get a text saying delivery would be tuesday and giving a time .
neutral	they didn_'_t deliver or ring me ( clearly they have my number as they texted me ), i checked the dpd website , that says the driver couldn_'_t find the address .
neutral	dpd deliver to me quite regularly so that '_s hard to believe .
neutral	i ' m currently waiting for them to try again .
neutral	[ edit ]
neutral	i '_ve revised my rating from three to four stars because tooled_- up took the trouble to investigate the delivery problems .
neutral	i '_ll definitely_use tooled_- up again .
neutral	and dropped it back to three as dpd failed again today , two days waiting in for delivery not to happen !
neutral	i did order the goods on wednesday , today is the following_monday , but i will wait a day before i start chasing them up
neutral	i thought i would never see my 000_pounds again after_reading all the reviews , but ater a week of very nervous waiting it has arrived , am i the lucky one would i use again , dont think my heart would take it .
neutral	best be careful of what you buy , dont get caught up in the bidding war .
neutral	set your price and dont go over it .
neutral	they are not as cheap as you can find elsewhere .
neutral	basically ' buyer_beware '.
neutral	want to waste your time ?
neutral	then sit at pc on facebook .
neutral	you have a choice of course , but we ' re easily caught up on it .
neutral	take time off .
neutral	talk to your families .
neutral	the money i spend ordering for my friends , without_any discount because they have no computers .
neutral	look at what i spend , and try to come up with discounts which as i order i can pass on to them .
neutral	it is annoying and i am thinking of going elsewhere !
neutral	i ordered an arrangement for my daughter , on their moving into a new home .
neutral	i fully expected it to arrive during the day , but when it got to 0pm and i hadn_'_t heard from her , i asked if anything had arrived .
neutral	this rather spoilt the surprise .
neutral	they actually arrived just before 0pm , which i felt perhaps i should have been advised of this .
neutral	i ordered a walking_stick that was posted by oneclick as in stock .
neutral	they emailed same day ( tick ) to say though they do stock them , they had run out and it would be " a few_days " .
neutral	after 0 days i emailed them to point out that was more than a few_days and they replied that the item was " on backorder with the manufacturers with no specific lead time ," hmmmm .
neutral	the item arrived not very long after so all was well in the end , but not a brilliant experience .
neutral	they seem to automatically offer free delivery for a future order , but i ' m wondering_if they put " in stock " for items that may be stocked , but are not actually in stock .
neutral	it seems unlikely that they ran_out in the few hours between my order and their first email .... the price was good , so maybe it is trade - off ...
neutral	i ' m really pleased with the quality and variety of products very offer but i feel that the service could be improved in many ways .
neutral	very offer free delivery but it annoys_me when i place an order that due to some of the products coming direct from the manufacturer , it is compulsory to pay delivery charges .
neutral	i feel that i ' m being conned .
neutral	also when i have any_problems with delivery or wrong products being sent and i contact very to complain , i ' m always promised an enquiry and a return phone_call within 00_hours to inform me of the outcome , it never happens .
neutral	very must have the worst customer service out of any company i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
neutral	one other complaint i have is that treats are not changed frequently enough and customers should also be awarded loyalty_points for frequency of shopping .
neutral	with a bit of tweaking very could be an excellent choice when shopping .
neutral	we searched for a room and breakfast .
neutral	the room was clean and freshly painted the room was small and just fitted a double_bed .
neutral	breakfast was not included and recommended cafe too far to walk .
neutral	no hand soap in the bathroom .
neutral	however a great weekend at the big church day out .
neutral	the only objection i had was a freezer i had delivered with a 0 pin plug on it .
neutral	a large upright freezer .
neutral	i had to consult an electrician to see if it was save just to change the plug into a 0 pin .
neutral	the products we bought for my daughter '_s new flat looked great and most of them have proved to be ok - but the roasting pan non - stick coating started to come off the first time that it was used and the metal underneath rusted quickly .
neutral	we bought a rack to fit inside the tin too , and this seemed to mark the non - stick - even_though it was sold alongside the dish .
neutral	i purchased 0 items from the bolton store and was so pleased with the service and speed of the delivery , however the drivers dropped the items in the packages and left , so i could not inspect the items , on opening them i found two items to be damaged the coffee_table had a hard glue like substance on the middle along with a scratch and a black mark on the side , the dining_room chair which is part of a set of 0 had a piece missing from the leg .
neutral	i duly sent of the photos of the damages and was contacted by the after_sales_team , i was horrified to be told that they would not replace the goods but would send someone out to repair them , i explained that i had purchased new fault free goods and not ' seconds ' which would need repair and that i wanted them to be replaced .
neutral	i was informed that i had been given a handbook into the store which told me that they would repair goods and not replace them , now call me naive but i have purchased items before in fact many_times and if they have been damaged they have been replaced with new goods .
neutral	i will admit i did not sit in the store reading the owners handbook and the very nice man who sold me the goods told me that it was a book on how to look after the furniture not about returns .
neutral	i have spoken to trading standard and they told me that i could ask for the items to be replaced and if they will not do this to ask for my money back , now comes another catch , i bought my dining_room chair in a set of 0 and as they come in pairs they have told me that i can send back 0 , i can '_t send them all back as i have already had the goods for 0 days and they are not faulty .
neutral	so i am left with either 0 chairs which don_'_t make a set or i have to make do with a repaired one .
neutral	i was also told that the coffee_table could be sanded down and would look like new , who has ever paid for a new item to be told that it could be sanded down to look like a new one , i bought a new one !!!
neutral	i feel so bad about this i want to send everything back , however - can '_t do this as have had the goods for 0 days and they are not all damaged .
neutral	all in i bought a tv_stand , lamp_table , sideboard , dining_table and 0 chairs and coffee_table all of which match and are for my lounge and dining_room so sending any back would spoil the look , so what options am i left with , having to accept repaired goods , to say i think this stinks is an_understatement and to say they are transparent by giving you a book in the store which explains this is a disgrace .
neutral	all i want is what i paid for , which cost to me quite a lot of money and took some time to save i want new fault free good is this too much to ask .
neutral	update 00 / 00 /_0000 : following posting this review i was contacted by oaklandfurntiures media dept who had seen this review and others i have posted , a very nice lady_called grace was now dealing_with my problem , i explained in detail what had happened and how i felt the after_sales_team were hostile and bordering on aggressive and refsued to offer me anything but a repair .
neutral	grace listened to what i had to say and agreed that after looking at the photos of the damages it would be unlikely that they could be repaired and that it would be a waste of time sending a technician out to look and then send in a report .
neutral	therefore they have agreed to send replacment goods , however i am now going on holiday so won_'_t be here to accept the goods until i return .
neutral	grace has agreed to call me to make arrangements on my return .
neutral	so far so good , hopefully all will go well .
neutral	i do wonder however if we did not have the use of this wonderful thing called the internet where people can check before they but what would have happened .
neutral	they have terrific bargains and wide_variety of sizes .
neutral	only thing that makes me give them 0_stars is quite often there are long queues to pay .
neutral	have shopped here for a few_years now and they are exceptional good value .
neutral	in my experience they have the best reception of all the mobile companies i have used .
neutral	however their website can be very frustrating to use which is why they have only 0_stars
neutral	one part of my order was met but the other was not .
neutral	there was no order update received .
neutral	my first contact , post ordering was an_email to say that a refund had been given .
neutral	when investigating this i found that only one item of the order had been met .
neutral	no alternative was offered or an_apology .
neutral	i would carefully consider_using this company again .
neutral	i always measure the performance of a company by how they deal with problems and in this case it was unsatisfactory .
neutral	my rad was supposed to be delivered 0 weeks after i ordered it , however a week after the delivery date , i still had not received it , contacted plumbnation who said they would email me the following_day to let me know what was happening , no email , so i cancelled my order , pity they couldn_'_t be as quick at refunding my money as they were at taking it .
neutral	will not be using this company again
neutral	i have had mobile services through virgin for over ten_years .
neutral	the downside was the the patchy reception i got when i moved_house , so i gave vodafone a go .
neutral	i got great signal reception but the customer service was dreadful .
neutral	i was never probably able to access my account on - line despite spending hours waiting to speak to customers service , whose english is often so poor that the are incomprehensible .
neutral	when my contract completed i emailed stating my intention was to finish the service .
neutral	having received no reply i decided to give up an evening waiting to deal with customer service who said the email did not reach them so i had to give another four weeks worth of notice and pay for a service i was not using .
neutral	i should have complained but you get so tired of dealing_with non - english speakers that are only interested in following the company line .
neutral	back to virgin !
neutral	i have used them before several_times - not these days
neutral	they once were the number one company , but over the years the standards have drop_off quite .
neutral	i sent an order to scotland recently and it arrived 0 x days_later then what was required .
neutral	this was my first order with very and i had high expectation .
neutral	the ordering experience was good , easy to understand and make the order .
neutral	then it all went wrong .
neutral	was given a delivery date so made sure i was home , waited all day nothing delivered .
neutral	complained and did get a very quick response and offered 00_%_off as an_apology .
neutral	next_day got an_email to say my item would definitely delivered the following_day .
neutral	so tracked the item and the courier details said out for deliver .
neutral	so stayed in all day again only for nothing to arrive .
neutral	item finally turned_up the following_day .
neutral	as this was my first order i have to say i was not impressed .
neutral	yodel has a bad_reputation and they lived_up to it .
neutral	shame as it reflects badly on very .
neutral	i ordered the item and was given a delivery date which was fine .
neutral	then received an_email that i could have it delivered earlier if i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 - seemed a bit of a cheek as previous reviewers have pointed_out , however i fell for it and paid up and chose my date .
neutral	on the day of delivery i was given a two hour_slot , but unfortunately the driver could not manage that and arrived 00_minutes late .
neutral	on opening the package i found the item was damaged and have found it very difficult to resolve the matter .
neutral	complained via the chat line but the operator had to break off to go home before he resolved the problem .
neutral	cotswold emailed me the next_day to promise a new delivery date for a replacement but so far nothing has_been confirmed and no new item appears to be on the way .
neutral	they do not reply to me emails and even the chat line says they are too_busy to talk .
neutral	i have emailed to say if the replacement is not available then i would like a refund , once again a stony silence .
neutral	the only resort appears to ask my credit_card company to reimburse me for damaged goods otherwise i will have to resort to the small_claims court .
neutral	moral - the website might look appealing but if there is a problem you could be left out in the cold .
neutral	now that jet0 . com have eroded their loyalty_points system to the point of no loyalty_points on the edinburgh to alicante and murica routes , they have lost my loyalty in booking flights with them , i now check out the other airline and book the best deal offered , so far this year jet0 . com have lost 0 flights that otherwise i would have booked with them .
neutral	order process and delivery handled very efficiently .
neutral	i ordered a cabinet and although it looks good and sturdy the melamine cover is thin and the chipboard beneath is not dense enough to purvey a sense of quality .
neutral	because they have given me my ten_pounds bonus , i will change my review slightly i have commented on my review too , but i shouldn_'_t have had to go through all this just to get a deposit bonus which i was offered in an_email anyhow .
neutral	their customer service as in lucky wasn_'_t respectful or nice and didn_'_t even try to ask a manager if he could add the ten_pounds .
neutral	so i ' m not giving them a five by any means .
neutral	i gave them a 0 because that '_s about right .
neutral	plus their machines don_'_t pay out much very low payback .
neutral	i played off my ten_pounds and didn_'_t win more than 0 quid .
neutral	thanks suzy
neutral	well i got an_email , and it said deposit today and you '_ll get a 000 percent deposit bonus up to 000 hundred_quid .
neutral	so i got my tenner and off i went straight_away it didn_'_t work .
neutral	i thought oh it '_s okay like any other decent casino they will add it manually .
neutral	i get this rep called lucky and he says nice as pie , give me 0 to 0 mins to review your account .
neutral	so i says yes and then he says you have to deposit 00 pounds .
neutral	well i took exception to this as it didn_'_t say in any single piece of correspondence that it had to be a minimum of 00 quid i won_'_t bore you this lucky argued with me for about 00_minutes .
neutral	it was quite funny as he said at the end .
neutral	it would only be false_advertising if we didn_'_t give the customer their bonus .
neutral	excuse me ????
neutral	no bonus can you believe that a huge casino like winner wouldn_'_t give me a miserable ten_pounds bonus which may i add you have to play through 00 times before you can cash out .
neutral	and when i went on casinomeister to talk to them , it didn_'_t work and there were some pretty bad_reviews about winner saying that they didn_'_t pay out a few people .
neutral	so there you go .
neutral	my experience .
neutral	avoid these scamsters at all costs .
neutral	oh and i asked to speak to a manager and lucky wouldn_'_t put me through just giving me the email address .
neutral	they have a lonng way to go to learn customer service off someone amazing like say 00 red or titan bingo and casino or butlers or dream and so on .
neutral	they are rule compared to blooming winner .
neutral	no issues with the trophy i bought , which was as advertised .
neutral	great communications .
neutral	i even got a text from the courier company telling_me when to expect them , to with an_hour , which they then honoured .
neutral	my one issue was with the amount of packaging .
neutral	it wasn_'_t to protect my trophy , it was to accommodate the huge catalogue that i hadn_'_t asked dfor and didn_'_t need .
neutral	the cost of the catalogue , postage and packaging coudl have made my product cheaper for me .
neutral	hardcopy catalogues are so out of date .
neutral	if i want another trophy i know where to find your website .
neutral	its even listed in my ' favourites '.
neutral	sending me half a pund of paper is a waste .
neutral	we can find the same deals on other bigger sites too .
neutral	nothing different
neutral	their website is great .
neutral	easy to navigate , easy to compare products , lots of customer reviews ( the only way to choose and buy on - line ).
neutral	prices are keen , delivery is excellent ( next_day ).
neutral	but , the product did not work as advertised or as it says in the manual and therefore was not ' fit for purpose ' under the sale of goods_act 0000 which i pointed_out to their customer_services in 0 separate emails plus filling in a request for a return on their website .
neutral	no response .
neutral	it took a week to get a response from them ( their published policy on the website is 00 hour response ) when they finally admitted liability and accepted a return .
neutral	but it still took another chasing email from me to get them to give me a returns number .
neutral	when i did get the returns number , the process was smooth and easy .
neutral	let_down by the last 0 %, like so many companies .
neutral	or as i say , " all fur coat and no knickers "…..
neutral	wanted to use pay later - you should make it very clear on the opening page that this facility is not available to people without mobile_phones - not everyone feels it necessary to have one
neutral	if it wasn_'_t that you are the only company i '_ve found with a table 00 x 00 i would have cancelled order
neutral	very disappointed
neutral	i noticed when i printed my booking details i could hardly see the small_print so site suggests i download for android if have one .... which i have done ....
neutral	when i went in to check it out on my smart phone does not take me where i want to see my details ...
neutral	instead tells_me what to do to find a booking .
neutral	i have already done that ... all i want is be able to see my booking details ....
neutral	or is there any thing i might not be doing right ?
neutral	please advice .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	mrs anna allen
neutral	i use to buy a lot of dvds blurays and cds from play . com but some of the companies on there arnt the best , i ordered a dvd which arrived and turned_out they sent the wrong one , so i arrainged for a return i didn_'_t get a pre paid sticker from the company so i had to pay for the dvd to be returned and when they got it back they only refunded the price of the dvd not the return postage or the postage i paid to get it in the first place and nothing has_been said when i have enquired , also i ordered a cd which said would be with me within 0 days after ten days i sent an_email for them to tell me lost in transit and gave a refund i found out this company had done this to a lot of people .
neutral	took orders then said lost in transit , im abit wairy to order now
neutral	i use to be a regular fashion world customer , but i find that there clothing is getting more exspensive but the quality is getting very poor . so i have not ordered anything for over a year now think .
neutral	i have been put off completely
neutral	i ordered 0 bags of 00 kg compost and 0 00 kg compost and a fair bit of other stuff as being in a wheelchair i thought it would be easier .. ordering was simple and i ordered for next_day delivery which i got , but there was nothing on the website about the delivery guy not going to deliver the big bags to the door just because he had to walk about 0 ft , he said if he had know he would of brought his sack truck ( eh why do they not carry this anyway ) and i wasn_'_t asked when placing the order how far he would have to walk , he also said we a delivery_men not removal men .. anyway he delivered the items and i told him to put them in the bedroom as its a bungalow and is nearer to the door he was using .. and no way was he going to take them out the back .. i would use wilkinsons again .. just hope don_'_t get the same happy delivery .
neutral	or that wiil be my last ..
neutral	on the whole i like aldi for some of their prices .
neutral	fruit and veg is much the same price as asda and morrisons and not always as fresh !
neutral	i never do a full shop there .
neutral	on the whole i find the staff in the hull branch very friendly but yes i agree it can be a bit manic at the cash out if you ' re not speedy ... fortunately i ' m not disabled ot very elderly , so i manage .
neutral	i buy their seafood sticks ... love them but as i don_'_t shop there each week i froze some as it said on pocket they were suitable for home freezing .
neutral	what a disaster !
neutral	the taste and texture changed and they were watery an stringy !
neutral	i threw them out !
neutral	i wrote to customer_care because i stupidly thought that they would look into it and maybe alter their packaging and prevent anyone_else wasting their money .
neutral	i got a reply fairly quickly saying that it would be passed on to the relevant_department .
neutral	i have not heard_anything since .
neutral	that was 0 weeks_ago .
neutral	i have since been in to buy more and it still says product suitable for home freezing !
neutral	all this advertising aldi and it is paying off but don_'_t get complacent .... customer_care is important ... people read_reviews and poor reviews are bad advertising !
neutral	slow shipping rude customer service
neutral	i deposit £_00 and it lasts less_than 00_minutes .
neutral	. i '_ve had the odd good win and managed to withdraw that whilst i was ahead otherwise i would have lost everything .
neutral	lose too often and have an occasional winning spree .
neutral	it should be more balanced .
neutral	i ' m not prepared to throw £_00 in 00_minutes .
neutral	this type of gambling is not for me .
neutral	saw a groupon deal for a toshiba 0tb external_hard_drive .
neutral	just what i needed .
neutral	the deal ended that day so although i couldn_'_t really afford it until the following week i paid for it .
neutral	several days_later i got the groupon_voucher to use on the website .
neutral	when using the voucher , the website locked on checkout .
neutral	i called ' box ' who told me the website was experiencing difficulties due to demand , but to leave it until tomorrow when it should work ok .
neutral	i tried for three days , no joy .
neutral	i rang box again .
neutral	they told me they couldn_'_t take the order over the phone but that the code should work now .
neutral	i tried again .
neutral	this time it said the code was invalid .
neutral	i emailed .
neutral	they emailed back saying they couldn_'_t take the order by phone and attached two forms which my comuter couldn_'_t open .
neutral	( i have no_idea what they were ).
neutral	i emailed again saying this is getting ridiculous , i '_ve already paid for the goods i just want to pay for delivery !!!
neutral	they emailed back asking for the groupon code .
neutral	i emailed all the details .
neutral	they said the code should work and sent another attachment of a picture of exactly where to enter the groupon code .
neutral	ok not rocket_science , but why the hell didn_'_t they just tell me that on the phone days ago !!!!!
neutral	don_'_t think i can be bothered with a company that can '_t be bothered with me !
neutral	saving or no saving !
neutral	despite having 00 days to deliver the oil none has arrived to date ...... leaving levels dangerously low and causing a lot of extra effort to try and rectify ........
neutral	the car and staff were fine .
neutral	one complaint was that i was told the fuel was included in the price , which it turned_out that it wasn_'_t .
neutral	also , i was persuaded to go for a larger car , as they said that the aircon in the small cars was inadequate , and there was no space for luggage for three people .
neutral	i have subsequently hired a small car from them , and neither of these points was true .
neutral	i could have saved £_000 if they had advised me correctly .
neutral	screws loose on chairs
neutral	sharp screw ends through table top ( very bad )
neutral	apart_from above a very nice set
neutral	wanted to buy a tag ,,, initial communication with lee was great ... not pushy let me take time out to decide whilst making helpful suggestions .
neutral	finally found the one i wanted talked over price with lee and confirmed the deal .
neutral	used the link that i was given to pay for my watch ... all went great .... payment accepted payment confirmed by email ..... yippeee .
neutral	an_hour later get a phone_call to say payment is declined because the card i was using was not secure enough ... i was using an m & s mastercard , i have used this all around the world and for far larger purchases than the one i was trying to do with watchfinder . it turns_out they are unable to accept most credit_cards from third_party providors ... m & s ... a . a ... amazon ..( i use these cards because i get loyalty_points for their use ). wasted a load of time on something that should have been pointed_out at the checkout stage ... not happy ..
neutral	hopefully owneship of the watch will ease some of my frustration ...
neutral	after resigning myself to a bit of a fight for my £_00 owed , after_reading other reviews , received a reply to my email of 00 . 00 . 00 out of the blue on 00 . 00 . 00 with an_apology and to advise that the funds would be transferred to my bank today .
neutral	lo and behold i checked the bank_account and there was the cash !!!
neutral	!.
neutral	although the payment took a lot longer_than advertised , i did get my cash in the end so i have to give credit to the company for that .
neutral	is it just perhaps that the company has_been overwhelmed by the goods being send and their processes are not robust enough to cope ?.
neutral	- hope that all the other customers who have been waiting for payment get the monies due in the near_future as well
neutral	overall my experience was ok & i would use again .
neutral	my only problem was the the scooter control_panel was advertised as blue and even said on the bag it was blue but is actually black .
neutral	also it did not have any instruction on how to fit it .
neutral	fortunately i managed to wotk it out and fit it for my wife .
neutral	i was satisfied with the product and price paid but delivery time was much longer_than other online shops
neutral	my sky modem started_playing up and they replaced it quickly without_any_problems .
neutral	performance of sky broadband is great and you can ring up and speak to a real_person if you have any questions .
neutral	the setup is also much_easier than other_providers i tried ( i moved to sky from aol , who made a lot of fuss about ' allowing ' me to transfer )
neutral	recently_purchased a bbq chiminea ( la hacienda ).
neutral	after unpacking i found the base part had a severe crack .
neutral	looks_like a manufacturing defect , not garden best buys fault , but the manufacturers quality_control ..... lets_see if i have a happy ending ... or another week waiting for a replacement ....
neutral	i used to use them but we get seeds cheaper through the allotment .
neutral	but once they have your details ...
neutral	i ' m told the flowers i sent arrived in good condition despite the packing being soaking_wet and falling_apart .
neutral	the card with the message to the recipient had fallen deep inside the bouquet and was difficult to find .
neutral	however , i ' m told the flowers themselves were beautiful so i guess the state of the packaging was down to the delivery people ( yodel ) rather_than serenata_flowers .
neutral	i think they are good value for money for delivered flowers and will use them again .
neutral	i have been on ancestry for a number of years .
neutral	i always found it to be excellent i have found a lot of my family on it .
neutral	this last few_months i hadn_'_t been happy .
neutral	i tick only english and irish ancestry only and all the american records appear .
neutral	i also find if you only want one set of records all the others the other records come up as well .
neutral	i don_'_t think the site is easy to move around very complicated to get we ' re you want to be .
neutral	not sure if i will_continue to use it when my subscription runs out
neutral	the whole_experience was reasonably hassle_free , despite 0 trips to london .
neutral	at first they said i could get varifocal_lenses , however this was later changed to single_vision lenses due to my right eye .
neutral	the price then changed , lower , however i had to go to cambridge and ask them to adjust the price , as i believe they would have just charged the varifocal price for the cheaper option !
neutral	the rle exchange operation was painless and nothing to be worried_about and the staff at the clinic very professional and pleasant .
neutral	i was told that i would just need cheap of the shelf reading_glasses after treatment , this turned_out to be untrue .
neutral	i ended_up needing varifocals as cheap reading_glasses were a pain as i needed one pair for reading and another pair for computer work .
neutral	my distance_vision could also be improved with reading_glasses for which they wanted me to pay an extra £_000 !
neutral	i then insisted they give me a prescription and got 0 pairs for half the price elsewhere .
neutral	my vision is much_better , but not perfect in low light conditions i get " halos " if i look at bright lights .
neutral	you need to ask the right questions and be a bit less trusting than i was about the expected improvements in vision .
neutral	knowing what excellent quality the men '_s underwear is i thought i would take_advantage of the womens sale products .
neutral	i ordered what was available in my size but later received an_email to say one product wasn_'_t now available and could i choose anther item .
neutral	i duly did and then 0 days_later had a similar email - now hardly any choice !
neutral	however , after lengthy delay i got my items which i am pleased with .
neutral	may be better to order by phone as the onlne ordering is not what it should be .
neutral	disappointed that you only cover laptops up to £_000 - doesn_'_t fill me with confidence , suggests that you can '_t deliver a valuable laptop safely .
neutral	actual delivery is cheap enough but , like rip - off ryanair , by the time i added insurance ( which didn_'_t cover the full value of the item ) and signature - on - delivery , the cost more than doubled so a bit of a con really .
neutral	i booked the swallow hotel in ibrox this year for a friend and myself , on approach it looked okay but couldn_'_t find the entrance eventually i spotted it and thought it was the delivery entrance !!
neutral	i checked in , the poor guy behind the counter was manning both the reception_area and the bar !
neutral	i was directed to our room , it was all a bit shabby ( not chic ) and tired looking , none of the electrical equipment worked and i informed reception he then offered me another room which i accepted on approval it was slightly bigger and dare i say better looking , although the hair_dryer didn_'_t work i did get a replacement .
neutral	the staff where helpful and friendly , breakfast was good , the hotel was near the venue i was going to , i would book here again if nothing for the staffs good nature and attendance towards me , and everyone_else there as apparently it was the busiest it '_s been for a while .
neutral	i haven_'_t used it yet or more to the point he hasn_'_t used it yet lol
neutral	hey , where '_s the free shipping .
neutral	free shipping is not a gimmick .
neutral	it is not worked into the price of the product .
neutral	most internet suppliers offer free shipping on larger orders .
neutral	plus points .. website easy to use .. orders despatched quickly and kept_updated
neutral	down points ..
neutral	part of order was not worth the money .. i . e .
neutral	plastic plates ( really thin !!)
neutral	-- could have got at my local supermarket for a lot less ..
neutral	not worth returning by the time you pay postage .. i e . mailed partyrama - no reply - as yet ..................... !
neutral	remote works and is identical to original , no_problems .
neutral	hotel okay .
neutral	hardly saw any members of staff during stay .
neutral	breakfast was appalling - took 00_mins to take order then was cold when it eventually arrived - kids running about everywhere - no cups for coffee - no glasses for juice .
neutral	i recently_purchased some studio lighting and wanted answers to two very simple questions .
neutral	my initial email has_been ignored (" we have had technical problems !!")
neutral	then my phone_call was met with " there is nobody to answer your questions as they are all being trained " hopefully in how to provide better customer service .
neutral	it '_s a good job there are plenty of other_providers out there .
neutral	there is a recession on isn_'_t there ??
neutral	?
neutral	i ordered this product at the end of october .
neutral	unfortunately , i could not find the estimated delivery time .
neutral	i went back into the order several_times to try to locate the shipping details to no_avail .
neutral	i could see once the product status was shipped , but i had not received the goods or locate the delivery date to ensure someone would be home to receive the product .
neutral	the product finally arrived and luckily left with a good neighbour who gave it to me as soon as i came home from work .
neutral	this is a good site where much savings can be made , but it is important to keep the customer in the picture all the way to avoid un - necessary panick or concern over missing items .
neutral	therefore i would suggest that an easy to use screen detailing the shipping details and estimated delivery date would have made this move from a 0 to a 0 .
neutral	easy to order and all seemed fine , but after 0 days i received an_email apologising the item was out of stock .
neutral	would of thought that would have been obvious if stock control was working :( anyway i am now held up doing the job for at_least 0 weeks whilst transair restock .
neutral	previously have visited the shop in shoreham with no issues so i hope its just a minor glitch with this product .
neutral	next time i '_ll check stock before ordering !
neutral	our connecting flight from myrtle beach to newark , nj was delayed_due to a tropical storm in ny .
neutral	we had checked - in to our ldn bound flight in mb .
neutral	when we eventually got to newark , the ldn flight had departed .
neutral	we had to sleep on terminal floor , then call london to get on next flight , which we had to pay an additional £_000 to get on , because we were classified as ' no shows ', in spite of chking in & the tropical storm closing newark .
neutral	0 other_travellers in our group , who were on same flight , booked through continental , were put up in a hotel o / n & put on the next flight home at no extra_charge .
neutral	have not flown with virgin since .
neutral	t - mobile do have a pretty good technical team , and over the past 0 years they have responded very well to most of my questions .
neutral	however , i still have signal problems , it constantly drops ( and this is in high population areas like central_london !!
neutral	), signal_strength is erratic , this has_been the case since the service was merged with orange .
neutral	as for the phone , well it was recommended to my by one of the t - mobile shops , an htc_wildfire , and it has to be the worst phone i have ever used , slow , frustrating , inspite of having great features .
neutral	pity the shop didn_'_t recommend the vastly superior desire at the time .
neutral	not the best phone company , but i get a great deal , and overall , for the cost , its pretty good ..... time to get a different phone !
neutral	( and no signal problems are not the phone , get the same problems when using a nokia and an iphone_0gs , also friends also using t - mobile have experienced the same problems ).
neutral	good but confirmed delivery was wrong .
neutral	it was delivered 0 days_later after i sent an_email to mytub
neutral	when it works its fantastic but i have had many transactions that have not tracked and it is sooooo hard to contact them .
neutral	they make it difficult for you to email them and most of the responsed dont allow for replies .
neutral	i have had transactions declined that show on the system and the trans details were given by the company i purchased from yet it is declined ???
neutral	it is far too hard to sort_out the transactions that dont track properly of which i have had six this year .
neutral	all unresolved .
neutral	all i cant talk to quidco about until they contact me .
neutral	really frustrating company to deal with .
neutral	nice range of different coffees : work well with my espresso machine .
neutral	however , i don_'_t find the aroma or the depth of the flavours match those of nespresso coffee .
neutral	the volume of water also has to be significantly less to get equivalent taste .
neutral	so it was cheaper to buy , with fast delivery , but i get about half to 0 / 0 of the coffee .
neutral	i wanted to host an existing domain on a uk_based server , so this seemed a good hosting option .
neutral	their interface is difficult to navigate and i found the domain transfer experience a little clunky .
neutral	i have installed wordpress on other_sites hosted on other_companies using fantastico etc and found that very easy .
neutral	it is not straightforward with 000 - reg however and i had to enlist their online_chat support .
neutral	this support was very good however and their agent marian was excellent .
neutral	the 000 - reg pricing was good too as i bought during a promotion period .
neutral	we '_ve had a first tunnel polytunnel for the last 00 years and we have had great fun and success with it .
neutral	we knew it was going to be hard to build initially , but all went well , just took time .
neutral	after 0 years we replaced the polythene and some of the timber which had rotted .
neutral	it worked ok .
neutral	this time , we replaced the polythene and timber and doors and found it more difficult than_expected .
neutral	we needed an angle grinder to cut_off seized bolts and intuition that was not in the instructions to build the doors and door frames .
neutral	we have our great polytunnel back again , but also a large load of extra spare_parts that seem to come with the order .
neutral	the parts did not match the instructions or the intended contents of the packs , but with a range of tools and some spares from around the house we re - built it .
neutral	we are back growing again , but it could have been far easier with a little more forethought from first_tunnels .
neutral	i live in aberdeen .
neutral	the guitar i ordered from gg in glasgow took a trip to birmingham which is the logistics centre of the courier company they use .
neutral	that seems crazy to me and gg should be looking to reduce their carbon footprint .
neutral	when i received my guitar the battery in the pre_- amp was flat , i had to replace it before i could use it .
neutral	a small thing that should have been picked_up on the pre_- delivery inspection .
neutral	it seemed that when tesco '_s delivery service started it was really effective , and the result of an operation that was getting a lot of focus within an organisation with massive means .
neutral	it now seems like the massive means is bored with the delivery service , and their is not a lot of effort into making it right .
neutral	if i went in to the shop i would not select the produce that is going to fall out of date soonest , yet when i go online it seems that his is what you get automatically .
neutral	substitutes will always happen , and that is the luck of the draw - my biggest bug_bear is getting stuff delivered that only has a couple of days left to be used .
neutral	need i say more
neutral	i recently bought an indesit id00 tumble_drier it was ordered payed for and delivered as stated no_problems after 0 days the machine broke_down i rang electrical 000 . com but after 0 minutes waiting on a 0000 number at 00p a minute ( sky ) i decided to try indesit directly another 0 days untill repaired not impressed with quality of machine ??
neutral	, not electrical000 . coms fault but should answer phone quicker and have a normal phone number as it is expensive waiting on these premium phone lines .
neutral	ordered a hand mixer , really pleased with the price and communication but disappointed with the 0 day wait for delivery
neutral	this was the first time i ' d actually seen an eflorist bouquet .
neutral	i '_ve ordered 0 in the past by to family and friends much further afield , so therefore unable to see the actual quality and standard of the bouquet and flowers supplied .
neutral	ordered the ' wow ' bouquet for my parents anniversary so was able to view it .
neutral	the bouquet is described as follows_:
neutral	wow
neutral	ref_: cr00aqpvb00r
neutral	a vibrant chorus of pink gerbera and zesty green chrysanthemum highlight this colouful mix .
neutral	warm orange roses and deep purple lisianthus cool the heat of this contemporary design .
neutral	price : £_00 . 00
neutral	unfortunately , my bouquet to my parents was very poor .
neutral	lots of yellow chrysanthemums and one pink rose !
neutral	no purple lisianthus and certainly no pink gerbera .
neutral	in fact , it was scarce of flowers !
neutral	not happy at all having paid top end prices !
neutral	will think_twice about using in the future as certainly expected better given the reviews .
neutral	glad i was able at long last to see one i ' d ordered !
neutral	the containers were exactly_what i needed although half the size i was looking for . when the delivery man arrived the package was very badly_damaged but the contents were fine .
neutral	disappointed with the flowers , some were brown around their edges .
neutral	looked like they had been prepared earlier in the day .
neutral	didn_'_t think they were value for the money £_00 would have been a most fare price .
neutral	the car was not sold through pistonheads but it was advertised elsewhere and sold , i did have a few emails from people through pistonheads asking for info that was in the advert so they obviously hadn_'_t read it properly !
neutral	also one man sent me an_email asking me the " real " price of the car as he had seen it advertised for half the price , which certainly isn_'_t true it was only advertised at the price shown on pistonheads or more !
neutral	!.
neutral	i didn_'_t receive any phone_calls at all , but i would probably use your website again to advertise cars for sale .
neutral	we bought some rhubarb crowns earlier this year , great price , sadly no sign of any growth from them
neutral	oh well you lose some / win some with plants !
neutral	but still a long way to go to match dfds ' prices and level of service !
neutral	i bought metro wall tile and black floor tile they arrived very quickly and on time when they arrived they was on a pallet and wrapped when i opened them one box off floor_tiles was ripped and 0 tiles broken after 0 e_mails i got a e_mail back asking for photo off the broken tiles i sent a photo no reply sent photo 0 times in all before i got a reply saying they would replace them so just waiting should arrive tomorrow but the tiles are good quality and very pleased with them
neutral	mr tey at manchester carried_out the lens replacement surgery on 00th_jan and 0th_feb_0000 .
neutral	customer service staff were excellent , nursing staff less so .
neutral	yes , i complained and yes they investigated and apologised .
neutral	my reading vision is superb and i can read thread needles again without the need for a magnifying glass which is marvellous .
neutral	my distance_vision remains distorted , sort of drop shadow or double vision .
neutral	i had glasses made to help with the distance_vision but they don_'_t improve things enough for me to drive .
neutral	i go back for a follow_up visit first week in april and hope i can get a prescription for glasses for distance work so that i can at_least drive while waiting for my brain to catch up with my lenses .
neutral	after_placing the order ( after ) we were surprised to be told that the item was not in stock , but will take about a week .
neutral	very poor practice whitebox , nevertheless all turned_out ok .
neutral	it would still have been nice to know that there was no stock at the point of paying .
neutral	i was switched to monarch holidays without being told . hotel very poor
neutral	my order arrived today , couple of days_later than_expected , but as we have just had easter , i expect that had something to do with it .
neutral	very disappointed that one item on my order was not included and noted as ' out of stock ' on note included .
neutral	i would have expected to have received an_email straight_away from them stating item out of stock so i could purchase elsewhere .
neutral	not sure if i will order from them again due to this .
neutral	shame as they appear to have a good range of products - providing they are in stock !
neutral	i originally put 0 tickets up for sale on this website .
neutral	i sold 0 .
neutral	i then decided that if the remaining 0 didn_'_t sell then i would go to the summertime ball myself .
neutral	i already had to take my daughters there with their friends anyway .
neutral	i emailed viagogo on friday_night asking where to go to collect my tickets - no reply to date .
neutral	i called customer_services , i only called to find out where ( in the event that the tickets didn_'_t sell ) i could collect them from .
neutral	after a 00 minute call the assistant was unsure where i should go and said she would call me back on the number on my account .
neutral	she never did .
neutral	i then realised that contrary to my instructions my tickets had been taken off sale from prime position - no 0 on the list !
neutral	so she had managed to not answer my query and stop my tickets being sold !
neutral	after dropping my daughters off i called customer_services again from wembley .
neutral	he couldn_'_t tell me where to collect them from either and put me on hold .
neutral	after 00_minutes it switched to the automatic survey and the call terminated !
neutral	i now discover he sent me an_email - which had no information in it .
neutral	so i didn_'_t sell my tickets and i didn_'_t get to the concert .
neutral	now they won_'_t reply to my emails .
neutral	don_'_t sell here - give get me in a try - i will next time !
neutral	viagogo transaction_id 00000000 .
neutral	so - viagogo '_s reaction to the above was impressive and they promise a refund for the unsold tickets after admitting their staff were in the wrong .
neutral	however they say the refund will take 0 weeks ( something to do with international banking ?).
neutral	we '_ll see ........... and i '_ll update this entry when in another 0 weeks !
neutral	everything_went ok , very good service .
neutral	but if you choose the argos card : you can only use them in store , and not take advatage of on line discounts .
neutral	i would have been better off if i had taken a cheque !
neutral	as the in store prices are higher ........................... robert .
neutral	slow but good for simple html websites .
neutral	sometimes they would hold some of the files probably making money !
neutral	i recommend paying a bit more to get better .
neutral	i am a huge_fan of amazon and up until now have thought their policies have been great but i am stunned they refunded this customer who threw the item away and expected ( and got ) a refund
neutral	speedy and accurate as usual but 0 pence worth of plastic turned into 0 pounds per knob plus the addition of vat and then carriage
neutral	sent a well_packed and protected travel - size guitar to us .
neutral	by usp via trans - global , box was smothered in fragile tape .
neutral	customer collected from the depot as he was out when delivery made , then went direct to the payment service , paypal and complained that it was damaged , they removed the funding from my account , i forwarded his pic '_s of the damage to t - g who then contacted usp who refused to accept the fault as the customer did not open the box ( which had no damage ) at depot .
neutral	paypal refunded the customer , i lost both guitar and money even_though i had not done anything wrong .
neutral	no wonder we are all going_bust !
neutral	somebody dropped this from a great hight to split the body but who ?
neutral	i know who didn_'_t , but i lost out all_round .
neutral	needed a shower_tray urgently as plumber arriving and discovered old tray cracked .
neutral	so i paid for next working day ( monday ) delivery which happened sadly with a very broken shower_tray .
neutral	despite ringing bathempire straight_away , they could not deliver until the wednesday and guess_what the second tray was cracked too but at_least this time bathempire arranged for delivery the next_day ( thursday ) and finally a complete item arrived and was fitted .
neutral	aside from the first time we rang , the company was eventually very responsive and sympathetic to our needs although the shower refit job took 0 days longer_than it should .
neutral	disappointing that no compensation offered particularly as i paid £_00 for quick delivery which took 0 days for a shower_tray to arrive in one piece !
neutral	we ordered some smart designer handles , really good service , no hassle , easy to read and choose the ones we wanted .
neutral	however , the delivery seems to have been so slow .
neutral	we haven_'_t seen any sign of the handles as yet and thats got to be one of the slowest deliveries we have ever had .
neutral	yet to see if the handles are up to our expectation !
neutral	take a big fat wallet if you are thinking of having a few drinks .
neutral	and dont forget the £ 0 overnight parking fee ( or was i shafted ) ?
neutral	well_packaged on arrival , no external damage visible , so happy to sign for .
neutral	unfortunately 0 of the bars ( 0x width , 0x length ), had slight end distortion .
neutral	these were manipulated by me and i continued to build the 0 bays .
neutral	although i bought the bay link " sleeves ", i decided to join the 0 bays with nut , bolt & washers ( as allowed by big_dug instructions ), for a very secure fit .
neutral	i ' m of the old school , where all levels must be right before securing which was reasonably easy .
neutral	however my main gripe with these bays are the shelves .
neutral	none really sat in the shelf bays satisfactorily ( 00 in all ).
neutral	this has however changed once reasonable weight ( i . e .
neutral	stock ) was placed on the shelves .
neutral	i don_'_t know if once weight is removed that the shelves will " pop " out of their seating place .
neutral	all i can say is , once i built them i had problems simply seating the shelves and was cursing the shelf dimensions , which appeared oversize .
neutral	only time will prove the overall value of this shelving system .
neutral	the info below is as it happens .
neutral	i do have to add that after writing this update i heard immediately from sofia .
neutral	i was happy with the outcome and an offer of £_00 voucher .
neutral	i will use this voucher for a new flight and keep my fingers_crossed that nothing_happens to change my newly found faith in this company !!
neutral	!
neutral	update would take it from one star to 0_stars !
neutral	below is the response i received from sofia on bravofly .
neutral	wow i thought .......... great news !
neutral	someone from the company taking me seriously and wanting to respond because they were concerned about customer_relations .
neutral	they would get back to me as soon as possible .
neutral	i responded_immediately .
neutral	it is now the 00rd jan and the response was received on 0th_jan .
neutral	so much for a quick response .
neutral	i was quite happy to put the record straight and write a decent review about sofia .............. oh sofia you have let me down so badly .
neutral	it could have been so good .
neutral	this is what you wrote to me :
neutral	i am writing to you with regards to your comment written on the trustpilot website regarding your booking with bravofly .
neutral	we are extremely sorry to hear that you have had a bad_experience with our customer service and rest_assured that despite the fact that the flight date has passed we investigate your situation thoroughly in order to resolve the matter .
neutral	you mentioned in your comment that you had written a number of emails without response .
neutral	could you please confirm to what email address you wrote to at bravofly and which email address you used yourself .
neutral	this way i can look into the matter in more detail and respond to your complaint as soon as possible .
neutral	kind_regards , sofia
neutral	purchased a nextbase in - car portable twin dvd_player and can '_t fault the product however the delivery by dpd was a fiasco !
neutral	it must be said that 0wm really worked hard to resolve the delivery problems and without their efforts i would probably still be waiting for the product !
neutral	thank_you 0wm .
neutral	dpd not only failed to deliver on three seperate dates but went on to lie about leaving calling cards and managed to lose the first order and only finally admitted they did not attend on arranged dates after three_weeks .
neutral	so thank_you amy of 0wm you did more than_expected .
neutral	0_stars due to dpd ( would be 0_stars otherwise ).
neutral	i have been getting regular emails from quotiva telling_me that my musical instrument insurance renewal is soon .
neutral	the fact that i have no such insurance makes this kind of cold call based on a downright lie as welcome as a new delhi call regarding my computer .
neutral	openness , transparency and honesty are the way to increase a customer base with loyal_customers , not the tactics used by the more dubious scams .
neutral	i have given quotiva a chance to quote , lets_see what they do before asking me to review them
neutral	ordered in stock item with a ten day delivery .
neutral	notified after four days of out of stock item and taking a further week to deliver .
neutral	notified of revised delivery date and time and delivered on time .
neutral	pity about delay but good communications and a good price so will try this company again .
neutral	goods fairly_priced , but then postage on top .
neutral	fair delivery and speed .
neutral	service spoilt by daily advertising e_mails following the order .
neutral	this will rule out my ordering from them again , unless desperate for a particular product
neutral	i am writing this review as to do so will get me a £ 0 . 00 credit .
neutral	i have just ordered from this company ; the ordering was simple ( big deal - would you expect it to be difficult ?
neutral	).
neutral	as the item hasn_'_t arrived yet i have no_idea if it '_s quick or not , or if the item is any good .
neutral	we '_ll see
neutral	try book depository as prices are frequentky cheaper and you get free shipping .
neutral	amazon seems to have a larger range though .
neutral	it `_s a pity that , not many companies offer just broadband anymore .
neutral	everyone wants your telephone line .
neutral	i '_ve traveled now a few_times ryan_air and to be honest i would rather have better customer service , before during and after the flight .
neutral	for those that like cheap then you can '_t complain , but i find the staff slightly aggressive at the airports and the seats on the planes so cramped that you certainly shouldn_'_t expect to move after you sit down .
neutral	i like the idea of trustpilot , but when i wrote a comprehensive review about f u , a lousy utility company , to warn_people to avoid them at all costs , your site made it very difficult for me , and i certainly wondered whose side you were on .
neutral	it wouldn_'_t recognise my account number , and i lost the text once , but as i had saved it , i managed to get it on there by adding it as a ' comment ' to a review by someone_else , who had written an avoid notice too !
neutral	three stars for now , but will be back to try you again .
neutral	der er tit udfald på internettet
neutral	er træt af atblive ringet op flere dage i træk hvor man vil sælge de samme ting som dagen før jeg gider ikke telefonsælger

neutral	i bought a lovely brown leather sofabed from this company sofa - company . co . uk for only one reason - that they managed to deliver the sofabed within 0 days of my phone_call .
neutral	i came_across their website and they said they could deliver the next_day .
neutral	so i gave them a call and they said they would deliver in a week .
neutral	when i pointed their next_day delivery promise on the website , they agreed to deliver in the next 00_hours with a surcharge of £_00 .
neutral	they advised me to have someone with me when they deliver the sofa .
neutral	when i said why , they said they might not be able to carry the sofa into the home .
neutral	this was the first i heard on the grounds of health and safety .
neutral	when they delivered the sofabed as promised , the courier men refused to bring the sofabed into the home even when we asked them politely .
neutral	they just left the sofabed in cardboard_box on the kerbside and left .
neutral	i could not believe it .
neutral	it was raining and i could not carry the sofa inside .
neutral	i had to call someone to come and help us carry the sofabed inside .
neutral	this was a big disappointment .
neutral	otherwise the sofabed is lovely and elegant .
neutral	i used your service once before and was happy so used again however you changed my item before delivery and as it was already delivered could not do anything .
neutral	easy to use website and like the facility to order more than one currency per order .
neutral	unfortunately i was left short of a note and although i was issued an_immediate_refund i ' m_afraid it has left me feeling very nervous_about using travelex again .
neutral	good value airport hotel
neutral	after_reading all the bad_press about this company i was gutted and kicking myself for going with the lowest_price (£_000 less_than high_street ), i really thought i had been_scammed and i would not see the goods or my money again .
neutral	i ordered a camera the saturday of a bank hioliday , the website said it was in stock and delivery would be 0 - 00 working_days .
neutral	money was taken from my card immediately .
neutral	after a week i checked the status and it was still pending so tried to contact the company .
neutral	phoning was a waste of time , put into an endless queue .
neutral	i did fire off an_email and did get a response the next_day saying they could not give me an eta but would ship when they could !
neutral	i was considering at that point cancelling the order but decided to leave it a bit longer .
neutral	camera arrived this morning , brand_new , uk leads etc .
neutral	in total it took 0 working_days to arrive .
neutral	finger '_s crossed i never need to send it back for repair .
neutral	i don_'_t think i would deal with this company again even_though i got a bargain , too stressful !
neutral	delivery quick but part was useless as it made my broadband slower ..
neutral	this was a good but basic flight , went to benidorm , not a lot of space for your legs but there was refreshments on board !
neutral	the price was reasonable but had cheaper flights with more leg_room !
neutral	good site to use for job hunting , clear colourful and helpful
neutral	my album arrived and the quality was great , unfortunately the first two pages of photos were missing .
neutral	i phone photoworld and their reaction was almost disbelieving of me , as though it was my fault .
neutral	i returned the album a week ago , phoned after 0 days to be told they were dealing_with it but to date have not received a replacement , no phone_call acknowledging_receipt of incorrect album or courtesy_call to advise me what is happening .
neutral	would not use them again which is a shame as the quality looked really good .
neutral	delivery bang on time but unfortunately to wrong_address !
neutral	tried to log on without_success claiming my email was not recognised .
neutral	contacted support desk who sent me a new password which works on fusion support desk but still not recognised on main website which is most frustrating .
neutral	i ' m_sure this is just a glich but does cast an unnecessary shadow on what is a very good site and would definitely recommend to friends .
neutral	i was expecting a delay , and simultaneously i see on my computer and everything restored itself andthe payment went through fine .
neutral	anyway , apart_from this mystery , which knd of alarmed me , because i gave the precise information , this company seems efficient .
neutral	i will obviously know more about the company at the end of september , when i return from my holiday /
neutral	har lige været i london og paris via esbjerg - harwich , kahytter ombord er alletiders . personalet gør det bedste de kan .
neutral	problemet er maden , den er det samme hver eneste gang . anretninger er stablet op på fade i bunker , det ser ikke særligt indbydende ud .
neutral	jeg_har flere gange beklaget mig til personalet over at der bl . a mangler fedt til silde maden . svaret er for det meste ," vi kan ikke tilgode se alle kundernes behov ".
neutral	spørgsmålet er bare kunne manikke bare have en mindre forsyning med , hvis nogen spørger . hvor er den danske flæskesteg / ribbensteg henne , samt pålæg .
neutral	der må og skal være et sammen hæng mellem det der serveres , hvad laver rødbeder sammen med laks og anden fiskeanretning .
neutral	morgenbordet er heller ikke hvad det har været , røræget er meget bastand , det bør være blødt og saftigt , der mangler bacon . brødet især wienerbrødet har fået for meget varme . de blødkogte æg var gode , samt det frisk bagte rugbrød .
neutral	der mangler et sammenhæng mellem smag , fremstilling samt udseende .
neutral	dem der fylde op , med de brune jakker på , skal lære mere om hvad de har med at gøre . jeg oplevede en indisk bedstemor som spurgte ind til hvad de forskellige ting var . hun fik et halvt svar , og så gik vedkommende bare sin vej , uden reelt at svare på hendes spørgsmål .
neutral	alt andet end maden fungerer perfekt på båden .
neutral	great product at a very good price .
neutral	delivery was slow as ordered over xmas_period .
neutral	website did not say they were shut .
neutral	for years bs staff have been , in my opinion , arrogant and snotty and their planes less_than clean .
neutral	not my favorite airline but better_than some .
neutral	ordered ' angry birds ' board game on 00th_november .
neutral	received standard ' will update in 0 days - delivery 0 days ' email .
neutral	card payment taken .
neutral	0 emails sent around 0th / 0th_december to chase up - no response .
neutral	then found all the reviews on trust_pilot so sent messages to info @ nicecans . co . uk , admin @ nicecans . co . uk and filled in ' customer complaint ' form from web - site , saying i would be contacting consumer direct etc .
neutral	also concerned that although payment had been taken , the ' order status ' on my account page showed ' awaiting payment '.
neutral	these messages very quickly ( by next_morning ) produced results , in rapid succession : one message_saying ' status of order updated to awaiting despatch ', two more saying there had been a delay in stock coming in but this had now been received ' and a final one at 00am the same morning ( 0th_dec ) saying despatched .
neutral	arrived 00th_december ( not bad for standard post at this time of year !)
neutral	game was well_packed and all ok .
neutral	so the moral of the story is : order early and be prepared to badger them !
neutral	a pity - because prices seem good and eventual outcome ok . are they just overwhelmed by the pre_- christmas_rush ?
neutral	p . s .
neutral	i can guarantee i have no connection with nice cans other than via this order .
neutral	a genuine customer from sleepy south norfolk !
neutral	the products are very good and competitive , navigating the website could be improved especially when adding products to your basket and then trying to return to where you were last at to continue shopping .
neutral	i purchase some product and then noticed another couple of products i wanted to add to my order , but couldn_'_t .
neutral	amazon and other_companies can cope easily with this but fragrance_direct can '_t .
neutral	i thought i would order them and then ask fragrance_direct to combine them , or as a concession refund the second postage charge for the second order .
neutral	even_though these were large purchases the customer service was very poor and responses received didn_'_t answer my questions raised .
neutral	it was as if they couldn_'_t understand me or chose to ignore the key points .
neutral	i would not use them again despite_being a loyal_customer for many_years now .
neutral	reasonable speeds on my desktop but very low on my laptops
neutral	this is one of only two networks that i can receive in west wales
neutral	i ordered a personalised knife from them a few_months_ago .
neutral	i was extremely pleased with the knife when it arrived .
neutral	it was perfectly engraved .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have normally ordered from this company as i don_'_t find their prices to be particularly competitive but the company i normally use had no stock .
neutral	i placed my order and the money was taken immediately and the status of the order on their website changed to ordered .
neutral	i was not concerened at first as i had allowed plenty of time for the order to arrive as it was for a family birthday_present .
neutral	after about two_weeks i had received nothing and looked on the website for a phone number but there isn_'_t one which worried me .
neutral	i then saw the reviews on this website which obviously worried me !
neutral	i found a telephone_number on this website in an old review .
neutral	there was no answer so i left a message requesting a delivery date .
neutral	the knife arrived the next_day .
neutral	the owner did phone me back as i left a message to say thank_you .
neutral	i explained that it would be helpful to give customers a delivery timescale and a landline and business address .
neutral	he said that this would happen but that was six_months_ago and nothing has .
neutral	i have noticed in the past that the website closes for weeks at a time which seems strange .
neutral	he has , however been in business for many_years and i assume that he would not be allowed to continue trading for so long if there were problems .
neutral	perhaps people who have had a bad_experience are more likely to post reviews .
neutral	i believe that the owners can comment on the reviews given so why has he never done so ?
neutral	i think that he may not hold stock and may need to gather a few orders to place together to ensure a good price from his supplier .
neutral	i think that if you have ordered you will receive your knife eventually .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t order from them again as i would rather pay a little more and order from a reliable source with a telephone_number that is answered and not have the stress of waiting .
neutral	in future i will check this site and look for telephone_numbers .
neutral	my order was for 0 pairs of shoes but they where shipped with 0 different carriers !
neutral	one was a nightmare to get even when i sorted it out to collect myself .
neutral	have sent several emails about the item i bought as_described in good condition but arrived in quite bad condition and have never had any response and ended_up sending item back and still have had no response .
neutral	will not be using again
neutral	we bought a pine table and chairs , free named day delivery due to the item cost , received notification from the courier company that delivery would take place between 00 . 00pm and 0 . 00pm ?
neutral	on our selected day .
neutral	goods did not arrive , called world_stores same day , the story was the courier was running_late , he never arrived .
neutral	the next_day he did finally arrive , started to assemble the flat_pack furniture and 0 chairs in , discovered one of the pine seats was split in two , hard to see until you picked it up as it was along a grain line .
neutral	i contacted world_stores by email 0 days ago and have heard_nothing since .
neutral	all i asked for was one replacement seat panel .
neutral	update , less_than one day after posting this review i have finally received an_email from world_stores , apparently i have to send a photo of the damaged item , obviously they don_'_t believe me , and must presume i have a spare chair frame the same size as the other 0 that will exactly accommodate the replacement chair seat panel .
neutral	their email was carefully worded and made no offer to replace the item ,
neutral	" could we please ask you to take a picture of the problem you described , then reply to this email with the photo attached ?
neutral	one of our team will then look into your case and contact you with a resolution ."
neutral	as it took so long to reply and i needed the seat , i glued the seat back together along the split , i ' m just waiting for the reply to my photos that says as i attempted a repair they aren_'_t prepared to do anything , still i might be pleasantly_surprised .
neutral	!
neutral	update , just received an_email promising me a new seat panel .
neutral	thanks trust_pilot , you really do make a difference
neutral	surprisingly the range is limited and i did experience probelms with my first order red wine replaced with white and vice_versa .
neutral	i also was given the wrong_size washing powder .
neutral	i '_ve decided not to use internet_shopping for groceries now till it gets much_better
neutral	i went to tesco shoreham ( holmbush ) on monday lunchtime , to stock up after a holiday , so intending to do a big shop .
neutral	bought some toys with no problem , and then hit the grocery aisles .
neutral	absolutely horrific , jammed full with tesco . com pickers with their big green trollies .
neutral	i counted 0 of them in one fruit aisle , and i queued to buy red onions while 0 pickers gossiped about football whilst completely blocking the whole side of the aisle with onions .
neutral	the situation was not helped by all the big cages left in the shop to refill all the shelves scavenged by the pickers , and the staff door at the back of the shop had nearly 00 trollies waiting to go through with . com shopping , blocking access to other sections to ' real ' shoppers .
neutral	i questioned it with a manager standing with some other staff at the back of the shop , and his reply was ' very sorry , they all follow the same route , so if you go back to fruit and veg later , it should be clear '.
neutral	i replied that i ' d go to asda in that case , and he just shrugged - apparently . com customers get priority .
neutral	thanks tesco - but no thanks !
neutral	!
neutral	00_minutes later ....
neutral	i have just spoken to mandy at tesco customer_services , who was a shining_example of how to deal with angry customers .
neutral	she was a total delight to talk to , and appeared to understand exactly why i was so cross .
neutral	thanks to her , i have just added another star to my original 0 rating - tesco , please employ more mandy '_s !
neutral	!
neutral	whilst i did not ready the t &_c '_s end to end ( my fault ), i seriously did not expect the delivery drivers to take photographs of the appliance in situ in my house .
neutral	i understand_why it was done from a commercial point of view ( people saying they had not had a delivery when they had etc_etc ) however , it was an utter invasion of privacy as the delivery team did not , at the point of delivery , tell me they were taking pictures .
neutral	it felt very subversive .
neutral	it maybe wouldn_'_t prevent me form purchasing again but i would explicitly refuse for photographs to be taken within my home
neutral	the ease of booking was apparent and the choices of cars and different levels of packages was full on , but in the past when i very first used online booking for car rentals the company was carhire0000 ( think they may now be a part of this company ) i was able to pay a premium package and that was the price i paid total .
neutral	now i booked a week in boston and didn_'_t choose a sat_nav or additional driver insurance so quite straight_forward , even choose the full_tank on return option and eliminate any unforeseen charges , the small_print says maybe some local taxs due at time of hire .
neutral	on return to boston they checked my car in and everything was fine , no damage and a full_tank , but noticed the print out strip had $_00 on it .
neutral	i just want a to pay my costs in uk and avoid these stupid additional (£_00 ) charges as it the makes the original ' cheaper ' quotation top end
neutral	i accept that text in the email suggests calling the fitting_centre which i failed to spot , but when completing the online order i was given the impression that in selecting the am appointment option , there was nothing else to do but turn_up .
neutral	being greeted at the fitting_centre by someone telling_me i ( the customer ) has failed to do something and then to argue with me isn_'_t the sort of customer experience that will get me going back for more .
neutral	why not improve the online system so that , if needed , a time can be booked , beyond the current am / pm choice which is evidently inadequate ?
neutral	this has_been thethird timer prebooking the shoirt stay car_park at edinburgh airport ... and the third time that on exit , i have to call for assistance because the barrier won_'_t let me out !
neutral	so much for the anpr system , thats supposed to automate this !
neutral	!
neutral	yes , , there is a good cost saving here , but tere is also the added hassle .
neutral	the gainsborough swivel is beautifully made an looks terrific .
neutral	but i chose it because the web_site claimed that it is height adjustable up to a 00cm seat height , otherwise i would have continued looking .
neutral	but , unfortunately , the chair height at its maximum elevation is 00 cm , so i cannot use it without a cushion .
neutral	i suspect i will buy another chair and the saxon one will become a very expensive ornament in my study !
neutral	your product & response faultless , but as far as the complete experience goes , i can '_t ignore the fact that by choosing a company that doesn_'_t value it customers as your delivery option you have made it almost_impossible for me to order from you again .
neutral	thanks for your efforts though , let me know when you change your courier to a company that gives a damn !
neutral	the booking through usrentacar was fine but on arrival at orlando the budget reprenetative sought to persuade us to pay for an unwanted upgrade .
neutral	he then stated that the only additional driver allowed under the gold booking arrangement was my spouse .
neutral	i insisted on speaking to the manager who agreed with my view but this was not an experience i was happy with .
neutral	the print came as ordered and was ok but you can see the edge of the frame through the print , this in my opinion is poor as printed canvases from other_suppliers i have do not have this problem .
neutral	great perfume at a very competitive price but the post to me nearly missed the birthday it was a present for .
neutral	for goodness_sake , get it together your end and get the orders out quicker or change courier .
neutral	i am not sure that i will use you again as it was so slow in getting to me .
neutral	i have had orders from the usa get here quicker !
neutral	my product arrived quickly albeit packaged in a box when a small jiffy would have done the trick .
neutral	the box was left in my recycling box at the front of the house which struck me as quite a dicey place to leave it !
neutral	i emailed the company asking them to psss on my complaint to hermes the courier and a week on haven_'_t heard back from them at all which is unsatisfactory to my eye .
neutral	handled things ago as it it was more completed then usual hade to chnge equity company .
neutral	sometimes a little_slow in supply me withmupdates .
neutral	but overall were ok .
neutral	these prices look cheap until the uk revenue hold your goods and demand you pay a minimum of 00_% vat .
neutral	these_people are as bad as starbucks etc
neutral	i ordered a guitar which was marked as in a sale .
neutral	when it arrived the strings were worn , well - use and very highly mounted .
neutral	i have taken the guitar to my luthier who has confirmed the instrument as " well - used " and he will replace and lower the strings for me .
neutral	the point isnthat the item was not sold with a description of ex - demo or used and saying it was a sale item was misleading .
neutral	your web - site states that you give a 0 %_discount at check - out when you enter the code dc0all but no box to enter the code and no 0 %_discount naughty and dissapointing .
neutral	don_'_t make false_promises !!
neutral	!
neutral	finally given an offer discount that worked .
neutral	unfortunately the free gift [ my order was well over their trigger point ] was for glucosamine gel [ which i buy ] was a 0 % gel whereas what i buy is a 0 % gel .
neutral	bit of a " come on " so still think they need to look at their sales strategy from a customers point of view !
neutral	booking was easy but transfer to airport was over an_hour late making us nearly miss our flight home .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	after using amazon for almost a decade , unfortunately , the information system cannot compare , this needs an urgent update .
neutral	also why does it take almost a week for delivery ????
neutral	i do not feel that this acceptable in this day and age .
neutral	seriously , you have the potential to soar , and match other_companies such as amazon ......
neutral	good luck !!
neutral	!
neutral	when i bought the top up i thought i was connected to tesco mobile only to find mobile topup is a third_party provider .
neutral	if i had gone directly to tesco mobile i would not have had to pay the 00p administration charge .
neutral	be careful before paying for a top up , it may be better to go directly to your service provider .
neutral	paid for and printed the label no problem .
neutral	arrived at the parcelforce office , they scanned it and said we hadn_'_t paid for it as the parcelforce reference came up with the weight as 0g .
neutral	i had to argue with them and show them your payment invoice before they would take it in but they were still not convinced .
neutral	i have checked tracking and it appears to be out for delivery today but it was a total inconvenience as we went out of our way to take it to the depot for delivery only to be turned away .
neutral	i trust this will never happen again .
neutral	kind_regards
neutral	lynda hughes

neutral	marlyn0000 @_hotmail . co . uk
neutral	purchased item recieved email to say will be delivered by dpd on certain date with a tracking_number waited in all day checked with local dpd depot to be told not collected by us yet so no delivery today when did not arrive late_afternoon phoned ffx to be told " oh_dear " should be delivered by uk mail tommorrow sorry will phone in the morning with time no phone_call from ffx item arrived mid_morning not the best of experiences
neutral	i made the booking by mistake thats_why i cancelled it , and still_waiting for cancellation confirmation
neutral	i received a mass mail from nine sharp after uploading my cv to one of the main job boards with the option to out of mails from nine sharp - i had never asked to get on their mailing list in the first place .
neutral	nine sharp is just another recruitment agency , no reason for choosing them over other agencies .
neutral	nine sharp go for mass mails over personal contact and their twitter stream is a one way posting of jobs , no interactions .
neutral	the only positive thing to say is , they work only in 0 markets , hr , it , marketing , however very unrelated markets , not a total jack of all trades
neutral	booked flights and hotel with e dreams , initial experience good price and what we needed .
neutral	e dreams soon loaded up the price with fees and phone_call charges , at the end it was no cheaper_than booking direct with the airline .
neutral	the product was first_class , and at a very good price , the only negative is it took 00 days to get here .
neutral	i booked a four - night stay at the cricket field hotel in salisbury , and left after three nights .
neutral	i was told that , because i had booked through late_rooms , i could not obtain a refund .
neutral	i left early because :
neutral	my first night , i was relegated to a dolls - house sized room , in a courtyard at the back of the premises .
neutral	the fixed - head shower was totally_useless for my needs .
neutral	there wasn_'_t space to put anything .
neutral	one wall of the room was door and window , with floor to ceiling curtain , which did nothing for my claustrophobia .
neutral	when i complained next_morning and asked to be moved , it took considerable effort to get a move to another room .
neutral	the first room itself , although still in the outside block , was very much_nicer , but the staircase up to it made it positively lethal when carrying anything heavy or bulky - like a suitcase !
neutral	the shower , although not entirely fixed head , was still useless , a dribble which actually stopped altogether twice ; a shower_cubicle built for a midget ; and nowhere to put anything like shampoo , soap , facecloth etc .
neutral	the rooms are clearly designed to look very impressive , but just do not function adequately ; it '_s all done to look good , but not actually work !
neutral	i have stayed there once before and could not have been happier , i have since consistently thought of it as the best b_& b in the world .
neutral	no more .
neutral	i will never stay there again , and cannot possibly recomment it .
neutral	as a first time customer , i ordered a plastic kennel on 00th_october_0000 .
neutral	six days_later i finally received the item ( what happened to your two day promise ?).
neutral	however , when assembling the kennel , i was disappointed to find that the fixing screws were not in the delivery box .
neutral	therefore i was unable to assemble this item .
neutral	after several emails to petplanet , i have today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) eventually received the screws , so in total , it has taken 0 weeks to complete my order .
neutral	this is not acceptable and i will not be using petplanet again because of this .
neutral	twice now , in the last few_months at stansted , your cameras have not read my numberplate , creating delay on exit .
neutral	i have an alfa 000 and the number_plate is to the nearside of the car .
neutral	the cameras at luton had no problem .
neutral	bought an artic parka for my daughter for christmas , her choice of garment and brand , it was delivered fast and very efficiently but is it good value ?
neutral	no i dont think so yes its a nice parka but your defo paying for the name and image here as there are many other brands selling better made garments for less .
neutral	ordered flowers for my wife for our wedding_anniversary , the ordering_process and contact from serenata was great , only problem was the delivery , using the provided tracking data i saw that the flowers had been loaded_onto the delivery van at gloucester depot 0000hrs in the morning yet it still took until 0000hrs in the evening for them to be actually delvered when they were literally thrown through the front_door with no contact from the delivery driver , now yes i know that looking at the small_print on the website serenata say in exceptional circumstances it can take up to 0000hrs but .
neutral	this wasnt a great distance either i live a couple of miles outside of gloucester and its suprising that it took so long for a fragile and time sensitive item such as flowers to arrive .
neutral	anyway the flowers were excellent so all ended well if belatedly .
neutral	ok , exciting products at £ 0 plus p_&_p .
neutral	great , but ...... my last 0 orders have had one item unsent in each , with an_apology and a promised future refund .
neutral	not good enough , e0p .
neutral	get your stock_levels sorted !
neutral	i would also like to be contacted as i may not want the rest of the order now .
neutral	like many savvy shoppers , i order more items to get the best value from the rather high postage_costs .
neutral	also work on the speed of dispatch e0p , you ' re a bit sluggish .
neutral	however , i do rate the quality of the items .
neutral	out of 0 pairs of shoes , only one has_been not as_described , in that they are a very narrow fit .
neutral	the rest are fabulous !
neutral	but you gotta be quick , as people are buying in bulk to sell on at a profit .
neutral	so how long can it last ?
neutral	i found fitting the therasnore device fairly_straightforward .
neutral	the device fitted by teeth well but i could not sleep with the device as there was not enough room left in my mouth to find a comfortable resting place for my tongue .
neutral	had the device come in a wider size it may have worked for me .
neutral	have always relied on my samsung mobile , old but reliable ... when i renewed my contract i was persuaded to also have this phone .
neutral	it worked well for about 0 months then the problems started .. freezing up and having to switch it off and on again , this eventually became a 0 times a week chore ....
neutral	i contacted them and a new one was sent out ... within a week i got the same problems again .. another one was delivered and again the same thing again ... eventually i gave up and went back to my trusty samsung .
neutral	not ordered from them before now so this experience will seriously make me look_elsewhere before purchasing again .
neutral	i ordered and paid for a roll of address labels on 0st . sept .
neutral	it took 0 days to get an_email to say the order had now been picked and posted .
neutral	i eventually received the item on 00th . sept .
neutral	a total of 00 days ..... in the meantime i had to order another set of the same labels , because i had run out by now and needed them quickly , and received them next_day from an ebay seller .....
neutral	i shall never order from them again .
neutral	i had booked an economy_car as i needed luggage space for at_least 0 people .
neutral	the car was provided by avis / budget at perugia airport .
neutral	no_problems with picking_up the car or returning it .
neutral	i was very pleasantly_suprised when the car turned_out to be a 0 door audi_a0 with 0000km on the clock .
neutral	this car has an electronic parking brake with an on / off switch .
neutral	unfortunately these take a lot of getting used to , especially since there wasn_'_t a word of info in english .
neutral	the secret to releasing it properly turns_out to be gently putting your foot on the brake while switching the electric brake off .
neutral	if you hold your foot on the brake too firmly the electronic brake fails to release leading to a warning display and eventual brake overheating .
neutral	i wish i had found this out earlier in the hire .
neutral	it would have saved me 0 days of stress !
neutral	my nokia n00 0gb was 000g in weight and therefore i had to pay the po £ 0 . 00 to deliver it and also insure for loss up to £_000 .
neutral	the lower payment only insures up to £_00 , which i couldn_'_t risk as the phone goes through the system in massively advertised mazuma bag .
neutral	and i don_'_t trust the po .
neutral	so , to prospective users , take off about £ 0 for you having to insure &_p_&_p .
neutral	unfortunately this being a bank_holiday i expect my cheque on tuesday , but expect a turnaround of a week .
neutral	i ordered my products easily and without_any trouble but when it came to delivery , i received numerous texts informing_me of who was delivering the parcel and what time , i tried to book my delivery for a tuesday , when somebody would be in but it wouldnt let me , so the parcel arrived on the wed when no one was in , i dont know if they posted it through the postbox or left it in the garage , but for a week after , i still had text sent to say my parcel would arrive on specific dates , i emailed pet_supermarket to let them know i had received the parcel , but the texts kept coming and eventually after a week they stopped
neutral	i was asked to provide a signature on a portable machine to authorise the work before it was carried_out .
neutral	that signature was subsequently printed out on a contract that i had never seen and the conditions of that contract were significant in terms of liability for autoglass in the event of problems during installation .
neutral	as i had not seen the contract before signing , i doubt that the contract would be enforceable but this seemed unfair in any case .
neutral	i ordered the peace white lilies flowers and a small birthday cake for my aunts birthday .
neutral	she thought the flowers and cake were beautiful .
neutral	they were left in the doorstep since she was out .
neutral	the box base was soggy due to it raining .
neutral	as usual excellent servoice and delivery , well_packed .
neutral	although i knew these were not a ' warm ' white , these led sbc candle lamps really give a very cold - almost blue - light .
neutral	set of 0 in our hall lamp on the deep crimson chest no_longer looks welcoming , but these were all that were available in the rating and cap we needed .
neutral	might try to change eventually , but being leds with a long life seems a shame to scrap them , and they do not fit any other of our lamps .
neutral	ordered usb_cable 00th_december and promised delivery within 0 working_days .
neutral	arrived 00th_january - better late than never .
neutral	a bit disappointing but could be royal_mail at fault !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	order processed_efficiently .
neutral	specs are not so comfortable as my last pair ( from specsavers ) but these were a lot_cheaper so i guess you pay your money , you take your choice .
neutral	hi
neutral	we did have a great holiday and the price was good but we also had a few issues along the way .
neutral	the online booking system wouldn_'_t work and so we had to book via telephone .
neutral	this was okay but the price went up from that quoted online .
neutral	this was due to an error in the online booking system .
neutral	when we arrived in spain the car_hire agent was supposed to meet us in arrivals but no one turned_up .
neutral	our mobile_phone didn_'_t work so we couldn_'_t contact anyone .
neutral	we eventually managed to make our own way to the car_hire place but it was very frustrating and not a great start to the holiday .
neutral	at the hotel - we had booked a two bedroomed apartment on all_inclusive but were given a one bedroomed apartment on half board .
neutral	the ai was fixed straight_away but the hotel was full so we had to wait a day to get the correct room .
neutral	have bought and sold hundreds of items on ebay .
neutral	in general it '_s a lot safer to use , than people think , but you do need to be careful to need their reviews , before buying from anyone .
neutral	ebay and paypal tend to sort_out any disputes reasonably , eventually , but their customer support is difficult to navigate , and can be very frustrating .
neutral	i wanted to send a small bunch of flowers to a friend so i went for the £ 0 . 00 bunch what w wast of money the flowers were half dead if i had gone to the local supermarket i would get the same bunch for £ 0 and at_least they would have been alive .
neutral	i have had other bunches sent to family and and friends and they where fine , it '_s a good job my friend is a good friend i was mortified when i saw them
neutral	the tracking_details on the website indicated the parcel did over 000_miles around the country to do a 00 miles journey from it '_s source to our local distribution_centre .
neutral	it then went out for delivery , so we watched out all day for the van .
neutral	no - one came .
neutral	it finally turned_up the next_day and on the tracking for the previous day it said " delivery attempted , unable to gain_access " which was a lie as we were here all day and no card had been delivered .
neutral	the driver was polite when he did finally get here but he was smoking in the van and the parcel now smells strongly of cigarette smoke which stands_out in our house as we are not smokers and the package is a gift too .
neutral	i found that the delivery service was careless and actually damaged goods .
neutral	getting exchanges in store was difficult .
neutral	the staff did not seem to care .
neutral	we were in murcia and used resort_hoppa to get to our hotel . it worked_fine and we didn_'_t wait long . would i use them again ?
neutral	yes , i would . it was cheap and easy but i think we maybe just fell lucky .
neutral	the salesman visited us on 00th_march and he said if we agreed to the kitchen before he left it would be fitted within 0 weeks .
neutral	so we agreed and kitchen was due to be fitted the first week of april .
neutral	or so we thought , as we had a phone_call at the end of march saying it would not be ready until the middle of april .
neutral	a few_days_later they called us again saying that it would now be the end of april as the cupboards were still being made .
neutral	the kitchen units are now being delivered tomorrow and we were told we would recieve a call the day before to confirm a time .
neutral	we did recieve a call but not to confirm a time , as that is dealt_with by another department but infact to advice us the cooker splashback will not be available until the end of may .
neutral	the fitters will be here on 0th_may .
neutral	i feel like i have been conned !
neutral	the reason is if the service is this bad now what will it be like after the kitchen is fitted ?
neutral	business class heathrow to bangkok .
neutral	flight delayed for maintenance by over an_hour .
neutral	ba refused to check bags through bangkok to save us missing our connecting flight even_though they could according to their computer .
neutral	in sharp contrast to eva air who are happy to do this when we fly with them .
neutral	check in at terminal 0 utter chaos .
neutral	sent from_pillar to post , the same check in dealing_with lots of different flights .
neutral	the cabin layout is odd when compared to other_airlines so staying together is essential .
neutral	ba charge £_00 per person per leg , £_000 return for a family of 0 to ensure you sit_together .
neutral	on the bkk - lhr return we were separated .
neutral	to be fair the ground staff at bkk pulled some strings and we were issued new seats just as we got to the gate .
neutral	the planes are absolutely falling_apart .
neutral	trim panels are dented and falling_off , flaps open everywhere .
neutral	only 0 working toilets on the 00 hour flight back - not nice !!
neutral	the plane looked like it belonged in a scrap yard .
neutral	i can only hope the mechanical bits are in better shape .
neutral	the most miserable flight attendant i have ever seen sitting at the top of the stairs into the upper deck of business class .
neutral	she looked like she ' d been out on the lash and it was 0am sitting on a pavement outside a night club .
neutral	no interest at all in helping a well spoken young lad with a question about his entertainment system .
neutral	to be fair the rest of the crew were fine , the captain positively chirpy .
neutral	i would have sacked her on the spot .
neutral	compared to the asian airlines ba are in a different league ( bad not good ).
neutral	the flat bed is better_than eva '_s angled seat and this flight was unusually the same price , hence our booking it but i wouldn_'_t pay the usual premium required .
neutral	i pray it doesn_'_t happen but i ' m just waiting for disaster to strike with those falling_apart planes .
neutral	i read all the reviews of the then advertised fence spray system .
neutral	i was impressed by what was said , so bought one .
neutral	however i received a ronseal fence spray system
neutral	when i queried that i had a ronseal system i was told that ronseal fence spray system was the one in stock .
neutral	i have no problem with the ronseal make , in fact the system works well , but i feel that wood_finishes direct should inform customers that makes may vary
neutral	there is another thing , if i gad gone to my local_store , i could have bought the same ronseal system for a couple of pounds cheaper
neutral	would i use wood_finishes direct again ?
neutral	no
neutral	the online service made a arduous task simple and effective .
neutral	however i would recommend other positive customer options
neutral	after going through all the steps of payment , clearance and even after giving an order no . and delivery details i was told the payment didn_'_t go through , which was a pain i had to do everything all over again . mrs . t .
neutral	i ordered a gas_hob online from marks on a tuesday_evening ( 00 / 00 / 00 ).
neutral	advised delivery would be on thursday 00 / 00 / 00 , and that delivery slot would be advised on wednesday_evening : which it was .
neutral	delivery man telephoned 00_minutes prior to arrival .
neutral	so far , so good .
neutral	the hob was installed on friday but the installer found that the electronic ignition was not working .
neutral	contacted marks who advised us to contact the manufacturer ( neff ).
neutral	a neff engineer will be calling on monday 00 / 00 / 00 (!!)
neutral	to examine the hob and , hopefully , effect a repair / replacement .
neutral	i would have been happier if marks had offered a replacement unit , rather_than having to wait for ten days for the manufacturer .
neutral	i find it extremely frustrating when you order clothing you really like in the size you wear only to be disappointed in the sizing .
neutral	there should be a standard sizing code across the world so that you know it will fit especially from the assian countries ie china where their clothes come up small by at_least 0 / 0 sizes .
neutral	recently ordered loads only to return 00 / 00_% of order as does not fit .
neutral	thats_why i dont shop in places like primark now you have started doing the same but at a higher price .
neutral	bought two akasa 0 . 0 " enclosures , took 0 days to arrive , plus one was doa .. slow responses , every_stage seams to take a day longer_than it should , plus they want a week to check it our once received - still_waiting .
neutral	folks are pleasant enough when you get to speak to them though
neutral	was so handy in regards to train and buses pass but didn_'_t cover the open roof top buses or tickets to london eye for example . my wife bought tickets for the whole family but at the end we missed out on half at_least .
neutral	i have used viagogo a load of times now for both music and sports events and have always got what i paid for in the end .
neutral	but ...... i have never had the tickets prior to the event and always had to pick them up from either a rep outside the venue or at a box office .
neutral	picking_up at a box office on the day can be a hassle but i have always been emailed letters of authorization from the original purchaser to take with me .
neutral	this works just as long as the venue has prior agreed with the original buyer that this can happen .
neutral	on such a letter the original buyer has to state the transaction number plus the last 0 digits of the card used to buy them in this letter , together with their full name and address together with the full name and address of the person picking them up .
neutral	you will need to have photo id to go with this letter , but - some venues do not allow this and before purchasing i always check this out by phoning the venue .
neutral	if the venue does not allow a third_party pick_up then the only way is for the original buyer to attend the box office and get the tickets and then give them to you .
neutral	if the venue insists on matching names on the tickets with photo id at the point of entry then you will not get in .
neutral	however - you can check this out with the venue before buying them in the first place .
neutral	as said , with careful checking before buying you will avoid hassle and has to be said that there are not many venues and events that print names on tickets and then match them with photo id at the point of entry - just takes too long and is way to much hassle for them to do this .
neutral	so , it works but it can be nerve wracking going to a venue without tickets and picking them up from a rep in a normally very crowed area - cell phones are very difficult to both use and hear in such conditions as is finding the rep - i have done the box office bit and the meeting a rep bit all too often - but as said , have always got there in the end .
neutral	and finally , a word of advice on checking if venues allow third_party box office pick_up - i always say that i have got tix but cannot go now , got a funeral to go to , and i want to give away free my tix to friends and ' can i do this ' and if so , what letters do i need to so facilitate .
neutral	i then ask the venue to email me confirmation .
neutral	if they do , then i buy on viagogo - if not , then i don_'_t .
neutral	hope i have helped as there seems to be a load of peeps hacked off with viagogo - you just need to be careful and do some checking first .
neutral	the other firm doing this ' get me in ', are by far_superior as i have always but always had the tickets sent to me via ups before the event .
neutral	i think they insist that sellers actually have the tix in their hands before allowing them to be listed - maybe wrong , but never had a pick_up to do when using them .
neutral	by the way , i do not work for get me in !
neutral	am happy for peeps to contact me for any more details .
neutral	website said my items were in stock so i ordered , received an_email_stating the goods were not available for three_weeks .
neutral	not good .
neutral	just been having a bit of issue with paypal '_s transaction view today , so i thought i should review .
neutral	it '_s a very slow service at times , maybe because of the security but it should be faster_than it is especially as they have so much money to spend on technical staff !
neutral	always liked paypal however as it makes paying for items online very easy .
neutral	good work !
neutral	i have brought all_sorts of things from wowcher from meals to weekend breaks which i wouldn_'_t have brought before i became a member .
neutral	really think it '_s one of the best things i joined and my hair thinks so to , because it get cut and blow dried regular with wowcher vouchers .
neutral	had a few bad purchases just lately and had trouble getting it sorted .
neutral	it all worked out well in the end .
neutral	shiply '_s website could do with a major redesign .
neutral	also the fee structure could be made much more transparent .
neutral	( see the negative_feedback from other users ).
neutral	however , that does not detract from the fact that i received seven quotes within 00_hours of posting my job .
neutral	and the contractor i choose performed well .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	only small complaint only one delivery driver , lift was not working so i had to help him carry up one flight of stairs im a single lady so it was not easy . i had slight_damage on unit but sorted_out quickly .
neutral	bought a bush twin cavity cooker model ae00tcs less_than three years_ago .
neutral	we took out insurance which we have used for repairing the cooker .
neutral	so far the oven element has_gone three_times .
neutral	this last time we had the engineer come on the 00th_november , to date still_waiting for the cooker element - so no oven working .
neutral	i bought an oven element from amazon , it came friday and i fitted it .
neutral	the element fitted last time by the argos engineer had only two electrical connectors on the element - so there engineer taped the earth cable to a live cable - to me a fire risk ?.
neutral	the cooker element should have three terminal fittings - not two argos .
neutral	we have phoned the insurance company for the electrical company '_s phone number and they gave out the wrong number - a delaying tactic .?.
neutral	i replied to a lady_who wanted to know where to buy a cooker element on the argos site , this being on friday last , i replied by saying she could get one off amazon and left a negative_feedback on the cooker , however had to wait for argos approval on my feed_back .
neutral	had an_email_saying they would not put negative feed_back on there site .. well bush used to be a good english brand some years_ago - not now it '_s owned by argos and made in china ?....
neutral	at each stop the driver called out the hotel name in an inaudable voice .
neutral	as i new exactly where i had to get off i was unconcerned but one passenger took the driver to task over this matter , firmly perhaps but not rudely .
neutral	the driver got off the bus and refused to get back on !
neutral	as it was by now 0 . 00am this was no joke .
neutral	the driver was eventually persuaded to continue after a twenty minute delay .
neutral	the return_journey went very smoothly although once again the driver was on a short fuse .
neutral	the fare is very reasonable , in fact cheaper_than the public bus service .
neutral	no_problems with menkind at all who sent the bluetooth helicopter promptly .
neutral	however , this helicopter is not built as well as some and is all plastic with no metal subframe like some of the better ones i have flown .
neutral	controlling the machines with the ipad or iphone is about 0 times harder using than a normal control module , so be prepared for a few crashes and plenty of practise .
neutral	this helicopter is expensive for what it is - maybe the fact that it has a blue - tooth module accounts for this , but even so , i might have expected a better flying model for the money .
neutral	just signed_up to vodafone - new samsung g s0 , unlimited_texts , minutes and 0gb data through carphone_warehouse - all for £_00 per_month .
neutral	i left my then provider tescomobile thinking i got a great deal - however when i got my first bill ... the £_00 turned into £_00 . 00 as they failed to tell me ( when buying and in the supposed small_print ) that they add vat after the £_00 ; i . e .
neutral	it '_s £_00 excluding vat !
neutral	now i ' m saddled with this for 0 years !
neutral	so not such a good deal after all - how ' sneaky '!
neutral	so beware the sneaks at carphone_warehouse / vodafone !
neutral	this is in two parts - yesterday '_s and today '_s experience - read on :
neutral	just ordered some trainers and spoke to an advisor ( think he said his name was brad ) who to me appeared a little impatient - i have an online account but had not yet added the address so he just said " there '_s no account " - i was actually logged in and looking at it and when i told him this he repeated " there '_s no account under that post_code "... anyway , i asked him if i could place an order over the phone - he did this , but all the while it felt like i was an inconvenience .
neutral	i felt i did not have time provided for me to ask any questions or go off process , if you get my drift ...
neutral	i asked if the trainers could be delivered next_day and he asked for my 00 digit number from the card - again , felt like i was interrupting his flow - but i went with it and gave him the details .
neutral	then i asked if he had put them on next_day delivery .
neutral	he said " that '_s already been expedited " as if i was asking an unnecessary question ... feeling rushed , i let him leave the call and thanked him for placing the order .
neutral	i then rang back as he had not mentioned any price for the expedited delivery - verity answered and i gave my order number and she confirmed it was on fast order and that it was £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	again , it felt a little less_than warm ... great website and great products and ( though they have no_idea ) i have been a customer of this business for over ten_years .
neutral	not impressed with the respect for their customers and given there are 00 , 000 reviews ( which will be only a percentage of customers ) on line they must be raking in cash .
neutral	might i suggest the owner invests some of this back into customer service - how to speak to customers , patience , care and flexibility ( go where the customer wants - don_'_t marshall them to where you want to go ), the importance of customer_satisfaction in building sustainable sales and therefore long_term jobs for them !
neutral	if i were asked the ' net promoter question ' " would you recommend to a friend ?"
neutral	i would score a 0 - which for those who are not familiar is not a promotion of the company !!!
neutral	if i had been serviced in a more friendly , warm and flexible manner - given the history i have of buying great products and being serviced well in the past when they had a store - i would have scored a 00 !
neutral	i hope you all and the company see this as a good company with good potential , but let '_s make it feel better shall we ?
neutral	day 0 :
neutral	having arranged for next_day delivery and with 0 people in the house , the delivery company dpd failed to knock - oh , and my dogs would have heard as well , so my trainers were not delivered ...
neutral	however , in contrast to yesterday '_s experience , i called sportsshoes . com to see if they could help - tom answered ; a pleasant chap_who was only too keen to help - he rand dpd and kept me informed of their attempts to contact the driver to see if he could return if still in the area and what i needed to do according to dpd to get to the leeds depot between 0 and 0pm .
neutral	tom was what customer_services should be across the board with the rest of the team - so ... invest in training and use tom as an example of existing good practice !
neutral	reward him !
neutral	i wanted a bath panel that was completely flat around the perimeter of the panel to fit my particular installation .
neutral	the website photo indicates this but on receipt the panel has a right angle return on the ends and bottom .
neutral	as a result i have had to purchase another one from ( name_removed ) which fits my requirements .
neutral	in hindsight i should have phoned up to check - a bit disappointed and somewhat annoyed .
neutral	i ordered two of these for a trip to the us
neutral	they arrived quickly enough ( within 0 working_days ) and i managed to register them online ; but but when i came to retrieve the pin ( by calling a number advertised on the web_page ) , having entered all my details , the system didn_'_t return my pin .
neutral	i called the lost and stolen line ( they don '; t publish a number to get to customer_services - they suggest you email them ; not acceptable to me ) and the lady i spoke to said the pin system was down .
neutral	if the system is down - why did you let me call the number , spend my money on the call only to not get the service i was paying for ?
neutral	why not put an_automated message on the phone line that tells people it '_s down , and a message on the web_page as well ?
neutral	anyway - my pin is in the post apparently .
neutral	i '_ll wait to see how quickly it arrives and whether i really can change it at any atm .
neutral	lets_hope it all goes as smoothly when i finally get the pin and use my card .
neutral	the iphone_app works very well .
neutral	once registered - my cards appeared in the app and i was able to transfer money from one to the other seamlessly ; very simple .
neutral	suggestions for fairfx :
neutral	0 .
neutral	publish a number for customer support and then let your customers decide what channel to use to contact you .
neutral	sometimes email is appropriate , other times it '_s not .
neutral	let your customers decide .
neutral	0 .
neutral	use an online ' pin reveal ' system like mbna .
neutral	then you don_'_t have to worry_about sending pins out in the post .
neutral	ebay is fine when the sun shines , but when it rains they will take your umbrella off you .
neutral	the fees are way to high for a company that uses just a computer , no warehouse , no , or little advertising , compared to its turn over not many staff .
neutral	i read recently that ebay dealt_with more than £_000 , 000 , 000 in a twenty_four hour period .
neutral	thats £_00 , 000 , 000 in fees , in one day .
neutral	just to clarify the point i include ebay and paypal as one , the same company but different , yea !
neutral	try and complain and you will find little or no customer service just a parrot that repeats prepared text .
neutral	time for some one else to take their crown and treat the people that make ebay what it is with some dignity and courtecy .
neutral	the biggest ' beef ' i have with an otherwise excellent mail order firm that tries to adhere to traditional values is that their warranties especially the mobile_phone warranty have never been honoured by littlewoods .
neutral	i speak from bitter personal experience !
neutral	ordering experience was simple as would be expected .
neutral	automated email said item dispatched and gave postage tracking_information - this said royal_mail had been told that the item was going to be sent , but they hadn_'_t received it .
neutral	when this was queried via website , no reply given .
neutral	i would expect much more accurate information , even personal sellers on ebay can provide better quality information and respond to queries or complaint in a much more timely_manner - not sure i would order from car audio centre again after this experience .
neutral	ebay are ok !
neutral	their on - line site is vast which lets your experience down a little bit .
neutral	i ' m not the best tech head so i find their site quite difficult .
neutral	however unless you have a problem with anything their process seems to be efficient enough !
neutral	i have been using interparcel for years but have stopped recently because it is just not that user_friendly .
neutral	sometimes options for drop - off appear and other times they do not .
neutral	i am looking for a simple cost_effective drop - off service and interparcel is just not consistent enough .
neutral	also maps do not always appear .
neutral	i now use [_external link_removed_] which is consistent , simple and easy to use .
neutral	perhaps i '_ll use interparcel on occasions for more complex items
neutral	plumbingforless lived_up to their name and offered the best price i could find .
neutral	ordering from them on - line was simple .
neutral	they later told me by text when it ( a pump ) was going to be delivered but offered me other dates if the offered one wasn_'_t acceptable .
neutral	all seemingly very efficient .
neutral	as it happened , the date they offered , i wasn_'_t going to be home .
neutral	so , using the text reply system they had put in place , i texted ' 0 ' back to them .
neutral	that meant i would be available to receive the pump the day after the offered date .
neutral	i had a reply to this saying that my changed date had been accepted .
neutral	but on the morning of the original date , i received a another text saying it would be delivered between noon and 0pm ( i think ).
neutral	i ignored this thinking it to be a remnant of the original offer of delivery date .
neutral	however , on returning home , i found the pump on my doorstep .
neutral	anyone could have taken it in the 0 hours between the time quoted and my returning home .
neutral	this is poor !
neutral	i shall be wary of using this company again .
neutral	i have had no_problems at all with amazon over the past five years , but today i read that they are withdrawing thousands of books from sale because the publishers and authors will not give amazon a big enough discount .
neutral	this sounds_like a big bully approach to business and should not be tolerated .
neutral	it is the first sign of a stain on a company '_s shield that has previously been spotless .
neutral	cheapest car_hire and beside airport .
neutral	hassle_free , but prices could be a bit higher i think .
neutral	i ordered a football shirt , which arrived promptly .
neutral	it was a good quality fake and was supposed to be 00 - 00 " which was medium ( only sizes were medium and extra large ).
neutral	it was too small - about 00 ".
neutral	i was unable to contact the company as their e_- mail was always off - line so sent it back (£ 0 . 00 for postage ) and to their credit , they refunded my money within a week .
neutral	their website states they do not give refunds if customers order the wrong_size , so my covering_letter explained that they did not send me the shirt size advertised , which worked for me .
neutral	if you want a good fake in one of these 0 sizes , then fitbakits may be for you .
neutral	if you want an authentic shirt , or are a different size , then look_elsewhere .
neutral	since royal mails extortionate price increase have used collectplus and out of the 00 parcels none lost but the damage rate is high but only in the last 0 weeks - so what has changed or was i just lucky initially .
neutral	parcels are bubble_wrapped , air pockets and boxed and it doesn_'_t seem to matter , they are intact but the contents in bits .
neutral	collectplus you had an opportunity to substantially increase your market share because of royal mails greed but you ' re throwing it away with heavy handed careless processing .
neutral	ordered ski tops for my wife and myself .
neutral	asked question online at time of ordering if vat removed for export sales to channel_islands but recived no response
neutral	i ordered an 00 0gs unlock on the 00st sept ( friday ) on the strength of their " 0hour " unlock service .
neutral	i didn ; t expect anything to happen until monday ( 00th_sept ) because as they state , imei '_s are not submitted at weekends .
neutral	well , monday came and went , as did the rest of the week and nothing .
neutral	i posted in their facebook_page and said that i wasn_'_t overly happy with the delay , in a professional way ... no insulting or bad language and my comment was promptly deleted and my posting rights were taken away .... so there gives an insight_into how these_guys deal with an unhappy customer .
neutral	meanwhile back at the ' check status ' page .. my imei had been submittted on the 00t sept at 0 :_00am and was now showing a timeframe of 0 - 0 days ... hardly the " 0hour " service i paid for and was led to believe was do - able .
neutral	anyway to cut a long wait short .
neutral	today i received the email that my iphone had been unlocked .
neutral	( 0th_october ) 00 days ( or 000 hours ) after my initial order .
neutral	so i ' m happy to have an unlocked iphone , and i would recommend this company to anyone who_wants to use their services , just don_'_t believe the times they say they '_ll deliver , and expect to wait considerably longer .
neutral	left_wondering_if present would arrive , eventually it did and i am_delighted with the quality of the materials .
neutral	pity about the communication issues
neutral	mixed feelings really .
neutral	i have used hermes a number of times for my e_bay sales and they have always delivered on time , parcels undamaged , 0_stars here , lovely couriers pick_up the parcels too .
neutral	but , there is a but , i have also used them though a charity e_bay site and here they have not done so well .
neutral	we pack stuff really well , yet items still get broken , note how virtually anything mildly valuable or breakable is not covered , and last_week a signed for item , which costs extra proved to be a complete_waste as it was just left on a doorstep in the rain !
neutral	so it depends on who delivers your parcel i think , come on hermes , you are cheap enough , but you need to up your service in some areas .
neutral	after wearing glsses for over 00 years , took the plunge to have the lasik procedure on 0th_june_0000 .
neutral	at the consultation everything was explained satisfactory and had very good experiance on the day of the procedure .
neutral	however after that had problems booking the follow_up appointments that was convenaint to me .
neutral	i work full time and it was very difficult to book appointment where i could book without taking too much time off work .
neutral	there was no flexibility with this at the clinic or one near too me and i found this frustrating .
neutral	then last_night three_weeks ofter the procedure i woke_up early in the morning with very painful , red and gritty left eye .
neutral	even after using the blink eye_drops it did not improved so called the emergency contact number , an answer phone kicked in so left a brief message with 0 contact numbers .
neutral	now 00_hours after message left , i still have not got a call back !
neutral	what if this had been an urgent emergency ?
neutral	at 00am tried_calling the clinic where i had the procedure to see if i can get advice over the phone but as the clinics was very busy the call_centre in glasgow answered the call .
neutral	firstly the line was very bad i could hardly hear the customer service lady so called back from another phone line .
neutral	still bad phone line but managed to explain my problem and got an_appointment booked to go into clinic not where i had my procedure .
neutral	i requested if an_email can be sent to confirm this and my email was confirmed .
neutral	guess_what ?
neutral	i still have not received an_email to confirm the appoinment or where it is i have to attend , 0 hours after i was promised that the booking will be confirmed in a email .
neutral	the lack of aftercare is very worrying and i hope this side can be improved on so this does not happen to others who may have an serious emergency .
neutral	excellent sales and delivery .
neutral	however after telling them the boot_liner doesn_'_t fit my 00 plate astra they have gone silent apart_from 0 pointless emails asking for photos and telling_me their supplier says it is the correct liner .
neutral	i don_'_t care what their supplier say '_s i want the correct liner or my money back .
neutral	i sent them a picture from another website with the correct shaped liner , they replied_saying that '_s what i should have received .
neutral	well i didn_'_t , so send me it .
neutral	after 0 weeks the correct fitting liner arrived yesterday .
neutral	if the customer service had been better , a lot better .
neutral	and the replacement process quicker i would have given towequipe full_marks , they did after all get off to an excellent start .
neutral	i will probably use them again if they have what i need at the time , and hope this experience isn_'_t the norm .
neutral	a decent store if a tad pricey
neutral	all i can say is thank_goodness for live_chat windows which i hope has resolved my collection of a parcel , i believe it '_s not the fault of this website , but of one of the companies they deal with ( which i have experienced in the past ) i had hoped to give them a second chance .!!
neutral	i would still use parcel0go again .
neutral	although i did use flybe once this year , it was only because i was taking a party of relatives and friends ( including children ) to spain and only flybe can offer that service from guernsey .
neutral	ie no liability on ourselves if we did not make the connection with the other flight ( uk to spain ), due to no fault of our own .
neutral	i usually avoid flybe like the plague because they have so many additional_charges these days .
neutral	when booking with flybe you start at a really low figure and are taken down a very long path , charging you for everything that should realistically have been taken into allowance before they started wasting your time .
neutral	i really do not know how they can still brand themselves as a low_cost airline .
neutral	the delivery was fast and the matress is very comfortable but the packaging was soaking_wet on arrival which transferred into the matress and the free pillows are absolutely_useless as they have no substance .
neutral	there is also some structural damage to the matress where it has probably been handled badly .
neutral	the memory_foam layer on top of the matress is not attached at the bottom end .
neutral	my order was processed and delivered very efficiently .
neutral	i received exactly_what i had ordered , but my only concern was the price i had paid for conduit connection elbows .
neutral	these were about £ 0 each but in walmart usa they are $ 0 for a pack of 0 .
neutral	pleased i didn_'_t order and more .
neutral	my last two orders were a disaster , in one case they advised nil stock and much later advised that they could no_longer obtain the product - i subsequently bought it cheaper elsewhere .
neutral	in the other , the consignment was badly packed and arrived damaged and i could not obtain satisfactory assurances that the mistakes would not be repeated .
neutral	the customer service team seemed too ready to bounce the problem back into my hands rather_than dealing_with it .
neutral	on the surface they have a good range , reasonable_prices and good initial communications but when things go_wrong their service falls down badly , i doubt that i shall deal with them again .
neutral	bizarrely npower managed to fit the wrong type of meter , an economy 0 one , they then proceeded to bill me the wrong way round .
neutral	i pointed this out and have been left with a massive debt and huge direct_debit each month , but they did replace the meter !
neutral	the customer service has_been good so far , but the jury is still out !
neutral	i have enjoyed excellent unlimited broadband from vodafone at home in 0 homes .
neutral	recently they sold their broadband services to plus net a very different experience for me .
neutral	i had no knowledge of any limit or of how to monitor my usage , first i knew was a direct_debit payment double what i was expecting .
neutral	so i rang to ask what had happened and was told for the first time about the internet limits .
neutral	to make_matters worse i was told where to check my usage , only to discover that i was already over double my allowed limit and going to be charged 0 times my normal price .
neutral	this is extortion !
neutral	i discovered that , to make_matters worse , the two locations were switched leaving the usage being put against the wrong account .
neutral	this has_been a farce from beginning to end .
neutral	the final nail in the coffin was being offered unlimited broadband through plus net for a tiny increase on the payment i was making as a vodafone customer , just because i said i was leaving !
neutral	too little too late , i ' m leaving plus net !
neutral	the whole proposition based on good yorkshire broadband with yorkshire values is a joke .
neutral	i have subsequently spoken to 0 different technical people have finally resolved the issue with the two accounts being merged !
neutral	however , we shall have to wait and see if the problem remains .
neutral	plusnet have an interesting approach to customer retention , despite having 00 hour call_centres handling technical and billing issues they can only cancel an account between 0 : 00 and 0 : 00 during weekdays and definitely not on bank_holidays , so if you work for a living and your boss won_'_t let you use the phone during office hours , you are stuck with the providers from hell !
neutral	( sorry my mistake yorkshire not hell !)
neutral	i was on the point of staying with them because their technical guys are really quite good and patient if you get good ones , however ...
neutral	kwik_fit were booked for between 0000 and 0000_hrs but did not arrive until 0000_hrs !
neutral	the tyre_fitting went well .
neutral	my partner bought a pair of varifocals from specsavers and was so pleased with them , i decided to buy mine from the same branch in dereham .
neutral	i was treated courteously by the staff and the optometrist , i ordered my glasses and they arrived within 00 days as suggested .
neutral	unfortunately , i found them to be very difficult to get used to , as i seemed to have to have them perched on the end of my nose to see distance .
neutral	it turned_out to be a measuring error , which meant replacement lenses .
neutral	it took just three days for them to be ready .
neutral	imagine my surprise when i found the measurements had not only been taken wrong again , but for some reason the lens type had been changed - so now i found myself peering through the bottom edges of the glasses to try and read , also the focussing area was impossibly narrow .
neutral	a third set of lenses were ordered , this time the tailor - made ones .
neutral	another two_weeks went by and eventually i got my glasses .
neutral	much_better field of view , but felt like i was wearing 0d glasses all the time , getting double vision !
neutral	a second sight test was offered , which was carried_out by another very pleasant optometrist , who suggested the distance prescription could be weakened slightly as he thought it was due to varifocal intolerance .
neutral	i agreed , and also paid for anti - glare coating .
neutral	the fourth incarnation were worse !
neutral	i had difficulty in finding an area that was in focus , making me look like a chicken when trying to read , and the double vision / 0d glasses effect was giving me headaches .
neutral	i decided that enough was enough , and took the glasses back for a full_refund .
neutral	i bet they were glad to see the back of me !
neutral	something wrong with the manufacturing processes , or just my inability to get used to varifocals ?
neutral	i don_'_t know , but i do wish to point out the staff did try to help me as best they could .
neutral	three stars is for my overall experience - i dropped two stars on this review for the product itself .
neutral	i have been with virgin for quite a few_years and am pleased with the service that they have given me .
neutral	however on reccomending a friend and neihbor to them , and he taking up a contract with them , as i reccomended him virgin say that they will credit my acount with £_00 , over 0 months have passed since my friend paid his first payment , and i still havent had the £_00 credit , i have emailed them and the continue to ignore my emails ???
neutral	my advice to anyone_thinking of reccomending someone to them for £_00 of false_promises is dont .
neutral	took 00_mins to order a bouquet over the phone - probably on a premium_rate line .
neutral	flowers were a little disappointing as the lilies were not in bloom so they looked less substantial than a supermarket bouquet for less_than half the price .
neutral	probably won_'_t order again .
neutral	stayed home all day but goods did not arrive .
neutral	another day was arranged but courier tried to deliver when we had to go out for a while .
neutral	had to waste an_hour collecting goods from courier '_s warehouse .
neutral	probably the fault of the supplier rather_than discountedheating , but better communication between all parties may have helped .
neutral	i picked a £_00 + bouquet to be delivered before 00 noon
neutral	the flowers arrived at 0pm
neutral	and the amount of flowers were small for the amount i paid and the time of year .
neutral	generally a good service but transfers out of the airport can take a hour or more to load up a full coach , returns generally on time
neutral	i ordered a belfast sink from taps uk because it was apparently in stock and i needed it quickly .
neutral	after 00 days i still hadn_'_t arrived nor any communication as to its whereabouts .
neutral	i eventually learned that the couriers had been holding the sink for a week or more but i felt that i should have been updated on my order progress as this is what other internet companies do .
neutral	i asked for a refund on my delivery charge (£_00 !)
neutral	and this was declined which i consider unfortunate .
neutral	i would not be confident recommending this company to others because of their delivery arrangements .
neutral	handtec took a payment , then sent me an_email to say " we don_'_t have your item in stock , and we don_'_t know when we '_ll have any ".
neutral	useless !
neutral	i then had to get past their " help " section to ask for a refund .
neutral	total_waste of my time .
neutral	i will not use them again , even if they are cheaper_than competitors .
neutral	avoid .
neutral	next_day i received an_email_saying " item in stock - shall we send it ?"
neutral	fair_enough - it arrived next_day .
neutral	could '_ve been fabulous ........................
neutral	i have found pet_supermarket to be a reliable company and very fairly_priced goods ., the last order i bought from them arrived with a broken top and also very slow to be delivered but they were very good about it and replaced it immediately with no extra_charge but again with very slow delivery , i think the post_office is to blame for that .
neutral	i was full of hope booking into a large 0 * star hotel in a town in majorca that i had not visited before .
neutral	i '_ve been to majorca many , many_times before and stayed in many types of hotels and would classify myself as a very experienced traveller .
neutral	the room i was shown to had an outside space ( i will not use the word balcony ) which was 0ft x 0ft with a 0ft high wall which meant only a sky view .
neutral	on peering over the top of the wall i saw it was street / shop side .
neutral	i would not have objected to that but i did object to a wall view .
neutral	upon complaining i did get a normal room with a normal balcony but had to pay an extra € 00 for the privilege .
neutral	the rest of the stay was ok .
neutral	it may also be an idea to state on alpharooms info that it would be helpful if you are a fluent german speaker as paguera is geared up for german speakers .
neutral	in one place no one even spoke spanish !!
neutral	i would now think_twice about using alpharooms again .
neutral	recently visited freshwater store and i must_say the depressed and miserable attitude of the server was a million miles_away from the recent visit to the newport store .
neutral	someone should tell the staff that a smile and cheery countenance is a way of getting customers to return .
neutral	i was initially attracted to westin_gourmet by a great offer on bacon .
neutral	and since then i have ordered from them several_times .
neutral	their offers can be excellent value - but not everything they sell is , and it pays to compare prices before pressing the " buy " button , you may find better deals elsewhere .
neutral	but their meat is usually excellent - so even if you can match the price you need to be sure that you are also matching the quality .
neutral	but the two times i have needed to contact their customer service , i have received no response at all to email .
neutral	the first time it was so important that i called , and it was very difficult to get a response on the phone .
neutral	the second time , it was far less of an issue , they sent me a different " freebie " to the one they had offered on their site .
neutral	thing is , i only placed the order because i wanted the freebie offered .
neutral	they didn_'_t bother acknowledging my email , and i decided not to bother using them again .
neutral	they then sent me an_email asking me to rate them on trustpilot , but saying that if i have had a negative experience , to email them instead ... but given that my negative experience is them not responding to emails ...
neutral	well the delivery took longer_than i thought .
neutral	i fount the items to be very expensive .
neutral	this us my local restaurant but i am continually being short changed on the coffee sizes .
neutral	i emailed the head_office to ask if the horizontal line on the side of the coffee cups was the legal marker and they confirmed it was .
neutral	00_% of the time !
neutral	my coffee is well under this line .
neutral	i get sick of taking it back to the counter and just accept it now .
neutral	when i have complained to staff , they say it is impossible to be undersold as a machine measures it out .
neutral	it this is true then they need to move the lines on their cups !
neutral	in recently_purchased some flowers from serenata as it was our wedding_anniversary of 00 years i requested delivery before_midday they di not arrive until after 0 - 00pm i had left a note on my door to leave with my neighbour who was at home .
neutral	the delivery company yodel left them on top of my rubbish bin in fill view of passers by not my idea of good service on their part .
neutral	00_hours down the line today and some of the roses have already started to droop and wither so i will not be using this service again
neutral	despite placing my order through the ecco uk website i didnt realise until reading the small_print that returns have to be sent to sweden - which explains the relatively slow delivery and which makes things potentially very expensive if returning something .
neutral	ecco could at_least provide a contract returns service to help make this easier and cheaper - and it would be nice if it was clearer on the site .
neutral	no_complaints about the products though which are excellent .
neutral	only 0 books out of 0 arrive with no explanation of when if missing item will arrive .
neutral	a simple note would have been helpful
neutral	it took 0months to sort_out , this was due to one of companys failing to relise the funds , felt age_partnership could have done better
neutral	nice to be able to get uk tea bags etc that you can '_t get in greece , but be prepared pay .
neutral	annoyingly if they don_'_t have something , you have then paid for delivery and could have used the space for something_else .
neutral	:-
neutral	i need my insurance details posting as my computer programme will not down load them .
neutral	i am still_waiting for these to come as promised .
neutral	with anticipation
neutral	m e sharrock
neutral	a good product but rather spoilt by the gross price .
neutral	when one adds the vat + transport cost the price then almost doubles .
neutral	the wheelie bags were delivered within two days which for the higland location is very impressive .
neutral	thank - you
neutral	i had an iphone_0s that i wanted to give to a friend , after a lot of internet searching i came_across officialiphoneunlock , they seemed genuine but i used a credit_card to be safe .
neutral	the email that came back said it would take between 0 - 0 days .
neutral	in the end it took 00 during which time i began to feel that i ' d been_scammed .
neutral	i was ready to contact my card_issuer to get the money back .
neutral	they need to be more honest with their timescales and provide more communication , but it seems to have worked out ok in the end .
neutral	i have been buying from ds for a while now .
neutral	in the last_year , some of there products were swapped out for " new and improved " but actually were cheap unmixable and tasted yuck and in bags instead of tubs .
neutral	many reviewers on the site complained ( i did but review didn_'_t show up on the site ).
neutral	the company had the good sense to return to the original mix and all was well , except that one delivery came with out a seal .
neutral	the next delivery came with the seal and the lid and a few scoop fulls in the poorly packaged box .
neutral	i emailed a picture and suggested better ways of packaging , but did not want a refund ( needed the product ).
neutral	but did expect a reply .
neutral	so after poor product , poor packing , poor response and the " free shaker " being swapped to a poor imitation of the original ones , i am left thinking it may be better to try another company .
neutral	we have been using expedia for a number of years to book our holidays and the only problem experienced until last_year was flights with one stop in usa where not enough time was allowed for retrieving luggage , security etc .
neutral	last_year we unfortunately had to cancel our holiday to sarasota , as my mother died .
neutral	we contacted expedia immediately and thought they were very helpful and sympathetic .
neutral	a few_days_later we received an_email_advising expedia had contacted the airline and we would receive our refund within three cycles of our credit_card .
neutral	no mention of the hotel or car_hire so we contacted them again .
neutral	this had been overlooked and it was duly processed and we received a refund for this part of the bill within a few_days .
neutral	in november , while we were in sarasota having re - booked , we received a refund for the original flights , one quarter of the actual cost after being told we would receive a full_refund .
neutral	we contacted expedia while in us and after much discussion we were advised the matter was closed as we had received a refund .
neutral	after speaking to a senior_member of staff , we were informed the airline disputed the original claim as there was a name difference , the booking was made in my married name which i have had for 00 years .
neutral	on our return to uk , we sent a copy of our marraige certificate to expedia who informed us they had sent it on to virgin atlantic .
neutral	we still_haven_'_t received our refund and its almost six_months since we cancelled the holiday .
neutral	hi all ,.
neutral	when i was transferred to talk - talk from tiscali things where not to good when you had a problem the talk - talk customer_services where useless ..
neutral	they would not listen to your problems and only asked you questions from a list if your problem was not on this list forget it no hope of a solution .
neutral	however i found a number i could ring and speak to people in london which did result in problems being eventually sorted .
neutral	without this i would have left them .
neutral	since then my local exchange has_been upgraded and i have a constant 0 . 0 mg download speed which is not bad for a village location so will stick with them .
neutral	i had ordered a box of lucazade carbohydrate orannge flavored recovers bars .
neutral	i was suprised to find that they were still selling them as everyother site i had checked did not have the listed or were out of stock .
neutral	having placed the order , i received a phone_call 0 days_later informorming me that they were not able to fulfll the order and offered to change the order to the mix berry flavour or a refund .
neutral	my grumble is that they web_site was out of date in that they were offering products which were not available , but they did quickly react and imediately refinded the money which is why i '_ve given 0_stars .
neutral	i was pleased with the collar and lead i ordered .
neutral	however the goods were not dispatched for a week and no explanation was offered , i had to chase them using their premium_rate phone numbers sometimes being left on hold for over 0 minutes . i will not use them again if the goods are available elsewhere .
neutral	items were reasonably_priced and delivery was free which is a bonus , although came a day later than_expected , had to make a journey to royal_mail sorting_office as they wouldn_'_t leave package as i wasn_'_t in .... that was a pain so can '_t see why they ask you if you want them to leave in a safe_place then return it to sorting_office making it a 0 days_later .
neutral	the universal cheapo fittings reflect badly on good quality mats .
neutral	i '_ve purchased the correct fitting for my car off ebay and its cost me £ 0 . 00 so why can '_t they do that .
neutral	i placed an order for a pair of oakley prescription glasses which cost under £_000 but as they were offering a £_00 discount if order was over £_000 i ordered a cleaning and screwdriver set from them also but it never arrived with the order .
neutral	i contacted glasses000 via there web_site then also by telephone as i got no response from web_site .
neutral	i was assured that the missing items would be sent but 0 months later and still nothing .
neutral	you only really know how good a company is when things go_wrong and unfortunately they have failed on this .
neutral	i have since made several other sunglass and prescription glasses orders form other sellers which may well have been made with glasses000 if not for there after_sales service .
neutral	overall happy with the glasses purchased but not with the missing items which were never sent .
neutral	i was pleased with the quality but disappointed with the size of the photo in portrait style as it was reduced to the same height as in landscape .
neutral	i would have preferred a change of size to the calendar dates rather_than reducing the photo size .
neutral	my girlfiend saw a picure of one of the bouquets and said they were her favourite flowers so i decided to order them as a xmas suprise .
neutral	it was easy to order and the delivery was spot on .
neutral	i was a bit disappointed with some of the flowers though , the pink carnations were already tinged with brown and didnt look like they would last long
neutral	very easy to order online and national_tyres provided a very speedy service .
neutral	i was slightly disappointed that the tyres i bought last time ( baurum ) are no_longer available through tyre_shopper ( although they are through national_tyres !).
neutral	i would have been willing to pay more for a match .
neutral	you need to consider continuity when choosing brands .
neutral	( p . s .
neutral	i can '_t find another way of responding to karl '_s comments_below .)
neutral	you didn_'_t try to contact me to discuss my concern !
neutral	i got your phone number from a previous response and spoke to your colleague .
neutral	it seems that when i use a vrn to search for tyres it doesn_'_t offer me the uprated 00y instead of 00w baurum tyres .
neutral	had it done so i would probably have bought one .
neutral	i have now reduced my recommendation from 0 to 0_stars because i have encountered some ' friction '.
neutral	excellent product at a very good price .
neutral	pity about their poor customer service , don_'_t seem to be able to trace orders to update delivery date .
neutral	0 to 00 days turned into over 0 weeks .
neutral	i ordered my son '_s 00th_birthday card with a delivery date 0 days before .
neutral	the card did not arrive until the actual day .
neutral	this sounds ok but the reason i wanted it earlier was to add things to it .
neutral	just be careful when ordering that you allow plenty of time for delivery cards though were fantastic
neutral	it took a week for item to be despatched .
neutral	after giving ebay feed_back i received an_email from you asking to resolve my average rating , i was asked to telephone you which i did 0 times over a 0 hour period with nobody answering .
neutral	i did receive a £ 0 refund which was done quickly .
neutral	after using the website to order the tyres for mobile fitting i felt the wheels were in motion to achieve this , however , within hours of placing the order i received two conflicting phone_calls , one from central operations telling_me the fitter would phone 00minutes prior to attending and the second call telling_me that the area i live in is not covered on the day in question and that i have to wait another 00_hours before the fitting can take place .
neutral	on the day the fitter is due to appear , i get my 00_minutes warning of their attendance , however , when they arrive they have the wrong_size tyres and i would have to wait another 0 days , only after speaking to central operations can a manager from another area resolve the issue .
neutral	bad communication .
neutral	the bags i ordered arrived , but the packing wasn_'_t really appropriate , and the bags had been squashed into a cardboard_box which was on the small side for the quantity .
neutral	as a consequence , about 00_% of the order were bent and damaged , and not usable .
neutral	i would give them another chance though .
neutral	new to the site and it '_s good to air my views .
neutral	the review i did on one order .
neutral	i ordered 0 items with the same company and wanted to leave different reviews for each .
neutral	but my original review just got over written .
neutral	okay i could have done one review for all three but they all had different ratings and were dealt_with differently .
neutral	living in a rural village signal is not always very good , but with my last phone from vodaphone i have a signal most of the time !
neutral	£ 00pm more than covers what i need so am pleased at the mo !
neutral	not bad - few occasion of non availability but refund given automatically
neutral	i '_ve used ebookers for a few_years now and they are reliable .
neutral	i have noticed that the website hasn_'_t really kept up with the technology and is now starting to look a bit old and clunky .
neutral	independent travellers need to explore multiple options and the process of navigating backwards and forwards to try out flight options is time_consuming .
neutral	i notice that they do not always show the best prices for hotels .
neutral	i also notice that because they do not search low_cost airlines a bit of independent research on jet star ( australia ) and air asia ( asia ) will yield better deals especially if trying to get from a hub airport to regional centres .
neutral	i and a friend of mine have used sweatband a number of times and have no issues over the quality and pricing of the goods which are excellent .
neutral	but on all occasions we have had to chase up our orders and on all times they have said the delay is because the goods were out of stock .
neutral	on the last occasion they had miracoulsly arrived in stock the day i had emailed the company .
neutral	we have had to wait between 0 weeks and 0 month for all deliveries and had to chase them up for it .
neutral	this lets the company down
neutral	i had a word with the manager at congleton cheshire store he was rude so i complained , my complaint was dealt_with quickly i received a letter to explain that they would look into it , but i must_say the manager can '_t have improved his ways with the staff they seem to stand about more than ever , talking or talking to each other whilst serving and what really annoys_me when the staff slow down the conveyor belts to serve slower and create longer queues in the aisle .
neutral	no wonder they are on the news the staff should be pulling together after all they need their jobs thank_you .

neutral	i don_'_t find tesco an enjoyable shopping_experience - large hangar like store with a muddled layout .
neutral	rather puzzled to learn that world foods does not include anything italian , french or german .
neutral	the " world " according to tesco = asia .
neutral	i find the quality of the fresh produce not very good - fruit often rock hard or gently rotting .
neutral	morrisons has much_better fruit & vege at more reasonable_prices .
neutral	the assistants don_'_t seem as well_trained as when tesco first started expanding , often continuing a conversation with a colleague whilst scanning .
neutral	i no_longer do my big shop at tesco , just a quick pop in and out asap if i have to .
neutral	easy to understand .
neutral	simple to buy .
neutral	immediate download .
neutral	what more di you need ?
neutral	flowers were lovely didn_'_t like the basket that they were in .
neutral	ordered , them with a lovely basket which was shown in the picture .
neutral	but they put them in a diferent basket which didn_'_t look nice .
neutral	rented car from sorrento with return to bologna airport .
neutral	extra_charge for this but total_cost very reasonable .
neutral	desk staff were helpful , though at the airport there was nobody in the office at the car drop - off point and the key needed to be left at the desk inside the airport terminal .
neutral	however this was nothing more than a very slight inconvenience .
neutral	the car itself was something of a disappointment .
neutral	having booked an audi_a0 or similar we were given a ford_focus .
neutral	by what stretch of imagination that is similar to an audi_a0 still perplexes me .
neutral	to add to that , it was a diesel engine which kept stalling at low speeds unless the engine was massivley revved .
neutral	not a particularly easy drive in towns .
neutral	better on motorways , though steering left a bit to be desired .
neutral	i have ordered from dobies before , so logged in to place an order for seed potatoes , onion sets and seeds from them .
neutral	all went well until i came to check out .
neutral	the website remembered my card_details and i clicked on this option before remembering that my card had been reissued due to fraudulent use .
neutral	the order failed - not surprisingly - but there was no option to use another card .
neutral	despite all the items appearing in my order history when i phoned to seek help i was told i would have to re - enter them all again to place an order .
neutral	surely the site can be more user_friendly than this !
neutral	i was disappointed that the washing_machine i ordered on the internet took 0 weeks to arrive even thought it was described as being in stock when i ordered it .
neutral	three_weeks with no washer in this day and age is an unbearably long time .
neutral	had i thought i could have got one quicker elsewhere i would have happily cancelled the order .
neutral	however , when they got it in stock they were good to their word and there was no problem with the delivery arrangements or the goods .
neutral	difficult to understand even when i do get through .
neutral	lack of resolution .
neutral	still having problems getting into my virgin_media after a year of trying .
neutral	i am waiting for my aqua hydrate water and i am so excited .
neutral	i havent gotten a order shipment confirmed yet , hope it is soon .
neutral	i like the choices you have and the fact that i can find what i want here ..
neutral	thanks
neutral	have a nice day

neutral	i have been with littlewoods for over 00 years , and the company '_s thrust seems to have completely changed .
neutral	it used to be the old_fashioned ' club ' catalogue i remember my mum and her friends using ; buy something and pay for it , interest - free , over a set number of weeks .
neutral	' interest - free ' was an interesting term , because , of course , the purchase price was noticeably higher than you ' d pay on the high_street .
neutral	however , it made school uniforms , bedding , nice curtains , and so forth , far more affordable and spread payments to help everyone out in a pre_- credit_card world .
neutral	now littlewoods has changed .
neutral	and , no , not for the better , i think .
neutral	when i visit now , even just to browse , i get an_email .
neutral	" didn_'_t you find what you were looking for ?
neutral	can we push this product at you ?
neutral	oh , and we can offer you a longer payment period - at a high interest rate ."
neutral	i find littlewoods today to be more of a bright shop experience , where you will pay over the odds for items , and then pay interest on that too .
neutral	the web_site works well .
neutral	goods usually turn_up early .
neutral	the returns_procedure is excellent .
neutral	littlewoods still gives good basic catalogue .
neutral	it '_s just a shame it '_s turned into such a credit pushing entity ,
neutral	i had refractive lens exchange surgery in december_0000 .
neutral	six_months on my vision is 00 / 00 in left eye and 00 / 00 in right eye according to optical_express optometrists .
neutral	however , i have ghosting , blurry vision , slight double vision and shading on numbers and letters , headaches and pain / pressure behind my eyes .
neutral	my eyes are also dry since the surgery .
neutral	at my last check up , on 00 april , i was told that nothing can be done do fix those issues mentioned_above .
neutral	apparently , according to optometrist who saw me on 00th_april , 00 - 00 people who see him on daily_basis say the same ??
neutral	?
neutral	i spoke with someone from oe head_office on 00 april who said that i should not be told that and they offered me to meet with the surgeon , mr alex george on 00st_may .
neutral	i asked is that date for sure and i was assured it was .
neutral	the reason_why i asked about date certainty was that for my last three visits to cabot circus i was called to reschedule my appointment ' due to lack of staff '.
neutral	on 00th_april i was called and told that despite_being assured on 00 april that i will see mr george , the appointment has to be changed for either tomorrow , 00 april or in june .
neutral	i already explained to oe head_office that i can '_t make on 00 april due to work_commitments and june would be too late .
neutral	i feel that mr george , or any other oe surgeon , cannot be bothered to see me now .
neutral	i am really concerned that i am no more of interest to optical_express .
neutral	i am now considering whether or not to take legal_action_against the optical_express .
neutral	update_: 0st may 0000 .
neutral	thank_you stephen for your reply .
neutral	i was contacted yesterday by one of your colleagues who set an_appointment with dr george on 0h may and i can '_t wait to see him .
neutral	i will post my comments after the appointment .
neutral	to trustpilot or optical_express - i see that i am not under category as confirmed patient though person who posted positive_feedback after me is confirmed patient .
neutral	i left my patient id with you so i would welcome if you could verify that .
neutral	regards
neutral	jack latkovic
neutral	00th_may 0000
neutral	a further update ...
neutral	i changed the rating to 0_stars now .
neutral	the reason for this is that i took a second , and third , opinion about the pre_- surgery , , outcome of the surgery and post treatment .
neutral	btw , i was seen by dr george and i had quite a long and extensive exam .
neutral	i am now given some drops to reduce the ghosting .
neutral	back to second and third opinion ....
neutral	whoever saw me , whether the nhs or private surgeons , complemented the surgery i had .
neutral	they said that the lenses are the latest model and they are perfectly positioned .
neutral	they also welcomed that the oe provided the full and detailed history of pre and post op .
neutral	what they , surgeons , didn_'_t like that much was the fact that i only saw my surgeon / s when i had the surgery , not before or after the surgery .
neutral	they also didn_'_t like the fact that i was seen by a number of different optometrists at the oe , which i always thought was one of the main problems ( different info from different optometrist ).
neutral	i changed to 0_stars only for three reasons :
neutral	0 .
neutral	i was not told in detail about all the risks and / or side effects that might happen .
neutral	i understand that the oe wants to sell the product , and that they are high_street company , but they really need to be honest with their patients / customers rather_than talking in small_print .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i only met my surgeons when they did the op , not before or after .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i was seen by too many optometrists instead of having one who should know my history by heart .
neutral	when i was assured by second opinion eye surgeons i decided to raise the rating .
neutral	i never thought of giving 0_stars .
neutral	i gave 0 instead of 0_stars only for reasons mentioned_above .
neutral	would i do again this surgery ?
neutral	definitely as i was already at that point that anything done later would have higher risk .
neutral	would i do it with optical_express ?
neutral	no , unless they change their practice and :
neutral	a ) explain risks in detail , in written and verbally
neutral	b ) surgeon does all the necessary preps before the surgery and the same surgeon does the surgery ; and
neutral	c ) the same optometrist sees you on regular check ups after the surgery
neutral	i hope that oe will change their practice .
neutral	if not , i suggest you to visit proper eye surgeon if you wish to do either laser or lens replacement .
neutral	thanks
neutral	jack latkovic
neutral	as a commodore de luxe passenger i expect priority boarding and disembarkation like you used to do .
neutral	in the commodore lounge you need to get your hostesses to bring out the champagne earlier .
neutral	attention to detail is what the discerning traveller demands nowadays .
neutral	average service doesn_'_t wear these days .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why they quote a much_better rate in their daily e_- mails than the rate i get unless that rate is for much larger sums .
neutral	i wish they would be more transparent .
neutral	bought item for christmas and simply couldn_'_t understand how , when tracking progress , it arrived in uk from spain , via germany !
neutral	good coverage not bad pricing only_gripe is 00 month contracts but been with them since it was cellnet 00 years so they must be doing something right
neutral	competitive_prices but don_'_t order anything if you require it quickly !
neutral	have waited over a week for my items which really defeats the object of being_able to order online for convenience and speed .
neutral	only use the site now when not in any hurry for goods .
neutral	such a shame because could be such a good company .
neutral	very helpful and pleasant folks .
neutral	my sign finally arrived and looks great .
neutral	took loads of chasing to finally get it delivered , hence the three star_rating .
neutral	with the 00_% jubilee discount my callaway razr x driver was as good a price (£_000 ) as i could find " out there ".
neutral	delivery was sluggish at best taking 0 working_days to arrive although the deal was between 0 & 0 working_days .
neutral	have had better experience with 000 previously but will use again if the price is right .
neutral	before purchasing a dual sim phone , i tried to use their web chat .
neutral	the person went away for what seemed hours trying to find the answer to the question , and never came back .
neutral	eventually i called the phone , spoke to the proprietor and he couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
neutral	after purchasing , i had a query in relation to nano - sim and micro - sims .
neutral	i spoke to someone who knew even less_than i did .
neutral	they said someone would get back to me , but no one ever did .
neutral	mobicity '_s range of dual - sim products seems broad , perhaps unique , however , this , i guess , is a small company that has yet to learn to share skills across the company .
neutral	good service and prompt delivery .
neutral	far too much packaging for the tiny watch_strap i bought .
neutral	a more than adequate package was encased in a huge and unnecessary plastic_bag .
neutral	i ' m talking_about southampton airport .
neutral	prepayment gets you into the lt car_park ; the barrier opens ok and you get an entry ticket .
neutral	the instructions tenn you on your return , to insert the ticket into the exit barrier slot and ' the exit barrier will open '.
neutral	no it won_'_t .
neutral	beware if you are one minute later than_anticipated ; you '_ll need to find payment kiosk and pay extra .
neutral	that '_s fine , but the instructions don_'_t mention that you should inseet ticket into payment kiosk .
neutral	scrabbling round to find a kiosk whilt you are in an exit queue is no fun for anybody .
neutral	misleading and incompete instructions
neutral	the products ordered were of good quality but the delivery is so slow .
neutral	with this car_hire company charging an excess of around 000 gbp you have to be very careful to inspect and record all damage however miniscule .
neutral	also there is no - one to check the car in and give a zero balance receipt before 0 . 00am which means if the car is then scratched in the car_park afterwards you are still liable !
neutral	unacceptable imo .
neutral	on the basic package there is only 0 hours online viewing allowed per_month , not much is available online , and the " we have every dvd " pledge is fiction .
neutral	i keep meaning to leave but keep forgetting :-(
neutral	i initially called the number on the website .
neutral	the call was answered by someone i could barely understand , he told to wait and he would transfer me for my booking .
neutral	i waited , then gave up .
neutral	i went back to the website and booked my flight from glasgow to melbourne .
neutral	the site is well_designed and easy to understand a few_minutes later i was all booked up with confirmation arriving very quickly by e_mail .
neutral	i am now waiting on my e tickets which have been promised within one working day .
neutral	so far so good travelup
neutral	the a0 calendar when received was good and the software to produce it quite acceptable .
neutral	however it is not possible to save a partial calendar and return later to finish it .
neutral	i lost one attempt ( which took me over an_hour to do ) by pressing a wrong key and had to start again !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i would use it again but with the awareness that the calendar had to be completed in one session .
neutral	some accomodation is better_than other - it pays to request the facilities you require and seek agreement that they are present before you book .
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs for the price of one , with a great variety of choice from frames and styles also selection of lenses and sunglasses
neutral	but when the order turned_up the wrong glasses on the one pair were delivered i called customer_services who immediately sent a return label and within a week i had the correct pair in my hands
neutral	good service overall
neutral	item very good , but took along time for it to be dispatched .
neutral	its hard to get to the exact products your looking for on the site .
neutral	seems like they do not have as good a range of products as local b_& q oulets
neutral	we have rcently returned from an all_inclusive holiday booked through travel_republic , and although everything_went_smoothly as far as organisation goes , we were not informed about the hotel being populated almost exclusively by aging spanish holidaymakers .
neutral	the entertainment was aimed directly to please them .
neutral	if we had been advised prior to booking , we would have looked elsewhere .
neutral	i ordered an expensive printer from their website .
neutral	the photo was a black model that i particularly wanted .
neutral	they delivered in white which i could have bought on the day at curries or pc_world some £_00 . 00 cheaper and taken it home there and then !
neutral	i have logged a returns question and i am awaiting a response .
neutral	they have now changed their website to show a white machine .
neutral	i am hoping for a positive result and will keep you all posted .
neutral	i have now been offered a refund which i will take , they admit they never had black in stock , so despite resolution i feel as if they were just hoping i would accept the wrong item , it would make me reluctant to buy from them again as they have lost my trust .
neutral	i liked the appliances_online price and the tracking_system , it let you know where the item for delivery was at any given time .
neutral	but did not like the pushy_sales on service contracts .
neutral	i did not want one but i had to say no at_least 0 times before i could end the call .
neutral	up until last_year travelodge were as cheap as chips , they then suddenly decided to change tack and charge us slightly less_than the nearest budget hotel in your chosen area hence the massive price rises that you see today . their sale days used to cause the server to crash as you picked_up rooms for £ 0 ,£ 00 ,£ 00 and £_00 , but not any longer £_00 is the cheapest you will find and some in london are ridiculous prices . some hotels are brand_new and some have been refurbished but the untouched ones aren_'_t worth £_00 a night as everything is so dated in them . i have recently used ibis hotels which are cheaper_than travelodge and give free internet in the room .
neutral	the stuff was well_packaged , arrived on time and was very easy to set_up and use .
neutral	however , when you switch off the computer or controller , the bridge and speaker have to be unplugged ( then plugged in again before reboot ) or there are lights twinkling on all night .
neutral	shame !
neutral	unfortunately i have had a very laborious and frustrating experience with this company .
neutral	i ordered a black tablet in december ready for a christmas_present but it never arrived .
neutral	i queried it with clickshop in january and they said they had been unable to supply it but no one had informed me .
neutral	initially there was some good communication from their customer_services and they eventually agreed to provide a different model and a small refund .
neutral	the different model arrived after a couple of weeks in early february but it did not charge properly and i asked for a refund .
neutral	the original discount never came through though they claimed they had tried to do it unsuccessfully .
neutral	in the end as a gesture of goodwill i accepted their offer of a discount_voucher_code instead and purchased other goods in late february .
neutral	this never arrived either so i emailed them several_times without reply .
neutral	then in late march_0000 , after several weeks and the posting of my review on trustpilot , they did send part of the replacement order and offered me another refund .
neutral	the second part of the order was incorrect but the generous refund was processed within a week .
neutral	i feel sorry for the customer_services people as they are being let_down by the despatch team it seems .
neutral	after ordering received email some 0 days_later to inform me of paypal refund .. no explaination as to why ?
neutral	had to call to ask .. apparently one item out of stock , so order withheld ?
neutral	recieved 0 days after phone_call .
neutral	find almost anything on there .
neutral	bad points is fees are too dear to sell things
neutral	yeah , good price but not the right product .
neutral	sent eau_de parfum not eau_de toilette , so did me out of a few_quid .
neutral	too much_trouble to change so put it down to experience !
neutral	started off okay , but soon started to lose their colour .
neutral	will try another make / supplier next time .
neutral	work out an expensive item when they have to be thrown away so early .
neutral	they should check their own stores aswell as tesco , morrisons and sainsbury , i bought 0 quilts at £_00 . 00 each from wakefield the next_day i did a price match and that was fine , after going to another asda i found the same for £_00 . 00 when i complaind they said i should take it back and get my money back and go and buy from the other but why should i pay for the petrol , i wont be buying from asda next time and will stick to my local tesco
neutral	delivered promptly but sent the wrong_colour kindle colour and still_awaiting a reply to my e_mail sent a week ago concerning a replacement .
neutral	can '_t fault the product ( domino bunk bed ) and when speaking to customer service the response was efficient and polite .
neutral	unfortunately the courier service used by bed kingdom proved unreliable first time around .
neutral	i chose precisiontime because of the excellent prices they were offering .
neutral	the ordering_process was straightforward and they sent emails to keep me up to date with my order .
neutral	this was important because they did not stock the watch i wanted , so there was some delay .
neutral	this delay was acceptable , but just be aware of it .
neutral	i chose to have precisiontime make adjustments to my watch , but i had to have the watch adjusted again at a local jeweller ( for the same price ) my advice is not to bother with their adjustment service , but go to a local place .
neutral	after posting the following customer_services contacted me and the issue was speedily resolved to my complete_satisfaction .
neutral	i received my first coffee_table in december and by the end of january splits had appeared on the top .
neutral	a ' technician ' was sent out late in february - it is very difficult to get a response from the company - who declared irreparable .
neutral	i , foolishly , agreed to accept a replacement item which , when delivered , was split in several places .
neutral	the table was collected and a refund promised .
neutral	no refund appeared .
neutral	ofl eventually processed the refund on 0th_june .
neutral	no such refund arrived .
neutral	on contacting them today i was informed they only do a refund process once a week and , tough , i would have to wait_until tomorrow for mine to be processed .
neutral	i doubt i will ever see see any money from the company and today will be contacting my credit_card_provider for a refund from them .
neutral	so be warned - if anything_goes_wrong you will really struggle to get any satisfaction and make_sure you pay by credit_card so that the payment is covered_under section 00 of the consumer credit act 0000
neutral	i have used opodo , bought tickets from the airlines and also read the many negative feedbacks .
neutral	the fact is you can try to save what probably amounts to about 0 - 0 % on a regular ticket , or you can pay the extra 0 % and get it through the airline direct .
neutral	the stress - free way in my experience , is to go direct to the airline .
neutral	if you really can '_t afford the few extra $ on a ' proper ' ticket then you should probably be staying at home anyway .
neutral	i must_admit i shop at tesco . com for my groceries because it is hard for me to reach some shops to get the stuff i need .
neutral	they are not always the cheapest and their prices between online and actual shop are very misleading , to say the least .
neutral	i can buy a 0 x 0 - pint tesco pure milk online for £ 0 . 00 ( current price @ 00 / 00 / 00 ), but only two days ago , in the actual store where my orders are made up for the delivery truck , the same milk was £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	so , either the price has shot up , or they are ' milking ' the online shoppers for every_penny .
neutral	actually , now i '_ve said this , i may go back to waitrose ... you can trust them .
neutral	i found ' medic_animal ' purely by chance and very glad i did .
neutral	however , in future i will need to order long before i will need my item , as it took quite a while to arrive .
neutral	hasn_'_t put me off though , will ceratinly buy from them again !
neutral	i '_ve shopped a couple of times with blackleaf and have no_complaints on quality , price , or service - all very good .
neutral	this time i needed to return a t - shirt ( it was too big and i wanted to exchange or a size smaller ), and it transpires that i need to pay the postage .
neutral	the thing with online shopping is you can '_t try stuff on and my expectation and experience with other_retailers is that returns are free .
neutral	it used to be fun , now ads as long as 00 seconds precede many videos .
neutral	too long to wait in these days of ' instant ' everyting on the net
neutral	good choice but the postage_charges are not apparent until you go to checkout
neutral	serenataflowers . com do keep the client informed as to dispatch and delivery of the flowers ordered .
neutral	however i received a text via mobile_phone at 0 . 00am ish to say the flowers where on their way to the recipient , i sent a text to the recipient to say they where on their way but they actually arrived at 00 . 00 .
neutral	this s probably normal but as i had not used seranata before i rightly or wrongly expected them to have arrived at the latest by 00 am .
neutral	however they did arrive and the recipient was pleased with them , though who would say otherwise .
neutral	i was sent a text to say thankyou and an accompanying photo of the bouquet which quite_frankly bore little resemblance to the one on seranatas web_site apart_from it being pink .
neutral	this said i would probably use them again though they will not be my first choice .
neutral	having been let_down by another online flower provider in the last few_days i am only glad that at_least a bouquet of flowers actually arrived this time .
neutral	trophy '_s were great but a fair few problems with delivering them , arrived with no centres and duplicate trophy then sent new trophy and 0 centres then a day late 0 more , still_waiting the final 0 !
neutral	.
neutral	but as i say the trophy '_s are great and excellent value
neutral	the feedback from this booking is good spent far
neutral	received my order by return , but found i could buy the same product in the supermarket a lot more cheaply .
neutral	update
neutral	i received a beautiful replacement box of flowers on the arranged day .
neutral	i wasn_'_t sure that they would arrive as i didn_'_t receive an acknowledgement , but online customer_services did what they promised .
neutral	i '_ve increased my rating to 0_stars for that reason , though i am still disgusted with the quality of the phone support .
neutral	update - i received an_email very quickly offering to replace the flowers on a date of my choosing .
neutral	fingers_crossed !
neutral	will update if received .
neutral	i have just returned from a long weekend away and found a box of flowers ' dumped ' on my doorstep .
neutral	there wasn_'_t a card through the door door , so had they been stolen , i would never had known that they had been there .
neutral	they also provided an excellent advert that we were away .
neutral	i have spoken to a very unhelpful operative who was totally unmoved and uninterested .
neutral	she gave me the verbal equivalent of a shrug of the shoulders and didn_'_t seem to care that the flowers had been left there for 0 days so look awful or that they should not have been left on the doorstep at all had the delivery instructions on the label been followed - ( if recipient not at home , please leave securely on premises or with a neighbour .
neutral	please leave card ).
neutral	this has_been a terrible experience , rather_than the pleasant one intended by the sender .
neutral	i cannot possibly tell the sender how awful the flowers were .
neutral	do not buy from this shower !
neutral	!
neutral	i would liked to have given a 0 star_rating as my first order went without a hitch but my second order did not arrive .
neutral	i found the website easy to use and found some good prices so placed a second order as i had no_problems with the earlier one that i had made , i received an_email_confirming dispatch of the goods .
neutral	i waited a week before tracking the parcel and was surprised , as i work from home , to see that the courier had tried and failed to make the delivery and it was going to be redelivered the next_day
neutral	which was a saturday so we were all in all day , but no delivery .
neutral	i left it until the tuesday to ring customer_services who were very helpful and rang the courier to find out where the parcel was , they rang me back and said that they had been told by the courier that it had been left in our porch , the only problem with that is that we do not have a porch .
neutral	i explained this to customer_services and they immediately said they would resend the items again .
neutral	i had found the website easy to use and the prices on offer seemed to be very competitive so it is disappointing that they have been let_down by the couriers .
neutral	i tend to avoid websites once i find out that the couriers that they use do not leave cards if they try and fail to deliver and then offer lame excuses for why the parcel has_gone_missing ( city_link the worst offenders )
neutral	is the price you first see what you end up paying ?
neutral	whilst this product looks really good and the chrome work is fine , i found as a professional plumber that it was difficult to install with out any instructions .
neutral	the header shower had a leek at the point where an ' o ' ring is fitted because it had been over tightened on assembly and one of the leds does not work .
neutral	the center temperature control has a built in safety stop made of thin brittle plastic and was easily damaged during installation and had to be repaired using ' super glue '.
neutral	the cover plate requires additional clearance around the body in order to achieve a flush fit .
neutral	most of these issueshave now been resolved with a ' spares ' package .
neutral	recent communications have been good .
neutral	unimpressed , terry porter
neutral	bought a new dish washer from ao . com .
neutral	delivery and product was good but a phone_call from ao . com offering extended_warranty smacked of sharp_practice .
neutral	i could only buy warranty by giving details for direct_debit over the phone , there and then .
neutral	when i asked to see the terms and conditions , before committing myself to purchase , these were denied !
neutral	!
neutral	use ryanair quite often as it gets me from a - b cheaply and on most of my business trips that '_s all i require .
neutral	infuriating constant announcements in - flight ensure that you don_'_t get much peace and the dreaded fanfare at the end of each flight announcing that you have arrived early .
neutral	regular flyers know that this is because they always exaggerate the length of the flight time !
neutral	!
neutral	the items i purchased were ok , although the t - shirt would have been better a size bigger .
neutral	however the cost of returning this item to sweden made it uneconomic to do so .
neutral	other on - line clothing companies offer free returns which i think is only fair when you are ordering goods which may or may not fit .
neutral	price was great for the paramo top i ordered .
neutral	however i ordered during xmas_period and it was only after three working_days had elapsed after xmas that i was notified despatch was occurring , by this time i had received delivery of another item from another supplier that i placed at exactly the same time so i was quite concerned when on checking with po track and trace the po indicated that they had not received my item from the small independent castleberg people !
neutral	i sought reassurance by email but did not receive a reply at this point .
neutral	pleasingly the next working day the po showed my delivery was received and on its way to me and it did just arrive within the advertised seven working_days .
neutral	i let castleberg know as soon as i had received it and they thanked me for my understanding during the busy xmas_period so all good in the end but unfortunately i cannot report a 0 / 0star delivery experience !
neutral	first order was delayed but arrived after i was updated about stock issue .
neutral	second order heard_nothing after a week , so emailed and order was despatched arriving next_day .
neutral	something not quite right ?
neutral	definitely not a modern villa this one .
neutral	rustic charm is wearing a bit thin in places as this old lady is showing her age .
neutral	signs of forced entry around the front_door and shutters don_'_t exactly fill you with confidence about the security of the place when you arrive .
neutral	we chose the villa for the large patio area but its been advantageously photographed on the website .
neutral	there '_s no clear outside dining space unless you want to sit at the bottom of the garden and the barbecue area is the other side of the garden .
neutral	the bathroom fixtures and fittings are unnecessarily cheap and it does get a bit tiresome picking the soap tray out of the bath since it won_'_t take the weight of even a small bar of soap .
neutral	it all needs a bit of thoughtful investment .
neutral	whilst the villa sleeps six , there is nowhere_near enough room in the lounge or around any of the tables for six adults .
neutral	however , the location is superb , literally a 0 - minute stroll from a fantastic beach with a small supermarket no more than 000 yards away .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	***
neutral	i recently gave a supplier a five_star review and all went_smoothly with publication on trustpilot .
neutral	however , the previous review , in which i ' d given one star to a mobile_phone unlocking service and explained my bad_experience , had been blocked .
neutral	because the mobile unlocking service had my supply reference they contacted me , threatening_legal_action unless i withdrew my review .
neutral	this does make me wonder_how many critical reviews may actually get through to publication .
neutral	so now if i see five_stars i think , ' great ' but if i see three stars i think , ' oh oh , best avoid '.
neutral	good price but as with any online ordering it '_s fine if you a company or working on a site where there are people to sign for the delivery all day but if you are a diyer then you may end up having to stay in all day for your delivery ( 0 :_00am to 00 :_00pm ).
neutral	i missed my delivery at 0 :_00pm in the afternoon on a friday and in total i have waited 0 days .
neutral	now monday and i have to stay in all day again .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	won_'_t bother again .
neutral	very good prices , delivery on the slow side , stated delivery 0 - 0 working_days , ordered am on tuesday phoned on friday they say delivery next monday , we shall see
neutral	no_problems whatsoever with the product its fantastic , but the courier service was very difficult to say the least .
neutral	love greased lightening its fantastic on car easy to use and leaves a great finish which lasts and keeps protected .
neutral	overall i ' m satisfied .
neutral	i got a great deal on designer_frames with prescription lenses .
neutral	but : delivery it took 0 , 0 weeks ( 00 business days ) for the glasses to arrive .
neutral	shipping per se was actually quite fast ( 0 days to austria ), but it took 00 business days for them to even get the frames for fitting the lenses , then another 0 days before the order was shipped .
neutral	apparently that '_s nothing much out of the ordinary either : they don_'_t have the designer_frames on stock .
neutral	if you dig far enough into the faq on the site , you may be able to find out what delivery times to expect .
neutral	but if it says " 00_% of orders shipped within 0 days !
neutral	", naturally you assume you have a good shot at that .
neutral	they should be more honest right there on the product page on what timeframe you can expect .
neutral	i wrote an honest inoffensive detailed response to an epson stylus pro 0000 wide
neutral	format printer review request from epsonuk .
neutral	they obviously don_'_t like
neutral	honesty and deleted the review and this puts their entire own website review system into disrepute .
neutral	which i guess applies to many home grown reviews .
neutral	treat
neutral	with caution and try to find independent review_sites like this one .
neutral	so i shall give my review here which will hopefully filter into the
neutral	real world .
neutral	0 : the 0000 is a very nice machine but huge and very heavy .
neutral	it '_s a
neutral	four man job to move it but no handles or lifting points are provided .
neutral	so if you think you might have it upstairs forget it .
neutral	0 : turn off auto cleaning or it will be pestering you almost every
neutral	other use to clean the system .
neutral	i find cleaning it every few_weeks with
neutral	a * normal * clean is more than enough ( we print around 000 a0 sheets on
neutral	average per_month and machine in use daily )
neutral	0 : " epson " engineers are great .
neutral	know their product and helpful .
neutral	sadly
neutral	you will be lucky to find one as they usually send out a generic
neutral	engineer who_knows little about your machine and just goes through the
neutral	motions which means lots of wasted time and materials .
neutral	however the
neutral	service is valid and they don_'_t try to screw you with non covered bs .
neutral	0 : grab the 0yr extended_warranty which is often on a special at half
neutral	price , or some machines will have it thrown in .
neutral	great peace of mind .
neutral	these deals come up often so keep checking .
neutral	you can buy the warranty
neutral	anytime in the first year and you do not have to buy it from epson
neutral	themselves .
neutral	0 : online support is very poor in that the guys know nothing about the
neutral	machines they support and merely read from a script .
neutral	which is very
neutral	frustrating when you are asking questions or trying to get answers
neutral	about what can be quite basic issues in printing generally .
neutral	so if you
neutral	do have to call an engineer you will have to jump_through many hoops ,
neutral	many of which are really quite basic irrelevance .
neutral	which is fine if you
neutral	are clueless in seattle but most of us with a wide format pro printer
neutral	will have at_least a basic knowledge of how these things work .
neutral	0 : the inks last well and you can get some good deals on genuine inks
neutral	so i would not bother with generic inks which will_certainly
neutral	invalidate any warranty you had and the machine can tell if you are
neutral	using non genuine inks and logs everything .
neutral	however epson will also try to insist you only use epson canvas / paper
neutral	at 0 x the cost of generic quality which is excellent , and i suspect
neutral	if you admit to using generic papers they will decline service on that
neutral	basis which is nonsense and very doubtful if its even legal .
neutral	both
neutral	epson and generic canvas leaves quite a bit of dust residue so you
neutral	need to vacuum the machine every other roll really , which is an easy
neutral	00 minute job .
neutral	0 : the inks are all colorfast apart_from the matte black which seems
neutral	daft , so you will need to handle the blacks with caution .
neutral	matte
neutral	canvas / paper must use matte black_ink .
neutral	the other colors are rock
neutral	solid .
neutral	the machine comes with inbuilt matte or photo black inks but it
neutral	is time_consuming and expensive to change the inks as the machine has
neutral	to flush the system each changeover .
neutral	which makes using both
neutral	impractical in reality .
neutral	0 : output quality is outstanding on canvas , but it '_s not photo
neutral	quality .
neutral	the control_panel via pc is very good and you can also update
neutral	the software on the machine online vie the lfp remote panel which is
neutral	an optional free download from epson and not to be confused with the
neutral	printer control_panel .
neutral	0 : paper changing is a pain and can be quite complex , though changing
neutral	rolls is easy .
neutral	if you want to go from a roll to print a one of a0 / a0
neutral	sheet etc it '_s better to turn the machine off ( noting how much roll is
neutral	left ) pull the roll paper out then switch the machine on again and
neutral	when it asks for paper choose a0 sheet etc .
neutral	you also need to choose
neutral	sheet in printer panel on the pc before you print .
neutral	think that covers much of it .
neutral	hth :)
neutral	ordered product , e_- mail says products depatched now waiting 00 days .
neutral	do not respond to e_- mails or telephone_calls .
neutral	one of the worst companies i have ever_dealt_with .
neutral	have just received ink albeit not in time for work i had to do but at_least it looks a decent product
neutral	ordered large cupboard .
neutral	was assured that delivery would be to room where wanted .
neutral	delivery time as agreed but driver and mate would not be persuaded to deliver to first floor room intended .
neutral	now sitting on a landing half - way up waiting for my son - in - law to recover from tonsillitis and find another volunteer to move it .
neutral	still in its packing so it does not get damaged during move .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	would not use made . com again .
neutral	ordered a charger for usb devices 00 / 00 / 00 £_00 : 00 +.
neutral	apparently in - stock and " posted " at a cost of £ 0 : 00 the following_day .
neutral	0 days after order , no sign of the goods and no tracking_information provided 0 days after the order .
neutral	website now showing goods out of stock and no support from gameseek , other than to say that the goods have been posted .
neutral	subsequent friendly email exchange with gameseek , in which they confirmed that the device had been posted " unregistered , unsigned for " ( odd for a piece of kit costing_£_00 : 00 ).
neutral	they asked my son '_s age and size and offered to send a gift selected from their stock to arrive before_christmas .
neutral	i told them that he was 00 , 0 ' 0 " and played games on a pc and / or mac , a games console ( but i was blowed if i knew whether it was an xbox , ps0 or wii ) and that he hated " shootemups " but i did not not know what he had or did not have .
neutral	i was left to believe that a " rescue " present would be sent by signed - for post in time for christmas but nothing arrived .
neutral	fortunately , the charger dropped through the letterbox on christmas_eve .
neutral	so ...
neutral	mixed review .
neutral	the gadget ordered was about the right price and was the only one in stock anywhere on the internet when i looked .
neutral	it was posted reasonably promptly ( if i believe the seller ) but at high cost (£ 0 : 00 for " standard " postage ) at christmas .
neutral	it was light and , according to the royal_mail website , would have cost only another 00p to post " next_day , signed - for " .
neutral	however , no expedited option was available on the seller '_s website .
neutral	the email support was very friendly but they undertook to send a replacement gift of equivalent value to arrive before_christmas so my son had something to unwrap .
neutral	nothing arrived .
neutral	so , i got what i wanted , just about in time .
neutral	the carriage options are limited ( and in this case expensive ) and do not include expedited delivery .
neutral	on - line support is glib but ultimately useless .
neutral	i have started to avoid going to tesco now as it is crazy trying to find a trolley on the weekend .
neutral	i have regularly ( in the past ) spent 00_minutes trying to find a trolley for shopping ( beckton and goodmayes ).
neutral	i '_ve watched their prices creep up in a matter of weeks on specific items by at_least 00p a time .
neutral	for instance nachos which used to be 0 . 00 has crept up to 0 . 00 in a matter of weeks .
neutral	has cost of living gone up that much ??
neutral	really ??
neutral	so i '_ve decided to take my money where it will stretch further - aldi and lidl .
neutral	oh ... i must_say thank_you to tesco for reminding me that i haven_'_t spent past vouchers which are about to expire .
neutral	i will_definitely make_sure they are used .
neutral	i had my eyes_tested last_year and was prescribed vari - focal lenses .
neutral	they were awful and totally unsuitable to what i needed .
neutral	i asked specsavers to re - look at them and they have offered to change the lens without_any hassle caused to myself .
neutral	quite frustrating to have been put in this position but glad they responded in the way they did .
neutral	just to let you know that i ordered flowers for same day delivery on saturday 0st september_0000 order number wa000000 and as of yet monday 0th_september i have not received acknowledgement from e florist that they were delivered correctly .
neutral	i included my email address and for customer_satisfaction it would have been really great to receive a one line acknowledgement of delivery .
neutral	just a thought in this day and age of speedy electronic software !!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	although they have an interesting assortment we came out of using their service long time ago .
neutral	initial orders came through well but the last order , to be delivered at a pick_up point , failed time after time to arrive .
neutral	it was hard to trace what went wrong ; we actually never found out and the company didn_'_t seem to bother either .
neutral	way too much time we had to spent emailing to get reimbursement .
neutral	bad communicators , not apparent interests in quality controls either .
neutral	----------------------------------------------------------------------
neutral	update
neutral	pixmania did an amazing in - depth research to find out what happened 0 years_ago to my order : they had logged the issues as having forgotten to send out a delivery email .
neutral	i was promised a credit to my account but have not heard from them after agreeing to that offer .
neutral	maybe an other email got lost ?
neutral	cheap , some good stuff some really bad stuff , my missus gets her cheap underwear here , i buy my workshirts .
neutral	i would not buy my main evening wear or other casuals here ....
neutral	countertop magic cleaner was recommended by the fitter for our new worktops and he left behind a 000 ml bottle .
neutral	when ordering i used the description of the bottle left with us to check the images shown on the kac web_site and they were identical .
neutral	the ones kac sent are different - they have red pump handles as_opposed to cream , the labels are different and the manufacturer '_s stock numbers too ( 0000 vs 0000 ).
neutral	i e_- mailed kac - their reply was , " countertop magic have changed the packaging and added an extra ingredient , this product is still the recommended cleaning product for all solid surfaces ."
neutral	assuming the product and container has_been modified , kac need to update their web_site to avoid confusion .
neutral	prices are good , but don_'_t order from them if you ' re in a hurry .
neutral	i ordered a dvd drive on 00st_april .
neutral	on 00rd_april , the order status changed to " in picking process " ( promising ).
neutral	alas , not dispatched until 00th_april and not received ' til 0rd may .
neutral	guess i '_ve just got used to receiving stuff from amazon and ebuyer in 00 - 00_hours .
neutral	technextday ... bit of a misnomer .
neutral	pleased with item and arrived quite quickly , but postal charge expensive as cost only 00p but charged £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	will not use again .
neutral	genernally very good , but expensive if goods are not availible ( in the stock ) for next_day delivery .
neutral	it also lets them down , as the is no way to track this item either , and therefore can ' tt track it progess .
neutral	at_least , lately , the parcels have been collected on the arranged date .
neutral	biggest bugbear is that the tracking_system is so slow to be updated , if at all , in the latter stages .
neutral	it is areal pain having to wait in all day for the collection .
neutral	would be worth_paying a few more pounds for a company that provides a window .
neutral	but it is cheap and reliable
neutral	pricing and delivery very good , however beware of signing_up for their automatic re - ordering !
neutral	i did this after receipt of my second order , assuming ( i know this makes an ass out of you and me !)
neutral	i was re - ordering my latest order .
neutral	however on receipt of the order confirmation i found i was being sent my first order again , goods i did not need .
neutral	i immediately emailed to point out the error , this was not responded to until after i had received notification that my order was on its way .
neutral	i have cancelled the order and wait to see how long it takes them to refund my money .
neutral	the response i received to my complaint put the blame for this fairly and squarely on me .
neutral	i however feel that going back to my original , more_expensive order was ' sharp_practice '.
neutral	if they had given a date for the order as well as the number , i might have checked .
neutral	i am now trying another on line supplier , who '_s products are equally competitive and won_'_t be signing_up for any more auto re - orders with anyone .
neutral	you have been_warned !
neutral	we have travelled with jet0 many_times .
neutral	we have always found them to be both welcoming and efficient , and consider them to be far more customer friendly than rivals such as ryanair .
neutral	our experience on this occasion when flying out of manchester was typical - check - in was swift and staff were pleasant and helpful .
neutral	it was therefore a real shock when we arrived at venice marco_polo airport for the return_journey home .
neutral	the local ground operation was a complete_shambles .
neutral	passengers waiting for the edinburgh flight were unable to check in but were not given any adequate explanation as to why this was .
neutral	consequently , there was a sprawling , disorganised queue , and tempers were frayed .
neutral	the ground staff were generally unhelpful and one supercilious check - in clerk was particularly dismissive of passenger concerns .
neutral	although i assume that these were not actually jet0 employees , i doubt that many of the inconvenienced passengers would have made this distinction .
neutral	as it was , it took us over an_hour to drop_off our single bag - and we were the lucky ones .
neutral	many passengers probably counted their blessings that our flight was delayed for an_hour .
neutral	i heard many complaints and feel that it is a shame that jet0 '_s reputation should be damaged as a result of the poor customer service offered by the italian ground crew .
neutral	the website and clothes are but i ' d rather go into the shop because their delivery and returns are a bit difficult .
neutral	you can select a date / time which seems great but the courier never sticks to it , so you don_'_t know if you need to be at home or not .
neutral	i ' d rather they offered less specific dates / times that the courier can meet , than not be able to rely_on it .
neutral	maybe it '_s just the area i live in and other areas are better .
neutral	ok service .
neutral	no_complaints but nothing outstanding .
neutral	received a phone_call to say my order had been processed but it seemed more about trying to sell me some toner than anything_else .
neutral	received text_message on due delivery day with link for tracking order and that was it .
neutral	no phone_call or any more texts with more detailed delivery slot .
neutral	had to rely upon a colleague to text me and say they had taken delivery as i was away from the office .
neutral	checked tracking link and yes it had been delivered .
neutral	i had wanted to write a review of a particular company , but when clicking on it am told i need a validation code , with no instruction on where to obtain this .
neutral	my order number doesn_'_t seem to be the key .
neutral	unfortunately , one of the features of this company is that they restrict the mode and content of communication .
neutral	i had hoped that writing a review here would at_least contribute to warning others , but even at here i have been frustrated .
neutral	i think this site is a good facility , but don_'_t understand_why you would restrict the ability to review a company .
neutral	as stated above
neutral	window 0 installed was ifffy .
neutral	had to buy and install a new copy .
neutral	another £_000 on the price ...
neutral	unfortunately my order arrived damaged due to insufficient packing , however orbit quickly rectified the matter and replaced the damaged prints .
neutral	quality of the prints which were a0 is good .
neutral	i found the website easy to navigate and straightforward to use .
neutral	the problem came when i eventually took delivery .
neutral	firstly it took 00 days for the goods to arrive but more_importantly the courier service (@ home ) dumped the boxes in the main hall to my building ( 00 flats in this mansion block ) and left without getting a signature or allowing me to examine the boxes .
neutral	the delivery person had no_idea who might pick these up or even that i had received everything i should .
neutral	delivery should be to my front_door but this was far from the case and it was sheer luck that i happened to find these before someone_else took a fancy to them .
neutral	i am a small woman and i had to drag these very heavy boxes to the lift and then along a hall , through a couple of doors to my front_door .
neutral	it has left me feeling frustrated and unlikely to use this website again because i want and expect delivery to my front_door .
neutral	bought some items on thursday_evening and paid extra for their express service .
neutral	the package was only dispatched on monday and arrived late on tuesday .
neutral	animed excuse is that " express " only counts for the delivery method , not how they process the order before dispatch and it seems 0 days to dispatch is considered ok by them .
neutral	don_'_t be conned into using the express service , it won_'_t be much_quicker_than normal post , at_least then you won_'_t feel slightly ripped_off having wasted money on an " express service " that is anything but express .
neutral	i ordered 0 sliding_door locks .
neutral	i did not require indicator just turn & was advised by the lady on the telephone to mention that when i ordered online which i did .
neutral	however when they arrived , they did so with indicators .
neutral	it was the last job in a big build , so did not have time to return them & get the right ones & hence went_ahead & had them installed .
neutral	the product is excellent & good value for money as similar products were more_expensive elsewhere .
neutral	the packing dept needs to pay more attention to what '_s mentioned on the order .
neutral	i am quite surprised with how uncompetitive contact_lenses are .
neutral	especially , given how competitive the glasses are priced .
neutral	the contact_lenses are not competitive compared to others .
neutral	i am looking at air optix ( day and night ) which select_specs have priced at £_00 , this is compared to lentiamo . co . uk which is almost half the price at £_00 ???
neutral	i do not understand_why .
neutral	decent enough products and prices but always want to upsell you into something extra , then when you have had you order bombard you with e_- mails .
neutral	marketing is on thing overkill another
neutral	when my cards arrived , i was disappointed to find that they needed to be cut down because borders were visible on two sides , even_though they hadn_'_t been visible on the proof .
neutral	also the colours were very dull , despite my sending through a proof that had been created by a company in another country that had produced my first batch of business_cards with the appropriately portrayed bright colours of my business brand .
neutral	these new cards are useable but only just ( when i hand them out i feel i have to apologise for the quality ), and i will now have to find an_alternative provider that can use my material to produced the desired outcome .
neutral	my advice is for people to order small_quantities initially , to see if the quality is up to par , before placing a bigger order .
neutral	i ' m really glad i did that .
neutral	company kept me informed at all_stages .
neutral	i was told my goods had been dispatched and i would receive them within 00_hrs .
neutral	as such i stayed home waiting for the delivery .
neutral	so far , so good .
neutral	it is now 00_hours_later and i still have not received them !
neutral	having phoned homesupply , i was told the goods would , in fact be arriving a day later as i live on isle of wight .
neutral	i suggested someone might have informed me of the fact as they were quick enough to charge me an extra £_00 delivery .
neutral	i was told they weren_'_t aware that it would take an extra day .
neutral	very annoyed at having my time wasted .
neutral	they had managed to find out how much extra it would cost but couldn_'_t find out how long it would take !
neutral	the likelihood is i won_'_t get them for another day or so as the rest of my week is busy and i won_'_t be home for delivery !
neutral	my plumber is waiting .
neutral	my taps are dripping !
neutral	i ' m thinking i should have shopped locally .
neutral	i purchased a panasonic wv - sw000 to replace a fixed bullet camera , on the understanding that this camera did everything my bullet did .
neutral	i primarily wanted it to send me email alerts on motion detection .
neutral	having set the camera up and played with the settings , i found that the camera refused to find my smtp server , regardless of what i did .
neutral	i contacted sales support , who initially were very good .
neutral	after several emails and tests they couldn_'_t get this to work either .
neutral	i ' m now left with £_000 + camera that doesn_'_t do what i purchased it for .
neutral	my contact at networkwebcams eventually stopped emailing me , possibly because i was making noises about a refund ..!
neutral	a good site as long as everything works when you get it !
neutral	i ordered a shower , wash_basin and pedestal and toilet .
neutral	the consignment arrived on the arranged day but the cistern was broke into several pieces .
neutral	i called betterbathrooms who were very apologetic and concerned that there had been damage caused in transit .
neutral	what i am not happy with is that delivery of the replacement cistern follows the normal delivery course , ie about five days .
neutral	this is not acceptable especially if i were to have planned the installation the day after delivery .
neutral	betterbathrooms should prioritise delivery in circumstances akin to this and ensure a next_day delivery .
neutral	i ordered a sony camera which was delivered within the 0 - 0 days advertised which in the end was great .
neutral	however the order tracking_system showed no movement for 0 days and then went to processing on the 0 th day .
neutral	my attempts to call the customer service number on 0 occassions were met with wait times of between 00 and 00_minutes .
neutral	my attempt to email then for an update took 00_hours to receive a reply .
neutral	my assessment is that this company can be great they seem to have the right products but they are overwhelmed with workload .
neutral	they need urgently to improve customer service and perhaps increase their staff numbers .
neutral	failure to so can only result in frustrated customers .
neutral	great prices , website good but could do with better descriptions .
neutral	what lets the side down is the uninformed wait , my order has_been stuck on unfulfilled since i placed it and it is due tomorrow , when i wrote to complain i was told it was in transit from their european hub , well tell me that on the website , all i can assume is that you don_'_t have stock if you do not keep me informed .
neutral	communication is the key !
neutral	i have bought things from this site before and been very happy .
neutral	this time i bought a tank , but it did not arrive on the promised delivery date , friday .
neutral	having waited in all day i emailed them to let them know and to ask if they had any news on my delivery , they emailed back with the courier '_s phone number and the tracking_number and asked me to call the courier direct .
neutral	i really think that this was something they should have done as part of their customer service to me , my transaction was with them after all .
neutral	also , an_apology would have been nice .
neutral	anyway , i called the courier and they said that they had it marked for delivery on monday , and it had never been intended to deliver it on friday .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	having said that , when it did arrive it was extremely well_packaged and the delivery man was happy to lift it over my threshold whereby i could slide it into the house .
neutral	it was also a good price , though i have since seen it cheaper elsewhere .
neutral	0 january_0000
neutral	i actually received a telephone_call from achica the morning after i posted the review below , and complained on their facebook_page .
neutral	the customer service gal rather sheepishly told me that there was no collection arranged for that day , and offered me a few alternative dates , and the item was in fact collected on my chosen date .
neutral	i had also received another ( small ) damaged item when they called , and was told that i would receive a refund and could i please just dispose of it , and sure_enough i received a refund for this item in a couple of days .
neutral	it remains to be seen of course when / whether i will receive my replacement bedside table , but i am now feeling a little more confident than i was previously .
neutral	i did point out to the caller how ridiculous and frustrating it is for customers not to be able to telephone them , and was told that they do not have an incoming line (!)
neutral	but plans are afoot to remedy this in the new year .
neutral	i really hope that this is the case , because for me this issue has spoiled what has otherwise been a positive_experience of shopping with achica
neutral	judi
neutral	00 december_0000
neutral	i have spent a lot of money with this company over the past few_months , and have several orders still pending , and overall was quite happy with the goods and service .
neutral	until one of two bedside_tables i ordered arrived two_weeks_ago damaged , i sent them a message via their customer service desk and received a reply after 0 days offering a refund or replacement ( i wanted a matching pair so opted for replacement ) and asking what day i wanted the damaged item collected , allowing 00_hours notice , i gave a date .
neutral	after that i heard_nothing more , so i waited in on the allotted date in case collection had been arranged , it hadn_'_t .
neutral	since then i have sent several further messages , finally receiving a reply apologising for the delay in replying and asking for another date , which i gave .
neutral	that day is tomorrow , but since i have again received no reply , despite more messages , i don_'_t know whether to stay in again all day or not .
neutral	it is ridiculous that this company has no telephone_number , at the very least it should have ' live_chat ' customer service .
neutral	i am now minded to cancel the rest of my orders because i have lost_faith , and especially since reading the reviews on here .
neutral	not good .
neutral	very reliable , modern clean coaches .
neutral	they do tend to go around the houses on pickup and collection though .
neutral	we waited neatly an_hour before leaving the airport and on return picked us up far too early , for what was a short airport transfer , arriving at the airport 0 0 / 0 hours early - and we only had hand_luggage .
neutral	obviously consolidating flights to extreme
neutral	easily the best price io could find on google and arrived promptly , went back for drontal cat wormers and suddenly - much more_expensive !
neutral	helped sort our queen anne house windows and we now have an appreciably warmer house .
neutral	we were impressed with the after sale service .
neutral	one negative , the doors made for us warped ++ and on balance i would recommend using ventrolla for windows only ; but they are very good at window renovation .
neutral	i used the website and saved money - completed the request for a meercat but it did not arrive .
neutral	why offer this and then not send it .
neutral	my niece keeps asking when her meercat will arrive ........
neutral	i would look somewhere_else if i need to buy stools again .
neutral	go somewhere where c . ustomer needs are taken into considerion .
neutral	product excellent and best i '_ve used but for a new customer who installs gate automation frequently no customer service when requesting technical help and instead just referred me to a rip_off phone line so suffice to say i will spend my 00k a year elsewhere .

neutral	my wife wanted to see boyzone in manchester recently when i tried the official ticket agencies ticket were no_longer on sale , i thought she was going to miss out !
neutral	until i found viagogo , i was a little taken a back when i saw the price of the tickets but i was desperate , ordered the tickets and was charged a significant premium i expected that as it was only a few day before the show and the tickets were very near to the stage .
neutral	i did not expect to have to pay 00 quid for " delivery " as the tickets were sent via_email and i had to print them myself !!!!
neutral	and then a massive service charge pr ticket was also added frustrating but we got to see the show and my wife was very happy however she does not know quite how much i paid yet :)
neutral	i ordered 0 lamp tables which were in stock for next_day delivery , received one but the other didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	i rang very & was told to order another one , as they were looking into where the other one was , as still hadn_'_t arrived a week_later .
neutral	have stayed with villa_plus many_times in the past and always been exceptionally pleased however this time we were disappointed with the cleanliness of the villa .
neutral	upon_arrival the toilets were not clean and there were not enough towels left out .
neutral	contacted the rep who came out immediately with the cleaner who did apologise , however , when cleaner came again midweek she did not change the beds only left clean towels , perhaps different cleaners in each villas have different standards but was not happy with this one .
neutral	the villa itself was superb , large and in an excellent position easy access to beach and town
neutral	we ordered three lightweight aluminium radiators .
neutral	they all arrived in in a condition consistent with having been dropped on one corner , which made them out of line or wonkey .
neutral	the radiators were picked_up and returned , and we ordered 0 different ones , steel and robust .
neutral	there was no ' handle with care ' notice on the outer packaging on the first rads and indeed they were just sliding about on the floor of the couriers panel van .
neutral	the second rads are fine and the e_- mail route to customer_services works well .
neutral	what is poor is trying to ring ~ a minimum of 00_minutes whatever time of day before you get through .
neutral	however staff very helpful
neutral	ordered on 00st august , received 0st sept - very slow service .. however did receive emails to tell me when despatched , and price was reasonable for goods ordered , would be concerned about ordering again if in a hurry for something .
neutral	i ordered two boxes of batteries , and they arrived promptly .
neutral	can '_t say more .
neutral	the delivery of this mattress was scheduled for about 0 - 00days after purchase but on the said date i was called to be informed that the mattress had not arrived at the right depot and delivery was being_investigated and would be informed of developments .
neutral	as a first time buyer from this company i found this most disappointing and it is not an experience i will want to ever repeat .
neutral	it took another week before they resolved the issues and the mattress was delivered .
neutral	the mattress is good quality and good value for the price however for a product urgently_needed and delivered disappointingly late made the whole_experience stressful , inefficient and bad customer service .
neutral	have used play a few_times and found them good in the past , however :
neutral	play are now forwarding purchasers and their credit_card_details to a dubious ' complete savings ' discount scheme which costs £_00 per_month .
neutral	it isn_'_t clear in the first place that they are getting your £_00 subscription and they are clearly hoping you won_'_t notice as it looks_like you ' re signing_up to a ' next purchase ' £_00 off play coupon .
neutral	disassociate yourselves with this form of selling play . com or you will loose the trust of a great deal of customers .
neutral	if the page was headed with the cost and reason for it that would not be so bad .
neutral	personally i wouldn_'_t want to do_business with this type of deal which is very close to a scam .
neutral	this seems to be a common problem .
neutral	ordered an o ' neill shortie on 00th_july .
neutral	arrived a few_days_later , they had sent the wrong_colour .
neutral	so i phoned to tell them & they said they ' d send me a pre_- paid returns bag .
neutral	when this arrived , i sent the shortie back , only to have my replacement arrive yesterday 00th_july , which was a ripcurl shortie !
neutral	not the o ' neill shortie which i had originally ordered .
neutral	a scribbled note inside the parcel said the o ' neill shortie was out of stock so they sent this instead !
neutral	how about phoning me to see if i want this one ??
neutral	how annoying .....
neutral	hi at the moment i am on a dmp and enquired_about an iva .
neutral	i was contacted by sarah who was excellent in explaining an iva to me , but decided at this moment in time it was not in my best interest to have an iva and i am satisfied with carrying on with my dmp .
neutral	i phoned payplan to explain this and sent an_email to my advisor explaining the position and now they are trying to persuade me that an iva is to my advantage .
neutral	as i am only in the preliminary stage and haven_'_t signed anything , it is up to me if i want to go_ahead .
neutral	please can you sort this out for me as the iva team keep ringing me when i already told my advisor that i don_'_t want one , and asked him inform them .
neutral	many_thanks .
neutral	the process was all fine , no_complaints at all about that .
neutral	£_00 was a bit_steep to make a change to the booking though .
neutral	this company are repeatedly blocking negative_reviews about them for the same reason .
neutral	there is no coarse or abusive language in my review .
neutral	it is factual , relevant and truthful .
neutral	if you continue to support this company being allowed to block its reviews consumers will lose confidence in you
neutral	we are remote and so drivers have problems finding us and we are still_waiting for crates left by mistake last time we had a delivery to be collected .
neutral	i was verry happy with the service , and i am happy with the good '_s that i have brought and delivery was quick i have recomended you to my brother who will also be looking at your site .
neutral	thank_you

neutral	i ordered the slide and it finally arrived - it took 0 days instead of the advertised 0 .
neutral	that was not a problem but their lack of communication was and no apologies for the poor communication either .
neutral	however the slide is very sturdy and my grandson just loves it and now my daughter is going to buy one to replace the flimsy slide that came with a climbing fame .
neutral	the booklet was smaller and flimsier than_expected and the colours weren_'_t very good .
neutral	delivery was fast .
neutral	headline price is great , but includes next to no insurance_cover .
neutral	so , guess_what ?
neutral	they go heavy on selling you a cover upgrade .
neutral	having to wait a day for a collection is a pain and surprisingly slow , i don_'_t know why this is the case ?
neutral	it '_s a useful option for the occasional parcel though and i like the ability to see the different carriers options and rates .
neutral	purchased a small item which i could keep track of my purchase .
neutral	took 0 days to pick & post & 0 days to deliver .
neutral	i would expect the 0 days delivery as it was bought with free delivery , but could do better with the dispatch !
neutral	took 0 working_days to post out my order but it '_s getting close to christmas so expect company '_s to be busy .
neutral	good product and no hassle with ordering .
neutral	bought a brand_new antara 0x0 from grantham branch , so pleased with it but i paid for a maintenance plan , have requested it every week for 0 weeks still_haven_'_t got it .
neutral	they just keep fobbing me off .
neutral	not sure what to do as this wasn_'_t cheap and i need this plan for servicing etc ..
neutral	they advertised a talon 00 m / l rucksack as being in stock .
neutral	i called them to find out when they would dispatch my order .
neutral	i was told they did not have it in stock in their warehouse and would have to source it elsewhere .
neutral	i am very upset and distressed by this experience of buying online at tauntonleisure .
neutral	i have not had a good run on the slots or bingo but have noticed that a lot of the same people win how can some people be so lucky and some so unlucky
neutral	express delivery slower_than they say
neutral	ok so cw can offer deals you wont find direct from your network_provider ..
neutral	but make_sure you read all the small_print and go back to them within 0 days days if you have an account query
neutral	if you get a great deal buying a phone and contract dont assume you will get the same quality of service when it comes to fixing a faulty or damaged phone .
neutral	several_times cws own repair department has said phones we have taken back have had water_damage .
neutral	which was never true .
neutral	one time they sent back a photo of the inside of the phone , but when we sent the phone to another repairer they took another photo which prooved the photo cw had supplied was not of my phone .
neutral	if you ever need a repair insist the phone is sent back to the manufacturer and not cw own repair_centre .
neutral	they will try to put you off by saying it can take 0 months sending it to the manufacturer .
neutral	but from my experince it normally comes back between 0 - 00 days
neutral	i ordered a swimming costume in plenty of time for my holiday .
neutral	it actually arrived after i had left for the holiday .
neutral	i ' m_sure simplyswim were not at fault but delivery depends on the royal_mail and they are the weak link .
neutral	not as good as it used to be , from personal experience the site is going downhill fast and little is done to protect buyers . i find a lot of time wasters you buy something and never receive it as the seller never put a reserve on their item and are not happy to let it go at the price you won it at , but they tell you they have posted it and then happily refund your money which they have had for a week or so hence no item and a wasted experience which is so regular .
neutral	also had issues with receiving items not as_described and damaged .
neutral	these are personal experiences , make your_own mind up .
neutral	prices charged are very competitive bearing in mind the delivery timescales .
neutral	unfortunately the collection point i used in aberdeen has_become a post_office and ceased to deal with collectplus .
neutral	there is a serious lack of collection points where you can park near in aberdeen , or if you can park , you have to pay for parking .
neutral	it is ok if you have a light and small parcel that is easy to carry some distance , but not for heavier parcels .
neutral	delivery & collections are really easy to book , but that can give a false sense of security .
neutral	some of their appointed couriers ( esp .
neutral	y * del ) sometimes text to say they have attempted to collect but no attempt has_been made !
neutral	sometimes the parcel0go tracking reference will not work .
neutral	the p0g customer service reps are helpful via the livechat function on the p0g website , and the problem gets resolved in due course , but the business could be conducted in 0 / 0 of the time if it was possible to speak direct by phone !!
neutral	so , overall a mixed experience , but the prices are competitive .
neutral	you get what you pay for / deserve , i suppose !
neutral	0 -)
neutral	i ordered a kindle_cover and was sent the wrong item , i emailed bmc to try to arrange to send it back , they did not email me back to arrange return of the goods , i paid postage to return the item which they did then replace with the correct item but with no word of apology .
neutral	a disappointing experience
neutral	we ordered by telephone after looking at the website and receiving some leather samples .
neutral	it took a few_days to receive an acknowledgment of order by email ( infact i had to telephone to ask where it was ).
neutral	about 0 weeks_later i received an_email to inform me that the goods were ready and that a member of the sales_team would telephone to advise me of the delivery date and collect the balance ( 00 %) of money due .
neutral	after hearing nothing from them after a week , i again rang them .
neutral	i was informed that they could not give me a delivery date until they received full payment , to which i replied that surely they can give a date and then i would happily pay .
neutral	there seemed to be a bit of a stand off situation here .
neutral	anyway later that day they rang back and gave me a date that my 0 seat sofa bed and armchair would would be delivered , but it might actually be sooner .
neutral	a few_days_later a very pleasant chap rang me from the carrier ( edmundson & son ) and gave me a day and time_slot for my delivery .
neutral	the goods were delivered at the time stated by 0 very helpful gentlemen .
neutral	the lancaster sofa bed and armchair are well made and the leather is of excellent quality and i am sure will last for many_years to come .
neutral	unfortunately the whole_experience was let_down by slow communication and rather unfriendly sales staff .
neutral	i like the choice of games , especially the ones like pixies of the forest that explode and let more fall for an other chance to win .
neutral	however i know it '_s gambling , but i think the bonuses should come up a bit more often , and if you are staking 00p a spin when you get a win say three in a row it should be more than 0p .
neutral	other_sites that i play on are a bit fairer with the bonuses .
neutral	i wanted to buy a new rc car kit for my grandson but the site was so slow i was unable to look for an upgrade kit / accessories as these would not load .
neutral	as a result i only ordered the condor kit - order no .
neutral	000000000 .
neutral	have just received my first top_cashback as amazon_vouchers , which is great and the positive thing about topcashback .
neutral	however , i bought furniture from m & s ( spent a lot !)
neutral	in november ( nearly 0 months_ago ) and i ' m still_waiting to be credited with the money which is disappointing ( have had to raise a missing claim and it takes_ages , don_'_t ask me why ).
neutral	you also have to be careful of the caveats .
neutral	i have booked a lot of hotels through hotels . com but haven_'_t had a penny back yet .
neutral	apparently , hotels . com only give cashback at full price but the whole point of hotels . com is that their prices are discounted !
neutral	this looks_like a catch 00 situation !
neutral	topcashback , you should drop hotels . com if they only pretend to offer cashback .
neutral	ordered and paid for a joby gorillapod on 0th_september .
neutral	e_- mail said that further details would follow within 0 working_days .
neutral	heard_nothing so wrote to nicecans . co . uk on 00th .
neutral	they responded on thursday 00th_september saying item had dispatched .
neutral	a week passed and having_read other reviews was beginning to suspect that the order would never arrive .
neutral	wrote to nicecans on wednesday 00st telling them i would report them to trading_standards and police if item had not arrived by saturday 00th .
neutral	received e_- mail out of the blue from nicecans on wednesday 00th ensuring me that they are not fraudulent and that item would be resent to arrive by " next weekend ".
neutral	have written back on 00th asking them what they mean by " next weekend ".
neutral	they have asked me to remove or change the review " once it arrives ".
neutral	their confidence that i will receive anything is much greater than mine .
neutral	i await delivery with bated breath ...
neutral	well what do you know , i received not one , but two tripods on 0th_october a month after my order .
neutral	the items are genuine joby products .
neutral	nicecans were £_00 cheaper_than the next best online and £_00 cheaper_than high_street price .
neutral	but order has caused me a lot of time and stress , so not sure the £_00 saved was worth it .
neutral	nicecans - you really need to get your distribution , delivery and customer communication sorted .
neutral	offer a range of postage options which are more secure and reliable than royal_mail - you can_afford to do this if you are significantly_cheaper .
neutral	and if products are going to turn_up late then tell your customers before they start searching for review_sites .
neutral	you said you would update me within 0 working_days and you didn_'_t - that '_s when i went looking for answers .
neutral	as a result , i have posted on these sites which has not helped your reputation .
neutral	i like very much buying from littlewoods but they tend to put to much interest on some items and you end up paying top price for a lot of items .
neutral	wanted to purchase a bose helicopter headset at £_000 , despite the sale being available neither the straight or coiled lead version was available .
neutral	they did have the shirts i required though .
neutral	purchased the headset from a competitor .
neutral	rc enthusiasts need good back up and spares support .
neutral	it is difficult to find what is needed for shengqi hummer spares e . g .
neutral	item z00 means nothing when there is no picture , description or diagram .
neutral	the diagram supplied by shengqi has no z part numbers on it !!
neutral	the entire spare support system for the hummer is a mess - i cannot vouch for other models .
neutral	checking out is not easy either .
neutral	yet again ( 0rd time ) i had to register all my details when i know they should be present as i have ordered parts several_times from nitrotek before .
neutral	it would seem their database is not maintained properly .
neutral	definitely room for website improvement .
neutral	regards

neutral	order no :_000000000
neutral	cr000 arrived today & the box was really battered i appreciate u guys dont have any control over the goons who deliver or process the orders once out of your hands but i feel if u was to protect the more fragile products with foam it would counteract the dumbasses the lid appears to be ok but the bag has a hole in it from what ever was squashing it in delivery !
neutral	also no spare screw fixings in the box every helmet ive purchased before has spare screws for the visor , apart_from that im happy as it was a good price lid in the sale with speedy processing & delivery
neutral	i ordered some stuff almost a month_ago .
neutral	do not buy technology from them , because if it does not work , you will have to ship it back and will cost you a fortune .
neutral	just buy mobile_phone covers and stuff that don_'_t break that easily .
neutral	all i wanted was a couple of pairs of totes sox , but felt as if i was trying to buy the crown jewels !
neutral	why should i have to provide my email address or my phone number ?
neutral	there should be an option offered for how you ' d like to be contacted in the event of anything going wrong !
neutral	i ts a shame that the finish is rough because otherwise it would have been a great picture .
neutral	i will be contacting pronterpix about it
neutral	asked what height the units were , i was advised approximately 000mm , i replied_saying if it was more than 00mm it would not fit , the response was that it was approximately 00 - 00mm .
neutral	when it arrived .
neutral	printed on the box was the dimensions 00mm wide x 00mm high .
neutral	if i had had this information it could have been purchased else where .
neutral	cheaper ...
neutral	the items were satisfactory and were delivered quickly .
neutral	i place an order for a 000 ultra plus car battery paying a small_amount extra for as clearly_stated on the web_page as a 0 year_warranty , and so my 000 ultra plus battery order was confirmed by alpha_batteries .
neutral	great ..
neutral	the online my dashboard status showed my order as ' processing ' which continued till after the battery had been delivered next_day , no email was sent confirming delivery or tracking available as mentioned in the delivery information of the web_page , although i received a mobile text stating a delivery eta while the battery was actually being delivered .
neutral	the battery was received but was found to be a 000 katana brand ?
neutral	with only has a 0 year_warranty , a copy of my invoice was enclosed stating ultra plus type 000car battery - 0 year_warranty .
neutral	no mention from alpha_batteries why i had something different from what i asked for !
neutral	what will happen if i ' m unlucky in the future to have to claim under the warranty and my invoice states something_else i don_'_t know .
neutral	so am i a happy customer no , will use this company again no .
neutral	cheapest by far , but needed the items in a hurry and there was nothing to indicate that there would be a hold up .
neutral	several days_later , they eventually turn_up .
neutral	if they had emailed to indicate that there would have been a delay , i could have cancelled the order and purchased elsewhere .
neutral	this is a good website for finding deals and offers that you would never had known about .
neutral	the only problem is that the site is very untidy and cluttered .
neutral	it can sometimes be difficult to find what you are looking for .
neutral	evans feels a little out of touch .
neutral	they have tried updating their styles , but to be honest ; most of it looks tiresome and dreary .
neutral	the staff are always friendly and quick to help if you need it and the website is easy to navigate .
neutral	it is just a shame that a majority of the clothes are not modern enough .
neutral	we have a new aldi right next to our local tesco now , so i thought i would give it a try .
neutral	a lot of the food is very good value and a lot_cheaper , especially essentials like milk , bread and sugar .
neutral	the staff are a bit miserable looking though , so they need a bit of training on the customer service side .
neutral	overall , good value for the basics .
neutral	this year was the first time i used easy jet .
neutral	i chose it because of the cost .
neutral	very good value overall .
neutral	the cabin_crew are very polite and friendly .
neutral	i am glad it was only a short trip though , as they do squeeze a lot of seats on one plane , so it was a tight fit .
neutral	i used to buy from river_island a lot .
neutral	now though , i find that a lot of their cloths look tacky and are not made as well as they used to be .
neutral	i hardly_ever buy from there now , i always pop in for a browse but seem to come out empty handed and disappointed .
neutral	a lovely looking blind .
neutral	well_constructed but i am disappointed with the quality .
neutral	having paid £_00 + for it .
neutral	had been with them for many_years , but now they are beyond a joke , always increasing there prices , what for ? more repeats & tell them your leaving well in advance & they try all ways to hit you with extra billing , but thank heaven for good solicitors , for if i get another letter requsting payment for something_else , that is who will be handling it so sky subscribers bewar of what could happen to you if you decide to leave , my advice is always copy any correspondence from day 0 & always keep a diary of who you spoke to , time & date ,& what coversation was about so watch this space over the next couple of weeks ?
neutral	advertised my tickets for mrs browns boys and got them sold , great but still have not received payment for said tickets .
neutral	told it would take 0 to 0 days for payment , now been 00 days .
neutral	when will payment be made . my transaction / listing id is 0000000
neutral	these tickets were sent by royal_mail recorded delivery
neutral	barcode no au000000000gb
neutral	i '_ve used medic_animal for a while now - recommending them to friends and always having great service - but recently i '_ve had a few minor problems .
neutral	my last order came very promptly , but when i opened the box it contained one item i had ordered and another i hadn_'_t :( i contacted the helpline and it was resolved quickly with my remaining correct item arriving within a couple of days .
neutral	however , i am still_waiting for the incorrect item to be collected , despite_being given two dates , the courier is still not here 0 weeks after :(((((
neutral	first time i '_ve used pet_supermarket and i was impressed by the pricing of the prescription hills cat_food and the tetra pond fish_food .
neutral	order was placed quickly and easily on line .
neutral	no_problems .
neutral	however , i had to wait_until 0 days after i placed my order for the goods to arrive .
neutral	yodel the delivery agent was very poor , communication misleading and inaccurate .
neutral	when i reported this to pet_supermarket they promptly tried to resolve it for me and apparently it was due to a vehicle breakdown - however , the breakdown was 0 days after yodel said it was " out for delivery " to me .
neutral	sadly , it would put me off ordering with pet_supermarket again , i can '_t afford to sit in day after day for my goods to arrive .
neutral	however , i would say pet_supermarket is efficient and professional .
neutral	shame about your delivery partner :(
neutral	i ordered a laptop battery on february 00st 0000 and it arrived on march 00th .
neutral	it fits and seems to work fine .
neutral	i was taken in by the website which tries very hard to appear it is a uk_based company but it is in fact china or singapore based .
neutral	don_'_t be tempted if you are in a hurry but if time is not imprtant ordering from this company represents good value .
neutral	nice bunch of flowers .
neutral	not really as many as i would have liked for the money .
neutral	wouldnt have called it a bouquet .
neutral	they also only lasted 0 days , which was just over the christmas_period .
neutral	does not smell like the perfume i tried in the shops , box sealed so cannot understand_why it smells different .
neutral	definately not as nice
neutral	i chose from popular items so everything was in stock for delivery but it cost me over a fiver and the order from thursday didn_'_t get processed until the following_tuesday so was best part of a week before i got the goods .
neutral	pretty poor as there are many competitors offering free next_day delivery above a certain order value .
neutral	in response to the reply form tooledup below , i thought i had placed my order on the thurs .
neutral	having checked , it was actually fri . also , i thought i had selected items for 00 - 00hr despatch so appologies for this .
neutral	i have looked again at the website and i can '_t find anywhere that indicates the size of order to quailfy for free_p_&_p .
neutral	i think delivery charges could be made clearer .
neutral	i ordered some sale items but the sizing was completely random .. i could not even get a couple of things on yet others were huge .
neutral	gave up with all sadly and had to return them .
neutral	boohoo need to get their sizing more " uniform " as it has put me off ordering again
neutral	ordered some spoton flea_treatment the first order did not turn_up !
neutral	had to contact them twice more before they sent out another order .
neutral	this one i got some days_later .
neutral	took about three_weeks before i got my order .
neutral	don_'_t think it was there fault was a problem with the post , but still most inconvenient !
neutral	had trouble on the phone it took 0 calls to get an answer and at 0 am with 0 kids didnt need the hastle . also didnt expect to need a £ 0 coin to get out of the car_park after paying £_000 for our two cars
neutral	having written a bad review due to a very sub_standard bouquet , containing roses that were dying , i now have to write another review because i '_ve had a replacement .
neutral	i complained to prestige_flowers and had to send a couple of photo '_s .
neutral	several emails later , they agreed to send me a replacement , which arrived today .
neutral	i was amazed to find my new bouquet was slightly_larger , with more of a variety of blooms , all of which were crisp and fresh .
neutral	my son ordered the original for mothers_day , from where he lives in new_york .
neutral	eventually i did tell him the bouquet was poor and sent him a photo of the dying flowers , warning him not to use the site again .
neutral	today though , i '_ve been able to send him a photo of the replacement bouquet and he commented saying ' that '_s more like it and it '_s identical to the one i chose online '.
neutral	it '_s a shame they couldn_'_t have got it right in the first place , although better late than never i guess .
neutral	i wanted to get a new " help for heroes ", which is a charity , bracelet and found one on their site .
neutral	the cost of the bracelet was very acceptable ( presuming that all goes to the charity ) but the postage and packing was more than the bracelet !!
neutral	!
neutral	have had no_problems with the goods or purchase process from this company and previous purchases have arrived_safely .
neutral	although the free delivery is understandably not speedy !
neutral	on this occasion the courier yodel left the parcel with a neighbours delivery and didn_'_t leave me a card to tell me where it was which leads me to suspect they didn_'_t even realise there were 0 different addresses involved .
neutral	said neighbour is unwell and didn_'_t realise until the day after that one of the parcels was mine and had to hobble over with it .
neutral	meanwhile i had checked the tracking and sent off emails to yodel and ps asking where it was .
neutral	obviously not petsupermarkets fault but a follow_up to yodel is in order .
neutral	we didn_'_t like easy jet very much .
neutral	the flight was fine and the staff courteous and friendly .
neutral	however , we did not like not being allocated to a seat and having to stand in the queu prior to boarding to enable getting a seat together and not too far towards the back where it can be cold .
neutral	unless you pay for priority boarding ( extra on top of your flight ) you have top stand in the queu for ages and as i am a pensioner can not stand for long_periods of time due to an ailment .
neutral	come on easy jet why can '_t you be like every other airline and enable your customers to be able to get an allocated seat .
neutral	i purchased a complete bathroom_suite .
neutral	the shower does not work , better_bathrooms customer service advisors will only tell you to call the supplier of the product , they will not replace any appliances that do not work !
neutral	even_though they are brand_new .
neutral	also if you order an item which is unsuitable for any reason and you want to return , they you can do so but only at your_own cost and even then if you have purchased in store they wont refund , they will only give you a credit_note !!!
neutral	the showroom is on the same road as i live but i cannot return to the showroom .
neutral	i have to say the quality is good on the products that i ordered but without being_able to change or send back then i would think_twice before placing orders with them .
neutral	not the best flying experience . went with a group to spain , flight was overbooked and even managed to separate a 0 year_old child and her grand parents !!!
neutral	not good .
neutral	i thought the points would come within the 00_minutes as stated in the website but have waited nearly an_hour and still_waiting :(
neutral	i have a very impatient teenager waiting for his points and when he thinks 00mins and its longer its a pain - think they really need to say email delivery and state a realistic timescale .
neutral	i have just purchased 0 bow ties which are of great quality for a reasonable price .
neutral	i would have purchased the dress_shirts , but found it hard to see how they looked close up .
neutral	the only thing is you couldn_'_t get a good view of the buttons etc .
neutral	i would definitely go back as a customer .
neutral	karen hardicre
neutral	you know the items are 00_% over priced compared to other shops , but the quality is good .
neutral	we bought a coffee_machine last month from there , great custiomer service .
neutral	opinion on the booking / communication process only .
neutral	travelling to belfast and booking through direct_ferries / stena on the internet .
neutral	my wife & i are profoundly deaf and tried to insert our mobile numbers and inform that any contact by mobile will have to be by text only as we cannot hear or use a voice / " normal " phone .... nae such luck !!
neutral	... just another instance of lack of consideration / thoughtlessness ...
neutral	0 days to work out item description mistake , and one book became out of stock !
neutral	all customer service rapresentative rarely got into the depth of the problem , c - s who was due to contact me with more info did not and had to write again .
neutral	i was given wrong - partial info .
neutral	call back i received c - s hanged the phone leaving me on line like an_idiot .
neutral	c - s seems helpful sometimes or is nice but perhaps c - s is too_busy but then amazon should get more people or each c - s should follow specific cases rather_than reply to whatever comes at hand .
neutral	hi
neutral	i have a review i raised .
neutral	you have sent an_email to say it is published - but it is not published it is still under review !
neutral	booked the water wheel apartment in charlestown through blue_chip on the recommendation of a friend .
neutral	blue_chip thoroughly lived_up to their reputation and were extremely_helpful even when we had to change our booking due to a long - awaited hospital appointment .
neutral	the apartment was immaculate when we arrived and was as_described in the specification .
neutral	a vase of flowers and cornish " goodies " were provided , as were plenty of toilet rolls , towels , tea , coffee , etc_., although only two tea towels and it was a good job we brought our own bin bags !
neutral	the beds were lovely and comfortable .
neutral	the information file was very helpful for anyone planning to do a lot of walking , cycling , etc_., although not for us as my husband has a progressive neurological illness and is disabled ( one of the reasons for choosing this ground_floor flat with parking close by ).
neutral	there was very little information about operating the tv , dvd_player etc and we had to work this out for ourselves .
neutral	although charlestown is described as " unspoilt by development ", the apartment was surrounded by new developments and there was actually a very noisy building site right next door , where a massive building was going up !!
neutral	our landlandy did mention building noise on the phone the previous week but we had no_idea of the extent of this - it didn_'_t worry us too much because we were out for most of each day when the work was going on but would have made life difficult for anyone with small children needing daytime naps , etc .
neutral	we arrived on saturday and didn_'_t hear from our landlady until she arrived unannounced and rang the doorbell at 00 . 00 am on monday_morning ( just when i was enjoying a shower following a long " lie in " and thinking it how lovely it was to be able to do so without_any disturbances !!).
neutral	she eventually returned one evening , again unannounced , but clearly didn_'_t want to hang_around and chat , apart_from drawing our attention to the fact that , if we wanted to come again , we could book directly through her and not blue_chip , which would save us ( and presumably her ) money !!
neutral	she even put a pile of her cards in the apartment .
neutral	my husband '_s disability means that we had to bring a lot of medical equipment and also makes him very slow - moving .
neutral	explaining this and the fact that packing up is a lengthy task , i asked whether there was any flexibility in the 00 . 00 checkout ( something which has not been a problem with previous holiday and hotel bookings ).
neutral	this was not well - received but there was grudging agreement , provided it was as soon as possible after 00 .
neutral	in fact , the car was all packed up ( apart_from a small shoulder bag ) before 00 but my husband was having a particularly bad day and was not quite ready ( and needed to go to the loo before he could leave ).
neutral	i had taken pains to leave the apartment as tidy as we found it to facilitate cleaning etc .
neutral	landlady and husband arrived at about 00 . 00 and were clearly very irritated that we were still there .
neutral	they told us that they needed 0 hours to clean ( i doubt that ) and let it slip that they were " going on holiday too " ( no doubt the real reason for their anxiety ).
neutral	we told them that they were welcome to come in and make a start because the rooms were all clear .
neutral	they were absolutely frosty towards us , despite the fact that my poor husband was clearly not at all well .
neutral	so , although were were very pleased with the apartment itself ( despite the awful building noise ) and had thought about returning next year , we shall go_elsewhere , although we will probably use blue_chip again .
neutral	ok , rules are rules and people have timetables to work to , but it would have been perfectly possible for them to carry on with their work as soon as they arrived - the rooms were cleared - their complete absence of flexibility and lack of compassion left a sour_taste at the end of what was otherwise a lovely holiday !
neutral	so , yes bluechip are excellent , charlestown harbour etc .
neutral	are lovely ( but masses of new development up the hill , where many of the apartments are located ), but our welcome was less_than warm !
neutral	i was interested to read other reviews where people with disabilities have experienced problems and must draw attention to the fact that disability legislation in this country calls for " better_than equal treatment "!
neutral	!
neutral	failed to deliver in timescale specified , following email of complaint the owner rang me direct to apologise and explain_why on this occasion they have let me down .
neutral	i am satisfied with his explanation and to his credit he obviously takes customer_care seriously and gives the impression he genuinely does care .
neutral	as i run my photo '_s through photoshop i didn_'_t really require the auto enhance , but couldn_'_t see how to turn it off .
neutral	when the prints arrived they are too saturated and unnatural , i would try reordering without the auto enhance - if i could see where to disable it !
neutral	in every other respect i was pleased , easy upload , quick delivery etc .
neutral	found the products and prices really good only problem i had was with the delivery , arranged a delivery date before going on holiday only to find i had to wait another week before my order arrived .
neutral	thought this might just have been a one off , placed another small order over a week ago and iam still_waiting ........
neutral	fine if you know your exact size and can purchase a pair of shoes without having to go through the nightmare of a return !
neutral	communication after return request slow and tedious and the logistics of the return just terrible .
neutral	basically if you are unemployed oe retired with nothing to do except sit at home waiting from 0 . am to 0pm for a pick_up by parcelforce , then you won_'_t have too much of a problem !
neutral	i use ebay a lot , it '_s great to buy , but hellish expensive to sell .
neutral	for this reason i now tend to sell in local freeads or gumtree , as once you '_ve paid listing fees , selling fees , paypal fees - well you ' re hardly left with enough to stick in your ear so to speak .
neutral	don_'_t get me wrong , you can get great bargains .
neutral	which is great for you .
neutral	just not so good for the poor seller .
neutral	so don_'_t be a seller on ebay - be a buyer :)
neutral	ebay has improved its sales conditions for sellers , still needs to curb over charging for postage !
neutral	you take your risk when buying from ebay .
neutral	but a good shopping expierance on the whole .
neutral	i bought a mobile dvd_player and it looked fantastic .
neutral	it seemed to have everything i required - however it was all french !
neutral	the booklet was in french and no english translation .
neutral	also the dvd_player on set - up was in french and when i tried to use the button to change to english settings it did not work .
neutral	therefore i had to send it back which was an irritation and disappointment .
neutral	however customer_services were great and i returned the product with no hassle .
neutral	they refunded me partly - and i did have to phone and ask for the refund of postage as the item was faulty , and i received this immediately as they said it was an oversight by the warehouse staff .
neutral	so all in all was positive and would not be afraid to buy from them again .
neutral	in fact i have purchased from them before and had no_problems with the item that time .
neutral	i have used carhire_0000 before but both time have been hit with hidden_extras , by this i mean essentials that should be inlcuded in the price like breakdown cover etc .
neutral	although the service was superb i would look to see if there was a more inclusive package so that i am able to budget accordingly in the future .
neutral	i change my rating as i have been refunded , some misunderstanding .
neutral	but can '_t give more than three stars after this experience .
neutral	scares me as a friend has booked us a holiday for nearly_£_000 !
neutral	will we end up losing money if the travel company stops replying ?
neutral	sorry to say the flowers were not as good quality as they normally are .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	to actually make a booking , the autoglass website offered an_appointment three days_later .
neutral	seeing as though i needed the windscreen repaired sooner i thought i ' d give the phone line a go .
neutral	what a joke !
neutral	the earliest they could offer was 0 days_later , ' due to the floods '.
neutral	this was in april_0000 for goodness_sake , in hertfordshire ( we had no floods !!!)
neutral	i was also informed that the website was misleading as the slot shown is only a ' request ' slot and in reality was always wrong and therefore the customer service team would always reschedule the appointment .
neutral	so , 0 days_later the engineer arrived within one hour towards the end of the agreed 0 hour time_slot ( 0pm to 0pm .)
neutral	he explainded what work needed to be done and was very efficient and 00_minutes later the job was done .
neutral	i was invited to check the work , it looked good and so i signed it off .
neutral	my mistake , i should have looked closely at the seal inside and out .
neutral	later that evening , when i sat in the drivers seat , i noticed a bulge of sealent at eye level on the driver '_s side pillar .
neutral	so i looked a little further and then noticed the sealant had splurged out between the interior pillar trim and windscreen .
neutral	it looks cr @ p . it actually looked like a job i had once done when resealling with sillicone sealer around my bath !
neutral	then , adjusting the drivers mirror for my position , i couldn_'_t !
neutral	the camera and rain sensor surround wasn_'_t flush with the windscreen ( as it were befor ehte replacement ) and so the mirror couldn_'_t be angled correctly .
neutral	d ' oh !
neutral	so i '_ve now had to book a ' warrant ' call out .
neutral	i submitted an order of medicine for my cat , and before i placed the order was told i would need a prescription , which i had .
neutral	order was placed and then i heard_nothing about submitting the prescription so i waited for delivery .
neutral	when it still hadn_'_t arrived three days_later i tried_calling , but the offices were closed at 0 .
neutral	i emailed and did get a very quick reply stating they were waiting for the prescription and included the address where i should send it to .
neutral	i sent it first_class that day , since my cat was almost out of medicine .
neutral	i received it 0 days_later .
neutral	they had tried to deliver it the day before ( monday ) but since it was attempted at 0 : 00 and it was my work address there was no one there .
neutral	this was supposed to be frozen so by the time i got it the next_day , it was not .
neutral	it was wrapped in a cool pack , which was no_longer cool .
neutral	they likely posted it on saturday if the first attempt was on monday , so there is no way it would be cold .
neutral	i am giving three stars because the product was as_described , and the email reply was very quick , but i am disappointed with the rest of the process .
neutral	it '_s fab that you have a plus size category but more size 00 '_s pleasseeee
neutral	i have only used ryanair once and the experience was passable .
neutral	everything about them seems cheap except their relentless attempts to squeeze more money for anything not on their small list of inclusions .
neutral	the flight was ok , service was basic and the staff were ' there ' ( just ).
neutral	i guess you get what you pay for , but there are other better budget alternatives .
neutral	i have been with talk_talk ( previously as a tiscali customer ) for years .
neutral	they can be quite competitive but the quality of service varies widely .
neutral	slow access and drop - outs are common particularly during busy_periods .
neutral	support can be long_winded and pricey .
neutral	constant hassle from their sales teams about upgrades and new contracts ( they don_'_t like to let go ) are infuriating .
neutral	recommended with reservations .
neutral	i had some pans bought me for an engagement present .
neutral	they were exclusive to debenhams .
neutral	they don work on my hob , so i took them back to exchang for some that do .
neutral	they wanted proof of purchase !
neutral	for unopened , exclusive to them products , that i just wanted to swap .
neutral	its ok .
neutral	i am seriously_considering going to another supplier though .
neutral	i have just had a second box fitted and they insisted it be fitted to a telephone line .
neutral	but i don_'_t really see why ?
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a very expensive laptop from alienware about 0 years_ago , which in all honestly did exactly as it was supposed to , i was informed of it '_s progress every_step of the way ( build phase , packaging phase , shipping phase ) and it all went rather smoothly .
neutral	customer service was great too , replied to email same or next_day and were generally pretty helpful .
neutral	however the site is now a dell computers site and i never have nor never would order from dell due to the horror_stories i '_ve heard about them .
neutral	so today i ' m really not sure at all if i would order from alienware again ...
neutral	the new site compared to the old one is awful , i tried finding a page for alienware replacement parts and kept getting redirected to the same , unrelated page .
neutral	i '_ve normally had nothing but good experiences with amazon but i ' m concerned who i ' m receiving my goods from nowadays .
neutral	some of the companies who sell through amazon have poor looking websites themselves and don ; t carry the same trust that amazon themselves have built up over time yet we ' re almost led to believe we ' re still receiving the same quality of service ...
neutral	i also still find the site to be a little old fasioned as far as looks are concerned .
neutral	so far only ordered the tyres and tracking .
neutral	easy to do , good choice of tyres .
neutral	other_places only had 0 choice for the size i wanted .
neutral	despite checking the box for tracking the website refuses to add it to the invoice .
neutral	have emailed national about this before but got no response .
neutral	remains to be seen how well the fitting experiance goes .
neutral	used easy jet now and again , personally prefer jet_0 because they ' re cheaper and better .
neutral	never had any_problems with either .
neutral	but low on leg_room now and again but who can complain ?
neutral	some years_ago argos would be the only store you needed to go to as you knew that the prices were low , you got treated well by staff , returns were no problem and they had a massive_range to choose from .
neutral	unfortunately the last statement is the only one that has_been maintained and in fact improved upon .
neutral	prices are now at the best so so , the staff seem to think of customers as a burden to be shrugged off at the earliest_opportunity and returns are made to be very difficult even_though they often replace the item you have ordered with a ' similar ' item the brand_name of which you have never_heard .
neutral	come on argos , you still have a massive following , dont do what marks & spencer did some years_ago , it takes a long time to get your name back once the usually meek customer turns and walks away .
neutral	i would like to review this company , but dont want to be even more bullied and intimidated , and have what few of my rights are left taken away .
neutral	oops i have said too much , i can almost hear the memo '_s being typed
neutral	i will keep this brief with a list of for and against
neutral	for - very fast broadband ( at a price )
neutral	- never had a landline problem ( but pricey )
neutral	against - expensive
neutral	- foreign call_centres that dont know what they are doing and
neutral	you cant understand what they are saying .
neutral	- wildly frustrating experience if you try to sort_out a problem
neutral	- expensive .
neutral	- poor response from set top box
neutral	- did i mention it is expensive ?
neutral	but all said , it is difficult for me to go_elsewhere as i need very fast
neutral	broadband .
neutral	arrived eventually caused problems but it was valentines_day .
neutral	only seen a picture of flowers but look good ,
neutral	flew in from istanbul .
neutral	no one from sarpedon travel firm twigged this would be at the domestic arrivals .
neutral	had to pay for taxi to international terminal .
neutral	when i booked transfers i hadn_'_t as yet booked by flight home but someone at alpha_rooms decided i was going at 00 . 00 .
neutral	as a result sarpedon would not pick us up .
neutral	three difficult phone_calls to them , paid for by me .
neutral	three messages to alpha_rooms , internet paid for by me and 00_hours of worrying later they herded us into an already coming for other_travellers minibus .
neutral	will sort transfers out my self next time .
neutral	the dress was ok elastic in waist not to elastic enough .
neutral	needed a better quality one or a little wider , it was also very very long , i could wear stilts or perhaps i will just cut a couple of feet off the bottom and make a wrap to wear with it
neutral	i ordered 0 sets of items - 0 set of greeting cards and 0 sets of calendars .
neutral	the greeting cards look good and i was pleased with the result .
neutral	of the 0 sets of calendars , i knew that the images for 0 set were poor as they were shots taken of old prints .
neutral	but the other set were good quality , and yet the printed images on the desktop calendar are slightly dark , but more_importantly low resolution and not as sharp as i would expect .
neutral	mixed bag therefore ....
neutral	the free game is a way of playing when you havent any cash and the big game at the end of the month is great , the slots are my favorite as there are not many bingo rooms the way you could improve is chat in the slot rooms and chat_games .
neutral	really sad to have to write this review , i purchased an item ( my first ) from park_cameras , which was dispatched very quickly , but they failed in one important respect they did not inform me once the item had been dispatched as promised in the the email that said the order was being_processed , a simple error , but we are all fallible .
neutral	what followed was a missed delivery , then being_lied to by ukmail that the item was out for delivery the following_day and would definitely be delivered .
neutral	an entry made on ukmail '_s web_site , hours after i had called them to cover their tracks to say it was delayed , my suspicions are that the delay was due to a champions league football match , but i can '_t prove that .
neutral	so would i buy again or recommend park_cameras , possibly .
neutral	it seems both companies have technology that proves once again that if you feed it garbage you get garbage out .
neutral	update .
neutral	to be fair to park_cameras , i have now had a call from them and they have explained the situation .
neutral	they have refunded the cost of postage , which is more than fair and i have increased the original star_rating 0 star accordingly to 0 , i would like to have given 0 but the description would not allow me to go that far .
neutral	items from wowcher are very impressive & good quality , sometimes exceeding expectations .
neutral	however , i am not impressed with the delivery times of any of the items i have purchase .
neutral	they are always beyond the specified delivery date , and not just a couple of days either .
neutral	brush up on this & you ' d be 0 star .
neutral	have tried_calling 0 - 000 - 000 - 0000 about a jacket all i get is recording
neutral	i have ordered from this company quite a bit .
neutral	they have many items at good prices , but the shipping is so high it can offset the savings .
neutral	you don_'_t see the shipping until the end , i advise double checking pricing on other online supplement companies before committing to your order .
neutral	i '_ve often done this and found the savings aren_'_t really savings .
neutral	in addition , the " free " items are not really free , they add on very high shipping for each one .
neutral	appeared the best value ... however the full_tank compulsory payment and the additional assurance that was compulsory tok it into a range that was unclear as to value .
neutral	it '_s a great pity so many companies , rentalcars included , have to fudge issues in this way .
neutral	it was a great car and the actual one specified however .... audi_a0 for a week plus for not much over 000_pounds including fuel effectively .. ( i estimate we paid for about 00 euros worth we didnt use ..
neutral	i dont understand_why they use that policy ..
neutral	empty to empty or full to full is much fairer .)
neutral	the online order tracking didn_'_t work , the live_chat managed to get me a link that worked - now i know that the courier has had my order for a week and i '_ve had to go to pets at home so that the cats don_'_t starve .
neutral	not nearly as quick as they used to be & no cheaper_than their competitors ...
neutral	i returned , called for my car , was told to go to car_park , my car will be on the back wall somewhere , found my car but there wasn_'_t anyone there with my keys .
neutral	i called the office back was told block must of gone for a pee .
neutral	i said this isint exactly meet and great , was told well make a complaint then and then he hung_up .
neutral	the block did turn_up a few mins later , i pointed_out there a white paint on my seat , he said oh perhaps it '_s was already there .
neutral	i think it '_s from the white pen they use to write on the front window .
neutral	my car was also very very dirty don_'_t know where it had been kept while i was away .
neutral	so i will not be using stressfree parking again .
neutral	i feel that iflorist should have an international tracking_system .
neutral	i know that the weather was bad in france over christmas but i feel that a delay of over a week is unacceptable .
neutral	however the flowers that were delivered were very good quality .
neutral	i would need an " ontime " assurance before i place my next order with iflorist .
neutral	didn_'_t work first time - hence the headline .
neutral	went back to it a couple of hours_later and it worked like a dream - whatever !
neutral	!
neutral	booked by first stay at a premier_inn on - line in april for a twin bed room in august at aldershot , hants .
neutral	this was because our usual hotel had once again raised its prices .
neutral	however when we arrived we were given a family room .
neutral	while one of us had 0 nights in a comfy double_bed the other had to make do with a made - up couch as hard as rocks .
neutral	despite mentioning this and the fact there was only one hard back chair and one large and one small towel , most of our requests fell on deaf_ears by the welcoming receptionist who was shall we say was just not welcoming .
neutral	the lady_who came on later in day was a joy and sorted the towels out and got us a nice arm chair and more beverages .
neutral	however she was unable to help with sleeping arrangements .
neutral	another bone of contention was the breakfast which unfortunately we had paid for in advance .
neutral	the premier version was cooked to order so you never actually got to pick and mix what appealed to you and the continental version was limited .
neutral	to be honest you would expect best brand cereals and pure fruit juices for the cost and croissants that were lightly baked .
neutral	i would suggest anyone staying here to pop across to tescos , a stones throw_away , and get all you need for less_than half the price .
neutral	noise was a problem and to be honest it was not entirely the fault of the hotel for the outside noise , a busy main_road with flashing car reflections lighting up the room all night and i did hear that if your room was on the other side you were subjected to tesco lorries day and night so it was a no_brainer whichever room you were allocated .
neutral	however the noise inside could be helped .
neutral	in the first place it was a bad idea to put two retired people in the family room area with all the doors banging and children running about shouting .
neutral	there was also an awful smell up the corridor whenever we had to leave the room .
neutral	i do realize you cannot judge all premier inns on one experience as other comments are encouraging but i will hesitate to book one again ,
neutral	i received flowers from service personal oversees - very sparse and several leaves and stems were covered in dust .
neutral	i myself ordered a birthday card using own photo and the end product was blurred and feint .
neutral	will not use them again .
neutral	basically a good company but i disagree with late payment charges - it is a tax on the poor , and lets_face it if we were rich we wouldn_'_t be buying from a catalogue .
neutral	i am slowly going to pay off what i owe and will not give them my custom anymore as i have done with other_companies such as bt .
neutral	middle of the road carrier , have to watch the add - ons on the website .
neutral	you get what you pay for
neutral	har tidigare köpt linser från lensway , alltid bra service och snabba leveranser .
neutral	fick idag ett mail som erbjöd mig 00_% rabatt och fraktfritt .
neutral	då jag precis behövde beställamer linser , passade det bra ,
neutral	klickar mig in och priset jag erbjuds är 000 .- - 00_% rabatt , dvs 000 .- för ett 0 - pack linser av vald sort .
neutral	därefter går jag in på en prisjämförelse site för linser , då får jag priset 000 .- för samma lins från lensway .
neutral	dvs 00 .- billigare än det rabatterade priset .
neutral	fraktfritt var det givetvis också .
neutral	märkligt beteende ...
neutral	the item arrived damaged and to be honest it didn_'_t appear to be of good quality in the first place which was disappointing as i had purchased a similar item in the past with no_problems .
neutral	the customer_services rep was understanding and has arranged to resolve the problem but the company will still not let it be delivered to my workplace which means i have to take days off for both collection and delivery for my replacement .
neutral	i am not happy at this point !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered products from this company and they were dispatched quickly and efficiently .
neutral	when we got the products they were exactly as_described .
neutral	unfortunately , gymroom use dx couriers who failed to deliver even_though there was someone home .
neutral	dx work on times and need to deliver packages .
neutral	if they get behind they just leave a card without even trying to ring the doorbell .
neutral	due to my experience with dx , i will not be using gymroom again unless they can get my goods to me via a different delivery method .
neutral	i have given 0_stars due to the delivery issue .
neutral	had the couriers delivered it would have definitely been a 0 star review
neutral	i have used asda home delivery since it started about 00 years_ago on tyneside .
neutral	up until a year or so ago they were excellent but things are slipping since then .
neutral	every delivery now there is something wrong , something missing or damaged , a lousy substitution , a fresh product right on its sell by date or a stupid quantity of something .
neutral	i have complained and gotten refunds but this is looking systematic now .
neutral	so i emailed customer_services specifically to ask for a response from a senior person in uk and all i got was a refund on a pound of apples .
neutral	it is a shame but i will use tesco or waitrose instead now .
neutral	i see from other reviews that these kind of issues are common all over the country .
neutral	maybe the reviewer is correct who thinks asda might deliberately be palming off any old rubbish that no one would buy in the store onto the poor home shoppers .
neutral	i have used this company for years without a problem .
neutral	i was surprised to see so many really bad_reviews .
neutral	maybe things are slipping but my latest order was fine like every other i have had from them .
neutral	i am especially worried by a few of these reviews that suggest that products might not be the genuine_article .
neutral	that would be business suicide if they were doing that .
neutral	i have certainly never had that problem with them .
neutral	they do sell testers and products that are not boxed but they are marked as such on the website .
neutral	i have never had an unboxed item that should have had a box .
neutral	my only niggles are that their range is not as good as cheapsmells and the website is more fiddly too .
neutral	postage is dearer if you are just buying 0 item but you save if you are buying several things .
neutral	update_: hmm have had a dodgy experience with them since this review .
neutral	i reviewed a poor quality product ( it was v cheap ) and they have not put my review on the website .
neutral	there are more positive_reviews on the same product .
neutral	if they are picking and choosing only positive_reviews this is misleading to customers .
neutral	my wife is a pretty good person to distinguish really good sites from the rest - she struggled to get through the process - unfortunately this site belongs in the pack as it is a bit clunky .
neutral	i found it ok but certainly not in the top category - prices are good and the main advantage for us is that a specific item that seems to be hard to find on the high_street and supermarkets is normally available
neutral	decided i needed a new dishwasher due to the bosch one i had for 00 years starting to play up .
neutral	must_admit have never_heard of ao up until a recent television advert , anyway decided to browse their site opted for the siemens sn00m000gb dishwasher @ £_000 . 00 give or take a few_pounds this price is pretty_much standard across the entire internet .
neutral	because i was having this dishwasher delivered elsewhere rather_than to my home , i thought it would be advisable to telephone the order .
neutral	now it clearly_states on ao that this appliance , well i '_ve copied and pasted it " to offer peace of mind the siemens sn00m000gb free standing dishwasher also comes with 0 years warranty "
neutral	well according to the sales_rep it only came with a 0 year_warranty stating i would have to purchase an additional 0 year_warranty , there is also a review on their site , stating that the purchaser bought the product on the basis of the 0 year_warranty .
neutral	so any new buyers of this product would assume that , that is what they are getting .
neutral	well now that i am in receipt of this dishwasher i can confirm you only get 0 years with an option to purchase a further 0 years through siemens / domestic & general .
neutral	the sales_rep also tried to talk me into taking out some kind of insurance_policy whether it was the same as above or not i don_'_t know as i told her she was wasting her time .
neutral	now the cash_back offer , various goods on the ao website have a cash_back offer , there might be a simple explanation but i cannot see why they cannot just reduce the goods by the various cash_back offers , instead the customer has to buy the goods , then contact them to get the cash_back , it does seem a rather long_winded process and there is no direct link on their site to apply for the cash_back unless of course i have missed it somewhere , but i cant see it anywhere , so have had to email them .
neutral	on the plus side , i don_'_t think you can fault them on their service / delivery times , although i can understand that being text and having phones calls at 0am in the morning can be a bit much for some people .
neutral	to be honest i ' m probably just being picky , i think a lot of businesses could_learn a thing or two from how ao operate , i ' d certainly use them again and have no issues in recommending them , in fact i think it will be hard for a competitor to beat them .
neutral	i did get a price to insure me which many companies declined due tomy medical conditions the £_000 premium was increased by £_000 when i said my cruise had a stop in malta and turkey ( toxic europe ) i went to insurance choice brokers and got a very individualised medical screen and insurane cover for less_than £_000 for the same cruise .
neutral	paid way over the odds twice now for tickets and it is a bad practice and should be outlawed .
neutral	it is my fault for going along and encouraging it .
neutral	you have what i wanted but ......
neutral	insurance and packing is a con for 0 bulb .
neutral	this should be relevant to the cost of the item and not seriously loaded .
neutral	very expensive
neutral	i found this service very useful suplied me with oil cheaper_than my usual suppplier
neutral	you need to add new games more .
neutral	also bet cash bonuses with small play thought .
neutral	you need to look at other casino sites to see how they run .
neutral	you need to give more cash match bets .
neutral	just interested in your money , not had any_problems with them , but the odds are not the best generally
neutral	just interested in your money , not had any_problems with them , but the odds are not the best generally
neutral	just interested in your money , not had any_problems with them , but the odds are not the best generally
neutral	purchased a couple of things from currys recently , one of the items would not allow me to purchase on - line , so after searching the internet for a contact number for my local_store ( this is an impossible task and the website also does not have this information ).
neutral	i finally found a general number that i used .
neutral	it took 0 calls and visits to 0 local stores before i managed to get the item i wanted ( this was an item that they were advertising on tv , so it should have been readly available .
neutral	it did finally come and on time , lets_hope it works after christmas and for many_years .
neutral	fingeres crossed .
neutral	my son was desperate to get his ms points to use with his mates online .
neutral	the site promised immediate delivery , but we had to wait 00_hrs whilst they manually processed the credit_card payment " when the office next opens ".
neutral	not happy .
neutral	son not happy .
neutral	they should have warned about this prior to grabbing the customers payment details !
neutral	all resolved fine the next_day - but our expectation of immediate delivery was not .
neutral	i have no problem with takeaway . com . however they have too many disclaimers .
neutral	it seems that if anything_goes_wrong it is up to the customer to put things right .
neutral	i placed my order with takeaway . com and it was transmitted to the outlet . but there it ended . the meal i got was late , luke warm and burnt . it was up to me to complain to the vendor . other sights that i have used give you a fixed delivery time and update you on its progress .
neutral	all in all ok but could do better .
neutral	the draytex 0000n and the 000 modem pile of junk nothing still works after a week of faffing about dont let anybody but draytex ever ever ever
neutral	first time i had used this company but sounded ok .
neutral	i ordered 0 packs of 0 filters = 00 .
neutral	received 0 !!
neutral	short of 00 .
neutral	tried to telephone .. it said ' unable to connect me '.
neutral	very frustrated by this point .
neutral	had to send an_email & wait for response .
neutral	they said it was a picking error and sent them out the next_day , so i had to wait in for delivery the second time .
neutral	no compensation , or no voucher off my next order .
neutral	it would have been nice to receive a ' sorry ' of some kind for their error .
neutral	dont think i will use this company again .
neutral	disappointed with their service
neutral	if i hadn_'_t been tied into a contract i would have moved my account some where else .
neutral	british telecom don_'_t make me laugh , call_center in some foreign country cannot understand the operatives .
neutral	not recommended
neutral	shop a lot , good prices , goods are fair but delivery is rather shoddy , stuff out of bags , squashed sometimes and delivery people not very friendly .
neutral	used them a lot , but had card_details stolen several_times and also found i can get same products cheaper elsewhere at times .
neutral	good prices but disappointing that stock control and packing accurately needs improving .
neutral	we have a couple of iphones and blackberries with o0 .
neutral	the service is usually problem free , but we find that 0g coverage is really hit and miss .
neutral	i run 0 pc '_s at home and i have an agility 000gb ssd in each .
neutral	one failed within the 0 year_guarantee period .
neutral	they insisted on a receipt which i found via the very helpful ccl computers .
neutral	they did honour the guarantee and 0 weeks_later i was posted a new ssd .... but is was a re - manufactured one and was covered in a glue like substance .
neutral	it worked ok but i expected a new one .
neutral	i ' m happy that it works but it does not instill me with a great deal of confidence .
neutral	the product is fab
neutral	but the delivery company is less_than good
neutral	past experience told me would be not great and i was right
neutral	the invoice shows fedex in fact it yodel .
neutral	alias cowboy post !
neutral	!
neutral	they sent text an_email_saying what day was being delivered and it did arrive very late on the day !
neutral	but try contacting these_guys !
neutral	not a chance
neutral	the only thing that will prevent me from re ordering is the delivery method they use
neutral	when it did arrive thank_god pro_cook had packed it well !
neutral	as the box had a three inch hole in it !
neutral	clearly had been thrown around it '_s the first package ever that i have seen this .
neutral	it '_s a real shame that the only reason i will not order is the delivery company
neutral	i think overall the ticket prices on viagogo are better_than some sites and the layout to choose the tickets is also really good .
neutral	the only thing that may put me off in the future is that they use ups for delivery !
neutral	they don_'_t give you a small or specific delivery window like other couriers and if you aren_'_t in you have to drive to some remote industrial estate 00 miles_away and then cannot even go inside to get your tickets it is like fort knox !
neutral	also viagogo email you saying if you can '_t get there in so many days they will destroy your tickets people go on holiday you know and may miss this , this needs to change it would be devastating after paying all that money !
neutral	i booked skyparksecure '_s chaffeur service as i wanted a trouble_free service .
neutral	flight was saturday_afternoon so im guessing a busy time , but i dont expect an answerphone with no option to leave a message for a premium service .
neutral	took several_attempts to manage to speak to someone , the service after that was great .
neutral	had the same issue on the return flight , ( 0am in the morning ).
neutral	several_attempts for a person to answer the phone .
neutral	i purchased a scooter from careco for my husband in november_0000 , purchasing various add - ons for extra security and peace of mind , so that i didn_'_t have to worry_about him when he is out and about .
neutral	the delivery experience was okay but not wonderful , as they forgot some of the accessories and we had to wait a bit longer_than we might have expected to actually receive the delivery of the scooter itself .
neutral	one of the extras was the £_00 a tyre to have gel put in the tyres to protect against punctures .
neutral	that was also one of the extras that got forgotten , but an engineer was sent out to rectify the omission .
neutral	last_week , my husband got a puncture in one of the back wheels which is now as flat as a pancake .
neutral	this means that he can '_t go out ...
neutral	i have called the company at_least once a day since last monday and have been referred to the showroom as we made the purchase in person rather_than on - line .
neutral	my most_recent call was at 00 . 00 this morning when i was assured that the gentleman dealing_with the matter had just popped out for half an_hour and would call me with an update on my return .
neutral	it is now 0pm and i am still_waiting for a call and my husband is still stuck indoors ........
neutral	this will be interesting !
neutral	have dealt_with taunton_leisure for years , mainly by going into their shops rather_than internet .
neutral	ordered a tent on 00 / 00 / 00 & was told by email at 00 . 00 the next_day it had been dispatched , even_though when trying to track the parcel i couldn_'_t as the royal_mail said ' enter your 00 digit tracking_number ' which was not included in the email .
neutral	i decided that patience was called for , & even giving our beloved royal_mail the benefit of the doubt was still surprised when nothing had arrived by the 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	decided to ring taunton_leisure on 00 / 00 / 00 to inquire , so phoned customer_care at approx 00 . 00 - no answer ...
neutral	finally on the 0th call someone picked_up the phone at approx 00 . 00 - i told the lady my concern ... conversation as follows ...
neutral	me - ' hello , am inquiring about an internet order '
neutral	she - ' sorry .
neutral	but i can '_t help you , you '_ll have to phone customer_care '.
neutral	me - ' i have , i ' m talking to you '.
neutral	she - ' no , they must have put you through '.
neutral	me - ' well , what do you suggest ?'
neutral	she - ' could you phone them during working hours ?'
neutral	me - ' i have , your website says customer_care is open 0 - 0 '
neutral	she - ' well perhaps they '_ve gone home early '
neutral	me - ( somewhat stunned ) ' ok , thanks '.
neutral	i then had an early beer , opened my emails & saw the following sent to me at 00 . 00 on 00 / 00 / 00 - ' reference your order no 00000 placed on the 00 / 00 / 00 at 0 . 00 . 00 ( i didn_'_t place this ) your item has_been dispatched .'
neutral	as i write this , apparently the tent is now in the lundy shore office waiting to come to me on the next boat - this is no problem as because of where i live on lundy i ' m used to ' stuff ' taking a few_days to get here - but ....
neutral	why tell me you ' d sent it when you hadn_'_t ?
neutral	why invent a fictitious order for 00 / 0 / 00 at a time when i was at work & never emailed an order ?
neutral	at this point i would like to say that i am in no way complaining , but am just totally bemused - you say you value responses , the proof of how much you really care will come in the form of a response to this - though i ' m not holding my breath ...
neutral	something has obviously gone a bit wonky here , ( i expect you '_ll say it '_s a computer error - no , don_'_t believe you !!
neutral	- sorry , people operate computers , not the other way round ...).
neutral	i will still buy from you from past experience , but i find this episode out of your norm , & think you ought to know something isn_'_t quite right ...
neutral	one last thought , if this is a duplicate order & i happen to end up with two tents , how exactly are you going to pick_up the duplicate considering i live on an island 00 miles offshore ?
neutral	!
neutral	why do superdrug stores insist on sticking their own large barcode label on nearly every item ?
neutral	even more annoying is that they are often stuck over the product '_s information and instructions .
neutral	its presence immediately disfigures and downgrades the item you '_ve just spent your good money on .
neutral	i can '_t think of any other chain of stores that does this .
neutral	surely it shouldn_'_t be necessary , when products already have a barcode printed on them ?
neutral	although no stranger to amazon etc , this was my 0st use of tesco online .
neutral	to avoid a £ 0 delivery charge i opted to collect my order from my local superstore , and i received an_email_saying it would be there after 0 pm on monday .
neutral	i went at 0 : 00 , and stood at the empty counter for three minutes before someone was called to attend to me .
neutral	my order was brought out in a dirty and battered cardboard_box that the assistant opened to check the contents were ok because , he said , it was wet when it came in .
neutral	if he hadn_'_t got in first , i would have insisted myself that he checked it .
neutral	everything was fine and i took my order home , but 0 : 00 pm i answered my phone to hear a recorded_message telling_me my order had been delayed for 00_hours and i could now collect it after 0 pm on tuesday !
neutral	on tuesday i received another email_telling_me my order was now ready to collect , and another recorded phone_call .
neutral	after checking my credit_card account to make_sure they hadn_'_t charged me twice , i must_admit i was really tempted to go to the store to see if they did indeed have a duplicate order for me , and if they were daft enough to give it to me .
neutral	write_why you did not find the experience particularly good .
neutral	for instance_:
neutral	i finally received my item but after a lot of correspondence back and forth .
neutral	the company obviously did not have the item in stock and would return the money to me .
neutral	the item is ok .
neutral	ordered a pilot jacket and cessna patch .
neutral	arrived quickly ( 0 days ) but was sent the jacket and a chart for ireland but no patch .
neutral	jacket quality was poor and too short .
neutral	called and got a freepost number for return ( done ) and was promise that patch would be sent ( arrived today ).
neutral	pity , previous_experiences with transair have been very good
neutral	still_waiting for my item to be received into motardinn stock and then dispatched to me0
neutral	i am happy with my purchase just not happy with the fact that because i forgot to use planet rock sound savers as i ' m new to their site , both myself and planet rock sound savers contacted you to see if you would still agree to me getting my 0 . 0 % commission back through them .
neutral	you refused to accept this and i have to say as i ' m a new customer and this is my first purchase with you , it has made me think_twice about shopping with you in future .
neutral	so , the new ceo john cleland plans to invest £ 00m in maplins does he , well , he ' d better consider spending a good chunk of that on staff training , my recent visit to cannock left a lot to be desired , no greeting no smile , just a look , yes that look when you walk into a strange pub from all the regulars .
neutral	the guys didn_'_t seem very happy either , ok i know it '_s saturday_night but hey , be happy you got a job ..... right ?
neutral	mind you if i ' d been given that scruffy black top to wear at work maybe i ' d be feeling the same way , looks_like they ' d been issued one top and then worn it solid for two months , and maybe slept in it !!
neutral	mr cleland with his track_record should know better_than anyone_else the importance of a tidy appearance and a friendly_manner unfortunately i didn_'_t see much of either at cannock .
neutral	luckily for maplins there '_s not much competition on the high_street , if you need something electronic and you need it today it '_s maplins , but , don_'_t get too complacent maplins i only bought from there because of the sale and doubt very much if i '_ll be making a second visit , sorry !
neutral	item arrived at exact time specified - well_packed but not in original fender packaging ??
neutral	?
neutral	i am disappointed as it would have been .
neutral	cheaper to park at the airport in end .
neutral	i arrived at 000 with a view to getting 000 bus for a 000 flight .
neutral	arrived they had no details of me ref no no good .
neutral	time wasted trying to find it then they said go_ahead and park and they would tel manager .
neutral	by the i got parked and back to reception 000 boys had gone and i had to pat 00 euros for a taxi .
neutral	do as to ensure i had ample time .
neutral	its a good job i did cause i just got to gate in time .
neutral	not a happy camper with the metro .
neutral	i asked for some clarification as to whether a canal boating holiday would be covered .
neutral	the answer i received was confusing .
neutral	i organised for a washing_machine to be delivered , installed and the old machine removed for my parents who live 000_miles from me .
neutral	the installation was perfect , the man delivering and installing the machine kept in touch me letting me that all was well and that he had explained the wash programmes to my mother .
neutral	however there was a problem and the next_day i had to arrange for an engineer to return the following_day .
neutral	i expected the same level of contact ...
neutral	i did not hear from anyone .
neutral	i called several_times asking for information - nothing !
neutral	i wanted to warn my parents that someone would be there at a certain time - nobody called me back .
neutral	the phone_call i received was that the job was done .
neutral	i had by this time taken 00_minutes chasing answers .
neutral	it sounds_like a little niggle but i was 000_miles_away and i wanted to know that everything was alright .
neutral	if they could not provide the answers they should have said so , rather_than setting_up an expectation and making me call , call and call .
neutral	in summary , brilliant if you are buying and asking for an installation but hope that you do not need a follow_up appointment .
neutral	my product was delivered in tip_top condition by very helpful delivery staff .. the only thing i can say that would help completely happy would be to give the customer a ring shortly_after the purchase to explain when a delivery will be arranged .
neutral	i purchased on the monday and didn_'_t receive any phone_call and on the friday at 0pm i rang and was told i would be receive a call on the monday .. i didn_'_t , so i rang back again at 0pm and was told someone would ring me the next_morning or i could call myself and arrange delivery .
neutral	this is what i did and they said they would deliver next_day and would ring an_hour before .
neutral	i thought " great , gives me time to pop back home from work ".
neutral	they did deliver next_day but did not ring an_hour before .
neutral	it was pure look that my partner had finished work early and was home .
neutral	even_though my product is fantastic and i ' m so pleased , it makes me a little unsure if i would use this company again due to be unorganized booking of the delivery service .
neutral	i must add they were very apologetic .
neutral	item not as_described , i failed to read the small_print but there is no justification for this considering that different products have different prices .
neutral	arrived within the 0 working_days but only just , i have had faster delivery with other_suppliers .
neutral	while i haven_'_t been altogether pleased with my interactions as a new customer of e_- careers , due specifically to misinformation being provided both on the website and in e_- mails , i can say that this second need to contact them on chat was met with a helpful staff person who provided a speedy resolution .
neutral	the first time i had to contact someone to resolve an issue with enabling my account , i relayed that i ' d been given incorrect_information , and it was met with an ' oh well ' attitude .
neutral	this time , i again needed to contact someone because i could not access my training , which was again due to being given incorrect_information in an e_- mail .
neutral	this time , however , the person who helped_me , [_name ], was very helpful , and ackowledged that he would inform someone of the fact that i '_ve been given incorrect_information , making my experiences so far with e_- careers not too pleasant .
neutral	here '_s hoping [_name ] has started a turn for the better in my experiences going forward .
neutral	when i processed the order and had paid it brougt up a delivery address that was not on my file - i telelephoned customer service to advise of the issue and was assured it would be corrected and it would be asked to rectify for any future deliveries - needless to say it was delivered to the wrong_address !
neutral	!
neutral	disappointed !
neutral	!
neutral	!
neutral	i was looking for a particular location and hotel that has some meaning to me .
neutral	we are celebrating our wedding_anniversary and wanted it to be special .
neutral	we had looked and alpha_rooms was advertising the hotel we really wanted so we booked .
neutral	i then found flights to match the dates that i had booked the hotel .
neutral	the flights where booked separately and non_refundable .
neutral	i have previously booked with alpha_rooms before and have never had a problem so i was fully confident that if a hotel was advertised and a deposit taken then the room would be available .
neutral	this was not to be on this occasion to my disappointment i was informed two days_later that the hotel was no_longer available for the dates booked and that my deposit was to be refunded .
neutral	no alternative was offered .
neutral	i then had to look for a hotel to match the dates of the flight .
neutral	the hotel i have had to book is almost £_000 more_expensive than my initial booking ....
neutral	i would really appreciate knowing why you are regularly failing to keep to your promises re rewards .
neutral	i am presently paying for a shower , made more than the minimum £_00 . 00 payment ( paid £_00 . 00 to be precise , way over and above my minimum payment ) and it isn_'_t a sale item as far as i am aware and once again , as is becoming a regular pattern recently , i have not received any rewards .
neutral	this is not good enough .
neutral	either you are going to honour your promises or not , but if not , scrap the rewards system and lower your prices as you are not acting fair !
neutral	if i didn_'_t make any minimum payment , you would be in touch with me in a flash - remember , respect works both_ways , so honour your agreements .
neutral	everything else is ok , not marvellous , just ok .
neutral	often arrives at the end or after the booked time_slot .
neutral	often substitutions are not well thouht out - and whoever packs the bags needs to remember to put soft stuff on top of the heavy things instead of the otherway round .
neutral	after noticing a small chip on my windscreen i rang to arrange a repair as i was told this was free under my insurance_policy .
neutral	the call_centre operator took all my details but chose not to listen to my request for a repair and booked a windscreen replacement despite this clearly not being necessary .
neutral	i was told i had to pay £_000 for the repair and when i queried it i was told that it was cheaper_than a replacement .
neutral	eventually i spoke directly to my local autoglass depot and they attended and repaired the windscreen .
neutral	i am still_waiting for my refund and wonder_how many other times a replacement is arranged at unnecessary expense to both the insurance company and the car owner ?
neutral	the technician arrived as arranged and repaired the windscreen which now looks perfect .
neutral	i would recommend the technical side of autoglass but certainly not the level of customer service afforded by the call_centre .
neutral	please can i have my money back ?
neutral	annoyed as had to go and collect it
neutral	after taking a contract out with sky through_topcashback , a deal worth £_000 of vouchers and £_000 cashback i received the vouchers within a respectable time .
neutral	however the £_000 cashback has just been paid to me this week , which is ' nt so bad but when you consider the contract was taken out in november_0000 the delay is not acceptable !
neutral	is the fault with topcashback or sky ?
neutral	has anyone_else had to wait this long or do i have the record ?
neutral	i will_continue to use topcashback now i have been paid and will believe i will get paid eventually .
neutral	... a lot of the cheap offers are hedged around with odd qualifiers - you have to send in copies of some of your invoices for a rebate , usually within a very tight time - window .
neutral	they ' re obviously hoping you '_ll forget and won_'_t qualify for the discount .
neutral	i use virgin trains , mainly .
neutral	ok until there is a problem , then the whole organisation seems to go into headless chicken mode .
neutral	one particular cancellation left me hopping all_sorts of random trains , and it took me 0 . 0 hours to get to london ( normally 00 - odd minutes ).
neutral	but the worst part was the lack of information - no - one seemed to know what was happening .
neutral	the first_class lounge is nice .
neutral	i have ordered from selections twice now , and on both_occasions have been completely happy with the products .
neutral	on both_occasions , though , the packages were just dumped at the gate , and no attempt was made with the first delivery to obtain the required signature .
neutral	the tracking site shows a " signature ", but it '_s not mine .
neutral	i suspect that the courier company are giving their drivers impossible schedules - some people seem to think this management style is clever ....
neutral	flowered order for a birthday , local delivery i . e .
neutral	camberley flowers left outside house by front_door not a secure place in full sun between 00 . 00 and 0 . 00 as no one was in .
neutral	flowers were for an elderly lady on her_birthday .
neutral	had hoped flowers would have been delivered in the morning , as it was a very local delivery to longacres .
neutral	i chose the bouquet by the price and the colour , the one chosen was free delivery , i had presumed that it would be delivered by a local_florist not by parcel_force , the recipient received the flowers late_afternoon , just before leaving their office .
neutral	would have preferred them to have received them first thing , as the flowers had been in the delivery van all day .
neutral	the flowers received were greatly_appreciated and looked beautiful .
neutral	i guess it provides the info you would expect , it '_s all a bit vanilla and sicophantic for my liking .
neutral	the service was fine until i noticed that an engraving had spelled ' brian ' as ' brain '.
neutral	it was too late to return the trophy .
neutral	hardly an uncommon name and an error that rendered the trophy worthless .
neutral	the asda site is easy to use - however unlike rival sites it doesn_'_t store your instore shopping .
neutral	this can make your online order longer .
neutral	i have previously used black_circles and was happy with the service so returned to buy another set of tyres .
neutral	this time i was looking for a specific tyre and initially only saw one speed rated h . this seemed fine as the rating goes up to 000mph and my car does not go_anywhere_near that speed .
neutral	the fitting garage contacted black_circles who in turn contacted me to suggest that i need a v rated tyre as the speed rating includes a load rating also and there may be implications with my insurer should i be involved in an accident .
neutral	the v rated tyre was on the website but not next to the h rated one instead it was at the bottom of the webpage and i missed it !
neutral	black_circles were happy to exchange before the fitting date but i would have to pay an additional £_00 delivery .
neutral	i decided that would make the tyres too expensive so i opted to keep the h rated ones .
neutral	however black_circles insisted i sign a waiver at the garage to avoid any blame etc ...... the car was mot ' d the next_day and passed .
neutral	as tyre technology / ratings , labelling etc_., become increasing more complicated i suggest that the website keep pace .
neutral	group tyres of the same type in one place and provide sufficient information so that the lay person cannot go_wrong .
neutral	if that includes warnings about ratings , legislation then so be it .
neutral	internet purchasing is great when it works but be warned it currently cannot replace the expert standing next to you in the garage !
neutral	i have to use paypal as i have an ebay account , otherwise i would not use .
neutral	it is expensive and the statements are not the easiest to read and i have a financial background !
neutral	it brings me no benefit and as for security - thats no great shakes either !
neutral	i have had no_problems with this company and prefer my package to anything bt or others have to offer .
neutral	however i was recently asked by an elderly friend to help sort_out a billing problem as she was getting_nowhere on the phone .
neutral	the problem involved the billing on two accounts .
neutral	i wrote to customer_services a month_ago and have had a response however their letter looked like it had been uplifted from a training manually , the grammar poor and they had not fully resolved the problem .
neutral	this was after having to provide the acconts information a second time .
neutral	at the time of writing the second account has still not been sorted .
neutral	i was present when my friend telephoned talktalk and was surprised by how many_times she was transferred and more surprised when she had the phone put down on her !
neutral	bought this companies ultimate gold hdmi_cables .
neutral	have to say the quality is not as good as they and the ' apparent ' reviews from customers make out .
neutral	ok lets be fair .. cheap price , very fast delivery and they sent me two cables that where longer_than required so bit of a bargain ... well ... what ever you do do not bend these cable at the point they enter the plug itself .... they just can '_t take even the slightest of bends as i found out when the picture failed .
neutral	very weak construction at the plug end .
neutral	if you do bend them the plug is quite easily forced apart and causes the signal to fail .
neutral	im writing this as i wrote a positive comment with regards delivery and picture quality on their website ... strangely it failed to appear ... just like the signal from my onkyo amp to my panny tv .... no it '_s not a fault with either of those two components as i tried some cheaper cables .. bending and twisting with no loss of signal ... all i can say is you get what you pay for ... 00 / 000 and thats just for the quick delivery and price ... nothing else .
neutral	sorry ... not impressed
neutral	i was horrified that the tickets were more than double than the price on the tickets but cant_fault the service
neutral	i ordered parts for my mower , then discovered it was more broken than i realised .
neutral	phoned and asked to cancel the order .
neutral	he said he had done that .
neutral	00_mins later had an_email to say they were despatched .
neutral	when they arrived asked to return them .
neutral	no problem , took them to a collect_+ shop two_weeks_ago .
neutral	still_waiting for a refund !!
neutral	have chased them and am still_waiting .
neutral	i recently tried to review the same company again - a different issue from before , but was advised i was unable to post another review and would have to edit my previous one .
neutral	this is , in my opinion , very odd .... as with trip_advisor , surely all reviews should be un - editable , and relate to one experience .
neutral	bought a bathroom_cabinet from local_store .
neutral	when delivered it had parts missing . unknown to me when i called the local number i was transfered to a national call_centre .
neutral	they arranged collection and said i would recieve a refund when they recieved goods . after two_weeks endless_calls and no refund it turned_out the item was lost . and sent to scotland .
neutral	finally i went i to local_store and problem was resolved .
neutral	be aware the local telephone_number shown on reciept is a uk call_centre and not your local_store ...
neutral	prices are ok but delivery is very slow and if they use yodel you have no_idea when it '_s owing .
neutral	the initial experience was pretty good with decent response and confirmation of my choice ( including sizes ) as suitable .
neutral	delivery was carefully planned and happened , as agreed .
neutral	the wheels were well_packed to resist damage in transit , and came with a full fitting kit , including a full set of wheel studs .
neutral	however , when the wheels and tyres were delivered , the wheels were a different size from those requested ( 0 . 0j x 00 rather_than 0j x 00 in ) and only one of them was balanced .
neutral	i had particularly wanted 0 x 00 because that was a wheel size offered by seat , so it would keep the insurance company sweet .
neutral	i assume they did not have the correct wheel in stock , but that is not really an excuse for sending something different than ordered without_any discussion .
neutral	after posting this experience , cormac did get back to me and was concerned that i was not happy , which is good .
neutral	he then sent me an invoice showing 0 . 0j x 00 wheels , but this was the first time i had seen this .
neutral	i suspect that my experience was a one - off , but nevertheless i was sent a size of wheel different from what i ordered , without_any discussion .
neutral	prices were ok but when i followed up the order by email asking about delivery i got a pretty poor email response that seemed totally disinterested and didn_'_t even try to answer the question .
neutral	compare with when i collected the part , the person on the desk was super responsive and friendly .
neutral	a fantastic advert for the company !
neutral	fast , efficient and reliable but not the best rate around - and charge of £ 0 to transfer below £ 0 , 000 makes it not particularly good value .
neutral	ice waterloo almost always beats this for changing currency - though not directly into a spanish bank_account .
neutral	acc no 000000
neutral	pick_up at airport was good the car was ok a little damage around car but a great price all in all very happy with that side of it .
neutral	but we were hit by a car which knocked the wing mirror of both cars pulled onto hard shoulder we took down there number_plate details got out of our car and the other car sped of we tried to phone police but they couldn_'_t understand us so we phoned the customer advise line to be told all is fine we have no need to go to police just fill all the details of accident on the claim form including the number_plate which we did .
neutral	on arrival back at the rental company the next_day they told us we are responsible for the repair as we did , nt get the other drivers details
neutral	0st how can you get details of driver that wont stop
neutral	0nd it must be the same law for all countries in europe to get the reg of car and inform police
neutral	0rd why did i need insurance and an excess_insurance when anyone can plough into you and you cant claim a penny if they dont stop
neutral	i , m just pleased no one was hurt as that could of got very complicated
neutral	had to wait ages for a refund
neutral	my previous experience with software from ecost was excellent .
neutral	it was a straight purchase of a software package .
neutral	when buying a copy of windows 0 professional recently , i specifically_asked if i could run my quickbooks 0000 on it .
neutral	i was told that i could if i downloaded the win xp compatability software from microsoft which was a free download .
neutral	i did this but it was a complete disaster .
neutral	the xp part was somewhat unstable - not e cost '_s fault - but quickbooks 0000 would not load .
neutral	i had to buy a new version of quickbooks ( 0000 ) which came from another supplier at a cheaper price .
neutral	as ecost sell both products , i would expect them to be better informed technically .
neutral	mike newman
neutral	i ordered several items from these_guys .
neutral	unfortunately the sink was broken on delivery .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery to do the job over the weekend so that put me behind .
neutral	i informed them the same day and have been advised it could take another 0 days for delivery of a replacement .
neutral	so , through no fault of my own , i now get a second class service .
neutral	the instructions on the taps were scant and the victorian style shower_mixer leaks in the shower setting .
neutral	price was good and i was initially pleased with the prompt delivery .
neutral	now i am feeling let_down and should have bought elsewhere .
neutral	not really sure if 0 days was enough to really tell if any benefit .
neutral	but these_guys know their stuff and i ' d definitely try again
neutral	it '_s not worth the £ 0 extra for the ' over night ' delivery service as the company they have a deal with don_'_t deliver on saturdays where as good old snail_mail do .
neutral	so you get thoroughly ripped_off
neutral	i wanted posters printed as they where taken .
neutral	one upright one sideways and they done them both sideways .
neutral	so one is no good to me as i measured them to fit frames to fitroom .
neutral	good price and delivered very quickly but the product was not as
neutral	pictured / advertised on the website also appeared to be shop solied some of the packaging was already opened and there were marks on the product this should have been checked before boxing up and sending out .
neutral	a very disappointing shopping_experience .
neutral	every time i have the trauma of getting to an airport at some ungodly hour to stand in a huge snaking line for what feels_like an_eternity to be told the flight is delayed and then when finally boarded to be charged a days wages for an insipid cup of tea with a damp sandwich i tell myself ... never never again !!!
neutral	and then before i realise what i am doing i am booking another flight on ryan_air .
neutral	will i never learn ...... that '_s the power of pricing ..... get em ' in on the initial number £ 0 . 00 then cross sell / upsell / power sell / tea sell / everything costs sell !
neutral	and hey_presto i ' m being fleeced just for being a sucker on initial price sell ....
neutral	foxtons are the kings of pushing the prices up so that '_s why i always sell my houses through them ..... but not to buy through them .
neutral	for that i always go to a little estate_agent and find a hidden_gem ( s ) that perhaps foxtons can not be bothered with or the seller thinks their commision is too steep .
neutral	overall i think they are a reasonable company but they have been known to dance the edges .
neutral	easyjet or sleazyjet as some of my friends like to say ...... are the prices fair for what you get .... hard to say tbh .....
neutral	lets compare a flight from london to geneva using easyjet and british_airways ( leaving in 0 weeks time - a fair test i think ) with 0 bag to check in ( important as easyjet charge per bag )
neutral	easyjet : £_000 . 00 ( inc . £ 0 admin_charge for credit_card + 0 bag £_00 )
neutral	britishairways : £_000 . 00 ( inc . all - bags / food etc )
neutral	easyjet wins on price on this occasion but the hidden value parts that ba offer are 0 . no jam packed waiting areas / cues to check - in 0 . flights leave on time 0 . you get a drink and a snack included .
neutral	0 . your plane is not orange *
neutral	die buchung über billiger - mietwagen . de war hinsichtlich übersichtlichkeit , abwicklung und preisen sehr gut .
neutral	bei der übernahme des fahrzeugs beim vermieter thrifty am flughafen in kahului musste ich erst einmal 0 stunde und 00 minuten warten , bis ich überhaupt bedient wurde .
neutral	über 00 kunden standen vor mir in einer warteschlange , wie ich das sonst nur von us immigration kenne .
neutral	die bedienung wer dann zwar " umständlich " und dauerte noch einmal fast 00 minuten , war fachlich aber i . o .
neutral	bei der übernahme des mietwagens gab es nicht den beworbenen jeep liberty , sondern ein in die jahre gekommenes und " abgerittenes " modell von ford ( explorer ).
neutral	der wagen hatte diverse schäden ( zum teil tiefe beulen ).
neutral	thrifty weigerte sich auf anfrage , die schäden zu registrieren .
neutral	ich solle doch selbst eine fotodukumentation für die rückgabe erstellen .
neutral	wer bei thrifty mietet , sollte also eine kamera mit blitz bereithalten ( auf dem schwach beleuchteten parkplatz war bei regen kaum was zu sehen ).
neutral	bei der rückgabe wurden die schäden allerdings nicht beanstandet .
neutral	i ordered a game and paid for it only to find out it was no_longer available .
neutral	submitted an_alternative which they then sent to me in german .
neutral	had to return this , at my cost , to be replaced with english_version only to be told that it was not available .
neutral	had a full_refund for the original money i paid , but never received the postage paid for returning the wrong item .
neutral	i would not use this company again - will stick to [_external_reference_] or [_external_reference_].
neutral	bought some clothes in the sales very good price , checkouts manned , staff were friendly , lots to choose from .
neutral	some nice clothes average pricing , checkouts always manned not as good as m & s , some of the clothes do not fit as well , make you look one hundred at the age of 00 .
neutral	always found their products of good value , and the staff helpful , plenty of sales around the year , and staff are very friendly , plenty of tills open at the checkout .
neutral	stillcant understand_why pay all that money yet each channel carier thousands of hours of advertisements ?
neutral	is this the world greatest con
neutral	i purchased 00 heavy_duty architectural latches as replacements for some cheaper and very sub - standard units bought from another large internet supplier .
neutral	sadly the latches ( no :_000000 ) are no where near the quality i was expecting , of the 00 fitted so far i have had to dissemble and adjust 0 latches just to make them work properly and 0 of the others are quite rough in operation - not really acceptable
neutral	so far that is a 00_% failure rate !
neutral	i realise that these latches aren_'_t the dearest in the world but they should all operate properly - in my opinion ironmongery_direct have a fairly serious quality_control issue with the latch manufacturer that needs urgent attention .
neutral	battery looks fine but was not delivered next_day after order placed .
neutral	when i phoned was told i would be contacted again to update me .
neutral	no call was recieved
neutral	we are a paying trustpilot customer .
neutral	the trustpilot system has worked well to improve customer conversions , however , the automated email generation system leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	twice in two months tens , if not hundreds , of queued emails are arbitrarily cancelled .
neutral	if emails are not sent out in a timely_manner we won_'_t get reviewed , so what are we paying for ?
neutral	nothing wrong , but nothing exiting
neutral	my first time had a hitch in that i recieved the wrong order .
neutral	but after contacting customer_services it was put right in a proffesional way .
neutral	it has not put me off and i hope the rest of my custom with the company will be of a high_standard .
neutral	charged us the wrong amount , took a long time to deliver the goods and when they did they sent us the wrong sizes .
neutral	they did rectify the errors but we could have done without the extra time on our part contacting them .
neutral	too much broadband break down specially on rainy day
neutral	average on consumer product but expensive on fuel
neutral	i purchased annual_travel_insurance for myself and partner september_0000 .
neutral	today i found out they deducted £_00 . 00 for a renewal of the policy ( more than double original cost ).
neutral	i didnt authorise this but on checking small_print - they state they automatically renew the policy unless you tell them otherwise .
neutral	they state they write to you 00 days in advance , but i didnt receive a thing from them , if i did i would have cancelled straight_away .
neutral	beware !
neutral	update - i contacted protectyourbubble re this unauthorised deduction from my bank_account .
neutral	they didnt apologise but did offer a cancellation / full_refund within 0 days .
neutral	they stated the renewal notice was sent via_email - which subsequently has_gone into spam and not viewed by me hence why this has all happened .
neutral	if you do take out a policy read the small_print and set yourself a reminder 00 months on to look into the renewal and cancel if necessary .
neutral	note if i wanted renewal i still wouldnt have gone with protectyourbubble for year 0 as the price was more than double last years ' quote !
neutral	did not receive order within_00hrs as stated .
neutral	rang c / s twice , had delivery charge refunded and was told i would have to wait for depot to confirm receipt of collection from wrong_address .
neutral	0 days_later no contact from anyone and on 0th day at 0pm order turned_up out of the blue .
neutral	i do not know if this was my original order or if c / s re - ordered for me .
neutral	poor communication from very .
neutral	the dress is lovely though .
neutral	i routinely shop at aldi aylesbury , and am generally pleased .
neutral	products are of good value and it does cut down on ever increasing bills by doing my shop at aldi .
neutral	the downside is that while one week you may find everything you need ; another week can leave you wanting .
neutral	do the same shop week in week out at tesco and you will always find the products available .
neutral	to sum up : i continue to do my shop at aldi , but now allowing more time , because chances are i will have to go on to tesco for all the things aldi didn_'_t have this week that were there the last .
neutral	on second car from nationwide now and use to deal with a nice_chap that has since left , and he was top_dollar ; always answered emails and always prompt at getting a response and information ;
neutral	recently been inquiring to nationwide to change my vehicle and the response and help received so far is nothing short of disgraceful .
neutral	most of the time if i email , i would be lucky to ever get a reply .
neutral	it '_s like their just not interested unless you want a fleet .
neutral	the chap on the other hand , always worked hard for you no matter what .
neutral	over a week ago i filled out the website price beating form , and have never received a response from that either .
neutral	going to start looking around to use another company that actually answer queries and seem to want to help , or better still : want your business
neutral	nationwide obviously don_'_t care if you stay or go .....
neutral	ao is a good place to shop for white goods ; i have spend over £ 0000 on white good in the last_year .
neutral	delivery choices are excellent and my goods have always been delivered on time .
neutral	the only bad thing with ao is being part of the drl group and appliance reviews being owned by the drl group :
neutral	if you submit a poor appliance review ; it will never be posted on their site .
neutral	trust me i have tried with two of the appliances purchased from ao , but when i wrote a glowing review on my last appliance , it was posted by the end of the day .
neutral	i ' m_sure ao will claim different : but if that was the case : where are my poor reviews ?
neutral	?
neutral	the drawback of this : potential_customers are led to believe a product is good when maybe it is not so good .
neutral	my advise is always check reevoo for reviews on products and not appliance reviews ; before you buy .
neutral	or check the web for a non related drl outlet for reviews .
neutral	i purchased three white goods items from ao from glowing_reviews and been let_down twice ,
neutral	i would shop again at ao but i would do my homework elsewhere first before i hit the buy button .
neutral	ive had to send one addissas jacket returns .
neutral	my mistake . bra fits nicely & like it .
neutral	please now will you snd me my voucher for £_00 for nike jacket i returned .
neutral	i need it to spend more now .
neutral	also credit my bank for addidas jacket i orded 0 of .
neutral	thanks very much .
neutral	regards to wiggle .
neutral	mrs_j langan
neutral	p . s these things iv ` e mentioned are just teething probs . also could you put my profile back on reviews
neutral	they do tell you that the budget range of glasses ship from hong_kong but they do not tell you you have to pay vat on anything over £_00 .
neutral	even worse they do not tell you that royal_mail will charge you an £ 0 handling_fee as well .
neutral	if you add the 00_% vat and the £ 0 royal_mail charge it may be cheaper to buy elsewhere .
neutral	do your sums first before ordering from them .
neutral	other_firms offer the day before gauranteed odds as ladbrokes used too .
neutral	i was unaware due to a missed email that ladbrokes had changed their policy to after 00am on the day being gauranteed !
neutral	other_firms offer better odds in general plus the ability to put your bets on the night before with some of your bets being gauranteed .
neutral	this is swaying my loyalty from ladbrokes unfortunately .
neutral	i have looked at other reviews regarding the above and there has_been comments saying it is very close to drum tobacco , this i don_'_t see .
neutral	the sweetness is there but too much caramel flavour overpowers what would be a very pleasant taste
neutral	order q0000000 flowers nice but why was there no card attached and delivery did not ring the bell
neutral	it '_s was disappointing that having paid good money to send flowers to our daughters mrs christina coldman that she happen to stumble upon them in the evening .
neutral	why did the delivery people not ring the doors bell and most disappointing there was no card inside .
neutral	please look i to the matter as this has totally spoilt the surprise
neutral	the other flowers i orders did have a card
neutral	thank_you

neutral	i use beauty expert but not often as i have problems with their promo codes and the customer service is so slow in replying the code has expired anyway !
neutral	they are not as cheap as some other_sites i use and are not quick delivery .
neutral	ok but dont use much
neutral	free gift offered via [_external link_removed_] was not honoured .
neutral	the pods fit and release .
neutral	the coffees , however , have a certain watered - down quality , lacking intensity and " bite ".
neutral	i '_ll pay the extra for the quality of the real thing .
neutral	really needed back support belt , paid for first_class delivery but had to chase company twice when item didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	finally sent by fedex next_day delivery , so got there in the end
neutral	good service , but for the small user , like me , it comes at quite a price ( 0 . 0 % + 00p_per transaction ).
neutral	i get people to pay through online_banking as much as possible to avoid the high charges .
neutral	i would encourage more people to use paypal if the chagres were lower .
neutral	the last two times i have used your organisation to send flowers to my mother - in - law in a nursing home in the uk i have had real problems submitting my message and uploading a photo of her great grand children to send with the flowers .
neutral	this means more hassle for me as i do not know what has actually been uploaded to your site hence i have to send emails_requesting details and adding the information again as well as having to incur another international bank fee for the additional transaction of emailing the photo to your office .
neutral	i am seriously_considering trying to find some other company to give my business to ................
neutral	the service was excellent but i was disappointed in the car .
neutral	having opted for a cheap car i still expected to get a car that was newer and with less body damage .
neutral	perhaps i was unlucky but the car supplied should not on reflection been in a hire pool
neutral	not keen on itunes , but the apple operating_system once you have sussed it is great .
neutral	have just purchased an ipad0 and think the technology superb but overpriced for what it is .
neutral	i find itunes expensive for what it is , ostensibly a record store with few overheads .
neutral	very arrogant in their dealings with the public .
neutral	ipad is a better set of people , although still overpriced .
neutral	i was disappointed with the first courier who bid and won the order , when just before they were due to collect the item they backed out due to transport problems .
neutral	this was the first transaction they were doing on shiply , perhaps you should check them out more thoroughly before allowing them onto your site .
neutral	this is the 0nd time this has happened and trying to get your deposit back from a failed job is a nightmare .
neutral	on a positive_note the courier i used in the end was good .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	this is the second time that roses have drooped within 00_hours !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the online booking was easy and everything was clearly_stated in the small_print . my car was provided by alamo at dulles usa ..
neutral	the transport to and from the airport was very good .
neutral	all i have to say is that i was disappointed by the highly pressurised and unethical sales technique of the alamo representative .
neutral	i had booked a basic car which was adequate but the man immediately said the car i had ordered was tiny for us and 0 moderate cases .
neutral	i had paid up front and he was upgrading me .
neutral	in the past upgrades when offered have been free but he was charging $_000 more without telling_me .
neutral	i enquired specifically if i was being charged and he said i was .
neutral	i was unhappy with that so he said as i was travelling with united airlines he would reduce to $_000 .
neutral	my wife liked the upgrade car but hadnt actually seen the one we booked .
neutral	when i asked to see the car i had booked it was perfectly adequate with a good sized boot that would have taken our cases .
neutral	i was on two crutches due to an injury and tired from the flight and my wife was unhappy about completing paperwork again so we took the upgrade but were not happy with the unethical tactics .
neutral	the representative also tried to imply that the upgrade would be better as we would not suffer any allergies and the original car may cause allergic reactions as it had done 00 , 000_miles .
neutral	the thing is another rep who was serving the customer next to me was confronted with the same unethical sales_pitch stating the car he had ordered was tiny .
neutral	be very careful when dealing_with reps for alamo at dulles airport and don ; t get ripped_off like we did !
neutral	i thought buy now pay later meant what it says , not you have to pay delivery now
neutral	only got one of three items ordered after a delay
neutral	francesca single bed wonderful .
neutral	mattress measured 0inches short of 0ft so i have 0inch gap all around my bed not good sizing uncomfortable
neutral	company was good to deal with on the phone but their warehouse let them down as there were essential parts missing from my order - the warehouse claimed everything was in the package for the courier .
neutral	the courier delivered the package which was undamaged and not open so i guess i was being blamed although i do not know why .
neutral	in the end , after a few calls i managed to get them to send out the missing_parts as the rest of the order would have been useless to me .
neutral	somewhat disapppointed .
neutral	clearly the warehouse had not bothered to check the order .
neutral	website is a bit tacky .
neutral	needs a re - design .
neutral	content and forums are good .
neutral	but martin needs to blow his budget on the design .
neutral	the product , when it finally arrived was first_class and exceptional .
neutral	but their standard 0st_class posting was not good , and despite talking to their customer_services " team " felt unimpressed .
neutral	would i buy from them again ; yes .
neutral	but next_day delivery ( despite the extra ) a must .....
neutral	the eye_test went ok although none of the tests were explained to me .
neutral	th optician suggested varifocals but when she handed me over to a colleague he did everything he could to talk me out of them trying to get me to buy two_sets of glasses instead .
neutral	one for long disrtance & one for vdu & reading .
neutral	bought items pre christmas , delivery came 0 th january .
neutral	cant check status of order or no updates
neutral	need to improve customer_relations but clothes were worth it .
neutral	delivery was really quick , but would have liked a little more info on the product on the web_site , took a chance on the gloves having leashes .
neutral	used the live_chat service to ask the question but no one replied :(
neutral	i love the products but find the na icon next to loads of products that i usually buy , they are essentials as well like atomisers and my chosen liquid .
neutral	the liquid is offered in 000ml bottles then they go down to 00ml bottles if you can get them .
neutral	the site is easy for me to use now but for someone new it isn_'_t as i have introduced loads of folks but i have had to go and show them how to use the site and recommend products all the time .
neutral	it '_s the na that is the most annoying as you have to choose something that isn_'_t the norm .
neutral	regards shakey
neutral	trustpilot '_s income comes from payments from companies who are reviewed .
neutral	a partly negative_review i put up was taken down after 0 months because trustpilot suddenly said it contained " coarse language " - it didn_'_t , and trustpilot did not specify what part of the review was considered " coarse " ( i suspect it was because i said the kitchen was delivered by apes , because of the transit damage it suffered , i would call that fair comment with a hint of humour )
neutral	so remember when you check companies with trustpilot they may have removed negative_reviews at the request of their paymasters
neutral	update - trustpilot has put my review back up , good , but still not sure why they took it down in the first place , but have given them 0_stars now instead of 0 .
neutral	kitchen units are excellent quality at good prices , but remember when ordering they add on delivery , vat , and even extra for drilling door hinges .
neutral	two items were received damaged and unusable , i failed to spot worktop damage until i unpacked it for the install four weeks_later .
neutral	the company refused point_blank to refund anything , so i am down the cost of 0 metres of worktop .
neutral	if you buy from here , unpack everything and inspect on receipt or next_day , it is a pain but could save you lots .
neutral	sent my claim in the middle of august .
neutral	chased them servearl times and they said they hadn_'_t received it .
neutral	i asked for duplicate vouchers so i could send it again and was then told that my claim had arrived and i would get my money within 00 days !!!!!
neutral	that was 0 weeks_ago now and i have emailed them 0 times to chase my money but they are just ignoring me so i will go legal .
neutral	0 / 00 got that nice reply that they were going to look in to it last_week but still_haven_'_t heard a word back or seen any money .
neutral	what a disgusting way to do_business .
neutral	00 / 0 / 00 sent my next claim first_class so will be interesting to see how many months this will take .
neutral	will update as soon as i hear_anything
neutral	00 / 0 / 00 i got my money today so it took only 0 and a half month this time .
neutral	i have changed my rating from 0 to 0_stars now .
neutral	:)
neutral	00 / 0 / 00 i am sending my third claim first_class today so i am expecting the money to be paid on the 00th of june .
neutral	will update .
neutral	00 / 0 / 00 i still havent had an_email_confirming they got my letter ( that they signed for on the 00th of may ) after they get that i know they will allow themselves another 00 working_days before they might make the payment and that can apparently take up to 00 working_days .......
neutral	i will keep you updated ....
neutral	00 / 0 00 still no confirmation that they received it so i have changed rating back to 0_stars .
neutral	00 / 0 / 00 money in my bank today !
neutral	will change star_rating now !
neutral	this was actually in time !!!
neutral	!
neutral	very good service , but the sheer fact that you cannot speak with anyone when something_goes_wrong with an online order is extremely frustrating .
neutral	i spent 0 hours trying to make an order .
neutral	the initial problem was a system fault that took 00 emails to rectify .
neutral	also trying to input a voucher_code that was sent to me when i was the recipient of flowers which was from serenata , wasn_'_t recognised , had to email again , twice , and then wait for a response - not great when you are running out of the door to pick kids up from school .
neutral	i do not like the fact that you can only email when something_goes_wrong and it '_s not because of something you have done .
neutral	that said , once the order was eventually received on time - the recipient was delighted .
neutral	0_stars for that , but the fact that you can '_t talk to someone , 0_stars deducted .
neutral	quick , efficient service , excellent camera ( fz00 ), could have bought it cheaper elsewhere , but more risky ...
neutral	nice quality though unexpectedly the pilot holes did not match the holes already prepared in my brand_new bed so quite a degree of competent diy woodwork was required to ensure it was fitted , with stability , to my new bed .
neutral	collect_plus lost my last package , so i was anxious about using the service again .
neutral	added extra insurance which made the process costly , but this time the package made it to its destination .
neutral	bought a sony rx000 at a very good price but it took 0 days to get here .
neutral	order delayed by security check involving sending copy of latest utility_bill which i provided on the same day as the order .
neutral	i buy off the internet all the time but i '_ve never had to do this before .... very strange ??
neutral	ordered 00pm wed but not dispatched until friday due to security check .
neutral	website says orders shipped next_day delivery but actually it '_s next working day so didn_'_t get here until monday_afternoon .
neutral	good communication but if you want it asap keep an eye on your emails after you place order so that you can send a copy of utility_bill and avoid adding to lead time .
neutral	if you don_'_t check your email for a few_days you '_ll probably be looking at 0 days or more .
neutral	both shower_trays arrived damaged , this was only discovered when all the packaging was removed to fit the trays .
neutral	wd bathrooms refused to replace the trays and were not prepared to discuss this as the trays were not reported as damaged within 00_hours .
neutral	we did contact wd bathrooms within their stated 00 day window for returns .
neutral	the damage to the trays was covered by the polystyrene that is supposed to protect the trays in transit , so was not visible on initial inspection .
neutral	had to buy two different shower_trays .
neutral	i was contacted later and offered a full_refund for the trays , which i accepted .
neutral	the delivery policy states that heavy items , such as shower_trays will arrive on a pallet if they arrive loose they will probably have been damaged by the courier .
neutral	so inspect carefully .
neutral	nice flowers and great being_able to order in the evening for the next_day .
neutral	its a real shame that they can '_t read though , as i requested the delivery for after 0 pm to welcome a friend into her new home .
neutral	were delivered around 00 am and left on the step .
neutral	i ordered an aquael fish_tank set_up which was promptly sent and very well_packed , however the heater supplied is not up to the job and is clearly_marked as being for a smaller fish_tank .
neutral	i contacted rocket about this but they do not seem interested in correcting the mistake . with a bit more customer after care they could have got full_marks .
neutral	the case was not as shown in photo , more plastic and very cheap looking .
neutral	not worth the money and unfair i would have to pay to return the item .
neutral	accepted a small discount but considered purchase a waste of money .
neutral	ordered what i thought was a buy one , get one free item .
neutral	the acknowledgement stated that it was yet when i received half what i was expecting , i was told that the item is no_longer part of the buy one , get one free range .
neutral	not happy as i thought i was paying for 000 tablets , when in fact i was only paying for 000 .
neutral	will not order again .
neutral	we received the blind bent , the black out does not go all the way to the edge , slightly to long and slightly not wide enough .
neutral	we have recommended you to many people hope its not the manufacure going abraod thats spoilt the quality ....
neutral	having tried several_times to register and place an order from my pc using xp i was unable to do so .
neutral	it kept telling_me to enable cookies .
neutral	i followed your instructions but still could not connect .
neutral	in the end i used my wifes laptop using windows 0 and succeeded in placing the order .
neutral	i look_forward to receiving my product in good time when you reopen after christmas .
neutral	happy new year .
neutral	i was looking for tickets and found that site was good and enabled_me to even see what block i was trying to buy .
neutral	they also offered them at a competative price .
neutral	that was months_ago and had a call the week before last asking them to ring them .
neutral	the first problem was that they do not open till later in the morning and then it is impossible to get through till much later as so many people have had to wait .
neutral	this is made worse by not being open in the evening .
neutral	so my advise wait_till midday , not sure what you do if you cannot phone from work .
neutral	when i did get thorough they said that me billing and delivery address did not match , which was not true .
neutral	anyway i though it was sorted .
neutral	then someone rang my house again yesterday saying that i had not rung back , which i had .
neutral	eventually got through again to be told the tickets had already been dispatched !
neutral	i recived them today .
neutral	come on double0 sort it out does the left hand no what the right is doing ?
neutral	the ink arrived after a 00 day wait i had tied to contact the company by phone and email on several occassions no answer
neutral	but i must_say the ink is spot on and value for money if they sorted the communication problem out this company would be a class outfit
neutral	the latest price drop seems to be a bit of a con so far as i am concerned !
neutral	!
neutral	great site and service until you need to send something back .
neutral	for the first time one product ( 00 x kinesiology tape pink 0 . 0cm x_0m ) was not good and i am trying to send it back but the responses i got from the enquiry site were confusing .
neutral	it took 0 emails to get a clear response .
neutral	i have not yet even received my ink so cant really say at moment but if and when i do i give you a review
neutral	the rate was good and service spot on .
neutral	however , the website , page one , appears to have never been sense tested
neutral	the service and transaction were fine .
neutral	no_problems , to coin a phrase .
neutral	if ever i were to purchase another wetsuit i would consider_using this firm again : but one wetsuit in a life time should be enough , surely .
neutral	thanks for asking me my opinion : anytime at all !
neutral	there was a delay in sending the item , as i was sent a questionnaire concerning my use of the product and requesting personal medical details .
neutral	i have never had a problem obtaining this medicine elsewhere .
neutral	when i tried to cancel the order , i was sent a further communication , saying that the questionnaire was not necessary and that the item had been shipped .
neutral	the item then arrived promptly and was as advertised .
neutral	we have been with virgin for years because we just cannot get the same broadband service elsewhere but if i am being honest i find their tele vision packages really expensive when you compare their charges to everyone elses even after taking into account loyalty discounts .
neutral	our area has_gone digital so we recently upgraded our service to include the new tivo box ( more money ) - great box with some really nice features but not as intuitive as the sky box and the fact that you cannot turn off some of the features for example child protection is really frustrating as you cant watch anything during the day that you recorded at night without having to enter a pin number every time such a pain in a household full of adults
neutral	i was pleasantly_surprised that check - in for the flight from manchester and return from arrecife was very quick .
neutral	other_airlines should learn from jet0 .
neutral	unfortunately , on both flights the rear cabin was extremely hot ( it reached 00c on the back row ), whilst the front of the plane was cold ( 00c , with people using blankets ).
neutral	on the return flight they had run out of ice , and the drinks were 00c ( i happen to carry a digital thermometer for work , and had it with me !).
neutral	i had bought the offer of 0 x 000ml cans of magners cider for £_00 to try to cool down .
neutral	my partner and i had one each , but couldn_'_t face the third , so asked if we could either have a cold one , or return it for a partial_refund .
neutral	we were told this was not possible .
neutral	i used p0g to send two parcels to the netherlands from manchester , using fedex .
neutral	collection was for the friday , and went as planned .
neutral	after the weekend , i decided to look at the tracking - and the p0g site did not help , all i could see was that it had been collected .
neutral	i used " live_chat " to find out how to find the fedex tracking_number , and had to search the pdf file for the information , and guess which was the second tracking_number .
neutral	( not very helpful ).
neutral	now i could see that one of the parcels was in holland ready for delivery , but the other had gone from manchester to london , to paris , then cologne .
neutral	after another couple of days , the first parcel had been delivered , but the second had now gone back to paris , back to london , back to paris , and then to holland , and might be delivered the next_day .
neutral	now i realise that the fault here was with fedex , but i had contacted p0g " live_chat " again in the meantime to find out what was going on .
neutral	the first agent allowed the " chat " to time - out , and the second promised to email me the following_day .
neutral	i never_heard back from either of them .
neutral	this is the second 0 . 0kg bag of complete protein i have purchased from bulk_powders .
neutral	the first bag was fine , although it did have a small_amount of brown crusty bits in the mixture , but they were few and far between and i could scoop them out before making the mix .
neutral	the second bag however , has quite a lot of white bits , right throughout the mix and , no matter how hard i shake , these white bits will not dissolve , making the mix a little bit lumpy and less enjoyable .
neutral	the good points are that it tastes great and is reasonably_priced , but i am a little_concerned about the inconsistent quality and may consider trying another supplier for my next purchase .
neutral	also , being in a sack makes it quite messy to use , so i would rather pay a little more for a tub .
neutral	the service from bulk_powders is good , but it says £ 0 . 00 for next_day dpd delivery and both my orders have taken two days to arrive rather_than one , but good tracking is provided and the carrier emails you a 0 hour time_slot that your order will be delivered in , which makes_life easier .
neutral	after looking around at my regular suppliers online stores , i decided to try proviation for my next new bit of kit ( a £_000 radio .)
neutral	as proviation had the same radio £_00 cheaper_than my usual suppliers and the website seemed to say all the right things regarding service , delivery etc .
neutral	the radio was shown as ' in stock ' ( in two places on the website ) and it was stated that it would be dispatched via courier if the order was placed before 00 . 00 .
neutral	this was ok as i assumed by ordering on a thursday_night , my order would ship on the friday and thus be with me the following_tuesday ( after the back holiday .)
neutral	not so !
neutral	after a few_days i noticed that my order had not yet shipped .
neutral	i hadn_'_t had any notification of a problem from proviation , so i emailed them .
neutral	at this point i was informed that the radio was in fact not in stock , and it would be a couple more days before they had more delivered .
neutral	ok i thought , no problem .
neutral	however unfortunately the radio was not shipped a couple of days_later .
neutral	after a few email '_s back and forth , my radio actually shipped 0 days after_placing the order .
neutral	i was a little disheartened at this point and contacted proviation again to at_least get the tracking_number for my order , i expected that after the above delays that this would be shipped 00hour next_day delivery .
neutral	i was again disappointed , as it seemed my £_000 order was now being dispatched by royal_mail '_s plain old recorded delivery service .
neutral	not ups or interlink_express as ' again ' stated on the website .
neutral	my order has finally turned_up , 00 days after_placing it , even on opening the package there was a bit of a surprise ... my order had actually been shipped from one of the other online companies i usually deal with , not proviation or icom .
neutral	if something is not ' in stock ', it really shouldn_'_t be shown as being ' in stock '!
neutral	purchased an item and paid for ' express delivery ' that added approx £_00 to total_cost as i wanted the item urgent .
neutral	statement below " express delivery " on their web_site says " orders placed before_midday will be dispatched the same day if the product is shown to be " in stock " on our website when you place your order " no ifs or buts , just a clear promise to dispatch that day provided it was in stock , you order by midday and you pay the premium .
neutral	my item was not dispatched until the following afternoon but thankfully it arrived within_00hours due to an efficient ups service .
neutral	i complained to customer_services and the repeated response was i got the item within 00_hours .
neutral	i have no issue with that but believe part of the premium i paid for " express delivery " was to have the item dispatched that day .
neutral	a fact customer_services and a response from head_office fail to appreciate .
neutral	pixmaina don_'_t make promises that you don_'_t intend to honor .
neutral	extract from web_site :
neutral	" express delivery "
neutral	" parcels sent using this method of delivery are usually delivered within 00 - 00_hours , between 0 a . m . and 0 p . m . monday to friday .
neutral	orders placed before_midday will be dispatched the same day if the product is shown to be " in stock " on our website when you place your order ."
neutral	the item i ordered was an iomega ego mac edition portable external_hard_drive - 0 tb , white .
neutral	the mac edition backup software does not work with the mac lion x operating software as it turns_out , with no solution according to iomega .
neutral	would have been nice if someone had made that clear when ordering or at_least on iomegas ' website before they let you download and fail to install the software .
neutral	it `_s been a sort of up and down three years .
neutral	it hasn ` t gotten better each year as the one i ` m using at the moment uses all the resources when updating and so everything else slows down to a crawl .
neutral	i ` ve had a few_times when i have had to reboot the computers because bit defender isn ` t working , this didn ` t happen with previous versions .
neutral	i would have given it more stars but for the constant checking that it `_s still working properly .
neutral	first off i '_ve got to commend upon price point .
neutral	they had what i wanted at a price that couldn_'_t be beat .
neutral	unfortunately the goods weren_'_t in stock and it took overly long to be delivered .
neutral	they did keep me informed , and the short email conversation i had was polite and helpful .
neutral	when the goods were delivered they gave me an extra which will probably come in handy .
neutral	just a shame that i had to wait a week longer_than i ' d hoped .
neutral	ordered 0 items .
neutral	0 arrived together and 0 separately .
neutral	no problem as i was advised in advance .
neutral	product as advertised and seems a fair price
neutral	however since placing the order i have had numerous cold calls for disability equipment which can only have come from this order .
neutral	i placed my order for a friend and i thankfully am not disabled and have never ordered anything_else like this before .
neutral	have used bhl a couple of times no_problems and delivery is pretty good within a couple of days e_mails giving day of delivery fine ,
neutral	only 0 complaint pictures by the order numbers not always correct wanted a 00mm lockshield with drain off rad valve looked at the pictures for the one 0 wanted ordered it but received just an ordanary lockshield double_checked the writing at the side of the picture it was describing an ordanary ls valve part number 000000 did e_mail to complain but no reply , so bhl can you double_check pictures correspond to the descriptions please , otherwise pleased with the service and will use again thanks
neutral	ordered and paid for two of the same items only one turned_up .
neutral	contacted the seller who informed me that another would be sent , at the moment we are still_waiting for the second to turn_up , will give it a few more days before contacting the company again .
neutral	i have tried to order several things from next on the " order before 0 . 00 p . m . - receive next_day " service as advertised on tv .
neutral	however , the items that i have wanted have never been available on this service .
neutral	is the advertising misleading ?
neutral	one word .
neutral	crap .
neutral	two and a half weeks to deliver a shower_mixer .
neutral	i don_'_t call that excellent .
neutral	made a complaint and the mixer was delivered two days_later .
neutral	so thanks for that .
neutral	got the game watch dogs xbox one day after the release_date by courier , not happy poor service
neutral	i would prefer to have the option of paying in advance , to avoid potential changes in the price due to variations in the exchange_rate .
neutral	also like to pay all taxes up front ( and to have them added to the price in the search ) to see + 00 . 0 % is not very helpful !
neutral	otherwise a good site and good prices .
neutral	also found you had availability when others didn_'_t , such as my preferred site hotels . com .
neutral	( i only prefer it because of the issues listed above , and because i can earn loyalty_points with them !)
neutral	thank_you for letting me feedback .
neutral	nicki
neutral	i always look on trustpilot before making a purchase on any major items to see what others are saying about the company involved and if their customer service is generally good .
neutral	things can occasionally go_wrong with even the best of companies but how they handle any error is the ultimate test of any company !
neutral	i do find the reviews really helpful when making my decision but i have to take some of them " with a pinch of salt ".
neutral	i have found , on several_occasions , reviews for some companies seem to be very similar , using exactly the same wording / phrases as each other and all by reviewers with just the one review each to their name .
neutral	these " fake " reviews seem to come in batches with several all being posted on the same day ( and then gaps of sometimes weeks in between until the next " batch " is posted again )!
neutral	!
neutral	call me cynical but i do think that some companies actually put on their own " fake " reviews to help boost their ratings which ultimately makes a mockery of the review system .
neutral	i appreciate it is difficult for trustpilot to monitor all reviews being added to their site so beware and make_sure you read a good sample of reviews before making your final_decision on a companies online reviews .
neutral	i have used this service several_times and all my parcels have arrived on time so no_problems there .
neutral	the only issues i have had is with their admin / website which was not sending me confirmation emails / invoices every time i booked a delivery online .
neutral	what should have been a simple solution they managed to turn into a major incident !!!!
neutral	their admin did not seem to have a clue what they were doing .
neutral	even took it to management level and in the end the only solution they could come up with was it was " my computers fault " - totally untrue ( which we did point out to them ).
neutral	in the end we gave up !
neutral	!
neutral	we now you myhermes ( who we get an_immediate_confirmation from as soon as we place our order ) as i really could not be bothered trying to get any sense out of them as i was beginning to loose the will to live !!
neutral	!
neutral	ebay can be very good - as long as you don_'_t have a problem .
neutral	the minute something_goes_wrong and you have to contact their customer service that '_s where things go_wrong .
neutral	over the years i have had to contact ebay customer service a few_times and have never been happy with the service .
neutral	if you go on live_chat they don_'_t seem to have a clue what they are doing and take an_absolute age to answer every time you ask a question .
neutral	i have been on live_chat trying to resolve things for up to 0 hours at a time ( probably because you wait around 00_minutes in between each question before you get an answer !!
neutral	).
neutral	the emails to customer service are not much_better .
neutral	they tend to send you standard " cut and paste " answers - not really reading the question you have asked .
neutral	the only way to get anything done at ebay is to ring them direct - even then they are hit and miss .
neutral	shame about the customer service otherwise a good company
neutral	i continue to use barringtons but am occasionally choosing to buy elsewhere because of your delivery charges - your options are not always the cheapest and more frustratingly you have accepted the order when you have not had the product in stock which has caused frustrating delays
neutral	there used to be a price range selection - where is it ?
neutral	i hate wasting time looking at hotels that are too expensive or too cheap !
neutral	overall the london pass and travel card was great , our only_criticism would be that the guide would have been helpful to advise the places you can no take photography .
neutral	for example the royal_albert_hall , westminster abbey , not been able to take photos of this internal splendider but the brakes on my partners enthusiasm .
neutral	had we known no photography was allowed we would have bypassed theses attractions , instead of rushing to get in and been disappointed .
neutral	and fitted in more of the other_places we missed going .
neutral	get the travel pass saves so much time and money
neutral	we '_ve been with seiretto for around 0 years but will be moving away soon .
neutral	our need for storage has grown and despite tumbling storage costs in that period , the disk space included in our package has not increased , neither has the cost of additional storage reduced .
neutral	we can get more than ten times the disk space for half the price elsewhere .
neutral	if you are certain that you only need the meagre space allowance you get with seiretto then i can recommend them ; if not , then look_elsewhere .
neutral	you will find em everywhere but if you look harder you can usually find most things cheaper .
neutral	i suppose your paying for convenience
neutral	your service brilliant till the point the phone arrives , after that you not really care to much , as you send me to samsung warranty .
neutral	i glad i did that because they do briliant service and i cannot say about you .
neutral	we need a new contract again for my wife next month as well .
neutral	that will be samsung again but i ' m not sure about affordable mobile
neutral	regards
neutral	mr k kosa
neutral	ordered item on 0th_december , not had it by 00th so emailed .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	phoned , and spoke to a very helpful assistant who indicated that delivery was awaiting a part of the order .
neutral	he said it would be sent next_day .
neutral	got email_saying it would be with me in 0 deliveries , 00st and 00nd .
neutral	as it happened , both came on 00nd .
neutral	one item had had to be re - wrapped by delivery service .
neutral	so - happy it arrived in time for christmas , not too happy about late delivery due to ( a minor ) part of the order not being in stock when ordered .
neutral	would have appreciated being told that , and having the choice of waiting for all parts to arrive , or having a split delivery .
neutral	can find it difficult to find what i am looking for instore , prefer to look online to find out what is instore .
neutral	lingerie staff very helpful
neutral	well i started out by ordered a siemens sl00 waited 0 days then was told they did not have any that could be sold must_admit got a refund straight_away then i went for a samsung grade a only to be told again they only had a grade bso i said ok ordered my phone on thursday still_waiting hopefully it will turn_up on tuesday lets_hope so
neutral	i try to use whenever shopping online .
neutral	most big or well_known suppliers offer a form of cashback thru the site but its often longwinded & your not prompted if your claim has to be made within a certain time or given any e_mail notice if a supplier decides to revoke an offer .
neutral	eg talktalk switchover was delayed by talktalk so it seems the transaction didnt qualify in time for a cashback .
neutral	worth it for purchases you would have made anyway , do your research before to ensure your not paying over the odds for a product on the site but dont count on getting the cashback as the goal posts can be moved without warning , so anything you do earn is a bonus ..
neutral	flight centre are very helpful and definitely try to get you the best deal possible .
neutral	however my recent experiences suggests that you have check you '_ve got exactly_what you want as the airlines aren_'_t averse from cancelling your supposed " reservation " and suddenly you ' re having to make compromises - had to accept different airports for traveling out and returning which caused huge logistical issues !!!
neutral	it seems the relationship between airlines and the people who sell their seats isn_'_t as harmonious as you ' d imagine !!
neutral	!
neutral	some excellent prices but the last couple of times i have paid by paypal i have had to ring and get my goods despatched .
neutral	money has always been taken but it doesn_'_t seem to trigger the delivery .
neutral	i ordered my kit because it was shown as instock and 00 hour delivery .
neutral	unfortunately it was apparently out of stock .
neutral	no one rang me and it took me to contact them .
neutral	they are friendly and apologetic , and assured me they would be in within 0 days .
neutral	i needed this for a gig i wanted to do , it arrived later than , but i stuck with the company .
neutral	i could have ordered elsewhere and got it within 00_hours , so the website should reflect the true stock_levels .
neutral	thanks
neutral	good value for money store , good if you like a lot of clothes and don_'_t overwear them .
neutral	we are a throwaway society now , so primark suits the uk .
neutral	i have bb , phone , tv and calls with talktalk ( ex - tiscali customer ).
neutral	everything was fine until talktalk took over .
neutral	i had problems with the tv , and it took 0 months to resolve .
neutral	still no reason was given , had 0 set - top boxes , new wiring , 0 modems , and still it didn_'_t work .
neutral	possibly a software problem apparently .
neutral	however , everytime i complained , it was given another job number , new instructions and was a nightmare .
neutral	no wonder they have dropped tv from their sales now .
neutral	bb is very slow , only 0 . 0 mb '_s , but i will stick with them until something_goes_wrong again .
neutral	then , it hurts but i '_ll have to go with virgin , the worst sales company in the world !
neutral	but it '_s a good bb / tv service .
neutral	order placed on june 00th for toilet and basin set , with an expected in stock date of july 0th , with payment taken immediately .
neutral	i received an e_- mail on july 0nd stating the itmes wouldn_'_t be in stock until around july 00th .
neutral	i replied_saying that was too late for me as my builder is due to start work week_commencing 00th_july and i requested a refund of monies paid .
neutral	i '_ve had no reply to that e_- mail or to thecompany '_s customer_services website form and telephoning is a waste of time and money as you are just held up in a queue due to operators being busy ( must be all their disgruntled_customers ).
neutral	i have just checked my credit_card account and a refund is yet to be made .
neutral	the above has_been resolved satisfactorily .
neutral	good for a last resort - on par with tandy
neutral	when i first wrote a review here , it wasn_'_t good .
neutral	i got an odd message from paypal and the companies site dissapeared .
neutral	all my nerves jangled and i called foul .
neutral	however , i got a message from the director telling_me they ' d have major faults with the web_hosting and the site and email had been down .
neutral	i have since received the goods , very good they are too .
neutral	i '_ve always said that any fool can get things right , it '_s how you ' re treated when it goes_wrong that counts .
neutral	i ' d say this company pulled themselves out of the mire and has now realised a few home truths about social_media and the importance of being in contact with your customers .
neutral	i would in retrospect deal with this company again as they offer a quality product at a very keen price .
neutral	i was impressed by the range of equipment that scubastore had and on that basis moved away from my usual on line scuba gear retailer .
neutral	however i was very disappointed that it took over a week for my goods to reach me .
neutral	both scubastore and dpd were blaming each other .
neutral	in the end , i received my order just in the nick of time but i really could have done without the hassle
neutral	fab idea , flowers were beautiful , delivery bit worrying as to office address and then noticed they deliver up to 0pm !
neutral	whoops could have been a disaster - disappointed that the birthday balloon was a mothers_day balloon so that went in the bin !
neutral	shame really because just been emailed to say flowers for my mother tomorrow won_'_t have a mothers_day balloon although i had ordered it !
neutral	have another delivery for monday for a work_colleague - let '_s see if this one goes without a hitch !
neutral	mondays flowers were very nice and delivered in the morning .
neutral	i think serenata_flowers need to take a look at what is being ordered - the vase that went with the mothers_day flowers was far too small to take the flowers that were ordered .
neutral	if i use this service again i will not be adding any extras such as balloons and vases
neutral	i ordered a small chest_freezer for my new conservatory and was extremely pleased with both the price , free delivery and the speed of the delivery .
neutral	but afterwards received a call from a rep who after a very pleasant chat then got me to sign up for what i thought was a bargain service deal .
neutral	this came_across with the comment that any_problems would be dealt_with and if need be the freezer would be replaced free of charge and that ' you will never have to buy another freezer again '.
neutral	at no time was this mentioned as insurance or extended_warranty as i would not have accepted either as my house insurance would cover the first and after a bitter experience years_ago never accept so called extended_warranties .
neutral	i expected within a few_days to receive acknowledgement with details , etc but nothing has ever arrived either by email or post .
neutral	after a week i decided to cancel and sent an_email_confirming this and requesting confirmation but .
neutral	again , no acknowledgement has_been received .
neutral	a few_days_later i was shocked to receive information from an insurance company domestic & general giving details of the direct_debit , etc .
neutral	so ao had not cancelled anything but passed this on to an outside insurance company .
neutral	d & a proved to be terrible to deal with as to contact them you need to ring and pay 0p_per_minute for the privilege .
neutral	to get this done promptly i decided to try that and timed my call .
neutral	after 00_minutes of ' someone will be with you shortly ' i gave up and was going to write .
neutral	however when i sat down to do so and i read the small_print i found that the insurance did not cover ' food spoilage ' and if the unit had to be replaced that was the end of the cover .
neutral	not quite the ' you will never have to buy another freezer again ' statement .
neutral	then i noted they had a website so i went on - line and after going through trying to make contact found they had a complaints on - line form .
neutral	i filled this in and when it was sent i received the message that i would get a response within 00_hours .
neutral	i do not know how they work out their 00_hours considering i did this last friday and it is now thursday the following week and i have still heard_nothing .
neutral	just in case their 00_hours did not work over the weekend i waited until tuesday and then went to my bank for advice and found , luckily , they could cancel this dd .
neutral	a sad episode to what i had been so pleased with at the time .
neutral	took out two policys but didnt recieve them via_email have yet to see if they arrive by post which i asked for too eventually sent one policy by email other one was missing but very helpful and have no doubt they will sort it
neutral	click & collect works well on their site but furniture delivery can be a bit of a nightmare .
neutral	dates changed twice and the delivery driver got lost - a lot .
neutral	unfortunately my order wasn_'_t directed to eflorist '_s nearest agent .
neutral	this delayed their delivery and the recipient had to collect them from the depot .
neutral	i '_ve bought twice from whybuynew and experienced let - downs both times .
neutral	the first was the purchase of a brand_new mackie mixer .
neutral	the mains cable was missing , a minor point but annoying .
neutral	i e_- mailed the seller and they put one in the post straightaway .
neutral	fair_enough , but the mackie desk shouldn_'_t have been opened by them in the first place .
neutral	when you buy an up - market product new you expect it to arrive complete and untouched .
neutral	the second item was a ' b_grade ' ex - display turntable .
neutral	the packaging was scruffy to begin with , looking like it had been sealed and re - sealed a number of times , and the turntable itself was tatty .
neutral	whybuynew '_s description gave the impression the unit would be not far off mint_condition .
neutral	this turntable , parts and perspex cover , however , are in well - used condition and cosmetically unattractive .
neutral	works ok though .
neutral	once_bitten twice shy - twice bitten puts me off buying from whybuynew again .
neutral	a pity because they have an excellent inventory of products .
neutral	i bought the vacuum which is great .
neutral	i then bought the garden hedge_trimmer , forgetting i had a £_00 credit to claim .
neutral	immediately after buying the trimmer , i emailed gtech to see if i could have the £_00 credited - never got a sensible response .
neutral	won_'_t but anything_else now until they give me the credit .
neutral	wanted to buy skins but noone called me back
neutral	i found the bigdug website well_presented and laid_out , a wide_range of products but i think the minimum delivery charge is expensive .
neutral	rubbersole were good and despatched quickly .
neutral	but , they use hermes , presumably because they ' re cheap .
neutral	well , it shows .
neutral	hermes are rubbish .
neutral	next_day delivery turns into three or four days , if you ' re lucky .
neutral	to be fair , rubbersole tried to track down my delivery but they were just as unsuccessful as me .
neutral	eventually it arrived , nothing to do with either of us chasing , hermes just delivered when they felt like it .
neutral	the products are price are great though .
neutral	very fast delivery , a great looking chair but the assembly was a nightmare .
neutral	supposed to be assembled in 0 mins it was great till i got to the bolts the hole on the arms didn_'_t align up to the holes in the seat properly in fact i still got one bolt i couldn_'_t put in the hole were a good half inch out .
neutral	i followed the video it still took me over an_hour and it took 0 people to assemble
neutral	most time '_s i use it cards arrive on time but last 0 were a day late .
neutral	when you try call customer service your kept on hold forever then when you eventually get through they say bad line and u get cut_off !
neutral	also when you email its takes days for them to get back to you !!
neutral	!
neutral	although i got what i ordered in time it all seemed a bit uncertain when it came to picking_up the parcel from a drop box and waiting for periodic updates / texts etc .
neutral	i am probably the sort of person who struggles with the impersonal nature of this type of transaction and would have much preferred to pick_up the item from the newbury warehouse where i could have had a conversation with a human_being .
neutral	i also didn_'_t like having to pay extra to pick_up an item from a drop box .
neutral	to be quite honest if pageant fancy_dress in newbury had been open on mondays i would have simply gone in there , had a browse and and picked something up .
neutral	as i needed to order something quickly jokers masquerade made that possible , although because i couldn_'_t talk to anyone i felt quite nervous until i had the item in my hands .
neutral	i purchased a sharp 00 " hd combi tv / dvd on 0 / 00 and paid for courier delivery all by credit_card .
neutral	subsequently received an_email next_day to confirm my order .
neutral	after 0 days nothing arrived ( had been checking status of order online which wasn_'_t changing - kept indicating pending , awaiting despatch )
neutral	rang cs number several_times over a two day period .
neutral	( always being kept waiting for an operator ).
neutral	eventually told on 00 / 00 by a cs lady that my order was overlooked and that she would chase it and get item despatched , and would send me an_email to confirm this .
neutral	no email received , so i emailed them again and phoned twice more ( don_'_t bother registering for a return call as no one bothers ringing back !)
neutral	overnight the status of my order went from pending to approved - but now says ' out of stock ' so rang pixmania again 00 / 00 and eventually got through to an operator who confirmed no stock & no expected delivery from suppliers .
neutral	i asked to speak to a supervisor and was told now possible .
neutral	i said i wanted compensation as i would now have to pay a higher price for the same tv elsewhere and would have to travel 0 miles to collect one as home delivery was not an option .
neutral	cs operator told me company do not pay compensation so no point her asking a manager - which i insisted she do in the form of a complaint as i had a contract with pixmania , and the error lies completely with the company .
neutral	the item was in stock when i bought it - my payment was taken in good faith that they would deliver in accordance with the web promise of fast delivery within their specified set time frame .
neutral	the cs lady told me she will cancel the order within 00_hours and it should be a further 0 working_days for the bank to refund the money to my credit_card .
neutral	in the mean time i am £_000 short of cash .
neutral	i can '_t buy the replacement item from another ( reliable ) company till next week .
neutral	it will cost me more - through no fault of mine - and if they sell out in the meantime i am stuffed !
neutral	pixmania have proved to be totally unreliable on this occassion and are avoiding accepting that they are entirely at fault .
neutral	do the honourable thing for your customers - pay up and compensate !
neutral	would love to receive a reply from pixmania .......
neutral	follow_up ......
neutral	thanks to rachels ( mediator ) fast intervention my issues with this company have been resolved .- i received my tv by courier the next_day .
neutral	it would have been nice though if the status of my order had been corrected and the company had emailed me to tell me delivery had been arranged , if rachel had not emailed me back so promptly no one would have been at home to sign for the consignment .
neutral	pixmania - please address the issues regarding updating orders and making contact with your customers .
neutral	you are creating unnecessary hassle for both yourself and your customers .
neutral	the only email i received from you was to say my order had been received ( on 0 / 00 )
neutral	thanks rachel - you ' re a star for sorting everything out .
neutral	fast delivery , good price , lovely looking wellies and decent quality unfortunately they are too small !
neutral	normally im size 0 . 0 and all wellies i had in past were in size 0 with plenty of room for thick socks ..
neutral	this time i went for size 0 as have read_reviews saying the wellies come quite small ..
neutral	if i didnt take the ticket off i would have sent them back ..
neutral	i think i should find out about small sizing from the description of the product rather_than the reviews .. easy wellie be more reliable !
neutral	i have bought from honour for a long time , as well as being chief architect for lloyds i am also a professional dj / artiste with a recording contract .
neutral	i '_ve bought stuff from honour and worn it on stage during gigs and have had umpteen comments about how fantastic i look .
neutral	one thing i have learnt tho is their delivery service is a bit poor if you choose the next_day delivery option as 0 out of 0 times - it has never got here the next_day , and the saturday delivery is even worse - that never comes !
neutral	if you dont need their goods in a hurry then fantasic review , otherwise they are not very forthcoming with keeping informed when goods dont turn_up in time and i have a plane to catch !
neutral	look what you are buying , sometimes you can get the items for less then less in other shops .
neutral	sky seem to offer new customers a lot of offers !
neutral	at the moment if you get sky you get 0mhts movies for free .
neutral	what do there loyal_customers get nothing .
neutral	maplin sell stuff you might need suddenly and don_'_t overcharge .
neutral	talktalk had 0 major failing - it was difficult to talk to them !
neutral	i think they have improved over the years , my broadband works quite well and so i '_ve not needed to talk with them for some time .
neutral	the products are more complicated than they need to be and cost much more than when talktalk started .
neutral	i have been with virgin for around 0 months and thought that they would be good .
neutral	well the service is good but their prices are not .
neutral	when i joined they said my broadband and phone would be a certain price , but when i got my first online bill the price was much greater .
neutral	they also have increased my price package by a considerable_amount recently .
neutral	i recently received a phone_call from one of their reps to ask if i would like to have the tv package .... the guy sounded_like a dalek !
neutral	i will stay till my contract runs out then go_elsewhere , but where ?
neutral	i am rewriting my review .
neutral	i gave them a really bad review to get them to actually take notice and refund my money .
neutral	it worked !
neutral	i have received my money and postage .
neutral	so i am not going to give a bad review but i am not going to hide the fact that i had to create a nuisance of myself to get them to take notice .
neutral	so while they seem to have a pretty good reputation overall just bear in mind that if it is wrong they don_'_t jump_through hoops to rectify the situation .
neutral	many_thanks for your help
neutral	i few to malaga from newcastle in the last_week of june ... good price and service both_ways .
neutral	unfortunately , i took_advantage of the ' cheap ' car_hire promotion on the jet0 booking site - with excellent pricing - and the promise of fully comprehensive insurance ...
neutral	sadly so did a lot of other people -- and finished up queuing in the car_rental hall for 0 hot and angry hours before reaching the goldcar desk ...
neutral	there i - and many other people - had the usual haggle over paying ' wheel damage waiver ' fees ... or face the alternative of leaving a huge deposit on your credit_card - despite the so - called fully comprehensive detail on the booking reservation form ... that in itself delayed the queue even longer_than necessary .
neutral	with the excessively priced full_tank of petrol and additional_insurance charge the total price seemed little or no different to the usual alternative rentals ...
neutral	certainly not worth the long wait - which totally spoiled the overall good impression of the jet0 experience !
neutral	!
neutral	sam was helpfull but it took a long time for him to respond i felt like he was being advised what to say or coached
neutral	00 years_ago travelodge were guarentee of an acceptable standard of accomodation at attractive prices .
neutral	now however apart_from special deals they can be uncompetetive and attention to detail in the rooms is lacking in some establishments
neutral	no problem with product - took 00 days to arrive , with no updates or notifications on late delivery .
neutral	i am so impressed - got this mail re my earlier review
neutral	our customer service team have listened back to the call when you placed the order , and you did request the glasses were tinted .
neutral	we ' re sorry we didn_'_t action this at the time , and have refunded the £_00 extra paid for the tint today .
neutral	how good is that !
neutral	i think the breathalyser is pretty reliable but not always functioning properly i . e .
neutral	:
neutral	quite often an error_message appears and one has to start all over again .
neutral	sometimes too often and eventually give up .
neutral	disable parking is on the short side
neutral	i came to you because i saw your ad on tv and i have a bad_experience with t - mobile '_s insurance many_years_ago .
neutral	however , i was a bit_worried when i picked - up a facebook posting from a friend who had lost her phone before_christmas , who described both yourselves and t - mobile as " hopeless ".
neutral	i have always loved i want one of those , the original and the best .
neutral	!!!!
neutral	! unfortunately on this occasion i have not received my xmas jumpers .
neutral	they had been armed as dispatched but were missing from the package i received
neutral	it turned_up a day late but that wasn_'_t too bad .
neutral	big problem is that you can fit lots of clothes in it but it cannot handle the weight and falls over .
neutral	seems it can only hold 0 . 0kg of clothes but it doesn_'_t tell you that when you buy it .
neutral	so a big fail for me .
neutral	can '_t fault mattressonline and would have given 0_stars if it wasn_'_t for the hopeless couriers .
neutral	the mattress was as_described and at a good price but it took 0 days to finally get the mattress after endless phone_calls .
neutral	courier companies seem to assume we all sit about all day waiting for when they can get to us but in reality it is a nightmare keeping the house manned particularly when they don_'_t arrive as promised and don_'_t communicate .
neutral	on the first attempt he couldn_'_t find the house ( no - one else has had a problem ) and gave up .
neutral	i only found out when i rang the company to see why mattress hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	i really feel their poor service let mattressonline down which is why i can only give 0_stars .
neutral	price , s are lately more than shopping around myself or using another comparison_sites .
neutral	we purchased 0 items of furniture , and i have to say i was extremely impressed with the service we received in store , and the fast and efficient delivery of the items , however on receipt 0 of them were damaged .
neutral	a display_unit was damaged so badly it was unusable , and appeared to have been dropped , a chest of drawers had a split in the bottom of a drawer , again unusable and irreparable and the third , a computer_desk , had a large section of filler right in the centre of the desk .
neutral	we went through the procedure to report this , which was straightforward , and then were told they had to send out someone to view the damage / attempt repair .
neutral	they gave us a date 00 days after delivery , however we were then called back and this was changed to a further 0 days after that .
neutral	we now had three large items of furniture in our house , that we were storing for nearly 0 weeks !
neutral	the man came to prepare the report on a friday , and attempted to repair the computer_desk , which was done to an ok standard , but not one that we were happy with , as we could easily see the area that had the filler in and if you ran your hand over it , could feel it was rough .
neutral	we received a call the following wednesday ( nearly another week ) to discuss this report .
neutral	we were offered a discount (£_00 refund ) or a replacement on the drawer unit , a replacement for the display_unit as this was irreparable , and were told that the computer_desk was up to showroom standard so nothing they could do about it !
neutral	my husband is a carpenter / joiner and it was not up to my standard let_alone his !
neutral	we argued this on the phone to be told we could return it for a refund but that we would not be able to receive an exchange - although they were exchanging the other items !
neutral	in the end we agreed to the refund , have ordered another one off the website , which we are hoping may even be delivered the same day as the other items are collected and replaced !
neutral	we now have a further week to wait .....
neutral	i '_ve been with three on and off for almost 00 years and i '_ve seen an awful_lot of changes .
neutral	they are a network of extremes as i '_ll point out during this review .
neutral	first the network is now imho brilliant .
neutral	great coverage in the midlands at_least , almost non - existent dropped calls fast and reliable data and superb download_speeds .
neutral	three have always been at the forefront of innovation and they '_ve now introduced ' ultrafast ' or dc - hsdpa technology - twice the speed of other 0g networks as things stand .
neutral	second - the tarriffs are also incredible - i just signed_up for a sim only data plan 00gb for £_00 .. beat that !
neutral	nobody but nobody comes within a mile .
neutral	three have also pledged not to charge a premium for 0g when they activate it in september .
neutral	again three are out on their own .
neutral	couple this with their outstanding ' one plan ' which gives unlimited data with tethering (!)
neutral	and so far they can '_t lose .
neutral	or can they ...?
neutral	third - the big bluebottle in the ointment - customer service - appalling !
neutral	no other word to describe it .
neutral	i '_ve has all the bother others have mentioned including customer service refusing to cancel my sim only with 00 days notice , staff from india whose english is as much use as my hindi , people with no_idea what they ' re on about .
neutral	in short we need the call_centres here in the uk not india !
neutral	so in summary three are great for the business side of things - a strong network with eye watering deals .
neutral	but all of this is no good if the customer_services is as useless as it is !
neutral	when that gets sorted the other_networks will have a real fight on their hands .
neutral	but until then three will always be fighting with one hand tied behind its back .
neutral	i bought a " coffin " for my son '_s pioneer cdj 000 '_s system the case is very good and fit for purpose but the velcro padding is poorly designed and will need to be re - fixed down .
neutral	there is a lack of padding around the mixer - as mixers come in different dimensions . the delivery service before_xmas was very good .
neutral	while their overseas call_centre is makeshift and tries it '_s best , it '_s engineers almost always seem to be unqualified and unhelpful .
neutral	it really is luck of the drawer on who you get .
neutral	on average it takes three engineers to fix a problem ... which most often has_been caused by their own engineers drilling through their own cables .
neutral	smart people .
neutral	i would score them more favourably than negatively .
neutral	they try their best but they presume they everyone who turns up does so by car - which means that meeting them across one side of the resort to where we had prior arranged ( because they were drinking in a bar ) makes lugging our_luggage inconvenient .
neutral	i would recommend them based on the price but not on their in resort reps who were barring 00 chaotic minutes ( when we couldn_'_t locate them ) unavailable and unhelpful .
neutral	what appears to be good value offered but , after i paid , i received a call to say that the tyres i wanted were unavailable , despite_being shown on the website .
neutral	i was offered an_alternative .
neutral	however , i accepted a refund and bought the tyres i wanted at a local independent supplier for less money .
neutral	ordered the friday_afternoon , got them saturday_morning but the foliage was all poor and wilting , expected better .
neutral	didnt expect much for a £ 0 . 00 cake but it was tiny !
neutral	we were not dropped at the correct terminal and not notified that this was he case .
neutral	we were to be dropped at terminal 0 according to booking .
neutral	not satisfactory
neutral	other speed - tests are far better such as speedtest . net were you get a choice of were you want to ping etc but it is ok .
neutral	paddy power the most generous site and fantastic value .... but the bit part payout on multiple bets like lucky 00s ect is an awful idea and hard to keep track of what your being paid ... for this reason they lose 0_stars
neutral	reported a problem with loo cistern to homeserve , sent a plumber out within a couple of hours .
neutral	nice_guy , replaced the flushing mechanism but after he was finished the loo wouldn_'_t flush at all - not enough flow of water .
neutral	he tried a few things and then blamed the problem on a possible blockage in the drain , or possibly having to replace the entire loo !
neutral	not happy .
neutral	after he was gone we phoned homeserve again and asked for another plumber to come out - eventually after arguing with the call_centre we had a call back from a supervisor who agreed to send another plumber out .
neutral	0nd guy was ace - knew_exactly_what the problem was - the first guy had fitted the wrong part for our unusual loo - it has a " cycloninic " flushing system apparently , rather rare_these days !
neutral	unfortunately he didn_'_t have the right part on his van , but after exploring other options he decided to drive all the way to his own home where he might have the correct_part in his own supply of spares .
neutral	when he came back he hadn_'_t found the right part but managed to cobble together enough parts to get the loo working again , eventually finishing at nearly mid - night - definitely above and beyond the call of duty , what a star !
neutral	meet and greet was fine when leaving gatwick but not so good when coming home .
neutral	followed the instructions i was given about ringing when landing and was asked to ring again when i had cleared customs .
neutral	rang the second time to be told to go to the car_park and the driver would be there shortly , 00_minutes later he arrived hurriedly gave me the keys and said they were late because they had tried to get ahead of themselves and rushed off .
neutral	some of my purchases have been straight_forward .
neutral	others not so and at times had difficulties getting the merchants to do something about it .
neutral	also not always convinced wowchers prices are such a good deal as advertised as have seen some items being sold for less elsewhere .
neutral	bought 0 api test tubes cost over £_00 , found out you can get 00 api test tubes from surrey pet_supplies for just over £_00 plus p_&_p so dont think buying tubes from aquatics_online is a good buy .
neutral	inadequate packing for international_shipping , curry all over everything .
neutral	also happened with marmite .
neutral	no response to my complaints , no improvement to skimpy packing .
neutral	i no_longer order bottled items from bcs .
neutral	i ordered 0mm basix pvc wall paneling and was pleased to see that the way the product had been packaged seemed to be very good .
neutral	unfortunately i ordered the paneling too early so it was left in the packaging for 0 days , but i had no reason to worry because of the excellent packaging .
neutral	the majority of the panels were in a cardboard_box , but there were some that had been loose but well_packed .
neutral	when i opened the loose panels every one had some form of damage , some of the damage was worse_than the others .
neutral	it was my fault for not opening the package within the 00hr return period but it is still disappointing although i ' m_hoping with the allowance i made for off cuts that i will have enough to complete the job .
neutral	it pays to check right away irrespective of how well things seem to be packaged .
neutral	i bought 0 tyres online .
neutral	i had previously checked they were in stock , after giving my postcode .
neutral	i purchased the tyres , and as i could not drive the car i opted for the free mobile fitting , and checked that the following_day was available .
neutral	i was advised that my appointment was " between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 ".
neutral	this i did not find acceptable , so i phoned the helpline .
neutral	i was told that the tyres were in stock , but actually in corby , northants , and no time could be guaranteed for next_day , and may roll over to the following_day .
neutral	in the event , the fitter arrived and did an excellent and professional job about 0 pm ..
neutral	my gripe is that i got the impression from the website , that after checking stock , i could then book an_appointment to suit me for the fitting , but in the end i wasted a whole day as a result of not being totally informed of the reality of the situation .
neutral	d . d . sawdon
neutral	a company should not advertise something as " in stock " when it isn_'_t .
neutral	even after they back - ordered my delivery , the web - site still claimed they had stock for priority despatch .
neutral	having said that , they were efficient in offering an_alternative and that arrived very quickly and well_packaged , plus zero hassle with the refund of the difference in price .
neutral	would i recommend , yes - but be prepared for substitute even if the site says in stock .
neutral	i cannot_believe the reviews i have read , the 00 ' x 00 ' polytunnel i purchased was hardwork to erect , and that '_s after laying a base of 00 " x 0 " sleepers that were spot on level .
neutral	the major problem we had was not having anywhere big and flat enough to lay the four hoop sections level to assemble before fixing together , and i can_assure you that if you don_'_t you will encounter numerous problems .
neutral	i also think the instruction booklet could be improved .
neutral	i purchased a polytunnel from you over 00 years_ago and the instructions were a lot easier to follow .
neutral	i have left the best for last , there is know way you can fix the self tapping screws without self - tapping first .
neutral	i have tried almost every vacuum_cleaner . is dyson , kirby , siemens , the results after using the ram air is astounding to the point of embarrassment . without_doubt a 0 * product .
neutral	the gtech multi is not in the same league . very , very disappointed it is just powerful enough to pickup household dust and is not powerful enough compared to my cheap electric hand vacuum for car carpets .
neutral	i did comment to customer_services in case it was faulty . the test is .
neutral	if it can pick_up a £_00 note then its okay , which it did .
neutral	not good enough to valet cars also velcro is not thick enough .
neutral	not good enough
neutral	so if you want to hoover you car carpets stay_clear even the velcro is also very thin .
neutral	that '_s is the only reason that i have given a 0 *
neutral	. i expected a faster service than received .
neutral	£ 0 for carriage is a bit excessive when compared with tesco / argos etc .
neutral	i had requested the house plant to be delivered on 00 / 00 .
neutral	i received an_email actually 0 saying that this had taken place .
neutral	but my 00 yr_old grandma that lives in germany had not received the plant as of 0 / 0 .
neutral	i live in the usa .
neutral	i immediately sent an_email and created a ticket stating that there had not been a delivery .
neutral	on 0 / 0 i received an_email_stating that the delivery was made on 0 / 0 .
neutral	i called my grandma and she was delighted w her plant that she received !!
neutral	it was not the anthurium plant that was pictured but a lavander orchid , it is sitting next to her white one .
neutral	thanks for making a wonderful grandmas day !
neutral	hamper was great , but the delivery person left it on the step , without ring door_bell
neutral	flight , hotel were fine .
neutral	transfer was appalling !!!
neutral	i arrived at bodrum airport on time and headed out to find the sarpedon travel desk , as per email .
neutral	after an_hour and a half of asking many airport and other staff for help in finding said travel desk , which did not exist !!!!
neutral	i finally found out it was a0b travel .
neutral	it was now after midnight , when i was shown to a well worn mini_bus where it seemed i was the only traveler , i must add here that had no other travelers arrived i would most definetly had not traveled on the vehicle .
neutral	after more then two hours of arriving at the airport the mini_bus left for my destination hotel , within forty five_minutes the driver received a call advising him that two more passengers needed collecting from the airport , the bus turned around and went back .
neutral	to cut a long_story short i arrived at my hotel an 00 . 00 am , a 0 . 0 hour transfer , 0hrs was the stated transfer time .
neutral	my return transfer , i called the number shown on my email , wrong number , i called a further number given , wrong number , i then called a further number and was told to call back the next afternoon !!!!
neutral	bearing in mind all these calls were from a mobile_phone i felt this was unacceptable and very disorganised .
neutral	i was finally informed my collection time would be 00 . 00 , the mini_bus duly_arrived at 00 . 00 , i arrived at the airport at 00 . 00 another long transfer .
neutral	i would also like to add the following :
neutral	airport staff - unwelcoming , unhelpful and unfriendly .
neutral	hotel reception on arrival - unfriendly
neutral	transfer - as above , plus driver unfriendly and spoke very little english .
neutral	being a sole traveler , the whole_experience did not inspire confidence in any future bookings i may wish to make .
neutral	this company sent me an unlocking procedure that is readily_available online for free instead of an_email_confirming that my phone was unlocked .
neutral	i waited for 0 days for an_email_confirming that my phone was unlocked ( that is what they say they do on their website ), then contacted them to ask what the hold up was .
neutral	i was told to run the procedure instead .
neutral	it is not how they say they work , but i gave them the benefit of the doubt .
neutral	when i reported that this procedure did not work , they told me twice to re - do the same procedure , which i did , each time with the same outcome ( the phone does not work with other_networks ), then stopped_responding .
neutral	i threatened to contact my credit_card company to report them for non - delivery of service to get my money back , which immediately sparked their attention .
neutral	they maintain they were too_busy to respond earlier .
neutral	they first assumed i have a stolen phone ( i bought it new ) but have since agreed to send me a refund .
neutral	they are adamant that my phone is unlocked .
neutral	the bottom_line is that i cannot tell whether officialiphoneunlock were able to unlock my iphone for me but it looks_like a refund is on its way .
neutral	i think they have stopped using trustpilot as the site they point their website to for testimonials due to some recent critical reviews .
neutral	unfortunately we have had several dvds which wouldn_'_t play which ruins the experience .
neutral	on contacting this company to try and cancel my subscription ( which had just been renewed for a year ), they refused , just dishing out extra discs !
neutral	there '_s a limit to how many discs we have time to watch in a week so not very helpful .
neutral	although their telephone operators are very helpful , we had a problem with incorrect billing which i hope has now been sorted_out .
neutral	very good on the hard_sell but not so easy to read the bill - the pricing is not clear and there are extras which suddenly appear .
neutral	i have shopped at tesco for more than 00 years .
neutral	their process of continuous improvement peaked in the mid 0000 '_s and has fallen since then .
neutral	they recently refurbished my local_store ( edgbaston , birmingham ) and through the entire_process of around 0 weeks , shopping there was a nightmare .
neutral	since completion of the store , i have come to realise that moving things around is now one of the new permanent features of the store .
neutral	the staff are a very mixed bunch .
neutral	the longer serving members are still quite good , but the more recently recruited members lack in knowledge and commitment to customer service , although they have been trained to apologise (" sorry about that ") and then walk_away .
neutral	i have a clubcard loyalty card , and they send me extra points or money off vouchers for items they don_'_t sell at my local_store !
neutral	on the credit side , the store is cleaner and fresher than it was before ... it was pretty bad before !
neutral	the customer toilets are at_least more wholesome , although still not serviced enough in my view .
neutral	in my experience , the duty managers i have encountered are inneffective individuals who are way out of their depth .
neutral	it is clear they are trying to improve this store , but they still have a long way to go to regain some of their early higher standards .
neutral	they need to be careful as there is a new very large morrisons opening a few hundred yards away .
neutral	it would not take much at this point to make me give them an opportunity to take my money on a weekly_basis .
neutral	my previous_experiences with morrisons have all been good , but until now there hasn_'_t been a store local to me .
neutral	they open in october , so there isn_'_t long to wait .
neutral	if you live in the hastings area make_sure this service works where you live .
neutral	i went from virgin_media because where i live in kent i had no reception .
neutral	with vodaphone i do .
neutral	my holiday home is in hastings where virgin_media worked but hey_ho vodaphone works when it feels_like it .
neutral	o what a pain , i have another 00 months of contract !!
neutral	!
neutral	i got weight gainer off you , s a few_weeks_ago and i havent put any weight on i didnt know much about your products as i wanted something 0 make me put on weight quickly i know you can buy it as i have done so in the past out of a gym in glasgow it was the same idea [ banana milk shake ] but i phoned you , s up for advice and the girl i spoke to didnt know anything about the product i was buying off you , s the 0 i got was whey gain by gn i have followed all the instructions but didnt find it affective ive since been told by my doctor that nesquick is just the same stuff so could you advise me as i was going 0 buy a different 0 from the site thank_you .
neutral	the villa we stayed in was said to have a tv plus sat tv ..... well it wasn_'_t we had the oldest tv ever ........... no sat tv all arabic the colour was atrocious was really disappointed
neutral	hi we stayed at lanzorote we found the villa quite shabby to be honest ... the dining_room chairs were quite stained and dirty and so was the sofas ... plus there was no full length mirrors and we found all the towels smelt quite musty ..... there was not enough clothes hangers either i dread to think of more than 0 people staying there !
neutral	! we also paid for transfers from airport and back to airport ..... but was informed we had to take a taxi to another place where we would be picked_up from ( as we had to vacate at 00am ) which we had to pay over 0 euros when in my opinion i had already paid for transfers !
neutral	! all in all very disappointing for what we paid .....
neutral	my only real complaint is the toilets .
neutral	no tissue and no soap which is totally_unacceptable in the days of norovirus .
neutral	the staff were not too bothered either .
neutral	it could do with someone asking the passengers not to occupy every part of the lounge as bedroom space .
neutral	we had ti sit it out in the cafe .
neutral	i found nah to be very pushy , constant phone_calls .
neutral	i had the paperwork from the solicitor , and noticed that even_though it said no win no fee , i was asked if i had house , car , or any insurance that had legal cover , if i didn_'_t win my case , then that would pay nah '_s solicitor , as i haven_'_t got this , they will take out an insurance_policy on the case , that '_s if they decide to go_ahead , so where is the no win no fee ???
neutral	tv ad '_s never mentioned taking out insurance to cover the expenses !!!
neutral	!
neutral	haven_'_t heard back yet , but when i do i will rate the rest of the service on that .
neutral	watch this space !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the memory_foam bed itself is fantastic and the dogs love it , but it '_s let_down by the cover .
neutral	we bought this for one of our older dogs and as such the cover needed to be waterproof and easily washable and dryable .
neutral	it was not waterproof and in the end i bought a single waterproof mattress cover and had it made up into an under cover , which given the cost of the bed i felt unhappy doing .
neutral	however , not only that but when i washed the cover which came with the bed the black underside ended_up sticking together .
neutral	not a happy experience which is a shame .
neutral	rental_cars are competitive , fast and efficient but the problems appear to arise with the actual car suppliers .
neutral	inability to find booking , incorrect number of days booked and other booking problems eg petrol car was mentioned when in facrt i got a diesel .
neutral	unable to check car for damage etc due to it being snow covered .
neutral	on return , car staff disinterested and advised me that i had to park car in bay before he could check it .
neutral	had to insist that he checked it before i departed .
neutral	also , i had to communicate with office with keys etc .
neutral	unhelpful to say the least .
neutral	not particularly customer orientated .
neutral	didn_'_t appear to get job satisfaction .
neutral	yes for bicycles , camping equipment etc .
neutral	not great for car spares for specialist vehicles .
neutral	if its a ford , your made .
neutral	can be pricey on some items but they are quick on delivery .
neutral	get more for your money in the uk campared to ireland .
neutral	order placed 0th_november , extra delivery paid to get goods quickly .
neutral	despite email of email , no tracking_details , also no phone number to ring up , so they can just ignore you emails .
neutral	i will not be using this firm ever again .
neutral	a full_refund was received from this company .
neutral	also a a free pair of headphones were also received .
neutral	looked good until i got the bill from customs .
neutral	by the time i had paid that on top i could have got the lens much_cheaper elsewhere
neutral	having_read the reviews on this site , all i can say is that if your i - phone is locked to softbank of japan do not expect a fast turn_around .
neutral	i have been waiting since the 0th of january to have my 0s unlocked .
neutral	the only response i have had from the unlock company was to a mail i sent on the 00th_january saying that if they cannot sort it out then to refund my money . all they could say was to give it a bit more time i do not think it is a problem with them but it looks more like softbank dragging their feet . luckily i have another phone otherwise i would be giving up and putting the 0s on e_- bay
neutral	product variety , prices and timeliness are pretty good but advisors should be more assertive rather_than authoritative when asking customer '_s personal details - also return address for items was not enclosed in delivery paperwork ( had to call to find out )
neutral	i needed a new / used headlight for mot retest and was given the choice of a second_hand one or a new ( aftermarket ) one within minutes of logging in !
neutral	the problem i had was with buying the second_hand one was a dodgy outfit from rochdale who sent me a broken one ( which also had a broken electric adjustment part ) and seemed like this lamp had been ripped out of the car and was unchecked .
neutral	after_sales service was poor but was eventually advised to return ( costing_£ 0 . 00 ) for refund . nearly 0 months later ... no refund !
neutral	bought aftermarket from ace and ace is the correct term !
neutral	proper part extremely well_packaged and does the job .
neutral	my only concern with using many companies is t &_c stating check item before signing ? the carrier will not allow you to open package until you sign for it so we will need some legal work done on this ( am investigating ) and would therefore reject the item unless i can open it before signing .
neutral	it also seems my password was changed and could noy access the account for a while ... hmmm again password issue not allowing me to access but the good news is my bank has successfully charged my money back !!!!
neutral	no thanks to any attempts at complaining for a refund .... am disgusted with the lot of you
neutral	rooms are often substanrially cheaper on othersites
neutral	i '_ve just booked a hotel in nice for 0 nights that was £_000 cheaper
neutral	frustrating when there is always a line saying ' sorry , the last room was booked 0 hours ago , or 0 hour 00_minutes ago .
neutral	if that '_s the case don_'_t have the hotel up as available for that date in the first place !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	disappointed that i had to trim the width of the blind to get it to roll !!
neutral	i gave exact internal window measurements and the blind was made to my exact measurement with no allowance for rolling !!!
neutral	:(
neutral	pond five have a great selection of media to choose from , and they are clearly passionate_about what they do , and are trying to do a good job .
neutral	however there do appear to be some pretty major holes in their system which do need addressing .
neutral	as a youtube creator who makes a living from monetising my videos , i am too nervous_about purchasing and using their royalty free music any more , because i have used it in the past and it has_been flagged for copyright .
neutral	this is not a problem as such , and the claims can be disputed .
neutral	however the claims can often take up to 0 weeks to be released , preventing revenue generation occurring during what is often the video '_s most actively viewed time .
neutral	although i appreciate that technically this is not pond 0 '_s fault , on two_separate_occasions when this occurred , i went back to pond 0 to find the music product i had purchased only to find the music and the author had been completely removed and it seemed very much that the music i had purchased had been uploaded for sale without the necessary permissions or authorisations .
neutral	on both_occasions i got a refund from pond 0 for the purchases , however the refund did not cover anywhere_near the expense and man hours put into creating the videos that could no_longer be monetised due to them being made with copywritten material .
neutral	pixmania seems a fine company no_problems there , but i must complain_about the couriers you use , yodel , they post a card in the door if your not in then you need to phone and email a new date , this i did on two occations and both times they delivered on other days , my wife stayed in all day on the agreed days , in the end i had to go and collect the item from there depot ten miles_away .
neutral	we have to work to pay for the items we buy , so delivery dates should be correct .
neutral	i am now very reluctent to purchase from you and will check your courir next time .
neutral	carol portlock .
neutral	they are a very friendly and knowledgeable bunch , helped_me decide between lg & samsung for the 0d tv and 0d surround systems but , when i ordered the tv and tried to get a price match on the lg surround system , which i was going to pick_up from store , i was told dont worry_about picking it up we can deliver the tv in a couple days and they would not do a price match on the surround system telling_me to go buy it from the place i found it £_00 cheaper ( argos ) which i did .
neutral	the tv , after many calls and being_fobbed_off and lied to by their delivery person , was over nighted by courier which originally they told me they did not want to do because equipment usually gets damaged by courier , arrived safe and sound .
neutral	overall i am pleased with the price and goods and would reccomend them to a friend but go and collect the goods rather then be lied too about delivery dates .
neutral	i would use them again solely because of price and their knowledge .
neutral	this is the way to find a firm to provide haulage if you are not in the know .
neutral	my only_gripe is that the amount of information you can give a potential haulier is limited due to stupid rules about alternative methods of communication .
neutral	for instance potential hauliers wanted details of measurements all of which were on the manufacturers web_site but it was blocked by shiply causing me and the haulier problems .
neutral	it is unfair to the haulier who has problems pricing .
neutral	also there fees are not clear taking you by surprise .
neutral	yesterday i reviewed a company and i would swear that everything in it was accurate and i could have added more but refrained .
neutral	the said company obviously took umbridge because i wasn_'_t saying how wonderful they were .
neutral	but it is considered to be in violation .
neutral	how can the truth be a violation !!!
neutral	i am at a loss to understand
neutral	i booked my car early and took full advantage of a good rate , which by comparison was less_than 00_% than a booking made the week before .
neutral	i was in portugal , and there were some heavy potential extras .
neutral	you know the odds are chiefly in your favour , but they do put the doubts on you ?
neutral	for example the e0000 excess on the insurance .
neutral	the e0000 deposit .
neutral	worst one was the caution that i was not insured in case of breakdown ( there would be a 000 charge ) i figured that a 0000 car really wasnt about to break down and enquired_about whether there was a spare wheel .
neutral	this led to an apologetic explanation that ' some of their drivers were women on their own ' ( so they exploit these women ?).
neutral	a new one on me was the rental of a toll charge chip , so that i could go on the motorway !
neutral	i paid this on ( 00 . 00 ) finally , i was stiffed on the return the car empty thing , but overall i am glad to say that despite the possibility of costing a lot , the car did not .
neutral	nothing wrong with drinkfinder good selection and reasonable_prices .
neutral	however had no delivery of first order due to yodel not delivering it and then sadly had to wait nearly a week before a replacement was sent .
neutral	this finally arrived ok . yodel are rubbish - they don_'_t deliver or leave a card so you have no reference to arrange_redelivery .
neutral	no one answers the phone - they don_'_t respond to feedback - frankly avoid at all costs if possible .
neutral	as a regular cyclist i have used leisurewheels on numerous_occasions .
neutral	i have bought four new bikes from them over about a 00 year period , & had servicing work carried_out too .
neutral	in my dealings with them i have had mixed reviews of their service .
neutral	on some occasions i have found them to be very good , whilst on others less so .
neutral	for example , one one occasion my bike was making a clicking noise with every pedal stroke .
neutral	a member of staff traced it to a worn pedal bearing & supplied & fitted two new pedals foc , while i waited .
neutral	great service !
neutral	however , after my front mech seized & had to be replaced , they fitted an inferior alivio unit rather_than a like - for - like deore !
neutral	why ?
neutral	fasthosts must think we ' re all mugs .
neutral	they practise creeping price increases .
neutral	that most_recent one makes them out of line for simple stuff such as wordpress hosting .
neutral	find a better value option .
neutral	great product and fast speedy delivery .....
neutral	only_downside is that as a company you need to get into the 00st_century and have the capability and technology to be able to provide customers with a time_slot when their product will be delivered ( other_companies now provide either a slot or will call you 00_mins prior to delivery to give you an opportunity to get home )... having to take a day off and stay in all day has cost me in both time and money ;-(
neutral	just think how frustrating you feel when you purchase something and the supplier can '_t provide you with a time_slot ...... provide your customers the same service and flexibility you want as a customer ....
neutral	please listen and get out of the dark_ages .... you can do better and you know it !
neutral	!
neutral	paula
neutral	the booking process is fine , and the actual car was fine and as_described .
neutral	but if i book through holiday_autos web_site , i want my car from them and not hertz , olympic or someone i '_ve never_heard of .
neutral	also some hirers insist you take a full_tank of fuel and pay up front .
neutral	we didn_'_t want that and didn_'_t use it all and it added a lot to the cost we hadn_'_t budgeted for .
neutral	the different hirers also have different bureaucracy and some are very old_fashioned and it takes_ages , and you have to repeat information you have already provided .
neutral	i will use them again , but i ' d like to be able to choose which company supplies my vehicle at the point of hire .
neutral	i was delighted with the products but disgusted with the courier company who provided only a kerbside delivery service , and yet could not give me a time for the delivery so i could not prepare to have help standing by !.
neutral	disabled husband and awkward access meant this was as important as the products being correct and good value .
neutral	unless they could offer a better delivery arrangement i would not buy from them again .
neutral	on telephoning better_bathrooms i was told this was in the small_print , but
neutral	i think when spending a lot on a new bathroom , i should not have to rally the neighbours to help get the products into a safe_place before being_able to unwrap and check .
neutral	spoilt to some degree the excitement of a new bathroom .
neutral	nous sommes très contentes avec le produit que nous avons acheté , mais la livraison ... quelques semaines avec une dizaine des emails qui promettent la livraison dans le meilleur delai .
neutral	dites honnêtement que le paquet arrive de_l ' asie et que ça prend du temps pour arriver .
neutral	hopefully the products are ok .
neutral	just took an age for them to arrive .
neutral	i am in canada .
neutral	i purchased tickets to mark knopfler at royal_albert_hall in may .
neutral	i did not do much research into viagogo but they advertised the best tickets for this show .
neutral	i bought them ( 0x face_value by the way ) and then tried to contact them to advise of our travel_plans .
neutral	it is impossible to speak with ( or email ) anyone at viagogo .
neutral	they have designed their business that way ; the fortress walls are high .
neutral	i was very concerned about receiving them before our departure from canada .
neutral	they say tickets will arrive about a week before the event .
neutral	that was dodgy for us given our travel pans .
neutral	i don_'_t know whether by luck or design , but the tickets arrived today and i thank them for that .
neutral	it was my choice to pay the big premium so i can '_t complain_about price , but the complete absence of customer - facing ( accessible ) service is a real flaw in their business_model and should be a real concern to shoppers .
neutral	my motto is never do_business with an organization that is not accessible and that does not openly invite prospects ( let_alone customers ) to contact them .
neutral	they do everything possible to avoid answering the phone .
neutral	in this age of communications , it is inexcusable .
neutral	ironic , they monitor complaints on this site closely and are quick to respond .
neutral	but if you are a customer trying tho contact them , you are virtually out of luck .
neutral	given the enormous margin they are charging for tickets as a " reseller ", they should have people on the phones eager to assist the needs of their customers ( yes this costs money but people are paying good money ).
neutral	but they don_'_t .
neutral	and this will cost them ... at_least my future business unless they post a phone number on the homepage of their website and answer calls promptly and courteously , respecting their high - paying customers .
neutral	i did get what i paid for , but i should not have been left feeling , as i did , that i have blindly rolled the dice .
neutral	it is not " what " you do , it is also " how " you do it .
neutral	viagogo , do yourself a great service and commit to posting a phone number and dealing personally with your customers because customers complain with their feet .
neutral	in this case , " how " you provide your service has virtually negated " what " you actually delivered .
neutral	it looks_like maximizing your profits today is your only interest .
neutral	and regardless , it makes you look bad ... and your competition better .
neutral	capisce ?
neutral	wiggle don_'_t answer the phone
neutral	poor communication with regard to warranty issues .
neutral	very frustrating experience but credit where it is due , they are trying to put things right now .
neutral	frankly , i have been getting more than a little fed_up .
neutral	cleaners come and go and i have been left without one a few_times .
neutral	this is not the fault of maid0clean , they cant force them to come .
neutral	however , the gripe i do have with the company is not being credited when there is no cleaner .
neutral	some of the times have been my fault in not wanting a replacement at another time / day , but not always .
neutral	so dont i get a rebate ?
neutral	this is why i have rated them as acceptable rather_than good .
neutral	they do get in touch very soon and reply to any message i have left quickly .
neutral	on the ball there and i know they are trying their best to find another cleaner .
neutral	i am keeping my fingers_crossed this one i now have will work out well and stay , then the rating will go up !
neutral	premier_inn provide a ' budget service ', i have to say that i have rarely seen this term so overused .
neutral	i paid over £_000 for my elderly_parents to stay at premier_inn , dover , as they were too tired to continue with their journey home .
neutral	this covered one nights stay and breakfast .
neutral	facilities were good and rooms were clean , but in no way does that price reflect value for money .
neutral	had i known the area better and had time i would have been able to book another 0 star hotel for literally half of that price .
neutral	the internet is bursting with bad_reviews about this company , and i must_admit that on a number of occasions i have sworn never again to deal with companies who use them .
neutral	however , a lot seems to depend on your local_depot and your regular driver - if there is such a person .
neutral	now that our area has the same driver all the time all is well for the moment , but in previous years we had some terrible experiences .
neutral	i certainly won_'_t choose them if i am sending a parcel .
neutral	i have used this company in the past for a lot of business card and letterhead printing as well as brochures but have ceased to do so as my e_- mail inbox was perpetually bombarded by their messages .
neutral	if you are not careful you could also unwittingly sign up to membership of some stupid scheme which will rob your credit_card on a monthly basis until you notice it .
neutral	luckily i didn_'_t fall for that one but if you decide to give them a try do look out for the very small_print and don_'_t agree to any trial offers .
neutral	the items i ordered were a good price and delivered quickly , but when i tried to checkout and get the free delivery , i wasn_'_t able to click on the free option - it said i needed to spend a certain_amount to get the service free , but then changed the amount and even when i had spent that amount , wouldn_'_t let me put the discount on ...
neutral	arrrived approx 00_mins late due to high_volume of air traffic , went to pick_up the car and was told it was away been refuelled !!!!!
neutral	. had to sit for 00_mins until car was ready , left the airport at 0000 ( still dark ).
neutral	inspection of the car identified damage to thedrivers side door that was not noted on the hire agreement ( walk back to pickup desk to inform them ) . arrived at destination and realised the car looked like it had just done 0 legs of the cyprus rally ( inside and out ) , had to take the car to a car - wash & clean out the interior .
neutral	afterwards the car was what we required and no further problems occured .
neutral	i was surprised that the items arrived in a plastic_bag as all the contents were battered , i would have expected them to be boxed like most other_retailers .
neutral	despite_being in a wooden box , inside a cardboard_box the 0 hip flasks i ' d ordered were dented & scratched , so they must have left the factory like that .
neutral	a call to drinkstuff resolved the issue as 0 new flasks arrived the next_day .
neutral	but i did not receive what i was quoted even through all products where good quality and in perfect working order . or my goods where syphoned off at the warehouse . i lost a total of nearly_£ 0 . 00 , which i agree is not much .
neutral	their email system never replayed for my request for a number for one of my packages . so i never got a list too write out on my package .
neutral	i had too hand write one .
neutral	good service but i don_'_t like it when these firms charge excessive postage
neutral	excellent delivery , ordered item one day and delivered the next .
neutral	item well_packed and and as_described .
neutral	would liked to have awarded 0 or even 0_stars but i had an issue with the floor brush sleeve not fitting the floor brush .
neutral	i telephoned the company in lancashire and spoke to a very pleasant lady_who , although she had not been aware of this problem before , said she would make enquiries and reply by telephone or email that or the following_day .
neutral	sadly , a week has now passed with no such contact .
neutral	you get what you pay for sum thinks a great and sum are not it the luck of what you pick
neutral	i had a good experience at trade center wales with the buying of the car the changing over of my private plate that will be done tomorrow i hope .
neutral	but i am very very disappointed at the fact i was told that i got £ 0 , 000 for my part_exchange , £ 0 , 000 off the price of the car ( bringing it too £ 0000 ) and 0 , 000 for my car , only to find out that my car was advertised on a well_known web_site ( ebay ) for £ 0 , 000 . 00 , that being £ 0 , 000 cheaper_than the garage price and the price i paid , so just to let trev know the cars are probably not the cheapest cars around , very disappointed buyer .
neutral	plus having looked round the car when i got home , i realized that the work tsw said they would do around the car and bonnet ( stone chips and scratches ) have not been done , the bonnet was done so cant complain at that , yes i signed for the car , but that was before i had seen the car myself after the work was supposed to have been done , so please don_'_t just sign for your car have a second look if work is to be done , i know it was a second_hand car but when paying this price i certainly thought i would have the service i was promised , after all i really don_'_t think i will be visiting again for another car .
neutral	when i visit tomorrow to change my number_plate i will be putting in a compliant about the body work and price .
neutral	i cannot_fault serenata for ease of use , delivery etc ... the flowers i ordered included roses and hyacinths .. both can be difficult to manage .
neutral	sadly both faded within 0 days of delivery which i think unacceptable .
neutral	have said might use them again but would be more considered in my flower choice ... something a little more able to travel .
neutral	still_waiting for item .
neutral	no ratings yet
neutral	the order arrived speedily and well_packed .
neutral	they give good instructions for checking sizing and the garments arrived in the size expected .
neutral	i will reserve final judgement until the garments have " relaxed " a bit with wear .
neutral	the gurnsey looks a bit odd at first , as it does on the models , but that is the design of the traditional gurnsey , not a garment fault ; i think it will wear - in .
neutral	free returns would have been nice , so two sizes could be tried on for fit , especially as there are gaps in the sizing ( e . g .
neutral	00 - 00 or 00 - 00 ; i ' m about 00 going on 00 ; why no 00 - 00 size ?
neutral	).
neutral	update
neutral	having now worn both jumpers for a while , i am less impressed with the designs than i thought i would be .
neutral	while the quality of the wool and the finish are both very good , the overall look of the jumpers is not as good as many others that i own ; i always find myself choosing a different one rather_than the woolover when i go to the wardrobe .
neutral	i will think very hard before buying from them again , unless they offer free returns .
neutral	happy with the quick dispatch but very disappointed that i never got a reply to a ' problem ' i raised with one of the products !
neutral	makes you think this is a company which is happy to take your money but after that they don_'_t want to know .
neutral	it was only a minor_issue but still not the service i had hoped for .
neutral	i made an enquiry by e_mail , but the response was poor .
neutral	advise on products and training was not very good
neutral	i had not used maxi muscle products for a while and now started training again with my son
neutral	i have now discovered that company is not run by zef eisenberg
neutral	pretty disappointed with service
neutral	since i haven_'_t ( yet ) made a claim , my only experience of the company is paying for a policy .
neutral	the cover appears to do what it says although the claim process via the underwriter looks rather involved - many documents required in support of claim .
neutral	on a positive_note , i got a year excess cover for about the same cost ss a week '_s cover from the rental company so worth it from that perspective but you would have forfeit your excess to the rental company then attempt to claim it back if there were an incident .
neutral	i ' d prefer the rental company to deal direct with the insurance company with proof of cover being provided on vehicle pick - up so the renter would never be out of pocket .
neutral	found a link on moneysavingexpert . com and chose the lowest cover which appears to be adequate for my short trips to europe .
neutral	can '_t possibly accurately rate a product like this unless i have to claim which i '_ll probably never do so the 0_stars are purely for cost , purchase process and the fact one can download the documents .
neutral	always the same unless you intend to upgrade or cancel .
neutral	multiple menus multiple departments and pass ons and eventually you get there .
neutral	if only there was a competitor
neutral	on quite a few occasions i gave up after getting an order together to get free_postage , even after meeting the target i was still expected to pay postage so i did not go through to pay for order .
neutral	even_though i took the time to point out problems there was no customer feedback .
neutral	on the prescription_drugs side of the site , i found confusion and there was conflicting prices , things just did not seem to add up so my local chemist will get the trade for my nhs prescriptions .
neutral	not pleased with the quantity restrictions .
neutral	on the whole though what i order is quick to arrive in my post box and at a good price , i have not been let_down yet over the past couple of years .
neutral	the product was good and deserves at_least a 0 - star_rating , and the price was worthy of a 0 - star_rating .
neutral	however , the delivery service and customer service was far below that in standard .
neutral	i bought on the 00nd october .
neutral	was told on the 00th_oct that the parcel had been taken by hermes .
neutral	it didn_'_t appear on their tracking until 00_hours ( or more ) later .
neutral	another 00_hours before it appeared as being at their hub ( on wednesday ).
neutral	then nothing .
neutral	on friday phoned hermes who wouldn_'_t even talk to me .
neutral	then phoned bradford , who also wouldn_'_t talk to me - said i had to fill out e_- mail form , which i did .
neutral	six days_later and i still have had no reply to that e_- mail !
neutral	!
neutral	however , the parcel did arrive on monday !
neutral	!
neutral	somebody really needs to ' pull their socks up ' as far as customer_relations are concerned .
neutral	in this day and age this is simply unacceptable practice .
neutral	what happened to the scottish customer_care ?
neutral	no tasty little nibbles for the customer to try either .
neutral	just uniformed workers working their day away in an unfreindly and cold working environment .
neutral	come on tesco !
neutral	make the place fun to be in !
neutral	welcome the customer !
neutral	how about reducing some of those prices .
neutral	the fruit and veg are extortionate for a supermarket !
neutral	asda is one of these large chains of supermarkets who are more focused on less staff doing more work , rather_than customer_care .
neutral	i remember when asda would welcome their customers into the shop and make the shopping_experience a real treat .
neutral	lots of nice little sample foods to taste and enough staff working that it did not look as if all their staff are stressed out with too much work .
neutral	sainsburys has a wide_range of delicacy foods , which is great .
neutral	however the shop is overpriced and i can usually find the same goods elsewhere for less money .
neutral	the staff seem to be some what demoralised and always seem to look tired and over worked .
neutral	sainsburys do have some good offers , and if you get out of the shop
neutral	quickly , you can have a bargain .
neutral	i am always aware that if i do not leave with my bargain / offer , i will have over spent and therefore not really had a good shopping_experience as i said they over price !
neutral	so you over spend !
neutral	the coffee is fine , the capsules do not fit as well as the originals
neutral	the prices are really good , and when the items arrive are really well_packaged , but the delivery is oh so slow
neutral	ok to deal with , no_problems ( no communication really ) and a very good price ; but compared to others , delivery however was very slow , arrived two whole days after i would have expected to receive it .
neutral	it would seem trying to get an_appointment in london is a huge challenge .
neutral	as the website was not working i called the call_centre , the person was very helpful but could not get me an_appointment for 0 weeks .
neutral	as i was going on a 00 day driving holiday and had a big crack on my windscreen i was not happy .
neutral	i decided to book an appointement near a location i was going on holiday , but on the day of the appointment i was called to say the replacement windscreen had not been delivered to the autoglass centre .
neutral	i was told it would arrive later in the day , but as i was on a touring holiday i could not wait around .
neutral	i tried to get another booking for another site on my journey but no appointments available .
neutral	in the end had to go back to an_appointment in london at my home .
neutral	the fitting of the new windscreen at home was a good experience and i was impressed with the service and the technichan .
neutral	autoglass need more technichans in london plus the online booking system is not live as i had looked at it and it had said there was appontments available in london but the call_centre people said that was not correct and a 0 week wait was typical .
neutral	i bought the liner to be used when i am carrying a mountain bike in my mondeo with the rear seats folded .
neutral	the only problem is that the liner cannot stay in the same position against the rear of the seat when the seats are folded flat compared to when they are upright ( this is explained in the instructions ).
neutral	this could be solved by adding an extra fold of plastic at the base of the seats to enable the liner to extend when folding the seats down .
neutral	it is impractical to remove the headrest loops every time you want to fold the seats so i have left it without the loops attached to the headrests .
neutral	slightly disappointed that this wasn_'_t a feature .
neutral	i arrived and was greeted_by the very friendly receptionist who explained all the hotels facilities including their premier breakfast , wi -_fi at £ 0 for 00_hours for up to 0 devices and she also made a big point of explaining their premier_inn ' good night guarantee '.
neutral	i went to the room which was clean , tidy and a reasonable size and started to use the wifi but it wouldn_'_t work properly and when i went to connect my phone , it said i had too many devices connected .
neutral	i reported this to reception and the hotel got someone from their it helpline to contact me but unfortunately they still couldn_'_t get it to work and they thought it was a fault with the hotel '_s local system .
neutral	i went out to eat and came back to my room to sleep but i was awoken at approx 0 : 00 am by a door repeatedly opening and closing near my room , i think , this was either the fire door or the lift and did not get back to sleep for the rest of the night .
neutral	i went for breakfast and again was greeted_by a very helpful server who took my breakfast order .
neutral	the breakfast was good except for the poached eggs which were ' hard boiled ' and the hash brown which was soggy and inedible and i did not eat either .
neutral	the same server asked me how the breakfast was and i mentioned the eggs and hash brown , she apologised and immediately offered replacements for both but by this time i was in a quite a hurry to check out as i had an_appointment , so had to decline .
neutral	on check out , the receptionist asked me how my stay was .
neutral	i mentioned the wi -_fi problems and she refunded the £ 0 .
neutral	then i mentioned being woken up in the middle of the night by a door opening and closing close to my room and she said she would ask someone to ' have a look at the door '!
neutral	!
neutral	i asked about their ' good night guarantee '.
neutral	she said she would make look into it but did not offer anything .
neutral	( incidentally , the receptionist was the same one who checked me in the day before who had made a big point of explaining their premier_inn ' good night guarantee ').
neutral	i asked her if someone could get back to me about the issue and she said ok , but no one has responded .
neutral	in summary , the hotel has a good central location and the staff seem very well_trained to communicate the features and benefits of the premier_inn package but not how to deal with any major issues if they arise .
neutral	00th_may 00 . 00p . m .
neutral	my furniture is here !
neutral	unfortunately i did not get the name of the driver / delivery man so i can not name him when i say he was brilliant .
neutral	he was pleasant , knew what he was doing , assembled my furniture for me and took away all the packaging .
neutral	the furniture is lovely by the way .
neutral	00 / 00 / 00 00 : 00 .
neutral	just received call from mark at rattan_direct .
neutral	he apologised .
neutral	he offered a solution to the problem : he asked if i would i take the same order in a different_colour which could be delivered 00 may and he would also give me a discount .
neutral	i have agreed but feel uneasy given the promises i have already received .
neutral	also , having_read some of the recent reviews that orders are arriving damaged i do not know what to expect .
neutral	let '_s wait_until 00th_may and see what happens .
neutral	i will update as necessary .
neutral	00 / 00 / 00 00 : 00 if i could give ' no star ' i would .
neutral	as other customers have said , rattan_direct took my money on 0th_march_0000 .
neutral	i have just been advised yet again that delivery is delayed - now until june .
neutral	strange as i was told last_week that my order was due to be delivered on 00th_may .
neutral	before that it was 00th_march , beginning of may etc .
neutral	etc .
neutral	every time they say it is going to be delivered i have to book leave from my work , then 0 days before delivery date i am told it is not going to happen .
neutral	i am beginning to wonder_if they are they a real company at all , or just people who take your money and then don_'_t deliver - literally !
neutral	i should be given compensation for the atrocious service and the long period they have had my money .
neutral	i have been told that some one will call me .
neutral	i am not surprised that i am still_waiting .
neutral	i gather that the shop is better_than their on - line presence .
neutral	i have rung about my order - no response
neutral	i have emailed them .
neutral	- no response
neutral	i have used the online contact form .
neutral	- no response .
neutral	update .... the company have been in touch .
neutral	please see comments_below
neutral	chris
neutral	i bought the racking to make some space in my garage for all my stuff .
neutral	the racking has done a really good job and i can actually find what i want !!
neutral	i thought it was fair value for money , but i did think the delivery was rather expensive .
neutral	i know it is heavy but i think a keener price on delivery would encourage me to buy more racking when i need it .
neutral	personally i prefer to go to tripadvisor , can get much_better deals buying from separate websites specialising in hotels and holidays .
neutral	i was disappointed that the main item i placed an order for was unavailable and could not be reordered .
neutral	if this information had been up to date on the website i probably wouldn_'_t have bothered ordering anything_else and cancelled the other items .
neutral	however they had already been dispatched with the full postage quoted charged which i queried as the unavailable item had been large and heavy compared to the other small items .
neutral	about 00_% of the postage was refunded after this but i thought that the postage for the other items was quite expensive compared to other things i have ordered on line .
neutral	however , they did respond to queries promptly .
neutral	i have used atkinsons many_times and found their service and prices excellent , and second to none .
neutral	but that has all changed with their new pricing_structure , with " free " postage now making small , or even larger , purchase no better_than anyone_else .
neutral	the postage is now included in the price , and thus there is now massive difference_between the " from " price and the real price any normal person will have to pay , as the " from " price is for 000 , 000 , even sometimes 0000 items .
neutral	we are talking_about gold here people - on one coins you have to spend £_000 , 000 to get to the " from " price .
neutral	seriously ?
neutral	( edit .
neutral	these very high quantities seem to have gone from the site now , so not quite as bad , at only around £_00 , 000 for one of the gold coins to get to the " from " price .
neutral	still high , but not so ridiculous )
neutral	further anomalies in pricing are shown in the silver coins .
neutral	two coins with the same " from " price , and similar single coin price can have materially different 0 + and 00 + prices .
neutral	what '_s that all about ?
neutral	and it gets worse .
neutral	if you buy four different coins , say five of each , you now pay the " free " postage four times , and if you are like me and want to buy five or six different silver items , maybe a bar and two different gold coins , you pay it eight or nine times .
neutral	with the old pricing_structure you saw what you would pay , there was almost no difference in price by different quantities , and you add postage on at the end , once .
neutral	and apparently this is what customers wanted .
neutral	not this one !
neutral	i am genuinely sad that this has happened .
neutral	i often recommend friends and internet posters to atkinsons as they are different from the rest .
neutral	they are different no_longer .
neutral	i was selling an ipad i know for a fact there was absolutely nothing wrong with it i was perfect when it was posted to them and the price quoted was very acceptable ,
neutral	then i got an_email from them saying the price quoted was changed due to a damaged case and a chip so the price was £_00 less it may be me but was it damaged in transit or are they just saying that to try and get it cheaper i '_ll never know as i needed the money , i do believe that it is possible to have been damaged in transit as i have seen some delivery drivers throwing parcels about in there vans .
neutral	it was well_wrapped up so what happened ?
neutral	i ordered my new mobility scouter through this company and they were great i ordered it on 0st aug and it arrived ready built on the 0th aug and there prices are great ,
neutral	but last month i called the help line number as the controls were sticking it was driving by its self and was promised a mobility engineer would call me within 0 days its now 00th_oct and im still_waiting
neutral	so there after_sales don_'_t exist ?
neutral	its now 0th_november still no response leaver still sticking why should i pay another company to fix this for me you get a years warranty .+ they had the cheek to send me extended_warranty info .
neutral	well thats a joke why would you want a extended_warranty when the dont even bother to pass on your problems :{
neutral	i '_ve bought a washing_machine and a cooker this year and both times i paid comet extra to install both products they were very fast took all the packing away im very very happy .......
neutral	until there were blisters on bottom of oven the oven was black i didn_'_t notice it right away i used a torch so i called comet was told that as i had the cooker for over the 0 days they would transfer me to the manufacture but they told me comet should replace cooker up to first 00 days some one is confused so after 0 calls getting passed from comet to manufacture i got some one that knew what they were doing a engineer will come out to inspect it .
neutral	comet may be good on price and delivery but there after_sales service they prefer to pass the buck .
neutral	disappointed with customer_care - maybe the tech team should add that you must add a land - line telephone_number when using the ' checkout ' service if you have used a ' free ' email account and ' mobile ' number .
neutral	this would avoid credit_card checks being refused by your internal system even_though the credit_card company has authorized payment and approved name , address and good credit rating !
neutral	have never been asked to scan driving_licence or personal document and upload to company - and as advised by credit_card company i refused to do so .
neutral	definite short fall in communication by sales / web team in this matter .
neutral	situation could have been dealt_with in a much_better manner .
neutral	a lot of stress caused , hassle and then when sorted ( by me ) no apology or follow_up by company , i had to ring back to check .
neutral	great shame as delivery was very fast and product was as expected .
neutral	but would not use again until new ' checking out system ' is updated .
neutral	ask me yesterday and i would have been quite positive .
neutral	today i spent an_hour and half on the phone being told that an item i had returned as per manufacturers instructions couldnt be repaired nor replaced due to the cost involved .
neutral	their solution ( not the manufactuers ) was to give a partial_refund because the cost difference was disproportionate in their terms .
neutral	it turned_out to be £ 0 and they couldnt be troubled to return the item to the manufacturer who would have repaierd or replace it free of charge .
neutral	the refund , somthing i hadnt been_warned of or suggested during the return was reduced due to the product being 0 months old ( it has a 0 year_warranty ).
neutral	they quote in the email chapter and verse of their terms and conditions and the sale of goods_act so obviously expect complaints .
neutral	they also refunded to a credit_card without asking if it is still valid - which it wasnt .
neutral	because they have sent their money to a credit_card company who i dont have any dealings with they also refused to return the faulty item i could have returned to the manufacturer to resolve .
neutral	i am told there isnt a manager in the building past 0pm on a friday and their returns department stop work at 0 : 00 each day and no one can get in their after that time .
neutral	they did eventually offer a full_refund of the purchase price but only a small_amount would be available straight_away and i would have to stump up the rest of the cash to buy a replacment at a greater price from them .
neutral	so because they wanted to save £ 0 , i needed to find about £_000 until their refund worked its way back and someone felt the urge to send me a cheque which of course would take a further 0 days to clear and mean i had to travel 00 miles to a bank to pay it in .
neutral	as its christmas i guess we would be looking at sometime in the new year !
neutral	one of the other reviews said that ebuyer were ok until something went wrong - i now fully understand and support that view .
neutral	whatch the prices however - other_companys often have the same stuff cheaper .
neutral	when placing an order remeber their warranty service is just as likely to give you a partial_refund as a fixed or replacment item and they will try and get one over on you for as little as £ 0 .
neutral	good luck - you may need it .
neutral	update_:
neutral	following a long_drawn out discussion with the staff at ebuyer the matter was resolve in way which was good for both of us .
neutral	there are some systems which i think they should change but the matter is now resolved .
neutral	i have increased from one star to three because of the enthusiasm they demonstrated in resolving the issue .
neutral	split delivery of order so had to stay in on two consecutive days .
neutral	goods delivered well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
neutral	i have ordered some flat_pack furniture on 00rd january , which is awaiting stock .
neutral	i received an estimated delivery date for before 00th and 00th_march and also ordered the furniture assembly service for each of the two_separate items .
neutral	however i received first a missed call and then a text_message from the assembly team to ring to arrange assembly , even_though i had not yet received the furniture .
neutral	i rang to explain this , but was still given a date of monday 00th_february incase it arrived by then .
neutral	on friday_evening i received a text about the forthcoming date to assemble today 00th to text yes if ok or ring if a problem .
neutral	i rang on saturday_morning and thought i had cleared it up that i still have not had this furniture delivered and was thought i had said i would ring them after delivery to arrange .
neutral	nevertheless this morning another missed call and text_message to ring .
neutral	i have just had a repeat performance of saturday_morning , hopefully this will not happen again .
neutral	although this might be considered very efficient under usual circumstances , i am starting to find it a bit annoying having not received a definite delivery date and am considering cancelling the furniture altogether having ordered it in january .
neutral	good prices bad delivery !
neutral	i ordered a roca back to wall toilet , but wrong pan was delivered on wed 00 dec . after calling customer service i was assured that the correct pan would be delivered the next_day .. . the same thing has happened on a second occasion , with the wrong item being delivered on thurs 00 dec !!
neutral	!
neutral	it was very difficult to get through on the phone , and i had to chase first thing in the morning to try and resolve the situation .
neutral	the pan i ordered arrived eventually but then the seat arrived with no fitting .
neutral	yet another wait ...
neutral	i have spoken to two customer service manager ... emailed them all the details this has wasted a lot of my time chasing what i would expect would be quite a straightforward request and significantly delayed the work on my bathroom .
neutral	i believe that as a gesture of goodwill , i should be reimbursed for the inconvenience and disruption that has_been caused .
neutral	in this instance , i think an equitable solution would be for you to send over a concealed cistern and chrome plate by way of compensation .... as yet no reply .
neutral	here '_s hope someone will take_note of this .
neutral	the bed is okish for the money , but is roughly made , eg just spot welded and the finish is very thin and rubs off .
neutral	the middle support leg on futon base the bolts came lose , hence threads were shot , so i had to drill through and put new nuts and bolts in with loctite !
neutral	the futon it self is wafer thin and very uncomfortable .
neutral	the whole bed is made very quickly therefore not quality !
neutral	ok and forgot to say the bed slats were very tight to fit , so having to use a rubber mallet , i broke half a dozen clips , and the job we had to get replacements from argos was a joke , they wanted to send out another bed , after it took us three to four hours to put this one up , then in the end they said they could not supply just the clips !
neutral	it had to be the whole bed !
neutral	so we opted for a slight discount , and i taped the lose slats in with duck tape !
neutral	!
neutral	the shopping_experience was great , the website promised loads and the cost was reasonable ... but to be honest , the coffee isn_'_t really that good .
neutral	it '_s ok and perfectly drinkable , but it doesn_'_t really match the description given on the website .
neutral	we bought packs of all the flavours and they all , including the intense flavour , seem a bit weak and flavourless ....
neutral	sorry , but we prefer our coffee with a bit of a kick and these flavours are just a bit limp .... :(
neutral	i booked a car through carhire_0000 for collection at_faro_airport on 00 july_0000 .
neutral	the booking was confirmed with goldcar .
neutral	carhire_0000 offered me their collision damage_excess waiver insurance at £_00 , and before i took it i asked them specifically ' if i take your cdw insurance , will that avoid my credit_card being having a big refundable charge taken when i arrive ?'
neutral	this was because i intended using my credit_card for most of my holiday spending .
neutral	i was told quite catergorically by email , you will have to show your credit_card as proof of identity , and a swipe may be taken , but no charge will be taken for cdw as you have it with us !
neutral	guess_what , on arrival the card was swiped , and they informed me they would be charging 0 , 000_euros (£ 0 , 000 ), unless i took their cdw insurance at 000_euros (£_00 )!
neutral	when i explained i had taken the insurance with carhire_0000 , they then told me how it works .
neutral	you pay carhire_0000 £_00 , you pay goldcar £ 0000 , and if you ' re unfortunate enough to have an accident , you loose the £ 0000 and have to try and claim it back from carhire_0000 when you return to the uk !!
neutral	they don_'_t tell you thats how it works do they ?
neutral	i took the 000_euro option , and asked carhire_0000 to refund my useless cdw when i came home .
neutral	they flatly_refused , hiding_behind the ' terms and conditions ' excuse .
neutral	so do not take carhire cdw insurance when you book , it is absolutely_useless !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a veil from light in the box .
neutral	it took a long time to arrive , and response from customer_services was a little_slow .
neutral	but eventually i did receive a full_refund even_though the veil arrived in the end and was quite nice .
neutral	i would recommend light in the box with respect to quality of goods , but don_'_t expect items to arrive quickly .
neutral	i contacted customer_services about a problem with my order on the day of recieving it cannot just have faulty pump part for 0000ml shampoo replaced as it was faulty i have to return the 00ooml bottle , what an inconvenience and expense
neutral	good price for jacket with delivery a week from dispatch however wanted to return an item and e_- mailed to receive a return order number received an_automated_response to say i would receive a return order number before i could proceed , and 0 week_later still no response despite e_- mailing again
neutral	once , prime time dramas had 00 to 00_minutes between breaks .
neutral	now , they seem like every quarter of an_hour , which does ruin the continuity of the program .
neutral	i find itv_player very inferior to bbc '_s iplayer .
neutral	i '_ve been buying from amazon for ages and thought they were a reputable company .
neutral	recently though i purchased an item which wasn_'_t as_described .
neutral	i used the contact form through amazon to contact the seller but got no response .
neutral	i left feedback which reflected how i felt about this and it hasn_'_t been published .
neutral	i '_ve tried 0 times now and it doesn_'_t appear .
neutral	that has put me off now as i always read the reviews but it seems they only publish the good ones so you think the product is good but that may not be everybody '_s opinion .
neutral	i ordered copper ointment and i was told by email that there would be a delay .
neutral	i had to phone up a few_days_later to check when i would receive the product and i found out that it had just been sent to me .
neutral	that is the only reason i have scored a 0 instead of a 0 .
neutral	at_least they told me there would be a delay .
neutral	i did nead the ointment urgently however .
neutral	i will order from them again however .
neutral	they are a nice company to deal with and you get to speak to a friendly person on the phone if you need help .
neutral	the booking system and loading was fine .
neutral	on board the food was likewarm , in fact on our return crossing the breakfast was very poor 0 of the hash browns were vstiull frozen inside and had to be replaced .
neutral	the staff at the till took too long to process the items at the checkout so people behind '_s food was cold .
neutral	there were no covers offered to help insulate the food .
neutral	the food was costly and although we had buy an adult meal and geta child meal free voucher staff semmed unsure how to process it through the till .
neutral	also we had 0 adult meals and 0 children '_s meals but it seemed that it could only be applied to one although i didn_'_t tghink this particularly clear on the voucher itself .
neutral	the shop was very limited as ii usually find its a good way to pass the time ( and spend money ) especially having a 00 year_old daughter with me who loves perfume / make up etc .
neutral	there were no newspapers which i missed on the return_journey as i like to catch up on the world while we have been away .
neutral	i think next time i ' d book with p_& o , the extra £_00 is worth it .
neutral	i ordered items and paid next_day delivery charge , only to find that the items were sent on a standard delivery , i complained and did get a refund .
neutral	initial tap that we ordered and shown in stock was inspected before despatch - :) - and found to be damaged .
neutral	no others in stock nor available so had to choose new tap - :(
neutral	good communication until the delivery was despatched , then i think they were let_down by yodel .
neutral	despatched 0st may , actually got delivered 0th_may - not good these days .
neutral	the service including delivery was slick .
neutral	unfortunately the back panel of the cooker was pushed in probably by a fork lift .
neutral	offered £_00 discount and repair after 00 days .
neutral	i declined asked for a return and ordered successfully elsewhere within a few_days .
neutral	i ordered flip - flops online on a sunday , which were delivered the next_day , at no charge , i was very impressed - especially with the delivery company and their excellent communication .
neutral	however , the product didn_'_t appear to be exactly_what i ' d ordered .
neutral	the pair of flip - flops delivered were different to those ordered and the finish wasn_'_t great .
neutral	i returned them to the leamington store , ( which is so much_easier now ) and they gave me a credit_note , which i was very happy with .
neutral	i really like superdry products and this experience has by no means put me off !
neutral	we are very pleased with our ratten garden_furniture .
neutral	only bad note was that the customer service team was not always available and if i hadn_'_t phoned to find out when my first payment was going out i wouldn_'_t have had to pay for them as they had not put it in place !!!
neutral	!
neutral	as the information doesn_'_t get out to everyone there are obviously big gaps .
neutral	not all items work in all houses .
neutral	older houses often lose out becasue items do not fit a tap or the plumbing ceases to work with a bag sitting in the cystern .
neutral	i have never seen the car wash brush suggested .
neutral	i used to sell them in the markets 00 years_ago so they are nothing new .
neutral	they work straight from a bucket and only need one bucket to wash and one to rinse .
neutral	as the pipe is only 0ft long it does not qualify as a hosepipe so legal even when watering is not .
neutral	mind you tell that to the policeman who is trying to bust you .
neutral	water has_been coming up throught my pavement for weeks and there has_been a leak for 00 years higher up the hill so if the water board fixed that we wouldn_'_t need to spend so much time saving water for them !
neutral	we are with bt and never had any_problems except when contract ends as they don_'_t notify you .
neutral	the first i realised was when a bill came through for nearly twice the amount & when i queried it they said we don_'_t tell people when contract ends if you were on a deal !
neutral	i found the brown leather chairs i have been looking for in the ps winter sale catalogue .
neutral	when i ordered on - line the chairs were more_expensive than the catalogue price .
neutral	i tried using the 00_% reduction code which would have brought he price down to the advertised price in the catalogue but was told my order did not qualify !
neutral	whilst recently traveling to calais on one of your vessels your standards have risen in your food areas and general cleanliness of the old sea france boats , but the seating was absolutely filthy and stained so i walked around for the entire trip .
neutral	the problems of the seating i believe is caused by some of the tramps !
neutral	oops people who travel with you sleeping on the seating with their dirty boots and shoes on the seating showing no regard for others .
neutral	who_knows what kind of crap is on them .
neutral	ryan_air is good if you follow the rules to the point and do all they require .
neutral	not so good if you fall foul of their rules and can get expensive .
neutral	no_frills means no_frills .
neutral	google_chrome is not so good .
neutral	it keeps crashing and have to reboot it .
neutral	they used to leave the food bags in the porch .
neutral	now it '_s ultra sophisticated , with signatures required , text_messages indicating time of delivery ( academic to me , as i ' m out working anyway ) and opt - outs to leave the bags ( which they can '_t do first time )
neutral	please get them to work like they used to , otherwise i '_ll switch pet_food supply to a company with a better delivery partner .
neutral	i got a voucher with a non descript rental company name on it , with no mention that the rental company was europcar .
neutral	meant we had to ask at different car_rental desks in the airport who they thought the supplier might be .
neutral	when we found out it was europcar , we joined a long queue at the back of the queue so meant 00_mins plus wait to get sorted !
neutral	good value but some basics absent !
neutral	great prices and great range of clothing
neutral	no_problems with the polite and friendly staff and very good service on both sites , however the gold_car_hire firm used by jet0 car_hire is very poor .
neutral	the insurance is a rip_off , the car was in poor condition with none of the required safety equipment and the terms of the insurance we ' re not explained properly to us , resulting in an unwarranted charge of 000_euros .
neutral	the written information provided differed in 0 documents - one said the insurance was only invalid if you went to africa but the other , in tiny print said invalid outside spanish borders ie not valid in gibraltar .
neutral	this was categorically not explained .
neutral	air travel - fine - car_hire a potential minefield and definitely a rip_off .
neutral	while the information leading up and including the delivery and was really impressive , the actual flower_arrangement left me unimpressed .
neutral	fortunatley for me my wife was delighted with her flowers but i regret using this service and wish i had just spent he nearly_£_00 on a more impressive bouquet from a local_florist .
neutral	would not use your company again .
neutral	last_year they offered a lower payment cause i never upgraded to another phone when contract ended ..
neutral	when i got monthly_bill it was higher than the offer so i had to phone up every month to correct it which cost you money to ring them also and always got a different excuse .
neutral	ended_up changing contract as it was a piece of nonsense .
neutral	i ordered 0 products recently .
neutral	they took 0 days for delivery and when the parcel was delivered there were two items missing from the order as it had been tampered with en_route .
neutral	simply_supplements have since promised to send me the missing items .
neutral	but i still take issue with the slow delivery .
neutral	they have excellent prices and an amazing selection .
neutral	i just wish they didn_'_t use parcelforce who at best are unreliable .
neutral	with the growth of couriers such as dpd who give you an_hour delivery slot , they should look at alternatives .
neutral	i waited in on saturday for a delivery that an_email told me was on its way , and the parcelforce website said was loaded on the van for delivery .
neutral	drilling down the site later in the day i found parcelforce don_'_t deliver on saturday so now i must wait in all day ( possibly ) on monday .
neutral	when i lived in london i stopped using whisky_exchange because parcelforce are so poor , wich is a pity as the prices and product of whisky_exchange are so good .
neutral	now i live in a rural setting i hoped things would improve but parcelforce seem to be useless wherever you live .
neutral	although customer service was fast to reply , and there were no issues as such with my order , it seems a bit_slow to have to wait ten days for just a magazine .
neutral	perhaps royal_mail would have done a faster job .
neutral	i recently ordered the 00 bottle elderflower champagne kit which arrived 0 days after order .
neutral	excellent !
neutral	i then received the recipe via_email for the champagne .
neutral	here lay the problem : recipe mentioned hydrometer which did not come with the kit .
neutral	it did not mention campden tablets which did come with the kit .
neutral	it did not state how many bottles the recipe was for .
neutral	i made a call to [_name ] at the home brew centre and he was most helpful , however , i do think that the recipe instructions should be amended depending on which size kit one has bought rather_than just getting a generic recipe .
neutral	i am going to give it a go and see if my results are drinkable !
neutral	even_though i did not pay extra for speedy delivery - the laptop arrived the next working day .
neutral	unfortunately , it was not the laptop i had ordered - the intel i0 processor was not correct and the laptop i received had an inferior processor . i emailed the sales and returns department but the emails were returned as their inbox was not accepting emails .
neutral	i also emailed the sales and returns department of box . co . uk ( the parent company ) - same result - my emails were bounced_back .
neutral	i used their online form to contact them ( both at saveonlaptops and box ) - but when i hit submit i got no message to suggest that my contact form had been accepted .
neutral	i was now much more frustrated by their attempts to avoid dealing_with me than i was by the delivery of the wrong product , and was going down the small - claims and county - court route to seek redress .
neutral	however , one of my online contacts must have got through as i got a response from them to raise a returns rma .
neutral	based on my lack of ability to contact them before , i decided against trying to return the laptop - i had no confidence that they could handle a return and i doubt that i would see it or a refund again .
neutral	the delivery is great - but their after_sales service stinks .
neutral	they would be a thousand times more successful if they had a reasonable after - sales service .
neutral	despite putting my registration_number into the site found the tyres selected were a completely_different size to those on the car which i have owned since new .
neutral	the helpline quickly altered the purchase to the correct ones
neutral	to all ,
neutral	the speed tester is as good as most on the web .
neutral	its also pretty close to the official bt version .
neutral	however its a post_code test and doesn_'_t use your logon so its never going to be the best test .
neutral	but its a good reference .
neutral	be aware broadbandchoices website has bias suppliers claiming packages that can '_t be delivered .
neutral	having tested my line i was confronted with a very limited number of supplier results considering there are 000 '_s of suppliers within the uk .
neutral	00_% of the results where technncally impossible from my local exchange .
neutral	not good .
neutral	conclusion ................. results can '_t be trusted 000_%.
neutral	know your exchange capabilities first .
neutral	ask you current provider to test your line first before moving .
neutral	rememeber your line is , in general , the same one with next provider with obvious exceptions such as llu suppliers & fiber .
neutral	what '_s bad will stay bad unless you fix it .
neutral	thats when you find put who are the good providers .
neutral	from a qualified it expert who works with a leading adsl provider everyday of the week .
neutral	the tiles were lovely and would recommend them they are mimeo grey satin multi tile use , unfortunately i ran_out so had to order further boxes which were all smashed on delivery , plus delivery charges very high , replacements boxes sent but took days to get here and customer service was very slow in getting back to me , so tiles great , customer service not
neutral	bought an ee locked iphone from ebay .
neutral	thought we could find a cheap , quick & easy way to unlock , however this is sadly not the case with ee .
neutral	when i ordered the ' unlock ', having not read the small_print , i was annoyed to find that all this company did was check back to ee confirming that an official unlock was permitted .
neutral	i paid £_00 . 00 to be told something that i already knew !
neutral	i couldn_'_t find a local firm to complete the unlock , so grudgingly i paid the additional £_00 required to complete the unlock via this site .
neutral	it took another 00_hours , so in total , i had to wait 0 days from the beginning of the process to completion .
neutral	i am satisfied with the result , just a little cheesed off with the cost !
neutral	!
neutral	we had been so impressed with the service received to plan our trip through russia , asia and australasia .
neutral	everything_went like_clockwork until we arrived in sydney to catch our plane to auckland .
neutral	no one had informed us that it had been cancelled by qantas yet we had asked for our flights to be monitored as we were travelling extensively .
neutral	so w e had to spend a whole day at the airport with no assistance from qantas for food or drink .
neutral	this was most disappointing considering our excellent introduction to flight centre .
neutral	i am very surprised that so few have reviewed dhgate and those who have , had nothing particularly nice to say .
neutral	i suspect , valid fears of counterfeit products or non - delivery are scaring people away from the often “ too good to be true ” prices available .
neutral	well i am here to testify that dhgate is a relatively safe_place to trade provided you go in with your eyes open , exercise caution and shop wisely .
neutral	the review below is far longer_than i would normally write but it is done to try and get the full message ( good , bad , warts and all ) across to prospective “ members ” of the dhgate experience .
neutral	i should point out that the bulk of this advice is not exclusive to dhgate .
neutral	this is general advice for dealing_with the chinese market .
neutral	armed with this information and your experience of ebay , you can make a more informed_decision .
neutral	i gave dhgate a 0 * review because , like with ebay , you will find sellers rated 0 to 0 and everywhere in between .
neutral	firstly , dhgate is an internet portal bringing together sellers ( predominantly chinese ) and buyers like me and you from all over the world .
neutral	think along the lines of a chinese ebay .
neutral	the chinese are the masters of imitation and so feeling your way around the site is easy if you are an ebayer .
neutral	you should routinely perform the same checks with sellers before making any purchase .
neutral	look at the feedback and comments from others .
neutral	use this information as you would with ebay and remember , no rating is often worse_than a bad rating .
neutral	you will find lots of counterfeit stuff on the site but this shouldn ’ t come as too much of a surprise as the site itself is effectively a counterfeit ebay - they even have a dispute resolution centre !
neutral	in terms of what ’_s available , just about everything is for sale .
neutral	however , by being selective , you can minimise the chances of buying fake goods .
neutral	some people will have you believe that fakes are actually made in the same factory and by the same staff as the genuine articles .
neutral	wrong !
neutral	this may have been the case 00 - 00 years_ago but not today .
neutral	take apple as an example who manufacture the iphone in china .
neutral	to win this lucrative contract , manufacturers ( with facilities the size of cities ) fight to firstly win and then to retain the right to manufacture .
neutral	eggs are never put in one basket and there are always 0 or 0 different companies manufacturing such products at the same time .
neutral	this protects apple ( or whoever ) against being held to ransom and to ensure continuity of supply in the event of natural disasters or strikes .
neutral	these businesses are always under the watchful eye of the brand owner and cannot_afford to put a foot wrong .
neutral	the myth that these are made in the same factories is perpetuated by the fakers themselves to make you and i believe that even if the goods are fake , they are the same quality .
neutral	try using a fake iphone or try on a fake armani and you will soon realise there is no truth in this myth .
neutral	this applies to all top_brands from around the globe without_exception .
neutral	the counterfeiters work in much cruder factories and this is evident in everything they produce , be it electronics , clothing , cosmetics or even viagra .
neutral	counterfeiting is such big business that officials are reluctant to shut it down because it keeps tens of millions in work .
neutral	a palm is filled with cash and a blind eye is turned .
neutral	the rule of thumb i use is to avoid western branded goods completely .
neutral	these items fetch a premium_rate and are “ worthwhile ” faking .
neutral	let ’_s not forget there is still a considerable start - up cost for the counterfeiter setting_up his factory and production line .
neutral	he will only do this if he can sell for a premium price ( apple , armani ; etc_.)
neutral	or sell in huge volume ( gillette , duracell ; etc ).
neutral	you can also be sure that as good as 000_% of computer software , cds , dvds etc are fake as these are relatively easy to copy .
neutral	so what can you buy ?
neutral	my advice is to buy chinese branded goods as these are often good quality and far below the price of the foreign counterpart .
neutral	as an example , i collect fountain pens .
neutral	i have bought hundreds of pens from china .
neutral	these are baoer , duke , picasso , jinhao , hero etc .
neutral	by shopping around , you can get a great quality writing instrument for a fraction of the western alternative .
neutral	more bang for your buck .
neutral	shanghai is the centre of the industry and counterfeits are very few and far between .
neutral	however , when i am buying a parker or a montblanc , china is the last place i would look as these will be fake .
neutral	the chinese do not tend to counterfeit chinese goods unless they are very high - end .
neutral	i share this advice as both a consumer and as a senior risk analyst who has recently returned from a 0 year ex - pat assignment in hong_kong .
neutral	my job was visiting these factories and assessing their credibility , performance and creditworthiness so i know the products you can expect to find on this site .
neutral	i hope my insight coupled_with your_own judgement , enables you to find a bargain .
neutral	if you do give dhgate a whirl , a few more tips ( you will be relieved if you are brave enough to have read this far ) are in bullet form below .
neutral	• do some research and find out whether a chinese brand is available
neutral	• always check a sellers feedback
neutral	• place a small order first to test quality and seller reliability
neutral	• watch out for true cost which is often “ hidden ” in shipping_charges
neutral	• check minimum order – sometimes you must buy 000 or even 0 , 000 units
neutral	• always pay via escrow facility such as paypal .
neutral	if seller won ’ t take paypal , walk_away
neutral	• prepare to wait , it will take goods 0 - 0 weeks to reach europe
neutral	• be very wary of branded goods
neutral	• if things go_wrong you will face a language barrier so keep communication short & simple .
neutral	• if all of the above hasn ’ t put you off and you take the plunge , share your_own experience here on trust_pilot .
neutral	the more consumers that share their experience , the better informed and safer we can all become .
neutral	really good item at good price but to then charge a fiver for delivery of something that would fit through the letterbox is a bit too much
neutral	items delivered a day late after having waited for 0 hours previous day .
neutral	driver didn_'_t stay while i checked items , discovered vanity_unit damaged .
neutral	rang customer_services sunday and was asked to send pictures of damage . rang customer_services services yesterday they said pictures received and that she would inform the person dealing and get them to ring me back , still no phone_call .
neutral	have now noticed my vanity_unit is out of stock till 00 / 0 / 00 wonder whats going to happen now .
neutral	i was away out of the country for a few_months and on return they had aiken the number .
neutral	yes it was sorted after a couple phone_calls but that '_s besides the point .
neutral	i didn_'_t take number with me as it would of been expensive to use abroad .
neutral	order online and go and collect - brilliant .
neutral	either pay online or when you ghetto store .
neutral	i like the fact when you type in code it '_s up to date how many they have and where is the mos local_store to you .
neutral	great store
neutral	tesco is ok for groceries if you are going to use them thatday , but you can '_t buy to last fora few_days .
neutral	they do have some bargains .
neutral	i fly regularly and choose these cheap flights but just make_sure that you don_'_t go over the allowance otherwise you will be stung .
neutral	always good flights it '_s just the extras that turn these into expensive flights .
neutral	ordering is easy and straight_forward , the only problem is that a few_days go by and then you have a email to say that some items are out of stock .
neutral	they need to update website more so as there is more chance of getting what you order .
neutral	other_sites seem to get it right .
neutral	come on sports_direct we love your clothes .
neutral	have had an fp - 000 for some time now .
neutral	the egg whisk is badly designed as it is so easy for food matter to enter into the body of the whisk and subsequently cause the gears to strip .
neutral	simple seals on the whisk shafts would solve this but kenwood will not accept this .
neutral	the lid bearing for the processor accessories is also a weak component , which cannot be purchased on its own , as you need to buy the whole lid .
neutral	not eco - friendly since this bearing gets a hammering and wears out regularly .
neutral	have had to make my own engineering modification to fix this bad design and now it works more reliably .
neutral	have written to kenwood , but they just stick their heads in the sand and come out with the usual mantra " no one else has complained ".
neutral	these days manufacturers build down to a price level rather_than up to a quality level , and quality suffers throughout the range as designers get set in a " build it cheap " frame of mind .
neutral	the product is otherwise good , just spoiled by this lack of attention to design excellence .
neutral	had to wait an age for the goods
neutral	had to pay 0 postage_charges as you have to order banners seprately from other products .
neutral	company said would refund never did !
neutral	products and general service fine .
neutral	have moved from vodafone after ten_years ( ouch !)
neutral	as o0 offered a good deal and vodafone couldnt match it .
neutral	have so far been pleasantly_surprised .
neutral	bought this item from argos - everything ok .
neutral	took it home and tried the steamer part on the cooker - worked great but was awkward to handle .
neutral	then tried it on the kitchen lino floor - again no_probs except for the handle being flimsy and feeling like it may snap at any moment .
neutral	now tried the carpet_cleaner - nope it didnt do what it said on the box .
neutral	i tried it 0 or 0 times but stains are still there .
neutral	i bet that if i went through the process of returning it , their engineer would find no fault with it as i have read on other review_sites so i think i will just swallow my loss .
neutral	recommend it - no way - it is a waste of the £_00 . 00 that it is priced at .
neutral	i have yet to try the duster and window cleaner but as i have mobility problems then i cannot see me managing the windows on the outside .
neutral	the 0_stars are because i am feeling generous but if i could then would only give them 0½ stars max
neutral	being out of stock is understandable on items that you don_'_t have control over .
neutral	however with things like the nuts for the tubeless rims , being out of stock for ages on those was ridiculous .
neutral	now i '_ve ordered one of your_own_brand shocks and there is at_least a two week wait for those .
neutral	that aside , the guys at sip at great .
neutral	the catalogue is brilliant .
neutral	that '_s why we keep_coming_back !
neutral	the site works well and puts you in touch with rated carriers who are generally quite reasonably_priced and compete for your business , but after going through the selection process , a fee of 00_% ( inv vat ) for jobs up to £_000 is added to the winning bid for shiply '_s fee , and i believe that they also take a fee from the carrier .
neutral	this is not made readily apparent or easily found on the website .
neutral	i realise that the company has to charge a fee , but why not let users know earlier in the process , or in the descriptive video of how the site works , for instance , instead of sneaking it in at the end , ryanair style .
neutral	there is no button on the website for fee structure .
neutral	a newly opened tesco extra at salford manchester which displays only two wife ’_s birthday cards !!!!!!
neutral	a shopping a shopping_experience
neutral	excellent service , but i had to help carry in the extra large box in to the house really should have 0 drivers for big products not fair on the poor delivery guy
neutral	fantastic price for the canon_powershot sx00 .
neutral	having ordered on the internet i did not expect to have to contact the call_centre to " confirm " my order .
neutral	kept on hold for 00_minutes , spoke to someone but got cut_off on transfer somewhere_else and had to re dial .
neutral	seems that the need to call is an upsell opportunity for slrhut .
neutral	i declined the price for the sd_card ( got one much_cheaper via amazon ) but fell for the battery even although the camera comes with battery supplied by canon .
neutral	so i have 0 batteries and charger with a 0 pin adapter that doesn_'_t connect to the us spec charger supplied .
positive	thanks petmeds for making a complicated procedure simple .
positive	regards dave jones

positive	i have just bought a new washer_dryer from 000 electrical and the service has_been fantastic .
positive	i placed an order on line on tuesday and the washer_dryer was delivered on thursday .
positive	000 kept in touch by text and phone_calls to let me know when the washer_dryer would be delivered and even gave a 0 hour time_slot .
positive	the delivery_men were really helpful , phoned when they were half an_hour away and easily got up some awkward steps at the front of my house that other delivery drivers have ' huffed ' about .
positive	all the other_retailers i researched for the same product were not only more_expensive but could not deliver for at_least 0 weeks !

positive	quality hard back cover , and good quality paper .
positive	photographs reproduced with true colours and crisp definition ( except where i chose to keep in photos that the website indicated were not optimal .
positive	my choice ).
positive	don_'_t underestimate the time it takes to sort the photos into the right order .
positive	cropping , fixing red eye , colour tinting .... you can spend hours getting it right , but the project can be saved and returned to .
positive	it took some time to get used to the app ! ovation , but i got quicker over time .

positive	on arrival we were extremely impressed .
positive	the villa was superb , it was large , clean and fully equipped with everything you may need .
positive	the pool was enjoyed by all , especially my 00 year_old son , who only came out of it to eat and sleep !
positive	we were in walking_distance of a small number of restaurants , which had superb views over the bay , but weren_'_t exactly the best i '_ve ever dined in , although far from the worst .
positive	menorca we found to be lovely and relatively uncommercialised .
positive	this was the best family holiday we have ever had .
positive	villa_plus delivered on all_aspects and i would recommend them to anybody .
positive	thank_you , from the woodcock family .
positive	changed banks , which i was doing anyway , and " earned " £_00 which i received today .
positive	overall it took 0 weeks , but it '_s free money so the wait is insignificant .
positive	so , don_'_t even think about it , it '_s an_absolute no - brainer , sign up today and start earning .
positive	we needed currency at short_notice , and i went to my local post_office to buy it , having first checked their rates online .
positive	however , the rate they offered me was very poor and much lower_than the online quote , so i decided on principle not to buy from them .
positive	i returned home , went online , got a quote from travelex for me to collect the currency next_day at the airport .
positive	the rate for euros was almost 00 cents to the pound better_than the post_office , and it took me about 0 minutes to complete my online order .
positive	collection at the airport was simple , convenient , and courteous .
positive	a perfect result .
positive	thank_you travelex , i will be using you again for sure .
positive	all dialogue with age_partnership was extremely pleasant .
positive	the staff were knowledgeable , personable , and courteous , and put me completely at ease .
positive	they helped make a serious business for me relatively easy , and were able to get me a better return for my annuity funds than any other company i contacted , including the " big names ".
positive	i can_honestly recommend them unreservedly .

positive	we have booked our usa car_hire with usrentacar on many occasions , but not before carefully checking competitors ' prices .
positive	we have never had any_problems at all with using their services , and their prices are always the best .
positive	the convenience of printing the voucher at home is very useful too .
positive	overall , faultless service and an efficient , user - friendly booking process , means that usrentacar are always a pleasure to deal with .
positive	i came_across this company online and spent some time checking them out and comparing it with others .
positive	i was very skeptical about it at first especially after i could not send the money directly using my debit_card and they do not have a paypal_account which i think they should so people can be more at ease and to make it worse , i am located in the islands of cape verde , est africa . but anyway i sent the money transfer through my bank and was eager to get unlocked .
positive	but 0st i had to be very patient since it took a few_days for the money to be cleared , then another 00_hours for them to get the response from apple servers .
positive	i sent the money on tuesday , it was recieved on thursday and i received the e_- mail telling_me that i was unlocked on saturday_morning ( a week - end , mind you ).
positive	that '_s why i feel nothing but pure joy joy joy , because these_folks are real and they take care of their customers .
positive	i was even so happy to know from the web designer , that the concept for the site was done in cape verde when he came here on vacation months_ago .
positive	well folks , there you have it .
positive	i trust them totally and i will do_business with them again and will tell all my friends about them .
positive	thank_you again for this new found freedom for my iphone .
positive	it took less_than 0 days from sending the phones to receiving the full payment as stated on line .
positive	we were informed by email of every_stage of the process .
positive	this is our second time using this company and it will not be the last .
positive	a big pat on the back for speed and excellent customer_care .
positive	the parcel arrived on time and in perfect_condition

positive	we were delighted and would definitely recommend .
positive	just what i was looking for ... and great personal service .
positive	passion digital are knowledgeable in the digital space while also having a really good understanding of how to engage with the customer and get results across key digital marketing .

positive	nice experience .
positive	i cannot_fault gear0music , no sooner had i placed my order , i recieved an_email_confirming my order , i then recieved a second email_telling_me my order had been dispatched , and i should recieve it the folowing day .

positive	i ordered an electronic garage door opener for a disabled relative .
positive	delivery was fast and very well_packaged .
positive	during unpacking i was surprised by the quality of the components , perfectly machined and fitting together snugly , with obvious attention to detail during design .
positive	as mentioned the instructions would be a headache if used alone , but i had my laptop at the side and followed the much more user_friendly installation video on the website which made the whole_process relatively easy .
positive	the door worked_perfectly the first time i tried it , i then carried_out the adjustments as advised in the setup guide ( an easy 0 minute job ) and that was that !
positive	has made me want one for my own garage , its that good !
positive	handy to have a store locally as maplins stock loads of those ' hmm where the bugger can i get that ?!'
positive	things !
positive	decent prices and staff who know what they are talking_about .
positive	only done the mail order thing once but it was cheap and quick .
positive	recommended .
positive	i think most of what can be said has_been said , but i want to say the best tip i have been given recently was to get the asda credit_card if you do online groceries .
positive	as long as you spend more than £_00 you get free delivery and can still select your_own time_slot .
positive	so for us , a family of 0 , we spend around £_000 a week on online groceries , so this adds up to a £_000 saving on deliveries per year !
positive	on top of that it is a reward card , so we get petrol etc on it and get vouchers in return .
positive	it is from the ' santander ' group and we already have one of theirs but got the asda one without problems .
positive	there is an interest free transfer period as well but i can '_t remember how long sorry .
positive	hope that helps .

positive	after being with o0 and vodafone since my first mobile i was a bit_wary of going to t - mobile for no other reason than my own perceptions .
positive	o0 gave me poor reception , vodafone gave me sleepless nights over their customer_services , so i was in the mood for a change .
positive	t - mob had the best prices at the time so i took the plunge .
positive	i have been more than happy and i am into my 0th year with them .
positive	my connection is superb and the allowances / dataplans are as good as any .
positive	i use my i ' net allowance on an iphone 0 00_% mobile and the other 00_% tethered with my laptop , and it is great either way .
positive	i can '_t see myself leaving anytime soon as the deal i got on my iphone was great and so i expect future ' upgrades ' to be the same .
positive	:)
positive	i am a returning customer and although we had a problem with our first item ( a remote_control camera / car ) it was sorted in no time and with zero fuss .

positive	we were horrified by the side effects of the medication prescribed by the vet , so thought we ' d try this first .

positive	after three_months the change in her is amazing .
positive	once again she can leap up onto her favourite armchair in one fluid movement , and she saunters around the garden like a cat half her age .

positive	this was the first time i '_ve ever used on - line spectacle supply .
positive	being very shortsighted (- 0 . 00 ) i have learned the glasses must be 000_% right if i am to see properly .
positive	initially i chose this company because , unlike many others , they will do lenses as strong as i need .
positive	i wear contact_lenses , so i am less fussy about glasses as i only wear them late at night or in emergency .
positive	so i ordered one of their special deals , and for under £_00 i received an absolutely perfect pair with high refractive lenses and scratch resistant coating .
positive	their service puts high_street opticians to shame !
positive	side by side there is nothing to choose between the £_000 pair from the high_street i recently got , and my £_00 pair from glasses0you .
positive	i can thoroughly_recommend them .
positive	don_'_t have any doubts_about on - line glasses !
positive	excellent company very professional and what an excellent price less_than 00_% of a local company charge even with the postage !
positive	no_problems what so ever with the product even getting a registered 0 yrs .
positive	warranty whereas my local company was a measly 0 yrs .
positive	!
positive	cannot recommend this company high enough !
positive	the company was fair and extremely quick at paying out , sure i could have got £_00 more on ebay , with all the hassle etc .
positive	no , this company treated me fairly and had all done , cheque in hand ( just opened as the mazuma advert was on tv ) within three days , excellent !
positive	oh and almost forgot , all so easy done !
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	this way it is so easy to make someone happy , always in the loop , great communication .
positive	wonderful !

positive	i am so glad i found this company .
positive	i found them when researching mattresses for my b_& b .
positive	i was so impressed with their website and their information that i rang and spoke to a very nice woman_who gave me all the advice i could have wanted in choosing a mattress .
positive	i settled on the superking origins pocket 0000 and every_single guest has commented on what a fabulous bed it is .
positive	since then , my daughter has bought the same one and loves it .
positive	recently , for my rental property , i have bought a memory_foam mattress from their new division .
positive	this is a great new direction for john_ryan .
positive	my reason for a memory_foam mattress was it was a little cheaper for rental than the origins pocket and because it has a removable and replaceable topper .
positive	this is a brilliant idea and saves the mattress - an important consideration for rentals .
positive	the bonus is it is so comfortable .
positive	we have been using it while we refurbish the property and it is wonderful to sleep on .
positive	not too hot , like many memory_foam mattresses and not too soft .
positive	it really is perfect and i am so pleased .
positive	i am very fussy and have a vi - spring for my own use ( which will be replaced when tired with a john_ryan artisan ) so for me to be able to report that i am happy to sleep on it is a real accolade .
positive	my younger daughter has since bought one ( different firmness ) and is very , very happy with it .
positive	so four beds bought by us all in all so i would say satisfaction is 000_% and you really can '_t beat the customer service either .
positive	talk to lee if you want memory_foam .
positive	he is so helpful and takes into_consideration your weight and any concerns you might have in terms of support etc .
positive	they seem cheaper_than most other_suppliers and the product arrives promptly and well_wrapped .
positive	what i liked most is that i got an_email to tell me that i still had a valid prescription for my dog and when it ended .
positive	i am pretty sure i will only be using this company from now on .
positive	as it arrived very quick the chilly powder a super hot just how the family like it order gluten_free flour made great bread with my bread maker

positive	once submitted , the book was printed quicky and delivered safely .

positive	this week however things did go_wrong , but not because of them .
positive	the courier requested a specific parcel which he was given , but then delivered it to the wrong place .
positive	parcel0go have sorted this out for me and hopefully my customer will have the correct parcel later today .
positive	thank_you tanya on ' live_chat ' for sorting this .
positive	it is a very busy time for all couriers , and mistakes_happen .
positive	i ordered a 00 - string_guitar from this company via their website .
positive	they had a telephone_number to call so i first made sure they had the guitar in stock - the salesperson was friendly and helpful and they did have the guitar as stated on their website .
positive	the guitar arrived less_than 00_hours_later at the time i was told it would arrive .
positive	it was well_packed and i ' m very happy with it .
positive	i will be buying another guitar soon from this company and theirs will be amongst the first websites i go to for musical products from now on .
positive	first_class service .
positive	thanks reidy '_s .
positive	i was looking for a marshall as000d acoustic amp and had some very fishy service from the music equipment retailer i usually use ( if you know what i mean ).
positive	i also had " bait and switch " experiences from some of the other_retailers i called whereby new stock was claimed on web - sites that then turned_out to be ex - showroom stock which was " only out of the box for a day or two - honest ".
positive	yeah_right , more probably a month or two and possibly pounded at full volume by every aspiring ac / dc fan who walked in the shop .
positive	it only takes a second to damage a speaker so i wasn_'_t too happy to have my time wasted by these " bait and switch " merchants .
positive	andertons was a breath of fresh_air and i was treated with respect as a customer from the start .
positive	the man with whom i spoke on the phone gave me his name without being asked .
positive	i called on a friday_morning at about 00 am and when i told him i needed next_day saturday delivery he told me that it wasn_'_t a problem and that they had 0 units ( as stated on the website ).
positive	he said he ' d check out which stores the units were at and call me back within 00_minutes .
positive	he called me back in 0 minutes took my credit_card_details and said he ' d email me as soon as the shipping had been arranged .
positive	i checked my email about 00_minutes later and found confirmation of the order .
positive	i also went to their website and sure_enough the stock level on the product page had dropped to " 0 ".
positive	i had another email about half an_hour after that with a ups tracking_number on it and advice to the effect that tracking would be active at about 0 o ' clock that evening when the package had been picked_up from andertons and delivered to the ups warehouse .
positive	sure_enough i clicked on the tracking link just after 0 and it was logged as having arrived .
positive	i looked at the tracking_info later that evening and early the next_morning and every_stage of the route was logged so i knew_exactly where it was .
positive	a ups man was at my door shortly_after 0 o ' clock on saturday_morning and i plugged in the amp and was playing guitar through it a few_minutes after that .
positive	andertons had taken 00_hours to get the amp to me on a saturday !
positive	if i had to describe the service in a few words i ' d call it " an american standard of service in the uk ".
positive	i look_forward to using andertons for all my future gear purchases .
positive	i ordered some a euros for delivery on a day i would be at home .
positive	the exchange_rates was competitive and delivery charge more reasonable than other_providers .
positive	delivery was duly made on the day so i cannot_fault the service .

positive	delivery was very prompt and goods were packaged well and all present .
positive	new laptop arrived exactly when advised and the communication from the delivery company was very organised .

positive	absolutely no concerns and would happily use them again .
positive	my mommy ordered the seraquin tablets for dogs ( large ) for me .

positive	i received my purchase within 00_hours well_packaged and exactly as_described .
positive	the product is good and the price was fair if not excellent against the competition .
positive	my total purchase was over £_000 gbp , so i benefited from the multi purchase discount and shipping was free ( or at_least built into the price .)
positive	i will buy from healthspark again in the future and i am not affiliated with them in case you think this is too good a review .
positive	we use interparcel all the time , ups are brilliant , most of the time after booking they are at the front_door before i have had time to print label !!
positive	!
positive	catherine was brilliant , i was sending a pallet to ireland , my address was longwinded and she tidied it all up for me so the labels could be printed .

positive	it was also 00 . 00 in the evening and she did not leave the chat until 00 . 00 , excellent , she also sorted the courier ups for me .
positive	ups picked_up the next_day { today ) at 00 am , what more can you ask for .
positive	ups are also an excellent company , service with a smile .
positive	we have had several chairs from this company .
positive	in the past the chairs have always been good but this time the chair seat split within 0 days .

positive	then i can use my card to pay , or pay on delivery ... and it '_s brought to my door ... simplzz :)
positive	this was my first experience of using this service , & it did serve me well .
positive	as a nervous newbie , i felt concern on the day it was due to be collected , for ' next_day delivery ' when the day was closing fast , and the parcel had still not been collected half an_hour before the ' end ' time .... but then , in the nic ' of time the courier arrived , and all was well :-)
positive	this collection worry for me ,( having faithfully promised the addressee , that the parcel would be with her , the following_day )...
positive	i think ... could have been removed .
positive	a courtesy_call or text in the morning , on the day of delivery , from the courier / driver , letting me know , that he was aware of my parcel , & it was on his days worksheet - would have let me know he was coming .
positive	any further information , perhaps that he hoped to be with me , either am or pm , or between , 0 & 0 pm , or something similar , would be a welcome added_bonus .
positive	having said that ... &, as i previously said the outcome was positive , everything_went to plan , and my parcels addressee was delighted .
positive	i will use this service again , even_though you may find it a little dearer_than the post_office - for myself & other people unable to get to the post_office themselves , this service is a godsend .
positive	it also saves having to ask friends to carry heavy items to the post_office , for me .
positive	i now believe , that the service is far_superior , & more reliable than the p . office , & can only wish this service success , & many more customers in the future .
positive	delighted .

positive	however it was the service which impressed me - i had googled the appliance with a view to getting it as cheaply as possible and beyond tv came up with not only the lowest_price but a code to get a further £_00 off .
positive	ok so cheapest doesn_'_t mean best service but i was so impressed by them - i recieved an_email from them confirming everything , then a phone_call to let me know my preferred delivery date was confirmed , and was told the driver would contact me to advise a delivery time .
positive	he phoned the night before as i was going to be his first stop and duly_arrived_bang on time .
positive	he was cheerful , smiley and very conscientous , unwrapping the appliance ( i hadn_'_t paid for the service ), positioning it and advising me as to how to let the fridge settle etc before i turned it on .
positive	my next appliance will_certainly be from beyond_television - must see what else they sell ;-)
positive	the strings were free but obviously , that '_s not practical so i '_ll have to leave it at :
positive	price / quality / delivery - all excellent .

positive	after speaking to a very helpful lady assistant on a saturday , our z - tec rollator
positive	arrived first thing on the tuesday_morning .
positive	my husband who has had three major
positive	heart operations has found it to be the most suitable rollator and has not stopped
positive	using it since it arrived .
positive	on many occasions we had tried to speak to someone
positive	responsible in several other mobility companies , and had sent back several other
positive	rollators which were much heavier than advertised .
positive	the z - tec is by far the lightest
positive	one we have found , it is well balanced and easy to put in the car .
positive	it has_been used
positive	round supermarkets , three racing stables with cobbled yards , and he really would
positive	not have coped without it .
positive	the most necessary item has_been the seat as he frequently has to sit down quickly , and is able to do this on his own .

positive	i ordered a canon_000d camera body from simplyelectronics on the tuesday_evening .
positive	only later in the evening did i see all the other reviews commenting on the poor service and liability for import_duty and vat etc .
positive	on the wednesday_morning i was intending to contact customer_services and cancel the order , when i received an e_- mail to say that my item had already been dispatched ( it was on a 0 - 0 day delivery ).
positive	i was even more surprised to see the courier at my door later that afternoon .
positive	the turnaround was certainly impressive !
positive	!
positive	the camera packaging was sealed and in good condition .
positive	the canon instruction_manual referred to a uk address and contact numbers and the packaging contained a uk 0 - pin plug .
positive	i have registered the camera serial_number with canon and the camera works_perfectly with my existing lenses ( both generic and canon ).
positive	there is absolutely nothing to give me concern regarding a grey_import and at less_than 00_hours between placing the order on - line and receiving the goods the camera must have come from a uk address ( the senders address on the delivery label was in london ).
positive	based on this i would happily use this website again .
positive	our flight was delayed and the customs procedure took more than a hour , but the driver patiently waited for us .
positive	he tried to call me many_times , but i couldn_'_t pick_up the phone .
positive	still he never complained .
positive	the ride to the city was smooth and comfortable .
positive	good vitamins at a sensible price , plus my delivery arrived in 0 days .

positive	when i rung to thank them and ask what i was to do with the first towel_rail , i was told to keep it , very honest company to deal with , we shall_certainly use them again .
positive	i have used vitasunn for over a year now and they are great . i once ordered wrongly , it was put right straight_away for me . they are a great company to deal with , keep_up the good work !
positive	thanks .

positive	i called back to place the order for two small pieces of hardware .
positive	these arrived within 00_hours of ordering - i . e .
positive	am next_day .
positive	overall excellent service & prices .
positive	if i have one small grumble it is the cost of delivery - £ 0 +_vat = £ 0 . 00 for two small lightweight products .
positive	that said they arrived as two_separate packages , by secure delivery , am next_day .
positive	perhaps it may be worth considering alternative delivery options ?
positive	next_day delivery i always feel is excellent but dpd go even better and give you a 0 hour time_slot !
positive	how they manage to do it i don_'_t know !
positive	with traffic and poor roads and people not in when they call etc it '_s amazing !
positive	the driver was well in the 0 hour_slot and was friendly and professional .
positive	i wish every supplier would use dpd - they are ' simply the best '.
positive	:-)

positive	we ' re delighted with our sign .
positive	good service from atlantic_signs and it looks great .
positive	recommended .
positive	easy ordering on line though you need to plan a few_days ahead to make an_appointment with a fitter and to be sure the tyres are in stock with your name on them .
positive	the website recommended a local fitter i ' d never used before but they proved to be excellent .
positive	the fitter was expecting us , told us how long the job would take , and had the car waiting for us on time .
positive	he checked the tracking but there was no adjustment needed , so no charge .
positive	very fair and very honest .
positive	would definitely recommend .

positive	great price , i thought i would have to wait awhile as i ordered between xmas & new year , but it came really quickly .
positive	i would recommend animed to any pet owner .

positive	i ordered a park chain checker form merlin_cycles because they offerred the best value and included free delivery .
positive	the process was very easy and the goods arrived quickly .
positive	i contacted parcel0go as i have a parcel to go to spain but know there is a surcharge for a " remote " destination .
positive	i spoke to emma today and she provided me with all the details to enable me to book the parcel in later in the month for collection .
positive	she was very helpful and gave me the information quickly .
positive	unlike jon at the weekend who made me feel like giving up the will to continue living , as he was unable to provide the information i received quickly from emma .
positive	so glad i decided to give parcel0go another call on live_chat this morning ..
positive	thanks emma and due to her help i shall be using parcel0go and not another company .
positive	most of us have stories of waiting hours for deliveries or services that never came ; of not knowing what was happening , taking time off work only to find we had wasted a day .
positive	a . o . com ( formerly appliances_online ) make such experiences a thing of the past .
positive	ordering online in the early hours of the morning after a late - night terminal breakdown of my washing_machine i was able to go to sleep reassured that i would have one two days_later , having chosen free delivery .
positive	the ordering_process was very clear .
positive	emails detailing my order had full , clear and easily read information , and a friendly call from customer_services the following_morning confirmed that all was in order .
positive	i was alerted that i would receive an early morning call to confirm my delivery time_slot and a text gave me the name of my delivery driver , norman .
positive	a follow - up call an_hour or so before delivery made sure i was ready , and the actual delivery and installation , including disconnection and removal of my old machine was completed within 00_minutes .
positive	norman even mopped my floor to make_sure it was safe .
positive	the packaging was whisked away and a quick demonstration reassured me my new machine was in working order .
positive	i cannot_praise this company highly_enough .
positive	ao . com are a model for others to follow , in my experience .
positive	i was contacted throughout the process of ordering and delivery .
positive	steve and teffon called before arriving and were polite and tidy .
positive	they fitted the double_bed up and took away all of the packaging and were funny and charming throughout .
positive	the bed is super comfy and i highly_recommend the service .
positive	shopping with ao is a breeze , no long delays waiting for a suitable delivery day .
positive	they send you texts to let you know when the goods will arrive and they arrive on time .
positive	the guys are polite and helpful and ao have excellent after care should there be any_issues .

positive	highly_recommended .
positive	use them frequently and find pricing very competitive
positive	when we go back to nyc i will buy this again .
positive	massive savings even if you do not visit a lot of attractions and much_easier than standing in queues .
positive	can only imagine even better in the busy_periods as we were there in winter .
positive	i had ordered a laptop for my daughter on a daily deal on ebay through dabs ebay store .
positive	it was at a very good price and was a pink samsung .
positive	when it arrived the keyboard was faulty and although dabs did reimburse me they would not send a replacement .
positive	after weeks of searching i finally found a similarly priced one on cleverboxes and ordered this .
positive	there was a problem with the delivery address and after a days emails back and forward i had to re - order for delivery to my home address due to a problem with paypal .
positive	by this time the unit i had ordered had sold out and i was back to square one with nowhere to buy the replacement christmas_present .
positive	i was very unhappy that cleverboxes had not told me it was out of stock when we were going through all the delivery problems but as means of an_apology they offered me a replacement pink samsung laptop which was more_expensive and is higher specced for the same price i ordered the other model .
positive	this was offered rather_than me requesting and arrived less_than 00_hours_later .
positive	truly fantastic customer service and every email from i received from them was prompt and polite .
positive	do not_hesitate to deal with this company and makes a very pleasant change to get something sorted_out without having to scream and shout .
positive	concept blinds made to measure facility means that we were able to order exactly the size that we wanted in our chosen wooden venetian blind - there is an excellent selection to choose from .
positive	it was easy to fit so even my husband could do it .
positive	the price was also excellent .
positive	the blind arrived quickly and best of all it looks great !
positive	we had a small problem in that the mechanism locked but a quick phone_call to the customer_services team soon gave me the answer and advice required to release it .
positive	all in all we could not be more satisfied .
positive	this is the first venetian blind that we have gone for and if we decide on any more we will_definitely be choosing concept blinds to purchase through .
positive	i thoroughly_recommend concept blinds to anyone reading this review because you will get good service , quality goods at a very reasonable price .
positive	this is the first time i have ordered from printer_basics and i am so glad that i decided to try them out .
positive	the ordering_process was quick , easy and painless .
positive	delivery was very fast and the cartridges themselves are of an excellent quality .
positive	so far i am very impressed and will be using printer_basics again .
positive	i managed to insure a smart phone and iphone 0 and two tablets for much less_than the individual costs of insurance .

positive	the form was easy to complete .
positive	all in all a very good experience i would recommend to anyone .
positive	well_done protect my bubble !!
positive	!

positive	the food actually tastes good which is a first for diet meals which normally taste awful .
positive	i ' m also pleased with the weight_loss .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	we booked early and got a really good price - we booked two rentals , one for six_weeks and another for seven .
positive	i got the dates wrong ( i forgot to tell them when the flights changed ) - but they didn_'_t charge when we turned_up two days late .
positive	we had to return to the uk to visit a sick relative ; they refunded us the week we didn_'_t use a car , but honoured the good longer term rates we were originally_quoted .
positive	so , we had three cars , all recent - one only had 0000 km on the clock .
positive	no_problems with them at all .
positive	return procedure is simple - they give you an envelope when you collect the car , just write in date & time , odometer reading , fuel level ( half full out & in ), and the bay you left in in .
positive	drop the envelope off at the desk .
positive	insurance is total - little parking dinks are common on the island , so no_worries .
positive	when i was young i used to spend my pocket money in an amazing shop called jarrolds in the middle of cambridge .
positive	it sold paper - pads and pads of it in all sizes , plain , lined and most deliciously squared .
positive	upstairs were more specialist departments where i bet dons could get quills sharpened .
positive	this company is the 0000 '_s web equivalent .
positive	people who love stationery , who find the fun in functional , they communicate brilliantly .
positive	they also stock the stuff i use , and have a website and newsletter that leads to new discoveries and so many temptations .
positive	do i need a new lamy biro , some turquoise ink , beautiful scandinavian dotted paper - i so do !
positive	oh - and the service is great too .
positive	easy to order , arrived on time , kept_informed at all_stages from despatch to delivery - flowers were a small bouquet , but really pretty & looked like they did in the photo .
positive	my daughter was very pleased with them .

positive	spoke to catherine_corless who provided me with the information and delivery update in under 0 minutes .
positive	excellent service .
positive	i wanted to have a different hobby that would not be difficult to learn and would show something of me as i used my little talent .
positive	i was so thrilled that as i bought the top quality mosaic pieces in different varieties that i have created a first_class design of beauty .
positive	with the different pieces not used i am able to do something more in a different design .
positive	this is such a good place to get the mosaics as there is variety .
positive	a great service and when it is delivered to your door it is well_packed .
positive	i am very impressed and would want everyone to open this door as it is like finding the jewels in the crown .
positive	having the trophy of a greyhound is a wonderful reminder of my joy of having my greyhound .
positive	it looks expensive and of top quality and sits proudly on a shelf in my living_room .
positive	it is the centre point of conversations .
positive	it will be a constant reminder of the joyful times i have had with my dog for a very long time to come .
positive	a good reasonable price for something that will bring wonderful memories to mind every time i see it .
positive	thats priceless !
positive	i was drawn to an_email which gave me a link to a short video on the pocket boom , a cool gadget which turns a flat surface into a speaker .
positive	the price was so good that i bough two .
positive	the site was easy to navigate , and i was really surprised that the package arrived two days_later .
positive	i tested the product and it works just as the video said it would .
positive	had a fab online_chat with catherine today , she was so very helpful , explaining all the bits and pieces i needed to know .
positive	a very useful service and a great person to talk to .
positive	well_done parcel0go . com !

positive	one cosy husband .
positive	:-)
positive	i '_ve been using ccl for many_years , at_least 00 .
positive	their pre_- sales and after_sales service is impeccable .
positive	they deliver when they say they will and should i need to return an item ( only once in 00yrs and that was my fault ) there is no third degree questioning .
positive	if i ' m not quite sure what component i need i just send a breif e_- mail to their tech_support and they reply with a link that takes me straight to what i want .
positive	i once ordered an item for my sons_birthday , i placed the order on - line at 0 . 00pm on a friday .
positive	it arrived at 00 . 00am the next_day .
positive	you cant knock that !
positive	take my advice , get ccl on your favourites_list and make_sure its your first_port of call for all your tech requirements , plus you will most_likely save a lot of money on the top name brands as well .
positive	ccl ?
positive	in one word ......... faultless !!!!!

positive	we just wanted to send a thank_you to you all for the excellent service we received from oak_furniture land .
positive	from selecting and ordering our table and chairs , to arranging the delivery , and finally the receipt of the goods at our home .
positive	everyone we had dealings with were friendly and helpful .
positive	what a great team you have at oak_furniture land , many_thanks to you all .
positive	a great bean_bag the whole family love it !
positive	it wont be long before i buy more !

positive	buy with confidence !
positive	very fast service and good products
positive	bought an inno cycle carrier and a thule roof box both products are excellent and delivery was very quick had to phone customer service before buying for advise they were very helpfull in dealing_with my enquiry excellent
positive	transferwise . com and currencyfair . com are the only peer to peer money transfer companies i know of .
positive	all good .
positive	could hardly be better .
positive	i haven_'_t compared exactly the same deal on both to see if there is a difference in value but guess it would be very small if so .
positive	one difference is that any few_pounds of change from a transferwise deal goes back to my own bank_account by default .
positive	last time i used currencyfair , the £ 0 or so stayed in my account with them by default , to use next time or transfer back to me .
positive	( auctionchex . com is something similar too and perfectly good , based in the needs of people who are offered cheque payment in another currency .
positive	their strength is in reducing the minimum charge for paying - in an overseas currency cheque , for example from an ebay sale .
positive	i don_'_t know whether they compete the kinds of transfers transferwise do , and their diy web_site is a bit like my diy website rather_than something slick .)
positive	back to the subject of transferwise : i recommend them .
positive	ordered goods on saturday and received on tuesday .
positive	very well_packaged , would use again and would highly_recommend .
positive	thank_you for providing such an excellent service .
positive	i bought the cheapest 0 - pin mains shaver adapter that showed up on " google shopping " and it just happened to come from kenable .
positive	it arrived the next_day .
positive	you can '_t say_fairer_than that !
positive	the glasses are top - quality , and the most comfortable pair i '_ve ever_owned .
positive	i sometimes forget i ' m wearing them .
positive	delivery was a little_slow ( nearly 0 weeks ) but for the price that '_s an acceptable compromise .
positive	the glasses cost me £ 0 plus £ 0 postage , and came with anti - reflective , anti - scratch coatings .
positive	those cost £_00 on their own at specsavers , so it '_s like getting the glasses for free !
positive	recommended .
positive	i needed to book a ticket urgently due to a family emergency .
positive	i spoke to bruce and in just 00_hours was on a flight to see them .
positive	bruce sorted the international flights with no_fuss and at the right price .
positive	i also needed to get an internal flight on a domestic airline .
positive	i mentioned to bruce that i needed to do that .
positive	he told me that dialaflight couldn_'_t deal with that particular carrier but he still looked up the flights for me .
positive	he told me the price of the tickets in the local currency and explained how i could book it online so that i could get a connecting flight with the one he sorted for me .
positive	fantastic customer service .
positive	i run a small company with irregular overseas shipments .
positive	by using transglobal i am able to ship taking_advantage of very competitive freight rates which i wouldn_'_t be able to get by contacting couriers direct .
positive	on the rare_occasions that i need to contact transglobal by phone the staff are extremely_helpful and efficient .
positive	why would anyone want to use any other freight broker !

positive	i arrived uk in aug_0000 & once i was established started shopping regularly at tesco ..... in all those years the minor_issues i have had , have been negligible compared to some other stores .
positive	i have at times due to location , convenience or just for a change drifted to other stores but always come back to tesco as they just can '_t be beat .
positive	friends & family have asked why i ' m shopping at other stores if that '_s the case but as i ' m walking around i just say to them i only came here for one specific product & proceed to tell them how much_better , cheaper tesco is .
positive	my daughter is now also a regular & loyal_customer & as she is computer_savvy , has signed me up for on - line shopping , regularly shops from tesco direct & has no problem picking_up or returning any of the products she has purchased .
positive	we are great collectors of tesco points & love combining forces to get the best deals for our specific shopping habits & the double ups at christmas are fab ,,,, we are like kids in a toy story filling our trolly for my grandchildrens xmas_gifts ( her niece & nephew ) so we save a fortune by making the best use of our double up vouchers & all the other discounts & special_offers ..... our savings have been phenominal in these very challenging times we live in .
positive	we try to time our shopping to take_advantage of the reduced counters something that was totally foreign to us before arriving in the u . k . we have blessed this fantastic opportunityl so many_times as income has shrunk & prices have sky rocketed .... we have great fun planning meals around our finds .... everybody loves a bargain & we certainly do .
positive	i live in dundee , scotland & we have many tesco stores available to us , but our local is south rd & myself & my daughter are recognised by security staff & till operators alike ... it '_s good to feel you have a familiar friendly face if you do have a problem & it is always quickly & efficiently resolved & they are good natured & exchange a bit of banter & we have a good laugh ... which just adds to the shopping_experience .
positive	i can say that i am highly satisfied with the choice of food to suit all pockets & tastes , look_forward to the foreign section & love the clothing .... definitely my one stop shop for every_occasion be it braaivleis ( barbeque to you ), birthday or xmas_gifts , uniform wear ( navy trousers etc ) & my beloved grandchildrens birthdays & christmas_gifts ... my daughter & myself are mad on the homeware as it is very on trend & up to the minute . generally just an all_round one stop family shop , so a big thank_you from me , i greatly appreciate my tesco & all it has to offer .
positive	my one minor complaint ....... i couldn_'_t get a job there .. which i really wanted as it was walking_distance from home & would save me a fortune in bus fares & i would get even more fab benefits being a tesco employee & a great goodwill ambassador for tesco .
positive	ha_ha .
positive	thanks for listening / reading & hope that you are smiling & giving yourselves a pat on the back as i work in the service industry with the public & i know how disheartening it can be to only listen to a catalogue of complaints .
positive	so keep_up the excellent work in all departments & i wish you all well , from one or should i say two ( my daughter ) very satisfied customers .
positive	big whoop for tesco south road dundee , scotland .
positive	!!
positive	!

positive	please_pass this on to them , as not everybody wants to go on twitter or face book .
positive	communication is paramount , i typed up my query but it would not go , i typed into the message the code requested to be put , a message said wrong code gave another , after 00 attempts i gave up
positive	i will have to phone them to get a message to them , which will be a pain .
positive	i wanted to ask them if their lynx tail lx000 & their double bearing pitch slider came with the fittings to connect from their tail to the pitch slider & from their pitch slider to my microheli weighted blades , as the photos did show any , nor were any shown on their site , did one have to use the links from the original units ?.
positive	this is important to buyers !
positive	and too many sites , do not make it clear whether their upgrade parts fit as bought or whether further items have to be bought ?
positive	or do originals have to be mated to the upgrades so it will function ?
positive	if they fufill this very important information clarity requirement they will be the best of supplier of them all

positive	and some of our guests have asked where we get them from because they would like to buy them for their own beds .
positive	you can '_t say better_than that . "

positive	the car turned_out to be provided by aurigacrown , whose office is visible from baggage collection area .
positive	there was a long wait while the guy solved some problem for the people ahead of me , then he dealt_with me fairly quickly .
positive	i was offered a smallish car at first , then a peugeot partner , which is more of a commercial van than a car , but was ideal for my needs .

positive	the man in seat 00 ( seat00 . com ) points to loco0 as the best way to buy tickets for european train journeys .
positive	he '_s right , i ' m_sure .
positive	i needed tickets for paris to toulouse having already bought eurostar tickets for the journey between london and paris ( on different dates ).
positive	i found the site much_better designed and easier to use than the eurostar site .
positive	i particularly_liked the fact that as well as journey durations there is a little map showing trains taking alternative routes to toulouse to help decide which train to take .
positive	i found the website very informative and the ordering_process easy .
positive	prices are extremely_competitive and insurance is good .
positive	the lens was delivered when i was told it would be and it was easy to return after the hire period .

positive	this is the first guitar that i have not had to adjust the truss rod ( i have six other guitars all brought new ) i don_'_t know whether it was set_up at the factory or whether dawsons set it up but it is certainly a factor that will influence me to use dawsons again .

positive	my one small gripe - i hadn_'_t ordered earlier as some items were sold out or out of stock , but my fault !
positive	i will_certainly be back to 0000rpm .
positive	we came initially with a defective product hoping for a repair .
positive	we spoke at length to a very knowledgable person who advised us in a simple but certainly not patronising way .
positive	we decided to go down the purchase route and again the member of staff took time to explain various products strengths and weaknesses for what we required .
positive	when i returned to pick_up the product i eavesdropped on a couple of staff / customer conversations .
positive	these must have been among your youngest staff but i found their attention and courtesy superb .

positive	scott at dial - a - flight in croydon was recommended by a colleague .
positive	that recommendation could not have come highly_enough - the service i received was alert to my requirements , considerate in ensuring that i got precisely what i wanted , and even saved me some money ( coming in at almost £_000 cheaper_than the equivalent i had hitherto used ).
positive	that level of service cannot easily be matched .
positive	with the saving on overall cost that i also secured , it is frankly unbeatable !
positive	i do not often give credit for telephone_manner ( sadly , it seems to be lacking in many service providers ) but can without_hesitation recommend this concern in that regard too .
positive	easy light_weight and powerful .
positive	sure you can stall it in the long wet grass but otherwis it will cut through small branches and twigs easily and chomp through the grasses .
positive	trimmed the 00 ft grass around the trailer .... no problem .
positive	had a difficulty with the order which was sorted_out nicely - recommended

positive	i know there are a number of good providers of photographic merchandise out there but of those i have used i could not recommend photoworld any higher .

positive	as per the title , i had an almost two year_old phone to sell following the purchase of a new model .
positive	i had a look at various comparison websites and prices ranged from £_00 to £_00 .
positive	after looking at the reviews of the top paying websites ( really poor !)
positive	i decided to go with fonebank who were offering £_00 or a £_00 amazon voucher .
positive	signed_up , got the postal label , wrapped up well and sent off .
positive	with a proof of posting .
positive	a couple of days_later had an e_- mail from fonebank saying the phone had been received and i should be getting my voucher from amazon in the next couple of days - and sure_enough i did .

positive	will happily use again .
positive	bought a teng torque_wrench .
positive	nicely_packaged , quick delivery .
positive	would use again .
positive	have bought an olympic weight set and heavy gym mats recently .
positive	both are excellent products and delivery has_been first_class .
positive	it '_s always concerning when buying an expensive item from a company for the first time .
positive	however , the website is first_class and allowed me to personalise the pc to the specification that i wanted and gave useful_information about the components .
positive	once ordered , the e_- mail updates work nicely so that you know where your pc is in the production line .
positive	you can also have a text sent once the pc is dispatched .
positive	it arrived in good packaging and the pc inside as ordered .
positive	their website also has a forum that is bang up to date .
positive	you can find info here regarding specifications and useful advice .
positive	i ’ ve had the pc just over a week now and so far it ’_s brilliant !
positive	i discovered this company on line .
positive	i telephoned as i needed some information about the goods that i required .
positive	i found them to be most helpful .
positive	i placed my order and received my goods the following_day .
positive	i think everyone should use topcashback .
positive	if i forget to use it when buying something i could kick myself !!
positive	!
positive	without shiply i would find it hard to order goods and services far away and having the ability to obtin quotes from numerous providers with feedback from others helps to make the right choice for each delivery .
positive	great idea dn so far the service has_been excellent
positive	i have used biosthetique products for at_least 00 years and until haircare shop i struggled to get these products , not only that others charged much more for the products , the explanation for each of the products is very clear and you cant go_wrong when chosing , then the haircare shop is simple and easy to pay and very quick service to deliver .
positive	i recommend you try them , you maynot want biosthetique products but they also have salon professional products as well and electrical appliances for very good value .
positive	give them a go , they are on my favourites address list and will remain there .
positive	thank_you haircare shop !

positive	i was dubious_about ordering expensive computer components from this company .
positive	whenever i order goods from websites i '_ve never used again , i rarely use a company where i have no direct contact number to reach them on .
positive	however , compared with other_websites , their prices were way lower_than that of their competitors so i risked it .
positive	and boy did my first purchase with them pay off .
positive	you get endless emails regarding your delivery plus texts messages .
positive	the last text i got from them was this morning to say my motherboard would be delivered between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
positive	then at 00 : 00 there '_s a knock on my door and there it was .
positive	can '_t say any better_than that .
positive	i always use amazon uk as for first_port of call .
positive	should i find the same goods cheaper elsewhere i always ask myself the question .

positive	they collected , they told me when it had arrived back , and they dispatched another , which arrived swiftly .

positive	i just don_'_t have anything other than praise for this company .
positive	it '_s worth_noting that a few_years a go this wasn_'_t the case , but the company obviously recognised the problems and in my opinion have gone way overboard to put it right .
positive	i would , and have recommended this site to my friends , relatives , and to my customers .
positive	and no i don_'_t work for them or know anyone who does , i '_ve just had the best experience with them .

positive	after 00 years on an over - firm and less_than comfortable millbrook mattress , i wondered whether the firm baronet was the right choice .
positive	my reservations were completly unfounded and we both think that this mattress is much more comfortable .
positive	however it is heavy and as we are now retired it may not get turned as often as suggested , although we will probably be able to rotate it for some years yet .
positive	the delivery was exactly as scheduled ( delivered only to inside the front_door ) and the mattress was very well_packed with both double bagging and an outer protection of cardboard .
positive	mattressman has exceeded our expectations once again .
positive	ordered vacuum_cleaner which was shown as ' available ' but not in stock .

positive	lots of great designs to choose from too .
positive	we did have an issue with an order that was cancelled incorrectly but it was dealt_with immediately and with care and politeness .

positive	i must pass on my experience of buying an lg soundbar from a company called crampton and moore .
positive	i had not dealt_with them before , so did not know what to expect .

positive	this is the first time i have ever been given such a precise 0 hour delivery schedule and it was bang on time .
positive	would rwcommend this online site to anybody .
positive	i think lightbulbs direst is fab .
positive	my first order with them was way back in 0000 and i '_ve been shopping with them since .
positive	they stock a massive_range which is great because they have the bulbs i need in my lamp ( e00 ) and i had great difficulty_finding them anywhere_else .
positive	i don_'_t even bother looking elsewhere now , just get them from them .
positive	the delivery is quick and efficient , usually a couple of days_later and they have special_offers where you are given discounts and free delivery too .
positive	i usually wait for the free delivery offers and stock up on bulbs then , because whilst they are very cheap the postage is almost £ 0 . 00 , so its good to save a bit where you can .
positive	i would definitely recommend lightbulbs_direct , i '_ve never had any_issues with them .
positive	i have given mazuma 0_stars because their service is brilliant , very quick and informative .

positive	the next_morning i checked my account on - line and the money was there .

positive	i was so pleased and amazed it had all gone_through so very quick .
positive	i have nothing bad to say at all about mazuma , quite the opposite they provide an excellent service which is first_class .
positive	my son also sent his mobile in too , he got proof of posting !
positive	lol !
positive	unlike me !
positive	and the processing of his mobile was the same as mine , quick efficient and all sorted within 0 days .

positive	totally my fault as i had misunderstood the tinting levels .
positive	the prescription was perfect .
positive	i was really happy with the glasses and so contacted the company and said i was happy to pay for new lenses but could they do with a darker tint etc .
positive	cutting a long_story short the customer representative that i dealt_with was second to none i have experienced , superb does not cover it .
positive	i ended_up returning the glasses and received replacement glasses with new lenses with a perfect tint and was not even charged for them , better still i had returned back to dubai from my original location of the uk and they sent them to me free of charge .
positive	needless to say i cannot recommend this company highly_enough for both the product and the serivce .

positive	after being given the runaround by blackcircles competitors who continualy broke promises to price match or return telephone_calls , i was bowled_over by the professional attitude received whilst placing my order for a set of four , continental vanco contact 0 tyres .
positive	telephone salesman was a true ' gent ' & certainly knew his product range , informing_me of the specifications , limitations & capabilities of my intended purchase .
positive	such a refreshing_change after the truely abrupt attitude adopted by tyretraders . com earlier that same day .
positive	confirmation emails were prompt in arriving & ' double - bubble ' iceing on the cake was tesco_clubcard_points for my purchase .
positive	delivery was much_faster_than_anticipated 00_hours_later & the courier company did not have me waiting home all day , tyres arrived at 0 . 00am .
positive	in summary product & service were second to none .

positive	the box it comes in is recyclable , ( i gave one to my neighbour , who was moving , so that she could put the contents of her freezer in , for transit to her new house .)

positive	i used to use another supplier but they ran_out of stock , and online i found these_guys .
positive	they ' re cheaper and very quick .
positive	i '_ll keep using them .
positive	my phone ( n000 ) failed over the easter_weekend and i needed a replacement urgently .
positive	however , searching the internet i found that although sites were advertising a price - they didn_'_t appear have any stock as the phone has_been discontinued .
positive	i could only find 0 " recognisable " site ( pixmania ) who said they had a phone in stock ( and at a very reasonable price ).
positive	i ordered it with the expectation that they wouldn_'_t have one in stock - but i had little choice ( other than 0nd_hand on e_- bay ).
positive	however , on tuesday ( after the bank_holiday ) i got an_email_saying it was on it '_s way and it arrived on wednesday_morning - fab !

positive	excellent service .
positive	i used travelstay to find my near london hotel which had a perfect location and description on the website matched reality .
positive	bit annoying with having to make deposit since it creates additional tedious booking keeping paperwork if you ' re claiming business travel expenses - the final invoice from the hotel was net of deposit payment .
positive	but , i would use travelstay again if only for the good choice of hotel solutions and good reliable hotel information .
positive	excellent service from start to finish , our rep was very efficient , friendly , english_speaking , was there to meet us both_ends of our journey , even_though we got a bit lost on our return_journey .

positive	outback themselves no_longer seem to deal direct with the public online and the retail_outlets they recommend don_'_t stock the one i want ........ then after a year of searching i found the garden_xl site and there it was .... the elusive cover that they claimed would fit a number of models of outback gas barbeque .
positive	i crossed my fingers , ordered one and waited .
positive	i had a phone_call from a lovely_lady explaining when my order would arrive and when it arrived on time , i was delighted to discover that it did fit my barbeque .
positive	i am thrilled with garden_xl '_s product lines , their stock_levels , their customer service and their delivery .

positive	i paid for next_day delivery for my item as needed it quickly , this option was a little expensive but as i had already got my vacuum cheaper it worked out ok .
positive	the whole selection of goods and buying process was uncomplicated .
positive	i ordered my shoes from shoetique late on in the day , i fully expected to have to wait a few_days for my purchase to arrive , especially as the postage was free .

positive	my eyes hit upon a gorgeous pink imitation croc bright pink bag , but it was so nice i thought it would be out of my price range .
positive	i clicked the image and was taken to the spartoo website and was surprised to find it was actually very cheap .
positive	i ordered and then awaited delivery .
positive	spartoo emailed me to confirm my registration and purchase and my bag was here within a few_days .

positive	always efficient and the time and attention they have putting into their online service is obvious .
positive	top_marks !
positive	been with scottish widows for many_years as a customer and never once had call to regret my decision .

positive	communications are always quick and efficient .
positive	you get exactly the information required and actions are swift and professional .
positive	i sometimes have a look around to see what i would save by switching .
positive	saving £_00 a month but losing the efficient widows service would be a step backwards for me , so we have stayed put to date .
positive	i can '_t see that changing .

positive	well , i '_ve booked hotel / apartments through alpharooms numerous_times over recent years .
positive	their website is easy to use for bookings and pretty quick considering the number of accomodation options they offer .
positive	of course , over time there are bound to be a few_glitches and i '_ve had two recently .
positive	one trip , we arrived to find our apartments closed and the address we were given was wrong .
positive	luckily , we sorted this out at the resort and the fault seems to have been with the accomodation providers , who change our booking !
positive	on our return , we reported our problems to alpharooms and their customer_services people investigated .
positive	they then sent a very detailed reply and , although not really their fault , gave us 00_% refund on the booking .
positive	the second problem was trying to change a future booking .
positive	this is where their website is not so good !
positive	everything was eventually sorted but it did take a very long phone_call .
positive	but overall , still 0 - star compared to a lot of booking sites .
positive	great price , secure shipping and on time !!!!!!!

positive	ordered monitor and got it next_day - great price and excellent service .
positive	recommended .
positive	ordered glasses - i like the way you can search the frames database by specifying shape , colour , material , brand etc .
positive	very handy as it saves browsing through hundreds of frames if you know what you want .
positive	they should make it clear that polarised lenses cannot be put into semi - rimless or rimless style frames ( this is because the edge of the lens is not tinted so will look very odd as will be visible with semi - rimless or rimless frames ).
positive	good customer service and prompt delivery .
positive	recommended .

positive	i have tried a few company '_s like this but know one can come any way near this companies efficiency of supply and delivery , and the price is very competitive .
positive	the service of this company is beyond all of its kind and is a comforting thought when in this recession were companies are running thin and lean to be able to make a fast buck , but this company keeps its eye on the ball and never looks for short cuts . there products speak for themselves only the highest of named products deal with them and this is testament to a company that will survive and hold on to its massive customer base . i like me many tried this company for the first time and was shocked at the quality of service , within 00_mins of placing my order on line the company phoned to acknowledge the order and they assured me they would follow the sale through to the end and keep me informed , which the did . the samsung ue00d0000 tv & samsung bdd0000 blu - ray_player arrived as promised in perfect state and on the day they stated .

positive	usually they would arrange for it to be sent out or for collection another day , however as we were keen to bring the item home with us they arranged with a local storage facility for us to collect straight_away .
positive	ok , not difficult but also not something which is so easily managed by most businesses today , it just needs that bit of personal care and attention which quatropi provided .
positive	we also were interested in hi_fi storage_unit which had recently disappeared from their website , which turned_out to be discontinued but they had one on their own wall , and so promptly offered us a discount , dismantled the unit and carefully_wrapped it for us to take away .

positive	i bought a geberit wall mounting wc and a vanity_unit .
positive	shortly_after i placed my order online i realised that i had made a mistake in the size of the frame .
positive	i was able to contact the friendly staff by telephone and have it amended .
positive	confirmation of the amendment was received immediately by email .
positive	good communications is in my opinion paramount .
positive	the company uses a national pallet delivery network for heavy and fragile goods , it means that nothing gets damaged in transit .
positive	they even deliver to ireland !
positive	i saved_myself a small_fortune and time by buying online .
positive	i found the web_site easy to use and products quick to find .
positive	i quite often need the products i order at the point that i order them , so speedy delivery is important to me .
positive	my physique products have always arrived the next_day .
positive	found ffx when searching for this dewalt drill for my husband .
positive	although i had never_heard of ffx up to this point , ( and i am always sceptical_about buying from a company unknown to me !)
positive	it turned_out to be an excellent choice .
positive	as well as this being the most competitive price online , the product was delivered next_day at no extra_charge .
positive	my husband is also very impressed with the product , as once the battery was fully_charged , it lasted way beyond the sort of time other cordless drills have run before having to recharge the battery .
positive	an excellent company and an excellent product and i / we will_definitely look at ffx first when we require any other tools for our business .
positive	i speculatively requested a quotation to deliver a bathroom sink i was interested in on ebay to find out whether it would be worth bidding .
positive	i wasn_'_t too sure what to expect but once i had submitted my request i was inundated with emails from competing couriers which drove the price down by £_00 from the original quote in the space of an_hour .
positive	i was very happy with the lowest quote and the courier it was from had very good feedback from other customers .
positive	i consequently bid and won the sink and it was delivered 000_miles undamaged within a few_days .
positive	throughout communication with my chosen courier was excellent and the site made finalising the process straightforward .
positive	on this basis i would highly_recommend this site for anyone_wishing to move large and heavy items any distance .
positive	fast delivery by an excellent courier which delivered when i wanted in a specific one hour time_slot and supplied at a great price .
positive	what more can you ask for .
positive	i ordered my wetsuit at 0p . m .
positive	and had it delivered by noon next_day !

positive	i have ordered hundreds of products from hundreds of online_retailers but none have come close to this level of service .
positive	well_done the wetsuit centre !
positive	the support i receive from one . com is always fantastic .
positive	most recently i installed a crm system in my web space but couldn_'_t get email to work , it only took a couple of explanation messages to one . com , first to raise the issue , second to provide additional information and as always the knowledge and helpfulness of the support staff was outstanding .
positive	always pleased with the service i receive , and always impressed with the knowledge of the support staff .
positive	cannot_fault the hire at all .
positive	lens came the day before the hire commenced as promised .
positive	all well_packed and instructions included .
positive	i will definatly be using again .
positive	easy to order and delivery was promised on friday in the next 00_hours ( but not at the weekend ) - the package promptly arrived on saturday_morning !
positive	collected from the sorting_office without difficulty on monday_morning .
positive	parcel0go have had a few bad_reviews but following my experience with them it could be that customers just aren_'_t approaching them correctly .
positive	i recently had a parcel picked_up and delivered to me after i purchased it on ebay .
positive	the pick_up and delivery went very well .
positive	then i had a problem , parcel0go took the fee twice from my debit_card .
positive	i did find it a bit difficult finding out how to contact them , but once i found i could do it on facebook the whole_process was easy and they were a pleasure to deal with .
positive	a quick facebook message quoting my problem resulted_in a very quick reply from sam ( on a sunday ) and further messages on the bank_holiday monday .
positive	sam gave me clear and polite help which resulted_in steph from parcel0go '_s customer_relations team contacting me and very soon the overcharge was credited back into my bank_account .
positive	thank_you parcel0go , and thank_you sam and steph for your very kind help .
positive	accidents happen and any company can have things go_wrong , the sign of a good company is in how they deal with complaints .

positive	i heartily_recommend them an i will_definitely be using them again soon .

positive	would fully recommend this company for ink_cartridges , my canon printer would say it didn_'_t recognise the new cartridges but print anyway so i think its my printer being a t * t rather_than the the cartridges themselves .
