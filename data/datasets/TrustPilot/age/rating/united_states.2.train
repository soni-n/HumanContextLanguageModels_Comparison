negative	when she got to the match , someone was sitting in her seat .
negative	your excuse to her was that you bought the ticket from het and from that time it became the property of viagogo .
negative	why weren '_t these tickets your property ?
negative	you can '_t make up your excuses as you go along .
negative	there comes a point where you have to be accountable .
negative	booked our transfer from gatwick to london and return before leaving home with an idea that the sevice was reliable .
negative	when arriving to gatwick we easyli found the busstop , but from there it went all bad .
negative	we waited over an_hour , being rejected from four different busses that drove away empty or almost empty , and the busdrivers didn_'_t even took a glance at our tickets , the only response was , there will be another bus in 00_minutes ( all four times ), and as we stood waiting more passengers piled up at the busstop all with tickets and no busses .
negative	so after waiting 0½ hour after our planned bus departure we gave up waiting and found other transportation .
negative	as we were to go to back to gatwick for the plane home , we showed_up 00_minutes before the planned departure to gatwick in the hope that our first experience just was one bad day for easybus .
negative	but no .... again we were rejected from our reservated bus , allthough the driver picked_up two very beautyful girls for 00 £ cash , but we who had tickets to the bus could not get on .
negative	again the driver said there would be a bus every 00_minutes , so we could just take the next one .
negative	well 00_minutes later there came another bus , which this time insisted to take the passengers with bookings for his shift , and again said we should wait an additional " 00_minutes ".
negative	at this time we reached a point were we would miss our plane if we did not get some kind of transport to the airport , wich we also told the last driver , but never the less he refused to help finding a solution for us .
negative	so in the end , we again had to find another way to get to the airport .
negative	overall we were left with a feeling that we had been hustled for the cost of the tickets like you would expect in the third world , and not a company that wants to be taken seriuos .
negative	so if you go to london and want to be sure of your transport , do not use this company .
negative	take one of the other reliable services in stead .
negative	out of 0 fem a bomb not a one poped , better off throwing the money away .
negative	ordered system on 0 / 00 , delivery estimated by 0 / 00 .
negative	at 0pm ct on 0 / 00 , i called to find out where my order is .
negative	i got an_email back 0hr later , here is the full text ;
negative	fedex tracking xxxxxxxx
negative	checked the tracking , the package was picked_up by fedex 00mins after my call .
negative	fedex estimates delivery on 0 / 0 .
negative	almost 0 weeks after the order , with no communication from portatech since the order .
negative	no attempt to explain , no attempt to make it right .
negative	there '_s lots of barebones vendors out there , i '_ll be trying one of them next time .
negative	i was searching for a solution for my problem hair , which is not split , but dry and rough feeling on the ends of the middle layers , but only at the back .
negative	biolustre description sounded like it was made for me , so i coughed up £_00 . 00 .
negative	product arrived_promptly , but is complete rubbish !
negative	despite following the instructions to the letter it did no good at all .
negative	don_'_t waste your money on this !
negative	if we could we would give this a negative rating .
negative	bought a visa_gift_card for my mom and had it sent to her address of record .
negative	she went to use it at her nail salon and after she left the place found out they charged her automatically 00_% for a tip , she found this out because she went to her hair salon and found out there was not enough left on it to pay her hair stylist , how embarrassing .
negative	after the fact i went to their website to watch a tutorial and they tell you there if you do not want the 00_% taken out to make_sure to tell the business that and you will tip them yourself .
negative	how conniving and deceiving this whole outfit is !.
negative	never again will we do gift_cards !
negative	they charge you a processing fee and shipping fee which i knew about , but was ok with it because it was a gift .
negative	and they did not use the picture we used to customize the card with , they put it on the paper the card was attached to .
negative	ordered two pair of designer glasses .
negative	first pair took over 0 month , and still_waiting on second with no word on when it will ship .
negative	had been waiting for 0st pair so long , then opened box to find it packed in a cheap plastic bag inside an even cheaper looking soft vinyl case .
negative	these were ysl glasses -- expensive .
negative	the site promises that glasses will come with all manufacturer '_s packaging .
negative	not true .
negative	no papers , no cloth , no case .
negative	i have to wonder if these are simply chinese counterfeits .
negative	i am so disappointed with framesdirect , i cannot begin to describe .
negative	meanwhile , since i needed glasses , i ordered two pair from coastal and received both within one ( 0 ) week , along with cleaning cloth , lens cleaner , and original designer cases .
negative	plus , coastal had better prices and much_better customer_service .
negative	go_ahead and buy from framesdirect if you want , but just be aware that it may take forever and a day , with little to no contact or customer_service or information on your order , and the glasses may well not come with original packaging ( as_promised on the website and is de rigeur for any designer glasses anywhere ).
negative	what a waste of money ( yeah , close to $ 0 , 000 ).
negative	never again .
negative	my daughter who is teaching in a foreign_country ordered flowers for my wife on 00 / 00 / 0000 to be delivered on the day before mothers_day ( 00th ).
negative	they never arrived !
negative	nor did they do so on mothers_day as they use royal_mail , despite the fact they alluded they could do so on their site .
negative	when the did arrive today ( monday ), they were in a cardboard_box that looked fairly battered .
negative	however when we opened them the flowers themselves were in a shocking state .
negative	there were flowers with the heads cut_off them , the roses were dead .
negative	but to cap it all these were not the selection of flowers my daughter ordered as they were meant to be orchids !
negative	!
negative	do not use this company for anyone you care about as their customer_service is atrocious .
negative	my daughter is going to try for a refund as she could try the dsr act due to the fact this is a british company and she used a british bank card to pay for this disgrace .
negative	however time will tell .
negative	i would invite them to reply to this but is doubtful if they care that much .
negative	stay well clear of these cowboys !
negative	!
negative	instead of dealing_with thomas cook who we found very good with other packages , our booking was taken over by olympic holidays .
negative	no boarding passes or transfers via_email just very basic info re flights .
negative	did not specify which terminal our departure was from gatwick .
negative	it all worked out but not impressed .
negative	worst experience and first time ever providing a review on any company or product .
negative	took forever , uninformed that my lenses could not be repaired .
negative	they sent me a cheap fake that were not attached to the frames and that i couldn_'_t even see clearly through .
negative	horrible and completely unprofessional customer_service ; refused to pay for shipping to send my glasses back a second time and refused to provide a refund .
negative	even went thru amex with no luck .
negative	please save_yourself the time and frustration .
negative	do not deal with this sham of a company .
negative	i bought something via quidco , saw instantly that the payment wasn_'_t tracked so raised a claim in may 0000 ... there it sits , claim raised .. .... no money and no way of reminding quidco as they have a clever support form now - really really clever in fact so clever that it doesn_'_t appear so they probably think everyone loves them because you can '_t complain .... would i use them again ?
negative	- mmm probably not .... they obviously care little about customers , accessibility or support .
negative	and by the way - how come they have the time to respond to these reviews but they don_'_t have the time to respond to claims or answer queries via their website ?
negative	we ordered some embroidered shirts .
negative	they assured us that we would have them on time for a convention we needed them for .
negative	i checked in two_days before they were suppose to arrive because i hadn '_t gotten any notification that they shipped .
negative	they informed me that i wouldn_'_t be able to get them - that somehow it had been delayed .
negative	i told them to cancel the order - they said they couldn_'_t .
negative	i went to a local place in desperation and they said they would help me out and get them done fast .
negative	two_days_later i picked them up and they looked awesome .
negative	three days_later the shirts from zazzle arrived and they were so bad .
negative	the embroidery image was too big and the stitching so so loose - it didn_'_t look professional at all .
negative	worst i '_ve ever_seen .
negative	i called to complain_about the quality and the fact that they totally missed my delivery date .
negative	finally , after several calls to them and complaining they agreed to refund my money .
negative	we haven_'_t and wont use them again .
negative	when i notified silvertribe that my shipment ( my second order with them ) had gone missing between my local post_office and my home , the company refused to help me resolve the issue .
negative	in fact , a manager accused me of having received the item and lying about it !
negative	silvertribe ships usps " signature confirmation ," and a postal employee had signed for my package ( i suspect it was stolen at the post_office ).
negative	silvertribe customer_service took the position that the package had been " delivered and signed for ," even_though the signature receipt had another person '_s name on it and the post_office '_s address .
negative	i have never encountered such obstinate and unprofessional sellers online , which is saying a lot .
negative	went in the store sunday 00sep around 00 . 00 lengthy queues at checkouts went one to be told in a rude manner i am closed dumped shopping and found the duty manager he couldn_'_t have cared less not the first time this ahs happened in this store
negative	overall the staff in there aren '_t particulary pleasant
negative	i suggest if aldi do any courses on customer_service the wednesfield store gets an invite
negative	you get one 0 bureau credit report and anything_else is extra over the monthly fee . you get a free report yearly so this is a big rip_off

negative	i was searching for hotels for my trip to asia and having checked on numerous websites including agoda , and before finalizing on my hotel choice and who to book with , agoda started pushing hotel ads to browsing activity with very , very misleading hotel rates for the various hotels i had previously considered .
negative	agoda '_s quoted rate for those hotels often flashed " from $_00 " for a hotel when i clicked on it for my dates , showed no less_than $_000 a night for the cheapest room .
negative	likewise , for other hotels when the " from rate " was all bogus .
negative	i would never even attempt to check agoda hotel reservation website ever again , not when there are dozens more reputable ones online .
negative	vey badly designed website .
negative	they never tell you anything .
negative	ordered on april 00 , and only today someone had the curtesy to reply that my order would be delayed .......
negative	extremely disappointed with this company !!
negative	if they can '_t find the original replacement for your sunglasses , they '_ll put their " inhouse " replacement ..
negative	wtf ????
negative	and they will charge you full repair price .
negative	once you pay , and receive your item , and realize is a cheap replacement , they will say that " their policy " states that they will replace your original with another " inhouse " option .
negative	means : chinese crap .
negative	don_'_t waste your money !!!
negative	!
negative	this company is not serious at all !!!

negative	i ordered an item 00 feb 0000 and messaged the site on 00 feb asking if it had shipped .
negative	said would check and get it sorted .
negative	messaged again 00 march , got excuse that their stock was damaged , more arriving end of week .
negative	messaged 00 march saying if not shipped by 00 march , please refund ; was promised goods and refund .
negative	messaged 00 april , gave deadline of 0 april to refund or ship else i will initiate chargeback ; responded with refund was issued ( it wasn_'_t ) and could i verify last four digits of card used .
negative	i did so , no further responses , goods or refund .
negative	on 00 april i contacted my credit_card company to chargeback .
negative	i expect site owner was trying to get purchase past 000 day limit for chargeback .
negative	so very glad i used a credit_card instead of debit_card , otherwise i would have had no recourse .
negative	caveat emptor .
negative	the wait for the was not so unusual , but it was a long 0days .
negative	i was so upset that i received the wrong part .
negative	using your site and verifying the picture i ordered the part . i submitted the order giving all the info that was asked of me . i looked at the picture to make_sure it had the right connections the part i received had different connections that was made for an earlier model .
negative	i tried calling to set_up an exchange but after waiting more_than 00_minutes on my cell_phone i could not wait any longer . i hope to get a response thru these e_- mail s as to the process of the exchange . i need this vehicle for work . please inform me of the method to get the correct_part as soon as possible .
negative	/ thank_you my number to reach me is 000 - 000 - 0000
negative	i was hesitant to use viagogo when i realized it was a site for ticket scalpers , but it was paypal certified .
negative	so , i purchased tickets for a soccer game in france as a gift for my son '_s first overseas trip .
negative	he really wanted to see a game in europe .
negative	since our time was limited , i specifically chose a game on a date i knew we ' d be able to attend .
negative	i paid three_times the sticker price for the tickets , but wanted to make_sure we had good seats .
negative	when the tickets arrived they were for a different date and at a time when we would be on our way back to the states .
negative	i immediately notified viagogo and have had numerous email exchanges with about the bait and switch .
negative	because the company does not have a working phone_number or direct email , it is impossible to actually have a conversation with a representative of the company .
negative	i just keep getting stock email answers back with no option for a dialogue .
negative	at no time was i notified by either the seller or viagogo that the date of the game had changed , nor was the correct date for the game changed on the listing until 0 days before the game - after i filed my complaint .
negative	by that time i was stuck with 0 useless tickets and terribly disappointed son .
negative	its unlikely we will be overseas again anytime soon .
negative	so , when i tried to re - sell them on the site , viagogo denied the listing because there was insufficient time .
negative	you can be sure viagogo got a hefty cut of my losses - they take a fee from both the seller and the buyer .
negative	i am also very surprised that paypal endorses this company especially in light of the numerous blogs and websites with negative_reviews of viagogo .
negative	0 / 0 / 00 : reply to viagogo :
negative	of course viagogo can '_t control when event dates are changed .
negative	however , i purchased tickets for a specific date and the seller sent me tickets for a different date .
negative	neither the seller nor viagogo notified me the date changed .
negative	nor did the viagogo website or packing_slip with the tickets indicate a change in date .
negative	neither of you warned me or gave me the opportunity to back out of the transaction .
negative	this is a breach of contract .
negative	if i ordered and paid for a toaster oven , and amazon sent me an iron with a packing_slip that said toaster oven , they would honorably correct the situation .
negative	i understand the seller sends tickets to viagogo who packs and ships them .
negative	a reputable business would ensure that the buyer was getting what they ordered or would notify the buyer if there was a substitution being sent .
negative	viagogo '_s reply states they do everything they can to inform the customer of changes in events , yet they did nothing in this case .
negative	if viagogo truly cared about the " inconvenience " it apologizes for , it would accept responsibility for sending me the wrong product and ruining my son '_s vacation .
negative	00 / 0 / 00 update_:
negative	i received a phone message from viagogo that they were looking into my situation with management .
negative	that was on 00 march .
negative	i have not heard back .
negative	i tried calling the number displayed on caller id the company does not accept land line calls and i do not have an international plan for my cell_phone .
negative	i wish the company would update me on my request .
negative	thank_you .
negative	00 / 0 / 00 update_:
negative	i received another phone message from viagogo that they were looking into my situation .
negative	that was over 0 weeks_ago , and still no contact back .
negative	i don_'_t believe the company is interested in customer_service .
negative	i '_ve yet to speak with an actual person .
negative	would definitely_recommend
negative	we arrived in madrid airport and followed the instructions to the resort hoppa desk for our pre_- paid booking .
negative	despite their conditions of a maximum 00_minutes delay we were told the driver would be 00_minutes so go to the cafe by the desk and he will fetch you .
negative	00 minute later nobody arrived so we went back to the desk to be told that she was unable to contact the driver .
negative	this was now one hour after we ' d arrived .
negative	on asking when the diver would arrive we were told she had no idea as she couldn_'_t contact him . i told her therefore i had no choic ebut to take a taxi .
negative	these events were reported the following_day to resort hoppa but apart from a note saying they were looking into it and would get back wiuthin 00 days ( which they havent ) i have heard_nothing .
negative	they are completely useless and i would advise agaainst anyone ever using them
negative	used to use expedia all the time , but i have just had one of the worst experiences ever .
negative	booked a flight months_ago .
negative	they moved it , moved it again .
negative	i called and spend 00_minutes working to fix it .
negative	thought i had .
negative	then i got an " emergency email " and called .
negative	their bad , they just informed me of the change i had made with the customer_service rep minutes before (?).
negative	then i get another " emergency " email .
negative	not i have been on hold and on the phone for 00 - 00_minutes , and they have me on hold .

negative	this is my second time buying with this company .
negative	the first time i ordered a product for my husband , they objected the price and website i found to match their price .
negative	i was in a hurry to get the product and was just $ 0 more i didn_'_t objected , it came quick but not enough before my husband traveled .
negative	if not for one day hold up because of the price_match it would .
negative	the second time i order on monday , by friday i saw on my account that they didn_'_t even shipped because of credit_card rejection .
negative	i saw on my credit_card that they already withdraw the money by tuesday .
negative	call them after 0 minutes holding and they said the product didn_'_t even left the warehouse and i needed by next monday when husband travels again .
negative	if they would have had consideration for their costumers would have emailed or called so i could have ordered from amazon or other places and would have the product before my husband travel .
negative	will never buy from them again .
negative	much_better on amazon that is much trustable .
negative	for less then $ 0 . 00 difference this time it is not worth the trouble .
negative	because of an airline delay , i missed my scheduled pick - up time .
negative	i contacted rentalcars . com as soon as my flight was rescheduled and 0 hours before the originally scheduled pick - up time to reschedule my pick - up .
negative	rentalcars delayed responding for 00 hours and then informed me that because it was after my scheduled pickup time i would forfeit 000_% of my paid in full rental .
negative	i '_ve spent the last several hours being given the run_around by this company both over the phone and online .
negative	they have the worst customer_service i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	they even sent my two fake phone numbers to call , one of which put me in an infinite loop with an advertisement for cruises to the bahamas .

negative	how nissan of chesapeake got away with charging me $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) above the sticker price of a 0000 nissan altima s !!!
negative	i received a card in the mail from noc telling_me i owned a 0000 chrysler 000lx & that my monthly_payments were just $_000 . 00 a month .
negative	they said they would offer 0 refinance existing loan 0 cheaper interest rate or trade in my car offering me 00_% more then it was worth , pay off the loan , & give me a deal i could not resist on purchasing a brand_new car from them !!!
negative	i called them & made an_appointment 0 may 00 , 0000 !!!
negative	the sales_team act as though they are trying their best 0 help u or become your friends when in fact what they are really doing is 0 get u 0 drop your guard down so they can become your worst enemy & get as much money out of u as possible !!!
negative	here is how they conned me in0 signing a binding contract paying $_000 . 00 more each month 0 the next 00 months 0 a car i did not want !!!
negative	initially i was not even looking 0 a brand_new car 0 purchase but a used truck with a 0 cylinder engine since the car i owned had a v - 0 which used 0 much gas !!!
negative	it did not take long 0 discover nissan does not even make a truck with a 0 cylinder engine !!!
negative	then i was told i could only receive special financing interest rates & vehicle incentive discounts if i purchased a brand_new vehicle such as the altima !!!
negative	i was shown what part of their lot 0 look then i discovered all the colors were mostly white & black but there was 0 that stood out & it was fully loaded with all the bells & whistles so that '_s the 0 i chose 0 test drive !!!
negative	i was shocked 0 discover how this smaller vehicle them my full size chrysler_000 was easier 0 handle & had a more comfortable ride plus all the extras 0 many 0 mention here !!!
negative	the sticker price was $ 00k so i was quickly told there was no way i would ever be able 0 afford monthly_payments !!!
negative	since they knew i was now hooked on the exspensive nissan altima all i had 0 do was find a cheaper model that i could_afford monthly_payments !!!
negative	we had 0 leave the dealership & drive 0 another crammed lot full of vehicles in order 0 find an altima with the color i liked !!!
negative	i found a red altima that only had hub caps no custom rims & the list price was $ 00k !!!
negative	i dealth with a salesman & his manager who both kept insuring me how they would be getting me the deal of a lifetime !!!
negative	the manager said he got me 0 . 0 % financing which was far better then what i had on the chrysler_000 when i purchased that for 0 . 0 % !!!
negative	he then said the payments would be $_000 . 00 a month never mentioning 0 how long !!!
negative	i told him that was 0 high so he said he could ' nt get them lowered unless i put some money down !!!
negative	i told them i needed monthly_payments below $_000 . 00 each month so he tried hitting me up for $ 0 grand down which i said i could ' nt afford !!!
negative	he then asked how much i could_afford & they would simply hold my check until the funds were there !!!
negative	these_guys are masters @ manipulation , coersion , & wearing u down until u give in !!!
negative	i told them earlier i was diabetic & had not had anything 0 eat 0 a few hours so my blood sugar was low so i guess they knew they could take_advantage of me !!!
negative	my initial appointment was @ 0 :_00pm & this was now several hours_later around 0 - 0pm !!!
negative	i told them i could_afford $_000 . 00 check but it would not be good 0 @ least 0 more weeks !!!
negative	the payments were ' nt reduced under $_000 . 00 but remained @ $_000 . 00 a month !!!
negative	no figures were ever discussed or seen during the entire negotiation !!!
negative	i told them i had just been offered $ 00k ( 00 , 000 . 00 ) alread 0 a trade in on my 0000 chrysler_000 from the exact_same dealarship i bought it from less then a year & half ago !!!
negative	the car did not have 0 scratch or dent on it & was in better shape now then it was when i bought it & i had not even put 00k ( 00 , 000 ) miles on it !!!
negative	the pay off amount was $ 00k so i knew i would only have 0 make up for $_0k difference which would be then added 0 the price of the altima !!!
negative	the card i received in the mail from noc also had a check for $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) that could be used 0wards the purchase of a new car or used 0 lower the sticker price so i thought i was set !!!
negative	by the time i finally got 0 the finance office my blood sugar was so low i just signed every paper thrown in front of me & said yes 0 everything just 0 try 0 get the hell out of there as soon as i could so i could get something 0 eat !!!
negative	i never left the dealarship until almost dark outside which was @ least 0 - 0 hours after i 0st arrived there !!!
negative	nissan only offers a 0 year warranty on their new vehicles so i hurriedly agreed 0 an additional 0 yrs . extended_warranty which raised the monthly car payments back up to $_000 . 00 for the next 00 months !!!
negative	gap insurance was also thrown in there somewhere !!!
negative	again no figures or prices were ever disclosed b0 or @ the signing of the contract other then only the monthly payment amount !!!
negative	i can not tell u just how sick i was 0 days_later after i left nissan of chesapeake & discovered just how much & bad they had screwed me !!!
negative	they only allowed me $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) trade in value on the chrysler_000 which is the rock bottom price allowed 0 a rough trade in not a prestige trade in like i gave them !!!
negative	this automatically put me owing the payoff amount of my chrysler_000 $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) instead of just $ 0000 . 00 if tghey had given me the amount that my car was worth !!!
negative	so now noc can add the difference 0 the price of the nissan !!!
negative	they also charged me $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) 0 the extended_warranty which is added 0 the sticker price of the new car !!!
negative	i was never given any so called incentives or discounts as told earlier & no $ 0 , 000 . 00 credit or discount was ever allowed or taken away from the sticker price either !!!
negative	i guess that $_0k check written out 0 me that was included in the card they mailed 0 my home bounced !!!
negative	the only thing nos did do was allow me 0 . 0 % interest rate on financing only because they wanted 0 charge me $ 0 , 000 . 00 more then the sticker price of the vehicle !!!
negative	they have absolutely nothing 0 lose & everything 0 gain by cheating u by getting u 0 sign a binding contract that if u default on the financer just simply repossess your vehicle & u still owe the balance of the loan !!!
negative	i just want the public 0 be aware of nissan of chesapeake & how they will screw u if u only give them the chance or opportunity 0 !!
negative	!

negative	the original part sticker was on the part bag and someone at parts_geek their label with my part information on top of it .
negative	no response by phone , sent e_- mail and got two replies .
negative	thank_you for your order and someone will contact you if you had a problem .
negative	no response .
negative	then the jerks want my review of parts_geek ... easy do not order from this company
negative	i placed an order on may 0st .
negative	may 00th i learned through fedex that the package was damaged and undeliverable and to contact the supplier for more information , which i did .
negative	may 00st healthdesigns replied to my email_saying they had not been informed of this until they received my email .
negative	they then told me that the item was now out of stock and once received they would ship it to me .
negative	on may 00rd i replied and asked how long the delay would be as i may want to just cancel the order .
negative	they replied that the package was still in transit to arrive to healthdesigns and once they received it i would be given a full_refund .
negative	it is now the 0th of june and i '_ve not received a refund nor have they contacted me again .
negative	bought a microphone from tidal savings 00 days ago .
negative	it was supposedly shipped usps priority_mail from ca .
negative	nothing yet .
negative	no tracking provided .
negative	i joined with them , i sell discount netflix accounts .
negative	i had 0 sales in 0 days , but one of them did a chargeback because the order the wrong plan .
negative	the customer then purchased the correct plan , so all was good .
negative	i just got a notice from them that i ' m a high risk , and my monies will be put into a reserve for 00 days .
negative	mind you , at this time , i had a pending withdrawal that was to go into my account , but even now that says it failed .
negative	sad thing is , i read these reviews before joining , i went with their bbb score instead , which is an a . i should have gone with my gut feeling .
negative	what they ' re doing is earning interest of my monies that i earned .
negative	i emailed back that i want my money now , and that i will be seeking legal counsel based on my experience , along with all the reviews on this site .
negative	if you ' re reading this before you '_ve dealt_with them , run !
negative	don_'_t give them a chance , you '_ll get ripped_off .
negative	the few positive feedbacks you will find on this thread i ' m sure was fabricated by wepay employees .
negative	this product was ordered last monday ( april
negative	00 ) after 0 days , i contacted ljshopping to find out where my order was as i had paid for two day shipping and had not received any shipping information etc_., yet my payment was made and accepted .
negative	i received an_email_stating that ljshopping company wasn ’ t sure about the address so the order wasn ’ t shipped , even_though i had enter the shipping address on the order when it was placed , and my
negative	confirmation clearly indicates the shipping address .
negative	they never attempted to contact me with this information .
negative	a representative from ljshipping
negative	company responded that the order would be shipped friday .
negative	0 - 0 day shipping
negative	should have had it to me by tuesday , april 00 , at the latest .
negative	i still have no
negative	product , had paid for express shipping and the product as of 0 days ago now .
negative	fed_ex tracking has an anticipated ship date listed only . nothing has been updated in days .
negative	another attempt to find out where the order was received a response that it was shipped but the fedex record was failing to update and now they were out of the product .
negative	i asked why that should matter if my order had shipped and have not received a response .
negative	have now demanded a refund of payment to include payment for express shipping .
negative	this place is unbelievable !
negative	first they send me the wrong ( canvas ) piece of art .
negative	it cost me $_00 . 00 to mail it back and it was their error !
negative	oh boy , what a class act .
negative	and forget any type of customer_service .
negative	very slick .
negative	avoid .
negative	lisa g .
negative	i placed an order on oct . 0 .
negative	0000 .
negative	the sunglasses were back ordered , so i decided to wait .
negative	after numerous communication , both by phone and emails ( some responses , quite unprofessional ), i finally received the glasses on jan . 00 , 0000 .
negative	used them for a 0 week booking from madrid airport .
negative	their chosen local partner was firefly car_hire .
negative	not a good experience :
negative	0 .
negative	even_though we arrived on time , we had to wait 00_mins to be seen then 0 and a half hours before a car was ready , all in a very hot office in the car_park with aircon for staff only !
negative	0 .
negative	our car was not ready , but in the 0 + hours we had to wait , i watched 0 members of their staff sitting in one of the cars smoking and chatting whilst 0 were left in the office to deal with all customers .
negative	could these 0 not have been cleaning cars or at_least trying to help .
negative	0 .
negative	were ripped_off for a tank of fuel at double what t cost me to fill the tank at a local petrol station .
negative	0 .
negative	were ripped_off with additional insurance because the " fully insured " offering from holiday autos did not cover windscreen , wheels or tyres .
negative	0 .
negative	car was a dented , dirty and not up to normal car_hire standards .
negative	0 .
negative	car itself was poor quality and not well serviced , struggled to keep_up with the speed limits on even slight inclines on the motorway .
negative	my advice , stick with one of the big companies like avis , hertz , europcar , sixt etc .
negative	it may look more_expensive , but in the long run it won '_t be and you will get a much more suitable and safe rental_car .
negative	opticsfast pictures do not display in rgb but instead are muted and are their listings describe the product wrong in the pic , wrong in description , and wrong by advice from representatives ... you will not do wrong and get by .....
negative	it is dishonest and poor customer care to know that the pics from vendors reflect wrong colors and descriptions thus causing people to order wrong frames and have to pay restocking fees of 00 %.
negative	00_% of $ is $_00 dollars plus shipping .
negative	they will take almost $_000 dollars if you buy and have to return your item .. i made much effort to resolve which was in vain ... opticsfast has a deaf ear and their level of customer care is really low .
negative	don_'_t do business with them for you stand the risk of looking at pics that do not display true colors and descriptions that leave out colors and representatives that tell you the same thing as their pics and descriptions on the internet because they have not seen them either .
negative	thus this is a lose lose lose situation with the customer at a 00_% loss , shipping loss and time loss and abusive tactics phone_calls and emails .
negative	i was issued a bad number for an xbox live gold card and they are telling_me
negative	the number is good \.
negative	i am not sure if i was the only one issued this number why is microsoft telling_me it is already used .
negative	this company does not have a good way to contact them after working hours this is when most problems would normally arise so why not have someone available to take_care of problems to a better hour maybe 0pm eastern time
negative	company will not price_match / beat by 0 %.
negative	they will take your order and indicate they will beat the price , but they later alter your order amount and claim some bs that the other company has ' artificial ' shipping_charges .
negative	sorry , i have no time for these games , and they can keep their ' free energy bar incentive '.
negative	this is not a company i would recommend to anyone after my visit yesterday .
negative	my daughter has an iphone 0 that had a broken screen , but everything else worked on the phone .
negative	the company states that they make repairs in four hours or less .
negative	we went by the office with about 00_minutes before the 0 hours were up , and they told us they needed 00 more minutes , that a sensor was not responding .
negative	we told them great , we will go to the grocery_store and return in about 00_minutes .
negative	when we returned to the store , with groceries in our car , we were told that the phone wasn_'_t ready yet .
negative	we waited and waited and waited .
negative	after around 00_minutes i asked the manager what was going on and he told me that they were still working on it .
negative	after another 00_minutes , we are told that this sensor didn_'_t recover , but it '_s not a big deal .
negative	this sensor worked when we brought the phone in .
negative	over 0 hours after delivery , we get a still broken phone with no apologizes or offers to make it right .
negative	when we get home , we realize that the phone no_longer has the ability to connect with our wifi in all parts of the house , most_importantly , my daughters bed room .
negative	on a final note , i wish the manager showed half the interest or concern about my daughters phone not working correctly as he did show towards his new kiosk which was having technical difficulties which he spent the entire hour that we sat there working on it .
negative	horrible !
negative	!
negative	i will never use priceline . com again , and that is after using them for at_least the last 0 years , and probably longer than that !
negative	after checking for a hotel in saratoga springs for a couple of weeks for a one night stay and not finding anything that would work for my family and me i received yet another email from priceline . com .
negative	the email starts out with " are you still looking for a hotel in saratoga springs for 0 / 00 thru 000 ?".
negative	excitedly i scrolled down to a link that took me right to priceline and a well priced hotel right in saratoga springs !
negative	i booked it right_away and ran in to tell my family i was finally able to get 0 rooms for our mini vacation .
negative	when i returned to the computer to make_sure emails , etc were all set , i read what priceline had sent me - one night 0 / 00 and 0 / 00 - not the days i needed , nor the days they included in their email intro ... of course when i looked at their email more closely i realized that next to the link to the hotel with the great price , in light gray lettering , they indicated 0 / 00 and 0 / 00 ...
negative	i was scammed and madder than mad !
negative	i called priceline right_away to let them know i could not believe they would treat a loyal_customer in such a way and after being placed on hold for a good 00_minutes i was told the can offer me a chance for them to cancel the 0 rooms for me but i will be responsible for paying one night for each room - that '_s all i booked - what do you mean you can offer me that - who the heck would bother !
negative	but there is a happy ending - i called the hotel to explain what priceline did to me - the hotel will honor my priceline reservation , adjusted , for the correct date , but i need priceline to call them right_away to arrange for the change .
negative	i called priceline right_away and let the csr know i had spoken with the hotel and that they will change the date on my reservation - the csr tells_me there is nothing she can do because the reservation was " locked ".
negative	long_story short , the csr called the hotel while i was on the phone and confirmed the reservation - thank_you so much wonderful hotel in saratoga springs .
negative	never again priceline . com .
negative	please beware of the scam they try and play !
negative	dualj charges for books upon receipt of order .
negative	later they claim delays in finding merchandise .
negative	for 0 months now they have not returned my calls ( their call_center says it is under repair all the time - try it and see ) or my emails .
negative	have not received books .
negative	difficult to contest credit charge because they lead you on until it is too_late to contest at credit_card company .
negative	where did all these positive_reviews come from that are so generic and sound exactly the same ?
negative	j ' ai en toute confiance commandé un livre en pensant que la photo correspondait à celui ci et me suis retrouvé avec un autre !
negative	le titre est presque le même , mais la couverture et le contenu pas du tout . après réclamation il a été considéré que celle ci était injustifiée car il me fallait bien lire toute l ' annonce !
negative	ainsi il est possible sur ce site de mettre une photo attirante , se rapprochant de l ' objet à vendre , et de vendre un autre objet et cela le plus légalement du monde selon price minister ! heureusement que la somme n ' était pas importante mais la raison a été donnée à quelqu ' un qui a en vente , tenez vous bien : plus de 0000 livres sur price minister !
negative	la raison du plus fort etc ...... si on le veut bien et si on l ' accepte , pour moi c ' est fini avec ce site .
negative	claim to have delivered a parcel obtained a signature and to have gps evidence of all this .
negative	however they did not deliver to this i address .
negative	i cannot get a credit for my order and they have sent a ridiculous squiggle to the sender as evidence they did deliver .
negative	. a joke and clearly dont_care who they cheat or malign .
negative	be warned find a trustworthy courier that doesnt lie .
negative	never sent us the reference number for thomas cook airlines and we spent many days and nights trying to resolve this issue .
negative	we had to have this number to obtain our airline_tickets .
negative	what a mess and alpharooms customer_service was terrible .. they just kept passing the buck and we almost never got to go on our holiday because of their very poor customer_service .
negative	once they get your money forget about any service or proper documentation at all .
negative	the worst ever ... never will use this company again .
negative	i ordered kitchen roll and sauce pan set with free cutlery .
negative	the kitchen rolls turned up after 0 weeks so badley damaged i couldn_'_t use them and i still_haven_'_t received the saucepans over 0 months later despite repeated emails sent to the useless customer_service department .
negative	save your money and buy from a company that will deliver the goods .
negative	i have contacted customer_services at mighty_deals on numerous occasions and they have not resolved the problem , the customer_service side of mighty_deals is awful , i would not recommend them at all .
negative	ordered a 0 door wardrobe on 00th april with a delivery expectation of the following_day .
negative	i received an_email informing_me that delivery would not be on friday .
negative	later a telephone call call confirmed the wardrobe would be delivered on tuesday00th april .
negative	later in the day i telephoned the company and was advised it would be delivered .
negative	no delivery .
negative	made numerous calls to the company requesting a call back .
negative	finally i was told that they would contact the delivery company to contact me .
negative	no communication was received .
negative	on thursday , 0st may it finally arrived , only it was a 0 door and a 0 door .
negative	the driver was surly .
negative	however , we did not accept the delivery as it was not as ordered .
negative	we requested our money back .
negative	we have been told delivery of the same items will be made on 0nd may and if we reject them then we will have to pay £_00 .
negative	the item is not as_advertised and if we had known this then clearly we would not have ordered ,
negative	never again will i order from this company .
negative	the worst thing is that they do not seem to care whether the customer is satisfied .
negative	the bouquet received was nothing like the picture online .
negative	only 0 roses in a bunch costing over £_00 with no vase as the picture showed .
negative	ordered for monday and dead by tuesday .
negative	no actual flower card displaying a message , just a discount card with scribble on the back .
negative	i can not recommend this florist .
negative	i ordered three outdoor tables and two chairs and was quoted $_000 for shipping .
negative	i had to wait 0 months for the chair and they charged my credit_card .
negative	i kept emailing them to see why it never arrived .
negative	i have to email them 0 times to get one answer a few_days_later .
negative	they told me 0 months later that i would have to pay $ 0000 usd for shipping and it would be shipped to the airport and not even to my home !
negative	i am not paying that much for shipping when i was never told so the price when i ordered it 0 months_ago .
negative	i would not have ordered it from them .
negative	they told me they were going to refund me for the tables and chairs over a month_ago and still have not received refund or my order !!!!
negative	they are not honest and do not do business with them !!!
negative	!
negative	i booked a 00 day rental in florida , prepaid entire amount and recieved a voucher good for alamo .
negative	went to pick_up car with family and luggage and alamo said the voucher was only good for non us drivers_license holders !!
negative	i paid about $_000 through carhire0000 , which was half the price of direct alamo and it was only good for non us ??
negative	but when they took my money they knew from my credit_card info that my address was us !
negative	i paid alamo about 0000 $ for the 00 day rental because i was stuck and it was a holiday period .
negative	so i call carhire0000 and they say because i did not pick_up the car and because i did not cancel within 0 days , i would be charged 0 days fee whcih they calculated to be $_000 !
negative	i only paid $_000 for 00 days and they werre charging me $_000 !!
negative	they told me the terms and conditions , which ran over 000 small_print words , required me to be non us license holder .
negative	i could not find it in the terms and conditions before i booked , but did find it in the voucher .
negative	so what ?
negative	why didnt they put in in big letters so i could read it ??
negative	i had my credi card company dispute the charges and agter much back and forth , i got the credit .
negative	dont use them .
negative	horrible customer_service and really nasty people .
negative	from the beginning this trip was horrible .
negative	long hours traveling and even worst , the bus ride to the hotel .
negative	once at the hotel you are imprisoned by locals who will take your money using guilt .
negative	we only left the hotel once and we were broke .
negative	this all inclusive resort is old run down and in need of a facelift .
negative	the power went out and the generators which they use to run everything were right under our window so we missed out on 0 nights of sleep .
negative	the beach is small , there is no area to snorkel , and the pools are filthy .
negative	you will be unable to make phone_calls or use the internet without paying a lot of money .
negative	the staff are not helpful and actually quite rude when you needed any kind of assistance .
negative	the food was mediocre at best .
negative	seemed_like most visitors were only interested in one thing , purchasing marijuana and smoking it in the hotel , the halls reeked .
negative	do not bother with jamaica and ocho rios go to the bahamas .
negative	we were truly disappointed in the $ 0000 for an " all inclusive " resort vacation .
negative	returned emails as long as they thought i was a new customer but when they realized i wanted my money back they not only did not answer me they ignored paypal .
negative	paypal closed my complaint because the number they provided could not even prove the battery had been shipped .
negative	oh it was shipped alright .
negative	to me .
negative	dead and unusable and then back to them they still will not acknowledge they have my money and their lousy broken battery .
negative	do not trust these idiots .
negative	they either dont understand english or they just dont_care .
negative	i paid an extra $_00 for a room with a water view in chicago .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel , we were told there were no rooms with a view available .
negative	so basically i paid_extra for the possibility of having a water view .
negative	the hotel manager was great and gave us a $_00 gift_card at their restaurant .
negative	but it just does not feel right that expedia took extra money for a room upgrade and gave us nothing in return .
negative	i will not use site again .
negative	our tour said appetizers and wine - correct !
negative	knowledgeable tour_guide - correct !
negative	bus and walking tour of rome - incorrect !
negative	after almost 0 - 0 / 0 hours of walking within central rome , there was no bus in sight !
negative	we had to leave the tour at this point because it was getting dark and difficult to walk and follow the guide !
negative	it should have said that walking was the major means of touring so that senior tourists could be honestly informed .
negative	too bad that they got our $$$ and we ended_up with sore feet and a difficult walk back late at night .
negative	parcel was pick_up assured it would be delivered safely with speed .
negative	it arrived on time contents smashed to bits .
negative	both sender and buyer both bitterly disappointed that it appeared no care was taken .
negative	it appears to have been thrown around like a house brick .
negative	would you recommend this company ?
negative	this is a follow_up to a purchase gone wrong and they wouldnt refund my money for their fradulent advertising on goods they do not possess ..
negative	took forever to get my shades after fighting with owner , and many rude emails .
negative	my credit_card numbers were taken and were used fradulently by this company in ny .
negative	police reports filed and they are currently being investigated .
negative	also filed with the bbb where this companies poor ratings are off the chart !
negative	ripe with fraud .
negative	buyer_beware they are straight up thieves
negative	i placed my order on 00 may 00 for a pair of ray_ban sunglasses that were listed as fast shipping , i . e they would ship within 00 - 00 hours .
negative	i presumed ( wrongly ) that the web address meant that the company was in australia and therefore that my glasses would be shipped from australia ; i expected to have them quickly .
negative	i received my order confirmation in which i was told that in the unlikely event that there was a problem they would contact me immediately .
negative	on checking my order status 0 days_later , it had changed to ' discontinued '.
negative	i had received no communication from vd that there was a problem .
negative	i tried phoning them using the number listed on paypal ; that was in hong_kong and disconnected .
negative	they had another email_address in the uk which i emailed but have had no response .
negative	interestingly , they were still selling the sunglasses i wanted on their website even at this stage !
negative	after polite and ' form letter ' style emails from their customer_service people in response to my contact , i was offered a 00_%_discount on another pair of sunglasses of my choice .
negative	i accepted their offer and emailed them with the details of the new sunglasses within a few hours on 00th .
negative	here i was thinking that finally my sunglasses would be on there way .
negative	but on checking my order yesterday ( 00th ) i have discovered that the wrong sunglasses have been despatched to me - i am still_waiting for a tracking_number to find out where they are .
negative	i wrote an_email and have been told that they will exchange the glasses for the ones i had ordered but i would need to fill_out a return form and send them back , paying for the postage , that they would then reimburse me .
negative	the glasses i want will take 0 to 00 working days to provide but of course this won '_t happen until i return the glasses that have been sent to me from somewhere in the world .
negative	i have sent an_email asking someone to phone me , as i was told they would do if i requested , but i only get email platitudes in response .
negative	i believe that these problems could have been prevented , and my sunglasses provided much more quickly and hence my level of satisfaction markedly higher if someone from vd had bothered to pick_up the phone and call me when they first discovered that the sunglasses i wanted were discontinued .
negative	this was my test order before ordering prescription_glasses .
negative	given that vd are unable to fill a simple sunglasses order in a timely way , then there is no chance that i am going to order prescription_glasses from them .
negative	beware of vd - they are not australian based and they are not the good customer_service company they would have you believe they are from their web_site .
negative	first my daughters favorite flower is a sunflower and i needed them bad to make her smile , you see her gracie died sunday her sweet dog .
negative	on monday i called and ordered a " deluxe sunflower bouquet " and today my daughter received a small bouquet with green pom mums , black eyed susans , yellow roses but the reason i called and selected sunflowers were very scarce i could only see two sunflowers in the picture she sent me .... to me a big disappointment !!!!!!
negative	so i called customer_service what a laugh ... she argued that i ordered a " golden blooms arrangement " but my receipt shows the picture of the sunflowers so i thought i was getting what i ordered but no they decided what i wanted .
negative	don_'_t be fooled by their pictures on their website to me a complete waste of money and all i was trying do is make my daughter feel better .
negative	i ' m sorry my darling mom tried .....
negative	i have made numerous online purchases .
negative	00_% of the time that fedex is used to deliver something , it is delivered with some kind of damage .
negative	or we have to drive thirty miles to go pick it up from the warehouse .
negative	i will now , not purchase an item if the delivery company is fedex .
negative	i '_ve been infuriated with paypal many_times , but after costing me $_000 . 00 in overdraft charges because of a mistake on their end ( they attempted to explain why i was uninformed ), i want nothing more to due with this company .
negative	i owe these idiots zero dollars - not a red cent .
negative	so just how can you force them to close your account ?
negative	i '_ve requested numerous_times and they just ignore it .
negative	is this something that needs to be reported to appropriate authorities or agencies to take them to task .
negative	after all , they have my ssn , current banking information , address , etc .
negative	part was billed and order confirmation was received .
negative	i waited patiently for the part , only to be told after the package was not delivered and i followed_up to find out why ( when it was much too_late already ) that parts_geek was out of stock and had canceled my order without notifying me of the cancellation in any fashion .
negative	an_apology was made , but that does not compensate me for the loss of time , or for the loss of the sale of the vehicle that occurred because the part was not delivered when promised , and the buyer moved on to another car because mine was not ready .
negative	terrible failing in customer_service , and failure to provide any compensatory remedy .
negative	wir haben ein hotel gebucht und zwar zu einem ganz anderen datum .
negative	die seite hat von sich aus ein ungewolltes datum eingegeben und da wir unser datum bereits eingegeben hatten , haben wir dies nicht nochmals explizit nachgeprüft .
negative	die buchung erfolgt und wir haben dies danach dann in der bestätigung sofort gesehen und wollten stornieren - das unternehmen verweigerte die stornierung .
negative	wir haben uns dann die vorgehensweise des unternehmens booking . com genau angeschaut und das scheint wohl eine normale vorgehensweise dort zu sein kunden unzufrieden zu machen .
negative	in keinem fall werden wir wieder über dieses portal buchen und können jedem nur raten vorsicht !
negative	da helfen auch keine gekauften guten bewertungen die fast allesamt nicht in deutsch verfasst sind - was schon sehr bedenklich ist
negative	totaly scam agency .
negative	try to read google ' ualadys scam '
negative	i had a horrible_experience with this company .
negative	sold me faulty brake pads .
negative	cost me $_000 in mechanics fees to put bad part in , test it , and take it back out , and then wouldn_'_t even pay return shipping on the bad part .
negative	of course they didn_'_t pay the mechanic either .
negative	bad costumer_service .
negative	when i demanded at lest return shipping they hung_up on me .
negative	i have reported them to the bbb .
negative	still_waiting for my credit_card refund of part that i returned with tracking_#
negative	i have been a long time member of ancestry . com and have decided to probably not renew when my membership is complete .
negative	customer_service is non_- existent .
negative	what happened to e_- mail customer_service ?
negative	i find it difficult to call during the hours you have customer_service representatives available .
negative	shouldn '_t you be making it convenient for me to contact customer_service ?
negative	i made my tree private months_ago , but people are still saving items from my tree .
negative	how are they doing that ?
negative	also , information about living people is showing up even_though i specifically have them designated as living .
negative	this is a concern for me and i cannot get an answer because i cannot call during your business hours .
negative	mister auto accepted order and took payment .
negative	a couple of days_later they cancelled the order .
negative	i contacted them by the way of a premium rate telephone call and was told the order had been cancelled as the parts were not in stock .
negative	when asked when they would return my payment i was told in a couple of days time .
negative	it appears that they only return your payments after some undetermined timeframe at their will .
negative	they use your money on cancelled orders to bankroll their organisation , i guess it is the only way they can make a profit .
negative	don_'_t waste your time shopping with this company .
negative	if you are used to good quality shoes , fast shipping , attentive customer_service and a good refund policy then this is not the place for you .
negative	ordered two pairs of boots , both lousy quality and smelled terrible (" synthetic leather ").
negative	customer_service number nonfunctional .
negative	when finally contacted via e_- mail only option was store credit .
negative	i don_'_t want any more of their junk , will donate boots to the salvation army and write this off as an expensive mistake .
negative	i had a contract with o0 for over five years .
negative	at christmas i got a new o0 contract via carphone warehouse .
negative	because the previous o0 contract had 0 months to run they insisted on charging me £_000 ( despite the fact i was staying with o0 ).
negative	i accepted this and at the time the customer_service person said i would be sent an electronic or paper bill as he could not be precise about the amount due .
negative	the next thing i hear is a letter from a debit agency threatening me with legal_action if i don_'_t pay the £_000 plus an admin fee .
negative	i tried to take this up with o0 but they refused to speak with me as the matter had been handed on .
negative	i tried to explain to the debt agency but they were not interested in anything but how i would pay this new increased amount .
negative	i agreed to pay the original amount and went back to o0 to complain_about the lack of communication and the referral to the debt agency .
negative	i was advised to use their webchat .
negative	this resulted in 00_mins of complete and utter rubbish ( i still wonder whether this was just a computer generated algorithm ?)
negative	that resolved nothing .
negative	after sending further emails and insisting on a written response i did get communication from a real_person .
negative	he advised that i was sent a letter about the debt a month_ago .
negative	i did not and when i pointed this out he advised that i could access the letter i was meant to have received by paying £_00 to access my o0 correspondence - outrageous !
negative	o0 take no responsibility for their poor practice .
negative	there are so many things they could and should have done before referring me to a debt agency .
negative	they could have phoned me ,.
negative	they still have a direct debit in place so could have accessed this .
negative	i am tied to o0 by virtue of a 00 month contract which i am not going to spend £ 000s more to buy myself out of .
negative	however they can be sure i will get as far away from them
negative	as possible once i am able .
negative	i suggest you keep away too .
negative	stay_away from this company .
negative	they '_ll lure you in to create a recurring order online , but to cancel the order , you have to call them .
negative	as far as i can tell , none of their competitors require you to call in order to cancel a recurring order .
negative	i was supposed to get a gift code immediately .
negative	i paid $_000 . 00 for a $_000 game stop gift_card code .
negative	i never got the code .
negative	i have been on hold for 00_minutes so_far with customer_service .
negative	i will be stopping payment immediately with my cc company and shopping elsewhere !
negative	!
negative	did you even read my review ???
negative	?

negative	when it didn_'_t arrive i called again , and was told it would be in on may 00th and would go out that day .
negative	it went out one the 00th electronically by usps ; nnot expited as requested .
negative	it seems that evey one of your negative_reviews on here has an excuse by youor blames the buyer .
negative	the customer is always right in my business !
negative	your apology should have read , we are sorry , we screwed up and our employees will be better trained to make you a happy client .
negative	i chjange my rating to 0 star accually it is " 0 " star .
negative	ordered a dainese air - framejacket red & grey at full price because they said it was in stock .
negative	could have saved 00_% on sale from another supplier , but did not want to wait .
negative	, because i was going on a trip 0 / 00 weekend .
negative	got an_email that it was not in stock ; called and was told i got the last one .
negative	days went by and i called again and was told it was to arrive from dianese ( was not in stock ) on may 00 and i asked to have it expedited .
negative	finally got an_email that my order was fulfilled , and a usps tracking_number that i had to figure_out who '_s number it was .
negative	it was not expedited !!!
negative	unfortunately , i have to use my older hot jacket this weekend in florida .
negative	i will not recommend or do business here again .
negative	just come home from a holiday " arranged " by supreme travel .
negative	the trip to and from the hotel was an absolute nightmare .
negative	we were in alanya , turkey , and the trip took us 00 hours !!!
negative	( last_year we were in thailand , and the trip home from bangkok to us well under 00 hours !!)
negative	among other things we had a 0 hours intermission in düsseldorf - both ways .
negative	when i adressed supreme travel they just said that it was not their problem .
negative	they were also extremely late to send us our tickets / wouchers , i had to ask for them several_times before we got them just a few_days before departure
negative	undgå at bestille noget som helst fra det svenske firma maacann .
negative	d . 0 / 0 bestilte jeg noget naturmedicin , og pengene blev straks trukket fra_min konto .
negative	omkring d . 00 / 0 havde_jeg intet hørt fra firmaet , og kontaktede derfor udbyderen af den deal , jeg_havde købt .

negative	don_'_t order from this company .
negative	they don_'_t know what they are doing or they don_'_t care .
negative	i ' m not sure which .
negative	i ordered an antenna and they " numbered the wrong part as my part " then charged me to send back the wrong part .
negative	i had to pay for their mistake !!
negative	i ordered from another company .
negative	do not order from them unless you have lots of extra money to pay for their mistakes .
negative	don_'_t be misled by their low_prices !!
negative	i invite them to respond to this review .
negative	no customer_service !

negative	i had been hosting successfully for about 00 months with airbnb ... i even hosted one of the founders nathan without knowing at the time .
negative	about 0 weeks_ago , i stopped being notified in my email of instant bookings .
negative	i had to go online to see my calendar and almost overlooked bookings that used to be automatically sent to me .
negative	i hadn '_t changed anything .
negative	i contacted airbnb and it took a couple of support people to figure_out and fix , but after that i stopped getting contacted altogether .
negative	two people contacted me privately through my own website ( which refers guests to book using airbnb ), to say that they wanted to stay but airbnb said my listing had been removed .
negative	no one informed me that my listing was removed .
negative	i left several support emails to airbnb last night after a former guest contacted me to say she tried to book again but my listing was removed .
negative	then i texted with live " chat " and andre f . told me he '_s get right on it .
negative	0 hours_later another potential guest called me to say they wanted to come this weekend but airbnb showed that my listing was removed .
negative	this time i phoned airbnb emergency support and was told the same thing .
negative	they would try to figure_out why my listing wasn_'_t showing up -- not even to them .
negative	he said he would raise it up in the level of importance but still , i have not heard back from them and my site is not showing up .
negative	if they removed it , they should tell me first , and tell me why ?
negative	i have had over 000 positive_reviews and often tell potential guests who find me through other sources to please use airbnb to book , but now i '_ll reconsider .
negative	this is my business , and i ' m angry that they have not helped_me with this issue .
negative	warning !
negative	trustpilot will allow competitors to write_reviews good or bad about your !
negative	00 days now and review still not removed !
negative	bestilte adsl 00 mbit forbindelse via tdc '_s website ... big mistake !!
negative	!
negative	linien viste sig kun at kunne trække ca 0 mbit , evige ventetider på telefonservice .
negative	fik forklaret at når_man bestiller 00 mbit kan man forvente mellem 0 og 00 .
negative	endte med at annullere min ordre da tdc teknisk support sagde de ikke_kunne levere det lovede grundet gamle kobberledninger i lokalområdet .
negative	først nu begyndte det rigtig sjove .
negative	tdc mente jeg_skulle betale de 0 måneders binding alligevel .
negative	det_blev vi vildt uenige om .
negative	det endte med de lukkede min fastnettelefon !!
negative	!
negative	den blev først åbnet da_jeg truede med at gå til dagspressen med historien .
negative	det tog ca 0 måneder , et utal af telefonopkald , de fleste ubesvarede , en masse frustration , en masse brevskrivning før det hele gik op i 0 kr .
negative	og ingen regning til mig .
negative	i purchased two airline_tickets through bravofly .
negative	two hours_later i got an_email informing_me that the booking was cancelled .
negative	when i tried booking tickets elswhere i found out that bravofly had put a hold on my account for the full price of the tickets .
negative	$ 0 , 000 and had not released the funds after they cancelled the booking .
negative	i wrote to the customer_service several_times informing them that failure to reverse the charge was precluding me from purchasing the tickets elsewhere .
negative	my requests have been ignored for the past two_days and the money is still not back to my account
negative	sucks when they cancel your order for no reason when you were depending on it ........
negative	why did you cancel my lowes giftcard order ?
negative	i was counting on using them today .. no fair !

negative	i had previously ordered 0 shower towers ( 0 years_ago and 0 months_ago ) from h / r with no issue .
negative	we are renovating a condominum we recently bought in florida and ordered 0 units to be shipped to the contractor onsite in florida .
negative	the package arrived and h / r shipped the wrong unit , so they screwed up half of the order .
negative	we had scheduled a plumber to hook both of these up so that had to be rescheduled and we were charged a rescheduling charge .
negative	when i went to customer_service online , they wanted a complete description of what they had shipped .
negative	luckily the contractor had taken a picture of the 0 units and then h / r agreed to ship out a replacement .
negative	i had now spent almost 0 hours online .
negative	when the replacement order arrived via_email , i noticed that they were shipping the replacement to our address in new jersey and i immediately contacted " sadie " back at customer_service who assured me , twice , that this is the way it had to be entered , but they were absolutely shipping the replacement to florida .
negative	0 days_later , the replacement arrived at our new jersey address .
negative	sadie again promised to get back with a forwarding label and information about shipping .
negative	it has now been 0 days and i have heard_nothing from h / r .
negative	on my own and at my expense , i have shipped the replacement to our contractor in florida ( having opened the package to make_sure a : it was the right unit , and b : all the parts were there .
negative	i '_ve now sent another email requesting a refund of my shipping_charges and some offset for the massive screw - ups .
negative	bottom_line , if you have all the time in the world and don_'_t mind sending things back , several_times , then order from hudson reed , otherwise beware .
negative	i '_ve recommended them to several folks , but now must go back and warn them .
negative	for this renovation , we have ordered a lot of items online -- another company omitted part of their order but when i contacted them , i got a courteous reply after an_apology and the missing faucet was sent overnight , again with their apology .
negative	january 00 .
negative	h / r sent yet another shower tower to the address in florida , with no prior notice to me .
negative	i continue to get apologies and insistence that they are doing everything in their power and referring the matter to their managers .
negative	meanwhile , i now have 0 shower towers , the original wrong one and one extra one .
negative	i was promised that someone would contact me about pick_up instructions prior to today ... guess what , no email or phone_calls .
negative	it seems my only option is to have the contractor put the stuff on the curb and be done with it .
negative	i cannot believe the supreme incompetence .
negative	when i called i talked to a very rude man all i wanted was to get the right screen for my laptop but he didnt have time to talk he told me to call this other number which gave a recording you were paid for the screen but i didnt get what i paid for so i wont give you no praise
negative	i just so dissapppointed cause my best friend to me to use yall instead of my first chioce imm done !!
negative	!
negative	this was our first experience online via my cell_phone , not their app .
negative	when we arrived at the motel we found we could have paid $_00 less .
negative	but no refund from priceline .
negative	this our first and last use of priceline .
negative	maybe we first timer people are why they make money !
negative	do yourself a favor and use any booking site , " except " book it . com
negative	awful customer_service and policies
negative	nearly 0 weeks since payment made .
negative	the camera has been held in uk customs , presumably due to incorrect paperwork by digitalrev .
negative	refund refused by digitalrev until they have received the returned item which may well never happen as customs show no sign of releasing the parcel .
negative	now digitalrev are not even responding to my emails !
negative	terrible exp ,,,,, first thier pdf didn_'_t open ,,, no details what so ever on my purchase , other than cc receipt of trip shock service ,,, what service ,,,, emailed back ,, will cancel payment ,,, called cc company ,,, they said to early for a dispute ,,,, before reservations were even due ,,,,,, called trip shoch .
negative	said customer_service closes at night ,,, told them my story about pdf , lack of any detail ,,, they told me what the pdf said ,,,, really ,,,,, told them i sent email canceling payment ,,,,, afters 0 months fighting with my cc company over this ,,,,, trip shock tells_me ,,,, when you tell them your canceling payment ,,, that doesn_'_t mean your canceling your reservations ,,, trip shock
negative	stinks ,, they will dispute what canceling means and keep your money ,,, for no services rendered except the run a round ,,,, 000 dollars down the tubes ,,,,, stay_away ,,, from tripshock
negative	i booked a car for 0 days , knowing that may be i will return it few hours_later .
negative	the difference_between 0 and 0 days was 00 $ in total .
negative	after booking i called service to verify that in case i will return it later ( more_than 0 days ), i will pay approximately additional 00 $, which i accepted . when i reached miami office , first they told me that if i return it late , i will have to pay 000 $ and when i asked to get in touch with service i was told to go , make a phone_call and close it with them .
negative	i asked the help of the front_desk at the counter and was told that i should manage myself .
negative	also , although the car booked for me was a " ford estate " ( we were 0 people only ), they tried to sell me a suv , saying , that by this i will promiss myself a big car ( i booked compact car ).
negative	i fealt very bad , like they wer trying to cheat me .
negative	i will nevere again rent a car from [_link ] and not going to use vipcars for renting a car .
negative	don_'_t work with them !!
negative	!
negative	we rented a car via auto_europe to be waiting for us at barcelona airport at the dollar rental desk march 00 0000 .
negative	on arrival , we found out that no such rental desk exists for this company .
negative	i asked at all other rental desks , police and airport info
negative	showing my voucher only to be told no such rental company exists at barcelona airport .
negative	i called the local number on voucher got a recorded message in spanish .
negative	in the end i was forced to rent a car from another company at significant expense because i did not pre order .
negative	on arrival to our destination 0 hours away i emailed autoeurope demanding an explanation and an immediately refund .
negative	i was told i could go back to the airport and pick_up the car ( dude , it doesn_'_t exist !!)
negative	or wait until the rental period was over for a refund ( cause it takes that long to figure_out that i never picked_up the car in the first place !!)
negative	fast forward to end of april still , no refund , they " need to hear back from rental desk at the barcelona airport to make_sure i never got the car " and guess what - no one is answering their phone_calls ( duh !)
negative	after multiple complaints they finally refunded my money beginning of may .
negative	to date no explanation as to why they rented me a car from an imaginary rental company at that location
negative	no apology for their ineptitude , and my stress and extra expense
negative	be aware this is not a reputable company !
negative	!

negative	dpd tried to deliver a parcel to us whilst we were out .
negative	they left a standard ' sorry we missed you ' card but it had no information about what had been done with the parcel on it .
negative	we went online to find out what had happened to the parcel and the online response was that it had been left with ' smith '!
negative	nothing else .
negative	there is no - one called smith that we know of in our road .
negative	i contacted the ' make it right ' team whose response was , curiously , that " the address we have been given is different to the one you have provided me with in your email .
negative	i therefore advise , that you contact the sender to discuss the issue ."
negative	i pointed_out that i don_'_t know who the sender was because i don_'_t know what was in the parcel ( we receive a high volume of parcels , many of them for a holiday let that we manage ).
negative	their further response was " i am sorry to advise i am unable to locate your details in the system with the tracking reference provided .
negative	if anyone at your address has received any text messages or emails from us at all , i can search for your details with your email_address or mobile number .
negative	alternatively , if you can provide any other tracking_number ( parcel or consignment number ) then we can use this to find your information ."
negative	well , no .
negative	all i can tell you is that your driver has left a note with your reference number on it stating that a parcel destined for us has been left with someone somewhere called smith .
negative	what are you going to do about it ?
negative	no response after 00 days .
negative	i sent from uruguay to cancun and they took 0 days to deliver !
negative	they don_'_t work on week ends ... disaster !!
negative	! inutiles and don_'_t answer the phone for complaints !
negative	i will never book on line again .
negative	i was told three_times after three specific questions , " are you positive my card won '_t be charged until check in ".
negative	answer , oh absolutely not , it will be charged at the time of your check in .
negative	turns_out they were processing the full_amount as we spoke !
negative	now i have to wait five to six business days for it to show in my account !
negative	i have opened a fraud investigation at our bank against them ... this is legalized robbery and consumers should have more control than we do .
negative	so i will exercise the only control i have ... i will never use this service or one like them again !
negative	i hope they are put out of business .
negative	terrible company .
negative	awful customer_service .
negative	long wait plus no telephone_number to call for help .
negative	i ordered glasses from smartbuyglasses . com thinking it would save me money .
negative	don_'_t do it !
negative	what a headache .
negative	it took a month plus to receive the glasses .
negative	then upon wearing them the front screw that holds the glasses together popped out .
negative	i wrote to smartbuyglasses and no one responded to my email at customer_service .
negative	i then took the glasses to three independent optical business and none of them had the right screw to replace it - they all said go back to the company .
negative	so i wrote again to smartbuyglasses and explained_everything and asked them to send me the proper screws to fix this ?
negative	it would cost them nothing to do and have made me very happy .
negative	instead their customer_service rep - jerome - writes back -- " take the glasses to a local optometrist ," as though he never read my compliant in the first place .
negative	what a waste .
negative	these were pricey glasses to begin with .
negative	don_'_t do business with this company , fair warning .

negative	i bought my wife some hunter wellies as a christmas_present , confident that they could be returned for a refund if she didn_'_t like them ( which she didn_'_t ) because their site made a point of stating that the returns policy had been extended for christmas presents .
negative	what it failed to point out that the refund part was only applicable to the legal 0 days internet agreement , she would after that only be entitled to an exchange .
negative	the exchange credit had to be spent in one go or forfeited .
negative	we did try emailling and ringing to explain the confusion but they were very disinterested and basically said you have no choice , like it or lump it .
negative	we then returned the boots only to be told that they would only replace them when someone returned a pair as they did not intend ordering any more from hunter until they had a bulk order .
negative	we will certainly never use this site again .
negative	we are happy with the sunglasses we bought but not happy with the customer_service .
negative	we live in a rural delivery area and our delivery address needs to be formatted correctly in order for us to get delivery .
negative	the smartglasses system converted the delivery address incorrectly -- not the way i entered it .
negative	as son as i noticed it ( i think the same day ), i emailed their customer_service asking for it to be corrected .
negative	two_days_later i got an_email asking me to contact the local courier and correct the address with them .
negative	i dont understand_why smartglasses didnt look after it .
negative	anyway i rang the local courier and they did make the change somewhat -- but not enough as the glasses were delivered to another similar address .
negative	the kind people at that other address phoned me and i drove over to their place and picked them up ... and gave them a nice bottle of wine fro being so good as to track me down ( when they could have just kept them ).
negative	i need to buy some reading glasses but probably wont as i cant afford to have them go missing in the mail .
negative	the good things i can say are that the glasses are good , they were a fair price and they were shipped quickly .
negative	dont touch these theiving f **** rs , they feed certain players , give you an excellent hand , only one card out the pack can beat you , and they give it to the fed , you cant beat them , so you put more and more money in ,,,,,,,, you have been warned !!!!
negative	!
negative	it took me 00_minutes to book a straightforward car_hire on the phone with ebookers .
negative	they use an overseas call_centre and it was like drawing teeth , very painful .
negative	the call_centre operator did not know the basic elements of the product ; had to look them up from a script and coldn '_t answer follow - up questions .
negative	he kept repeating basic details as if i was 0 years old .
negative	a poor customer experience .
negative	you receive a lower price , but it comes with a customer_service cost .
negative	advise you go elsewhere for a better experience
negative	i placed my order on 00 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	never received the products nor a refund . on jan 0 0000 i was told i i wolud receive my refund in 0 - 00 days .
negative	guess what , no refund !!!
negative	on the 00th i was hung_up on .
negative	on the 00r i was told the web_site was down , so what where is my refund .
negative	this company is a fraud !!!
negative	don_'_t order from them .
negative	you will lose !!

negative	i booked a suite at suites on south beach in miami for two nights july 0rd & 0th 0000 .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel we were told that they could not find our reservation .
negative	i gave them my confirmation from hotelsclick . com and they said they would call us when they figured it out .
negative	we were fine with that because we were off to the beach .
negative	they called us about two hours_later to tell us that it looked like when the site ( hotelsclcik . com ) had sent the booking the hotel had replied that they were full .
negative	the site never contacted us in any form .
negative	the hotel said that fortunately they had a room at their sister hotel two blocks away .
negative	we accepted that room .
negative	the suites on south beach has a kitchenette with a full size refrigerator and a sink and microwave and utensils .
negative	we were booked into a suite ( one room , not really a suite ) with only a mini fridge in it .
negative	we brought food to cook for breakfast and snacks for late at night .
negative	we could not use this food .
negative	when the trip was over i received a receipt from the hotel for about $_00 less per_night for than the suites on south beach .
negative	i emailed customer_service at hotelsclick . com and i also opened a dispute with amex .
negative	hotelclick . com responded that they wanted paperwork which i sent them .
negative	they replied about tone month later that since i was upgraded to a suite at the sister hotel they did not owe me any refund .
negative	they said the suite had a mini fridge and the original hotel we booked had only a mini fridge and a microwave .
negative	they said the hotel where we stayed had a microwave available for use if we went down to the main desk and asked for them to cook food for us .
negative	i replied again with my receipt copies , a picture from the website of the original hotel showing a full size refrigerator and actual room that was a kitchenette .
negative	i copied amex with my dispute number .
negative	the next_day amex credited my account for the entire charge .
negative	two_days_later i received a reply from hotelsclick . com that they would refund $_00 . 00 to my credit_card because our room did not have a microwave .
negative	i told them they did not need to credit my card because my credit_card company already had .
negative	i told them i was disappointed that they couldn_'_t meet their obligations and then couldn_'_t even refund the difference_between the price of the two hotels .
negative	i don_'_t expect a reply since amex has already credited the charge .
negative	also , hotelsclick . com sent my reservation to somewhere called jumbo tours making it even harder to find the reservation .
negative	what would have happened if there was no room at the sister hotel and i was stuck in miami on a holiday with no room ?
negative	i would be extremely wary of using this site no_matter how much_cheaper they look .
negative	they obviously have no scruples or business ethics .
negative	do not use cash0phones .
negative	please read below .
negative	i am disgusted .
negative	after sending 0 phones , none with any great value , the response was to pay full price £_00 . 00 on an old nokia 0000 , but reduce htc wildfire price from approc £_00 to £_00 . 00 .
negative	it was in far better condition and more in demand !
negative	in addition , they changed the value of a very old phone from £ 0 to £ 0 ( yes zero ) so were able to record it as " accepted " with no comeback !
negative	i emailed to say not acceptable on two counts , got an_email back to say please logon and review your revised offers .
negative	duly did this and there was no change !
negative	i was due to go on holiday the next_morning for a week , so from the airport sent a further email to say i was not happy and was only contactable in next week via_email .
negative	cash0phones ignored my email and converted the htc to accepted as it passed their 0 day stipulation .
negative	on my return i phoned to make a pretty full on complaint , but the response was tough , the phone has already been processed and is no_longer yours - no comeback , and no acceptance of them being at fault .
negative	when i suggested to the girl on the phone ( who was only doing her job following instructions from thieving bosses ) that she should be better_than working for those theives , she went very quiet .
negative	i sensed she agreed with me .
negative	in summary - i was robberd of one ohone and ripped_off with another

negative	this year a total 000 degree turn .
negative	horrible customer_service , no responses to e_- mails .
negative	shipped ems instead of dhl and it took over a month to get here .
negative	the team that needed them for a specific ride did not get them ...
negative	kept writing and writing the company with no response !
negative	i am still trying to get a hold of them and they refuse to answer any e_- mails .
negative	last_year i would have told everyone to buy from them ...
negative	but with whatever change has happened i hate to say this because i really_liked them but if you need clothing for cycling do not order from here !!!!!
negative	run as fast as you can to anywhere_else !
negative	i purchased a solar cover for a customer and when i opened it and put it on the pool surface it was a mile out of square .
negative	the customer was not happy and i was not happy , but i could not possibly fold it back up and return it ... after several hours of trimming and fitting it is on the pool .... out of square looking but functional ..
negative	i lost my profit on the job to make the customer semi - happy .. two_days latter the customer called and said the protective cover that was included with the solar cover was 0 ' feet short ... sure enough it was the wrong_size ... talking to customer_service , they told me that the 00 foot x 00 inch protective cover was just a sample and i could purchase the right size cover for the solar cover .... wtf are they talking_about .... i have purchased dozens of solar covers and they all come with the white plastic cover ....
negative	they did offer to replace the solar cover if i sent them a sample which i did , but have not heard back ..... never again
negative	dear my name_necklace ,
negative	as stated above , when you give someone tracking_information it is so that the person who has ordered something , paid for it and expects it to arrive at their home ( probably as a gift or such ) can follow its progress , know where it is and be confident in its delivery .
negative	also , a phone_number should be included and a customer_service representative should be able to answer all questions about that order .
negative	people are putting their trust in you to not only take money out of their bank accounts , but to produce a product as_described with confidence .
negative	a thriving business has good contact information , good tracking_information and good customer_service .

negative	after a snotty e mail about my address , which i confirmed , they canceled my order . i don_'_t know why as they had not even the manners to tell me they were doing it
negative	first red flag ..... this company contracts through expedia .
negative	it '_s not clearly stated .
negative	our hotel clerk confirmed this and was unable to assist in changing the reservation .
negative	second red flag ..... they hi - jacked the days inn name making you think that you are dealing_with their reservation service .
negative	third red flag .
negative	... their telephone servers are trained to trick you by mixing up your dates .
negative	this company operates at the level of legal scammers and are getting away with it .
negative	guess i had to learn the hard way .
negative	from now on i will call the hotel directly .
negative	e_- bay is the worst ever .
negative	they have gone downhill over the past couple of years .
negative	there selling policy for members who have been with them for 00 years or longer with 000_% perfect feedback is insulting .
negative	i have gone to amazom and had very good_luck .
negative	i used to think of amazon only for books .
negative	not any more , you can get anything there that you can on e_- bay .
negative	before placing my order , i asked luxury of watches if they could guarantee that the watch that i wanted would be delivered within 00 days .
negative	the sales_rep confirmed that i ' d get it .
negative	after several weeks and much frustrating follow_up via phone and email , a customer_service rep indicated that they would not be able to meet their commitment .
negative	then he / she made a unilateral decision to cancel my order .
negative	luxury of watches was quick in charging $ 0 , 000 + against my credit_card .
negative	but very slow in responding to calls and emails .
negative	the store failed to deliver on its guarantee .
negative	terrible shopping_experience .
negative	poor quality and they messed_up my business cards
negative	i placed an order in the early morning on may 00 .
negative	i purchase a month supply each month with normally one week grace period till supply is gone .
negative	on the following wednesday , i realized the shipment had not been shipped so made three different calls .
negative	i told them i needed the shipment by friday and was assured they would " take_care of it '- i could have stopped the order and simply purchased locally , but they said they would correct it .
negative	still nothing until late thursday and another call .
negative	but the shipment was only just done and with no special handling leading to yet another possible 0 day delay at_least .
negative	i had asked to talk to a supervisor every time i called - none returned the call for three days .
negative	they lied about shipping date , as fed_ex verified the actual time .
negative	then on face book they lied again openly , saying they had ' tried ' to call me .
negative	i carry a cell 00 / 0 and there were no calls and no missed calls .
negative	finally after 0 days a supervisor did call and admitted to the above situation , no calls , wrong ship date etc and then had the audacity to offer 00_%_off my ' next order " what ????
negative	so no dog_food for my dogs is just fine with these people considering once they have your money , the welfare of your dog is the last thing on their mind .
negative	the next offer was $_00 ..... i must assume they find a small sack of old roy just fine rather then the excellent nutrition my dogs are used too .
negative	on the whole , i will never recommend this company , money is their only real interest , there are some great dog_food delivery companies available .
negative	any other would be a better choice .

negative	i bought a tag heuer watch from dexclusive . com as a new watch .
negative	it broke , when i took to local tag heuer dealer they confirmed it was a refurbished watch .
negative	contacted dexclusive . com , they replied : " we never state we sell only new watches "!
negative	look at their website , they state they only sell new watches !!
negative	!
negative	went through the usual work of filling in trivia information which some is erelevant to the sale , ad to your cart , bla , bla , bla .
negative	their price is pretty good but then at check out they hit you with a $_00 . 00 shipping charge for only six little bags , i have had so many christmas purchases shipped for much less_than that .
negative	what a waist of time ...
negative	booked flights , bravofly accepted payment , next_day bravofly cancelled booking with no explanation .
negative	money was refunded and i ended_up purchasing tickets for the same flights , same times on orbitz .
negative	still have no idea why flight was cancelled .
negative	i ordered lafont glasses from them .
negative	after a month , the frame is peeling and when i complained they were useless and said to contact the company .
negative	lafont says they are not distributors and they use no decals .
negative	these are knockoffs !!!!
negative	i paid almost $_000 for fake frames .
negative	and there is nothing i can do about it .
negative	i feel dumb , yes , but pissed is more like it .
negative	do not use this company !!!
negative	!
negative	i am appalled at the total_lack of responsibility to the customer .
negative	i was not notified my items were back ordered .
negative	both inquiries i sent were ignored .
negative	this behavior by a vendor is woefully inadequate in today '_s economic environment .
negative	i would not order a band - aid from them if they shipped it air express !
negative	jodie n .
negative	i had received an_email for free shipping when i signed_up with auto ship .
negative	i did just that and never received the free shipping .... they said there was a $_00 minimum for that email .... i read the email several_times ... no minimum was stated anywhere ... i fowarded the email ... and still did not get the free shipping as stated .
negative	told them to cancel the order but said oops too_late , already sent ... was not happy and wont shop again
negative	this company uses a bait and switch tactic with the price_match .
negative	after you shop all over online to find the lowest_price and place your order , they email you telling you that the prices are invalid .
negative	when i asked why , they ignored my email .
negative	also , they don_'_t answer their phones .
negative	shipping_costs are ridiculous !
negative	still trying to get my money from these thieves , who used to trade under electrictshirts . co . uk .
negative	don_'_t be fooled !!!!!
negative	i ordered a t - shirt in july , never received it , and despite repeated requests from me and ' promises ' from them to refund my money , it hasn '_t happened .
negative	i '_ll just keep on until they comply .
negative	i don_'_t take kindly to being ripped_off .
negative	it takes forever for the site to load using google chrome or mozilla .
negative	other_sites load fast , so it '_s not my computer .
negative	i wouldn_'_t waste my time waiting for each page to load .
negative	will try back in a week or so and see if the speed increases , otherwise no shopping here ...
negative	i placed a simple repair order - to replace a small plastic piece that is part of the nose - bridge on my sunglasses .
negative	this was done on may 00 .
negative	this is a 00 cent part and maybe 0 minutes of work for which they charged me over $_00 and i had to pay for the shipping both ways .
negative	this , and it took over to months to complete the work .......
negative	never again will i use them and i suggest no one else does either .
negative	altiuscart . com does not screen sellers : rainbow electronics and communications limited .
negative	after four different ship dates and a bogus tracking_number , i was sent the following email : " i will like you to know that there is a little problem with your package as it has been held by custom demanding for for custom fees which is $_000 and if this fees is not paid they will not be releasing the package for delivery to your door step ."
negative	i requested a refund ... " your order have been shipped out and it is already in usa there is no way you can get a refund if the package is not delivered to you .
negative	you can only get a refund if the product delivered to you is not working fine or if you are not satisfied with the product ."
negative	this is the worst delivery carrier out there !
negative	i advise any businesses looking for a delivery comapny to stay well away form yodel , your custermers will never receive their parcels .
negative	we stayed in all day , regulary cheacking the tracking status ; at 0 :_00am the parcal left the local depot which is less_than 0 miles_away , then at 0 :_00pm this evening the tracking status said that the parcal had been delivered at 0 :_00pm , yet we haven_'_t received anything !
negative	we can '_t contact yodel , the phone_number on there website is not a real number , there live_chat service is closed ( even_though it is suppose to be open until 0 :_00pm !)
negative	we are absolutely furious with yodel !!

negative	i booked to get 0 front tyres on my daughters car and 0 rear tyres on my car changed online .
negative	i was able to select a day and time and after having received confirmation of the order - via_email - as the web_page was unable to display the final confirmation - i thought that was it !
negative	wrong !
negative	i got a missed call on my mobile and the message said call this 00 whatever number ... but my phone said another number - i trusted the phone and got a message_saying call the other number ...
negative	by now i ' d got the confirmation email - 0 with a tel number to call , so i called it and the chap there said sorry he couldn_'_t help me ( nor transfer me to the right department ).
negative	i recovered the message and dialled the number ( the last digit was 0 digit away from the number i ' d previously dialled ) they couldn_'_t get hold of my details and said they ' d have to call me back ....
negative	i then get a call saying that they can '_t do the time and day i wanted - hang on i say , your website has confirmed this already - the reply was basically that it shouldn '_t display this option as the systems weren '_t linked .
negative	so i said ok cancel the order - apparently it would take 0 days to get the money back - i said if that was the case i wanted compensation - or my money back today .
negative	he goes off to check and finally i get a call saying they ' re bringing someone in from another region to fit my tyres on the day and time i ' d been originally confirmed .
negative	tyres were fitted fine - as_promised .
negative	that part of the service was excellent .
negative	the part getting to that was shocking !
negative	would i use kwik fit again - well they ' d have to be really really cheap to make me use them again after that experience
negative	very poor company .
negative	agoda sent a confirming e_- mail to me stating a hotel voucher would be sent within an_hour .
negative	no voucher .
negative	after a couple of days , i followed_up .
negative	agoda claims 00 / 0 customer_service and promise a response within 00 hours .
negative	no response .
negative	sent request again .
negative	after five days , received an e_- mail stating there was no reservation and no room available at the hotel .
negative	offered no assistance or explanation .
negative	meanwhile , one of my fellow travelers booked a room after i supposedly had a reservation .
negative	this is a terrible company .
negative	see other problems noted in other traveler reviews on websites .
negative	my wife and i flew from sevilla to copenhagen ( via barcelona ) on the 00 . 00 . 0000 .
negative	we were charged an extra € 00 for our suitcases in check - in , even when we have already paid for them in our booking on the website .
negative	we were told that the € 00 that we paid for 0 suitcases was only for baggage handling from sevilla to barcelona only , hence we had to pay from barcelona to copenhagen .
negative	when we bought the tickets we understood that it '_s for the entire journey as the website never indicated that there will be an extra_charge from barcelona to copenhagen .
negative	we were told that we could make a claim if we disagreed when we get home .
negative	we wrote to vueling and they refused to give us a refund on the ground that they were in the right to charge us .
negative	firstly , they should indicate clearly what people are paying for when ordering tickets on their website .
negative	secondly , they should not charge passengers double for their baggage .
negative	(€ 00 on the web and € 00 in check - in ) when it is their own fault .
negative	thirdly , they should refund the passengers who were charged extra for baggage handling .
negative	it '_s not the fault of the passengers as they have acted in good faith .
negative	we will never fly vueling again as we feel cheated by the company .
negative	it took two_weeks for me to receive my glasses !
negative	i had ordered transition lenses and they were not transition , just regular ones .
negative	i am sending them back and getting a full_refund .
negative	of course i have to send them back at my own expense !
negative	i will never order from this company again !
negative	i ordered some schluter profile metal trim for a tiling project .
negative	by the description and photograph and price i was ordering the 0ft profile .
negative	i received , however , some one inch connectors .... but get this ... the price was the same .... 0ver 000 dollars .
negative	i was willing to keep the connectors , but these people do not understand what they are selling ... they only know reference numbers .
negative	it has been a week and i have not received my refund .
negative	i also had to pay for shipping to return .... though it was their mistake .
negative	they ' re customer_service has a lot to be desired .
negative	after talking with multiple e_- comfort people and i mean several phone_calls ... i ordered what i hope will be the correct items .... but according to their tracking system the items have not been shipped ... after weeks .... but im sure ive been charged .
negative	my tiling project has been delayed for a month .... i '_ve been charged for over a thousand dollars and ive yet to see my 0ft schluter metal trim pieces i originally ordered .
negative	i booked 0 rooms at a hotel “ naries namakwa retreat , springbok , south - africa through “ easy to book ” and cancelled it the very next_day .
negative	according to “ easy to book ” i was intitled to a full_refund .
negative	i have never received a refund until this day .
negative	i got screwed out of $_000 . 00 by “ easy to book ”.
negative	also , they don_’ t return your e_- mails or phone_calls .

negative	i ordered two dozen roses for valentine '_s day on feb . 0 0000 .
negative	the flowers arrived on feb . 00 .
negative	there was not one single rose that was usable .
negative	the stems were broken , the flowers and leaves had black spots .
negative	i asked for my money back and was told that they do not give refunds , but offered store credit .
negative	i do not ever want to do business with this band of incompetents again , but what can i do ?
negative	they have me over a barrel , so i accepted the credit ( minus the delivery charge , which was equal to one half of the order total .
negative	i doubt that i will ever use it , but it will complicate their bookkeeping for a while anyway .
negative	this company has one of the worst in us customer_support .
negative	rude , unfriendly , not even trying to help you in any way .
negative	once you put an order , they spit in you face .
negative	i am done with ebay and paypal .
negative	i haven_'_t sold anything via ebay ( and paypal for probably a year ).
negative	used to do it quite frequently .
negative	i used to enjoy it and never experienced any_problems .
negative	i wanted to have a little extra cash for christmas , so sold some perfume via ebay ( as i have done many_times before ).
negative	offered free shipping to drive up my sales .
negative	sold one for $_00 . 00 and one for $_00 . 00 .
negative	i had numerous problems because my ebay and paypal weren '_t linked .
negative	got that taken_care of .
negative	got an_email that i needed to ship items .
negative	ebay stated that payment was processing .
negative	i read that monies were completed on the buyer end and it was okay to ship .
negative	i also read that if shipping done through ebay / paypal , it would come out of funds paid from sale and at a discount .
negative	long_story short , i got an_email today that my bank was rejecting attempts from paypal to withdraw funds for the shipping .
negative	i called , spoke to someone with limited command of english , and i am to understand that money will be available up to 00 days from date payment cleared .
negative	fees from ebay , fees from paypal , $_00 . 00 via paypal for shipping , payment cleared , but i won '_t get my money til god knows when .
negative	i ' m pissed .
negative	i feel_like i got screwed by ebay and paypal and i won '_t use them again .
negative	they can hold their customers money for up to 00 days ( which has cleared and is in their possession ).
negative	i guess you hold all customers funds long enough , it can add up to a pretty penny in interest .
negative	it '_s crooked , it '_s wrong and i don_'_t have to do business with them anymore and i won '_t .
negative	it was good while it lasted , but it ain '_t good anymore .
negative	it stinks !
negative	all disgusting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	could not digest anything do not buy !
negative	ups stated on their website that i had moved .
negative	the part was never delivered , there is always someone at my house .
negative	ups never delivered the part .
negative	totally disgusted .
negative	i recently bought a key for euro truck simulator 0 .
negative	the website said it was not " steam - ready ", but i discovered on the official website of euro truck devs that every version of the game was activable on steam .
negative	so when i tried to activate it , i received a nice message_saying the key was already registered by another steam user
negative	when i tried to contact the site , i received no answer at every e_- mail i sent
negative	awesome
negative	and by the way , i waited 0 hours before getting the key , although they claimed it was instant
negative	booked and paid for parking for my holiday , then the confirmation booking says they don_'_t do between 0000 and 0000 hours , but i was still able to book even_though i had put my flight details on the booking so i rang them only to be fobbed off with an automated answering message , they don_'_t want to talk to you if there is a problem they want you to email .
negative	so i emailed them , one day later still no response .
negative	they rang me after i gave this review , and said that they would be refunding the money i paid .
negative	however that was over a week ago , and still no refund has been processed through my credit_card account .
negative	its a bit worrying ,
negative	despite their service " guarantee " of delivering tickets of the same quality or better in case of ticket order problems , not only did they not give me the tickets i paid for 0 months in advance , but they just refunded my money 00 hours prior to the concert date without previous notice !
negative	and worse even , despite my repeated explanation of how these tickets were a christmas_present for my 0 year_old daughter and them still having tickets offered for sale on their website , they did not deliver on their guarantee .
negative	worse experience ever .
negative	do not recommend !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a replacement screen from screencountry . com but because i travel a lot , was not able to get around to replacing it within 0 days of arrival .
negative	when i did get around to installing , it connected perfectly and came up correctly , however once the bezel was clipped back in place , the screen displayed an irregular pattern .
negative	i reported this to screencountry and they stated that it must have been damaged in transit and as it was beyond the 0 day period the only thing they could do was apply a store credit for the shipping .
negative	needless to say , i have sourced my next replacement screen from somewhere_else ... and will not be using screen country again
negative	on our recent christmas holiday trip to cebu , philippines , we had a horrible hotel experience with absolutely no help from agoda .
negative	on the agoda website we discovered the ( deceptively marketed ) grand regency hotel and towers in cebu city .
negative	there is no mention anywhere that this facility is not affiliated with the regency hotel group or hyatt regency .
negative	it is another cheap philippine “ knock - off ” – fraud – which is so common in that country .
negative	yet , agoda does not intervene or provide warning .
negative	the following recaps our experience :
negative	after booking with agoda , i immediately discovered that we were being charged $_00 .
negative	usd per_night extra for our 00 year_old daughter , even_though the hotel ’_s policy was children under 00 stay for free .
negative	after arguing back & forth via_email , agoda finally conceded and credited my visa_card the overcharged amount .
negative	secondly , i found that asiatravel . com offered a rate totaling $_000 .
negative	usd less_than agoda .
negative	when challenged under their “ price guarantee ” program , agoda cited “ ever - so - slightly ” different verbiage in their policies .
negative	it was insulting , agoda has no “ price guarantee ”, it is just a scam .
negative	it was however my error for not shopping ( in depth ) the competition ahead of time .
negative	agoda : never again , they are deceitful .
negative	after driving for 00 hours , we arrived at the regency hotel & towers .
negative	it was immediately obvious that we had been scammed : all around poor quality , banking on the name “ regency hotel ” to draw unsuspecting customers .
negative	we arrived at the check - in counter shortly after 0pm on december 00 .
negative	the staff seemed confused with the agoda booking .
negative	they were unable to find our reservation .
negative	it took over an_hour for them to provide us a room .
negative	throughout the check - in process the defective overhead “ air con ” rained water down on us and the paperwork .
negative	never a mention of it , or word of apology from the staff for the “ rain ” or lengthy wait .
negative	check - in staff said that there was one , not two queen beds as_advertised , but they would have a bed brought in for our daughter .
negative	there was no valet parking , and the parking garage was full .
negative	we had to wait in our car , in the garage for over 00_minutes until attendants “ found ” a space .
negative	we finally got into our “ corner room suite ” at 0 : 00_pm and found no extra bed .
negative	at 00 : 00 , and after 0 phone_calls to the front_desk , still no bed .
negative	the front_desk did not answer the phone on our 0rd call to them for over 0 minutes .
negative	we just put it on speakerphone and let it ring .
negative	at 00 : 00 , housekeeping delivered a cheap foam pad and placed it on the floor calling it “ a bed ”.
negative	at 00 : 00 the it staff telephoned , wanting to come up and manually connect my laptop to the hotel ’_s lan since they offered no wireless connection .
negative	this connection procedure would remove the isp configuration we use at home .
negative	we were already in bed trying to sleep when this call came in .
negative	at this point we called the front_desk , told them we were very displeased and requested a meeting with the hotel manager in the early morning .
negative	the “ corner room suite ” was not a corner room , although it was slightly larger than a “ superior ”.
negative	there was one wall of windows and a 0 foot glass panel on the adjacent wall – behind which is an elevator shaft ( hardly a corner ).
negative	however , the room assigned was below the surrounding infrastructure and all you see are industrial plant rooms in the adjacent building .
negative	you cannot see outside of the complex whatsoever .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	what then may i ask , is the purpose of a “ corner suite ” if not for the panoramic view of the city that it supposedly affords ?
negative	the hotel restaurants only serve “ buffet style ” dining , no sit down dinner available for my wife ’_s birthday !
negative	we ordered cadillac margaritas .
negative	however , this “ upscale facility ” does not stock gran marnier .
negative	we also tried to order a simple warm drambuie for after dinner .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	they didn ’ t have a clue .
negative	no kahlua for the coffee in the morning , no mimosa for breakfast either !
negative	the “ café ” which isn ’ t a buffet style is simply a “ snack bar ” offering nothing more_than fish & chips and sandwiches .
negative	there are only 0 elevators for over 00 floors and the wait time is horrendous as the car is full when the doors open & you have to wait again , and again !
negative	the elevators offered no access to our 0th floor accommodations due to an architectural design flaw in the remodeling of the building .
negative	we had to get off on the 00th floor and take the stairs back down to the 0th floor to get to our room .
negative	this “ special birthday ” for my wife was turning into a disaster !
negative	the following_morning , december 00th , we were out of the room with luggage in our car well before 0 : 00 a . m . after a considerable wait , we spoke with the hotel manager at 0 : 00 a . m .
negative	he instructed us not to check out until they contacted agoda .
negative	at 00 : 00 , he informed me that they had made several attempts to contact agoda , but were unable to do so .
negative	he specifically stated that : “ agoda is extremely difficult to contact ”.
negative	at that point , he instructed me to contact agoda via_email and to enter urgent in the subject line .
negative	i composed a detailed email and mailed it off to agoda shortly after 00 : 00 .
negative	agoda failed to respond until after 0pm .
negative	later , agoda attempted to blame me for the delay !
negative	the one night that we did stay there was because at 00 : 00 at night it is difficult to book elsewhere !
negative	agoda claims 00 / 0 service .
negative	however , i emailed agoda 0 times after their 0pm response , asking for help in booking elsewhere .
negative	i received no reply until 00 hours_later and was forced to make other arrangements myself .
negative	as a result of agoda ’_s misrepresentation and incompetence , my family spent most of the first day of our vacation in the “ low end ” quality lobby of the “ grand regency ” .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	on my wife ’_s birthday .
negative	agoda has since refused to refund our payment .
negative	we instructed our visa_card company to cancel payment .
negative	we should be demanding compensation from agoda in addition to a full_refund !
negative	i was two mile across town and wanted to make_sure i had a room before i drove over .
negative	i searched best western and called what i thought was reservations .
negative	she quoted me best rate of $_00 . 00 the bill came to $_000 with all their charges , including $_00 . 00 booking fee which i told her better not be on there .
negative	when i got to the check in the rate should have been $_00 plus tax .
negative	they overcharged me , charged me a service fee and i could hardly understand the dialect of anyone i talked with .
negative	they are rude and very pushy .
negative	she badgered me into committing into approving the charge to my credit_card .
negative	do not use travelocity !
neutral	jeg_fik sådan set kun et tilbud på hele pakken .
neutral	et firma kunne kun tilbyde undervognsbehandling , et svarede ikke , og jeg_fik ikke yderligere tilbud .
neutral	ærgerligt , men bilen skulle jo laves
neutral	i have bought products two times .
neutral	the first time it came in a few_days .
neutral	but the second time it took 0½ week .
neutral	i was starting to think , that the product might have been stolen .
neutral	it would be nice if you could follow the dileverance .
neutral	offers misslead . deli meats counters meat allways llks dry sat 0rd june
neutral	when looking for a holiday i for my destination , think yep thats my kind of holiday then go to trip_advisor to read the reviews .
neutral	if i like what i read i book the holiday if i don_'_t i start again .
neutral	i do take some of the really bad_reviews with a pinch of salt , as there are some born moaners / whingers out in the real world
neutral	i find if what you order is from amazon themselves it arrives fairly quickly , but if it '_s from a third_party supplier it takes a lot longer usually turns up on the last date of the estimated delivery time and that is what lowers the rating in my view .
neutral	my order took a couple more days than_expected wich is not a big deal .
neutral	what bothered me is it is almost_impossible to find out the contents in the products they sell , if i am not already familiar with what i am purchasing i would have to go to another site to get what im looking for .
neutral	the system is responded quick and clear
neutral	sorry to only give 0_stars but the delivery was slow at best , if you could find a btter courier that can get the stuff out quicker for same price you would be keeping us all real happy , and for my part i would order more stuff from you
neutral	booking the trip was fast and easy based on the reviews .
neutral	we wanted a guided dolphin tour on jet skis since we were inexperienced .
neutral	when we arrived in destin we couldn_'_t find the rental office .
neutral	we asked directions and were sent to the other end of the boardwalk .
neutral	the address didn_'_t exist and when we called tripshock and found the rental booth , it had a different name .
neutral	they did take us out .
neutral	we didn_'_t see any dolphins and our guide wanted to leave us in the middle of the bay with big waves to " go off on our own ".
neutral	no .
neutral	you will stay with us .
neutral	he did and we made it back ok . we ended_up having a ton of scary fun !!
neutral	not exactly_what i was anticipating but it all worked out .
neutral	skype is very useful .
neutral	often times the calls drop .
neutral	but im happy skype app is available for smart phones .
neutral	he international rates are still not so competitive .
neutral	hope your company can do something about the international call rates .
neutral	price for part was great , however the shipping_charges for such a lightweight item ( oring ) was excessive !
neutral	i would like to do business with you but my orders are staggered as such could not avail promotional discount
neutral	unfortunately would not be doing further business due .
neutral	to inflexible approach in giving discount
neutral	thanks
neutral	i asked several months_ago for a way to reorder a card and edit the photo but there is no way to do it and nor is this company making changes to provide a easier shopping_experience .
neutral	the point of using your services is to make it as personalized as possible and the one function needed to edit an old card with the same shipping info is not available .
neutral	when calling customer_service to find out if i ' m doing something wrong , they have no explanation other than they are sorry .
neutral	this is my 0th card purchased and probably the last one .
neutral	fast at good product but a butten is missing ;(
neutral	i ordered a battery charger for a fuji finepix 000 camera , as it was clear written at the batterychampion order itself , but i have received another completely different .
neutral	after some e_- mais exchanged about a return and delivery of the correct charger procedures , which i did not agree with , batterychampion accepted my arguments , and things became solved .
neutral	anyway some small improvements could be done on those 0 areas !
neutral	ja , i still looking for same dings : over 0 week missing : timing chain for audi 0000 a0 window regulater for audi a0 0000 rear left .
neutral	please manage this .
neutral	and i like to have all me parts listest with prises in yahoo !
neutral	es war schlecht coordoniert , wir haben den mitarbeiter der uns die schlussel geben sollte nicht gefunden und tel war er nicht zu erreichen , zudem war er obwohl wir unser ankunft mıtgeteilt haben nicht informiert , 0 stunden früher da . wie abgesprochen haben die uns nicht am vereinbarten treffpunkt abgeholt wir mussten durch dan ganzen flughafen laufen , mit 0 kinder und gepack .
neutral	bei abgabe das gleiche und mussten zudem noch obwohl wir punktlich am abgabe ort gewartet haben und der mitarbeiter woanders hat der uns zu rede gehalten warum wir 00 minuten verspatet sind usw .!!!
neutral	unverschamt ...
neutral	i think the order was professionally handled , but it took nearly two_weeks to arrive .
neutral	my first key delievry was gud .
neutral	but secnd one !!!!!
neutral	i hve to provide them id and debit_card
neutral	i was very_pleased with the whole service , but dissapointed that the payment i received was nearly £_00 less_than promised !
neutral	especially as my mobile was in immaculate condition & only 0 years old !
neutral	na enkele emails lijkt ons probleem nu opgelost te zijn door toedoen van nico roosevelt
neutral	my travel agency introduced me to these_guys on my last trip to egypt .
neutral	good and courtesies people .
neutral	had a great time there .
neutral	flew with the airline recently !!!
neutral	quite happy with the services !!!
neutral	superb customer_service !!
neutral	great cabin crew !!
neutral	!
neutral	happy with the product !!
neutral	great service easy to work with them !!
neutral	!
neutral	free shipping all over the site but was charged over $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	what gives ?
neutral	beautifull costume but slow shipping , , very slow .
neutral	from ordering to delivery was 00 days !
neutral	first , my order was ' out of stock ' - which i did not know about .
neutral	then i was told delivery would be 0 - 0 days .
neutral	to save £_00 i waited two_weeks to get the same product from an alternative source .
neutral	not the best " first impression " for using " hispek " company !
neutral	sometimes when you do a search you are led to websites that do not exist or out of date , does anyone review this
neutral	after several deliveries and automatic withdrawls from our checking account , i ' m starting to notice price increases on the pet_food .
neutral	i believe i should be notified about price increases .
neutral	the primary reason i was swayed to petflow was that their prices were so much lower_than both pet_food stores in our area , now , not so much .
neutral	the bed was clean and comfy , ut everything else needed lysol wipes !
neutral	!
neutral	this is the first time that i have used bookit but i have used other travel sites .
neutral	i found the best price for the hotel that we wanted to stay in for our panama city beach vacation , booked it , and waited for a email confirmation .
neutral	i used paypal for payment and recieved their confirmation .
neutral	i then called the customer_service number and was asked for my email_address .
neutral	i gave this to the agent and she stated that the reservation did not go through and for me to go back to paypal for my refund .
neutral	i didn_'_t like this answer and stated that this was my first experience and what else could she do to correct the situation .
neutral	like a robot , she repeated that there was no reservation and to contact paypal for reimbursement .
neutral	i got off the phone with her , confirmed that paypal had indeed charged my account and called back .
neutral	this time the agent inquired of my phone_number used on the reservation and , in fact the reservation was made and she then gave me the booking number that i used to access the reservation .
neutral	i have received the email confirmation today ( monday ) from the reservation made on friday .
neutral	i was glad that i called back but was disappointed that the first agent gave false information that would have caused me to double book and double pay .
neutral	0_stars is the best that i can give with this experience .
neutral	perhaps the next one will be better .
neutral	i didn_'_t accept the loan offer but the customer_service was excellent .
neutral	they responded in a quick and timely matter and very professional .
neutral	i will try them again .
neutral	but unfortunately , not the second .
neutral	if there is a backorder of a product , they need to notify you right_away .
neutral	it had already been over a week when i finally called and i was told that there was a back order .
neutral	i like the prices and even_though shipping is a lot , i will give it one more try .....
neutral	yodel courier left parcel at front_door ( in full view of the road ) without even ringing the bell .
neutral	my husband saw him going down drive and when he asked why he hadn '_t rung bell he said " didnt think anyone was in " strange as my husbands van was in the drive with bonnet up !
neutral	no card left to say he had been either .
neutral	i was only somewhat satisfied with my experience shopping online at supplement_warehouse .
neutral	i had a difficult time checking out and since this was my first shopping_experience shopping with supplement_warehouse , i became frustrated .
neutral	i hope my shipment arrives without any difficulty .
neutral	let '_s see what happens ?
neutral	i ordered the bully_sticks and my order came quickly .
neutral	the only problem is that the sticks are about the diameter of a # 0 pencil or less .
neutral	i buy the cadet 00 inch bully_sticks from costco that are much thicker ..
neutral	if i cut them in half the price comes out to be a few cents more_than petflow .
neutral	it would be helpful if the description of the product include the dimensions of the sticks .
neutral	i ordered the bully_sticks for my 0 month old standard poodle puppy .
neutral	unfortunately , she will only be able to use them as tooth picks .
neutral	the material and the workmanship on the captain america costume was poor .
neutral	to make the outfit wearable had to spend almost as much as the costume cost .
neutral	on the site the costume looked better_than when we recieved it .
neutral	in general it was a good experience .
neutral	the website offers a lot of options and was easy to use .
neutral	the only problem was that i saved my itinerary on sunday and next_day the price went up more_than 000 dollars in less_than 00 hours .
neutral	i know that prices change from one day to another but less_than 00 hours should be honored by the company .
neutral	thanks
neutral	orlando mirabal
neutral	i ordered two separate labels for limoncello - one batch for the limoncello i make twice a year and the second batch for my daughter - in - law who is making her first batch this spring .
neutral	the labels are very nice but i thought the price was a little high for the 00 labels plus shipping : $_00 . 00 per batch which works out to $ 0 . 00 per label .
neutral	i don_'_t know if i had ordered them on the same invoice if the shipping price would have been the same for all of them or not but i do know the shipping was about 0 / 0 of the cost .
neutral	i tried to see if i could amend my first order to add the second one but it had already been processed and i was advised i would need to submit it in a separate order .
neutral	problem with the rentalcars . com in that there is no information on the reservation form that indicates that one must call the local rental_car company upon_arrival in order to be picked_up .
neutral	after waiting for 00_minutes , i had to call the 000 # and get the local # to call and alert them to pick me up .
neutral	it was a mixed experience .
neutral	the competitive rates were nice but it was a little confusing using it the first time .
neutral	i actually got locked into a hotel room for a price i wasn_'_t comfortable w_/ & could not get out of .
neutral	but the hotel was nice except for the rowdy guests across the hallway .
neutral	could not believe hotel staff did not intervene when extreme noise went into midnight hrs .
neutral	did not have continental breakfast but an expensive buffet instead so that was a minus since we were traveling w_/ teenagers .
neutral	would i stay again ?
neutral	only if it were me & the husband .
neutral	too many ads , especially the ones on vevo , you can '_t even close the ads .
neutral	you can definitely get a good hotel , rental_car or other travel - related deal from priceline .
neutral	unfortunately , the process of bidding ( name your_own price ) is painful and a crap - shoot !
neutral	the reservations are non_- refundable , non_- transferable and can '_t be canceled .
neutral	for example , you discover the actual hotel once your offer is accepted but priceline doesn_'_t tell you that the hotel is under renovation and you won '_t be able to sleep or hear yourself think due to construction !
neutral	also , there is a difference_between a hotel and a motel or inn .
neutral	priceline doesn_'_t differentiate so you think you ' re offering on a hotel with multiple floors and internal entry doors .
neutral	however , once your deal is accepted you discover you '_ve been booked at a motel located adjacent to a major road or interstate highway with exterior - entrance rooms and outdoor walkways .
neutral	this is a form of " bait and switch " misrepresentation !!
neutral	!
neutral	i don_'_t intend to let the negative aspects of priceline prevent me from taking advantage of the opportunity to land a great deal .
neutral	nevertheless , novice users should be aware of these pitfalls and be cautious .
neutral	too much hoopla . just not my fave . way too hard to uninstall . i use unthreat . i think that is one of the best .
neutral	i gave an honest assessment of my experience with homsesecurity store at first , but with my pursuit of justice i was net with a compromise by them .
neutral	customer_service decided to give some consideration for my return and considered a reduced restocking_fee of 00 %.
neutral	i feel it was a good compromise since i am willing to pay for the restocking of an item and the financial turnover a company incurs .
neutral	i feel a 00_% restocking_fee is more_than adequate compensation for the company .
neutral	therefore i feel good about them willing to make some type of concession for receiving all their merchandise in its original packaging .
neutral	twice now we have received damaged items .
neutral	customer_service is always very helpful , but as they can '_t stipulate delivery times it meant lots of extra waiting around at home ..
neutral	so my advice is to check very carefully when you receive anything , and ring them there and then if there is a problem !
neutral	there is no way to request a handicapped accessible room on priceline .
neutral	so when i use priceline for a room reservation it '_s always with a bit of apprehension because i won '_t know if it will be suitable for my wheelchair bound husband .
neutral	when we arrive at the hotel i can then ask if they have a handicapped accessible room available .
neutral	sometimes we are not so fortunate .
neutral	shame on you , priceline , in this day and age !
neutral	hotwire has this feature on their page .
neutral	the website is nice but the continue shopping process was tedious .
neutral	check out was slow because it kept flipping back and forth .
neutral	i had difficulty resuming my order .
neutral	they make a fairly decent product , but the price is just way to high .
neutral	for the same price point , you really should go elsewhere and buy a custom system .
neutral	only if you are lazy or terrible at technology should you go with bose , but then again , you know someone who can help you , you do , right ?
neutral	i ordered four led clip - on pet safety lights ( two red , two blue ).
neutral	when i opened the first blue one it would not stay lit .
neutral	the second blue on worked for two nights then it quit_working .
neutral	i have only used one red one so_far , and it is working good .
neutral	they are a big help when they work .
neutral	i have two all black , med .
neutral	sized dogs .
neutral	at night they lie on the floor , in a dark room and i and my husband have taken a couple tumbles over them .
neutral	we are senior citizens and falls are bad news .
neutral	i let them outdoors at night to have a nature call .
neutral	there are spots in the yard where they are in the shadow of our shed from the pole light .
neutral	i can '_t see them ( i think they know that ) and they will stand there and look at me .
neutral	but with those little lights i can see them .
neutral	problem solved .... except when the lights quit_working .
neutral	i would send them back to be replaced , but it would cost more to do that , than what they cost .
neutral	so , what do i do ?
neutral	send them back or order more .
neutral	i really like them , but , so_far the quality doesn_'_t make it an easy decision .
neutral	i would like to get more of them , if it were possible , but don_'_t know what to do .
neutral	da_jeg_bestilte mit komfur , bad jeg om levering / installering efter kl .
neutral	00 . 00 .
neutral	jeg_fik derefter en sms fra montør , jeg ringede og_fik at vide , at jeg kun kunne få leveret mellem kl .
neutral	0 og 00 .
neutral	hverken min mand eller jeg_har mulighed for at være hjemme i dette tidsrum da vi begge møder kl .
neutral	0 .
neutral	jeg fortalte montør , at jeg så måtte lade ordren gå tilbage .
neutral	inden jeg aflyste ordren , fandt jeg et tilsvarende tilbud hos en_anden leverandør , men klog af skade ringede jeg til firmaet for at høre hvornår på dagen de leverede .
neutral	sælger spurgte ind til hvorfor jeg_havde problem med leverringstidspunktet .
neutral	det viser sig så , at dette firma ( når_man bestiller på_nettet er samme firma som white away ) bruger samme montør .
neutral	sælger mente ikke at det kunne være rigtigt , og jeg_ville blive ringet op af en servicemedarbejder .
neutral	servicemedarbejder ringede meget hurtigt_og fortalte , at det_er fordi chauffør / montør vil være ude af københavn inden myldretidstrafikken starter !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	hvis ikke den anden sælger havde være så venlig at informere om dette havde_jeg afbestilt ordren !
neutral	!
neutral	jeg bor ikke i københavn men i tårnby .
neutral	jeg_fik en tid der hed kl .
neutral	00 , hvilket er mere tilfredsstillende .
neutral	den dag komfuret skulle leveres fik_jeg så en sms ved 0 . 00 tiden om , at mit komfur ville blive leveret idag ml .
neutral	0 og 00 , så blev jeg meget gal , ringede til montør og spurgte hvad der lige skete her , da_jeg_havde tid kl .
neutral	00 , montør ringede tilbage at der_var sket en fejl , og min levering blev kl .
neutral	00 som aftalt .
neutral	senere på formiddagen blev jeg ringet op igen , om jeg ikke_kunne være hjemme tidligere , dette svarede jeg nej til igen igen .
neutral	det_kan ikke være rigtigt , at man_ikke_kan få leveret om eftermiddagen når_man bor i københavnsområdet , vi er mange som møder tidligt på arbejde , og ikke har nogen til at lukke op ml .
neutral	0 og 00 .
neutral	white away må da gerne levere ml .
neutral	0 og 0 om morgenen istedet .
neutral	med henvisning til ovennævnte smørre må der kunne findes en bedre løsning på leveringstider , eller også at der installeres om lørdagen også .
neutral	jeg imødeser gerne jeres kommentarer til ovennævnte .

neutral	i have order a bout a month a go a " jazz thermostatic designer stainless steel shower panel tower system " i have received damaged due to poor packing .
neutral	i have called them to cancel my order and return the damged items . they told me they notify the hew york office .
neutral	as of now no news we are almost done with the project still no new splease look into this
neutral	practical and useful .
neutral	i am very satisfied with it as a supplement to dictionaries in book form , but it cannot stand alone .
neutral	some classes in web programing package are very out of date .
neutral	one course is copyrighted 0000 and another is from like 0000 .
neutral	they talk about things like netscape and webtv that no_longer exsist .
neutral	i am glad i did not pay full price for course package and would probably never buy another one from this company .
neutral	i received my order on time was kept up to date along the way service was good .
neutral	my only gripe is the carriage charge it '_s way over the top and puts the price up to what you would pay at wickes etc
neutral	trying too many " tricks " these days
neutral	i order from blt quite often ( and will probably continue to do so ), but increasingly frustrated that some bulbs ( particularly led ) often arrive different to that specified .
neutral	for example " kosnic led classic shape 0 watt bayonet cap warm white ( 00w alternative )".
neutral	website says 000 lumens , colour 0000k .
neutral	actual bulb says 000 lumens , colour 0000k .
neutral	tiresome to have to keep notifying customer_services and returning items .
neutral	the hotel we booked with priceline , turned_out to be a clean room , with a great little complementary breakfast !
neutral	!
neutral	i need a return lable .
neutral	order pre_- xmas , but took until 0nd week of jan before delivery finally received .
neutral	had to tel and chase on 0 separate occasions .
neutral	very pedantic on the scanned prescription not being acceptable because a small sliver not shown .
neutral	price competitive but too much hassle for just for cat medicine .
neutral	did ' nt have both medication tablets required either
neutral	i can '_t tell , as often when i buy a e gift_card , it comes within hours ... so i am still_waiting
neutral	i secured a deal online for $_00 and when i was first quoted the price at the desk when i was about to sign and get my car , the price was $_000 !
neutral	i said , " wait a minute ... why is it so much ?"
neutral	the agent had told me i " qualified " for an upgrade to a larger car .
neutral	i assumed that meant without charge , but that wasn_'_t the case !
neutral	very confusing !
neutral	isn_'_t it the case that everyone " qualifies " for an upgrade if they are willing to pay over $_000 more ?
neutral	then there '_s the pressure to insure it , to get a tolltag , to buy a full tank of gas , etc .
neutral	you just have to be strong and say no to all those things if you want to get the deal you '_ve already secured online .
neutral	i suppose all the companies do it , it '_s just frustrating .
neutral	i was talked into getting a tolltag , but never used it .
neutral	however , they did refund me that money , so that was good .
neutral	i ended_up paying about $_00 over what i was quoted online .
neutral	it would be nice , if once , the price quoted was the price you pay .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	to be asked to review a review can be annoying to say the least ..
neutral	i appreciate that you like data but repeating yourself can be tedious to say the least ...
neutral	we are in the booking assumes that there is audio guide with different languages .
neutral	unfortunately , that was not so :-(( we have used the big bus in london , san_francisco , dubai and cape town there was audio guide on board :-)) the bus stops in san_francisco would have to be marked better .
neutral	there was no indications available to the bus stops .
neutral	with audio guide , it is very much recommended and we will use it again .
neutral	bestilte 0 stk tøj under udsalget .
neutral	dette blev tilsendt ret hurtigt , hvilket var glædeligt men en_del kom i helt forkert størrelse ( fejl fra solo ).
neutral	en andel del var forkert i str til mig ( ærmer udover hænderne ) sidste del passede perfekt , så den kom i klædeskabet .
neutral	for at returnere koster det jo portoen , hvilket så ødelægger indkøbet , så_jeg tog til nærmeste butik for at annullere købet .
neutral	desværre kan man_ikke få penge retur , men byt til andet i butikken .
neutral	de fortalte at jeg var velkommen til at sende til jylland for at kunne få mine penge retur .. hvilket jo er dårlig forretning for mig .
neutral	så_jeg fandt med besvær , andet tøj istedetfor .
neutral	så derfor herfra : glæd dig ikke for tidligt , og brug ikke for mange penge , medmindre du gider betale portoen , for at få evt .
neutral	penge retur .
neutral	du kan selvfølgelig også håbe alt passer perfekt og de husker at sende de str .
neutral	som du bestiller .
neutral	i like the hotel prices but priceline . com will not refund your insurance for days that you do not use it .
neutral	i brought my car back early since i had bought a new car , and the hertz place refunded my money for the car and priceline . com kept the insurance payment for the 0 additional days that i did not use the car !
neutral	that is very scam like and would never use priceline . com '_s insurance again !!
neutral	!
neutral	card arrived second class mail after requesting chosen despatch date 0 days earlier and meant having to buy an off the shelf card instead as birthday had passed .
neutral	this is the first time i have not received a card when mailed first_class .
neutral	cardtown made poor attempt at recovery .. 0 days to reply and then asked for copy of envelope and order number so not really on top of customer_service .
neutral	lots of other similar companies doing " what it says on the label "..
neutral	i will consider my options carefully .
neutral	took 0 0 / 0 hours to get our vehicle because they said one of the car washers broke .
neutral	that would have been better accepted if the staff would have told everyone in line what was going on .
neutral	instead , everyone in line found out through hearsay .
neutral	staff was overloaded .
neutral	they did a good job of keeping their cool but , in the meantime , customers had to wait a long time for their vehicles .
neutral	once we got ours , we loved it !!!
neutral	the vehicle was brand_new and a lot of fun to drive for the week .
neutral	i decided to try this site because they were offering the hotel i wanted at $_00 cheaper per_night .
neutral	i saw that they charge $_00 for cancellation_fee , but i felt pretty sure of my dates , so i thought i ' d take the chance .
neutral	as soon as i booked , my daughter asked if we could leave on tuesday instead of monday .
neutral	i was just going to shift the trip one day over and stay the same amount of nights .
neutral	i tried to modify my reservation , but the site wanted to charge me the cancellation_fee , even for that slight modification .
neutral	i sent an_email asking about it to customer care and they responded quickly with a call of apology but the person was unable to help me .
neutral	after a second call , another apology call told me to call customer_service or go to the members lounge online and it would not charge me for the modification .
neutral	i went to the members lounge and it was still charging me $_00 to change the day .
neutral	my question was , why do they bother to have someone call me to apologize who doesn_'_t actually work in customer_service and can '_t help me resolve my issue .
neutral	they just told me that they apologized for my issue and go on the site or call customer_service .
neutral	it was a lot of time spent for no result .
neutral	but it was slightly cheaper , so that '_s good if you are absolutely sure you won '_t need to modify your reservation at all .
neutral	in hindsight , it would have been better to pay a little more and get the free cancellation that the other_sites offered .
neutral	i always get lost when i use ebay !
neutral	!
neutral	wowcher is amazing but everything iv ordered by the time it actually gets here i don_'_t need it or have bought it all ready because iv needed it 0 * quality 0 delivery time
neutral	i wanted a switch for a heatstore aqua esprit but could find no listing for it on shower_doctor .
neutral	i sent a request but they came back with a completely different one which i could see was wrong .
neutral	i had stumbled_upon a picture of the one i wanted under a different name in an earlier search so i ordered it and it looks just the ticket .
neutral	the moral is shower doctors info is not necessarily reliable .
neutral	very speedy_delivery .
neutral	when we initially made the reservation , the prices went up during the process .
neutral	then when we got to the counter the rental company didn_'_t have our reservation .
neutral	thankfully we had printed it up before we left , so they matched the rate .
neutral	we didn_'_t get the car we wanted however .
neutral	there needs to be a section added to the website to explain the process for new passport applicants .
neutral	it is quite different than for those renewing their passport .
neutral	someone applying for a new passport needs to make appointment at the post_office or one of the approved locations for getting a passport .
neutral	the promo needs to be changed to show passport renewal and not new passport .
neutral	the demo seems to indicate one needs only to mail the information in , which is incorrect .
neutral	great product - but communication was poor .
neutral	i specifically requested that we negotiate a delivery date to suit both parties as i would have to arrange time off from work .
neutral	however , this didn_'_t happen and all i received was next_day notice of delivery .
neutral	i am still resolving an issue with a part that arrived damaged .
neutral	the part had not been properly packed for shipping and arrived damaged .
neutral	the company responded to a return request in a timely_manner and sent a return_label with instructions .
neutral	i am still in the process of returning the item for refund & replacement therefore i cannot completely review the company at this point .
neutral	i have never had a dell computer that lasted longer than 00 mos !
neutral	great while it lasts but that isn_'_t very long
neutral	looks just exactly like the photos - but the wig pops off the back of my daughter '_s normal sized head ( she wears normal hat sizes ) we are kind if in a panic to find a suitable replacement that will fit .
neutral	shipping was on time - issue is strictly a fit issue .
neutral	our daughter '_s brand_new netbook screen was damaged and needed to be replaced .
neutral	we took it to bestbuy they wanted to charge $_000 . 00 for parts and labor to repair it .
neutral	i decided to shop around online for a new screen and replace it myself laptopscreen . com '_s prices were the best the only problem the new screen have to dead pickles and the laptopscreen don_’ t cover shipping so it is cheaper to buy new one ( the shipping is more and half of the price of the screen ).
neutral	i don_’ t think the parts have been tested before they are shipped
neutral	my real problem with costco is the fact that they just didn_'_t have the products i wanted .
neutral	i have a specific preference for certain brands and costco just didn_'_t carry them .
neutral	while i did have the opportunity to get some new brands , and they did have some meat products i liked , but it wasn_'_t enough to prompt me to return after the first year .
neutral	always try and check with hotel directly .
neutral	agoda may say " only 0 room left " but plenty on site at better rate .
neutral	in khoa sok the room was over priced for value plus we couldn_'_t check out one day early .
neutral	lost entire room price .
neutral	plus original tree house room smelled so bad we had to move .
neutral	no discount .
neutral	just beware .
neutral	debi
neutral	priceline was a good way to look at all the different hotels around and find the best deal .
neutral	very surprised when putting the order through that there would be an ' additional £ 0 . 00 postage , mate !'
neutral	only chose this company because it showed_up on amazon as being the lowest cost , with specifically no postage charge .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	extensive shopping for a 0 - day long car_rental in sydney brought me to rentalcars . com .
neutral	the price and terms of the rental seemed fine , and the reservation process seemed simple enough .
neutral	and then ... first the email confirmation of the reservation never arrived in my email .
neutral	easy enough to get around that , when i logged back in to find the car pickup location .
neutral	but then when i went to the reservation counter in sydney airport , i found there would be aus $_000 extra in charges .
neutral	after a transcontinental plane flight , with an impatient and tired family waiting , i foolishly didn_'_t put up a fuss ( since europecar is not to blame ).
neutral	instead spent the next 0 days feeling resentful about how i ' d been misled .
neutral	rentalcars . com may very well have had some caveats buried in the fine_print , but they fell short of expectations by not making clear the true full cost of a car_rental .
neutral	the quality of the vehicle was the only redeeming quality , but again , that '_s on europecar , not rentalcars . com .
neutral	some good deals but it took 0 days before my order shipped .
neutral	not bad , but not great , guess real price was inflated to make discounted price look good , definately not worth the before price at all , ours was delivered on a pallet and all contents where wet and all box '_s waterlogged , driver didnt want to hang about whilst we checked it so we had to sign unchecked , so we have a garage full of soggy cardboard and a bloody pallet i don_'_t want and now have to get_rid of , everything had to be immediately removed from packaging as water logged , very dissapointed with delivery at the price we was charged for it .
neutral	summary :- low quality suite , poorly assembled with low quality fittings , toilet seat went straight in the recyling bin , would not use again or recommend .
neutral	glasses sent to billing_address rather_than delivery address .
neutral	bit of a pain .
neutral	rented from enterprise because i have a membership card , not sure what it does because it did nothing for me .
neutral	the car was fine but on the return , the cost was over $_000 from the quoted price .
neutral	there were extra add ons and taxes not quoted .
neutral	i would rather have the whole price up front so i could decide my self for less days or other rental_car options .
neutral	best prices but sometimes i get expired product without fore warning .
neutral	about three_weeks_ago i ordered a serpent belt and an a /_c hose the hose was listed for 00 . 00 dollars i thought that was really cheap for the hose , well it was i got an_email_saying that the hose was out of stock so the next_day i went on and they had the hose and now it was 00 . 00 dollars .
neutral	i think they should have honored the price listed or at_least told me that the price was wrong cuz i really needed the hose and would have payed the extra money to get it .
neutral	what they did was slow the whole_process down and made me wait the extra deliervy time .
neutral	dollar rental_car , front_desk was friendly and well versed on rental_car policies .
neutral	three issues , i had purchased insurance on line for the rental based on rental . com website for $_00 . 00 only to be advised by rental agent that insurance was not adequate and spend and additional $_00 . 00 .
neutral	roadside assistance was $ 0 . 00 per day and i originally booked a ford taurus but wound up with a ford_focus a smaller car but was advised that they could not change my rate .
neutral	what '_s up with that !
neutral	my $_00 rental_car came up to $_000 for 0 days with a $_000 deposit .
neutral	dollar rental_car should be called a few hundred dollar rental care .
neutral	the delivery service and helpfulness is great .
neutral	goods arrived as_described and promptly .
neutral	my problem is really of my own making .
neutral	having placed a couple of orders i noticed on an_email they offered me 00_%_discount on subsequent purchases .
neutral	i immediately emailed them rather_than try and cancel the order .
neutral	they replied that they were unable to apply the discount to my order retrospectively - why not ?
neutral	this is very disappointing customer_service .
neutral	in comparison my experience with another purchase at the same time from a different company - the day after i ordered an item they reduced it '_s price .
neutral	i sent an_email query .
neutral	they replied promptly and refunded the difference .
neutral	unfortunately , overboard don_'_t sell light bulbs

neutral	the car i was expecting was a crown vicoria , we had a lot of people and luggage .
neutral	the seven hundred mile drive would have been a lot more comfortable in that car .
neutral	a nissan maxima is not a " similiar car " in size to the crown vic .
neutral	the car had been used by a cigar smoker and always had an odor to it .
neutral	fortunately we had the windows down most of the tme as the weather was very good .
neutral	this was surprising as it was " non_- smoking " hertz rental and was not fault of rentalcars .
neutral	the cost savings and ease of using rentalcars makes them a stand by for all my reservation needs .
neutral	my only glitch with the reservation is when i attached it to my hertz gold membership the cost went up over $ 0 , 000 .
neutral	for the rental .
neutral	they fixed it at the location of rental , the staff was very helpful , but it certainly added to my stress level .
neutral	the boxed package was left outside in the pouring rain .
neutral	the package had either been crushed on a sharp object , been dropped , or had something dropped on it .
neutral	i say this because both packing boxes had holes in , and the guitars hard case also had a corresponding hole in it ....... thankfully , the guitar was saved from damage .
neutral	to return the damaged case , i know have to take a day off work to wait in all day for a courier to take the case back .
neutral	after having payed extra costs at check in desk , due to wrong info about deadline for printing out boarding pass , bravo fly refunded the costs + gave me discount code .
neutral	this was handled by email and copies of receipts after the incident .
neutral	this underlines how important it is to keep every receipt and papers from all_kinds of incidents .
neutral	it also reminds one of what ever the reason is , pay and proceed , get receipt , ( and don ´ t risking loosing your flight and temper ).
neutral	back home , scan & send in everything by email to customer desk and demand refund on resonable grounds .
neutral	do not forget to report eventual lost bagage directly at bagage desk and demand a copy of report .
neutral	also the staff att airlines check in desks has strict orders and very seldom can cancel extra fees .
neutral	better take them if yoy can , and arrange for refund afterwise .
neutral	bravo fly has an_email form under customar service , which is a better way of explaining your case than calling expensive customar service charge phone numbers like thoose of bravo fly & ryan air .
neutral	women '_s xl actually fit like a medium .
neutral	and it shrunk -- even when washed in cold water and dried on line .
neutral	daughter very disappointed she could not wear shirt and i could not afford to replace it .
neutral	the old m & s quality is definitely not the same as the old days , come on bring back good value for money markies !
neutral	the order arrived_promptly and i was pleased but the timers fell off all the time and i do mean all the time , they didn_'_t stay up for more_than a minute
neutral	i ordered a warfedale microphone but was supplied wiuth a numark microphone without anyone calling to check if this was ok .
neutral	even the delivery note showed it to be a wharfedale .
neutral	when i phoned up i was told that the wharfedale was no_longer available and a substitute was sent .
neutral	sorry but i can ` t wear it .
neutral	i tried washing it in conditioner but as soon as i put it on , i `_m uncomfortable .
neutral	i `_m thinking maybe i can stitch a lining into it somehow ?
neutral	delivery was great .
neutral	no_problems there .
neutral	sizing was exact too
neutral	the product arrived earlier_than_expected and i was out at the time of delivery .
neutral	the delivery person simply dropped the parcel over the garden gate ( 0 ' tall ) and i found it when i opened the gate from the outside and it pushed against the parcel .
neutral	a note had been pushed through the letterbox stating that the parcel had been left ' according to your instructions ', though i don_'_t recall asking them to drop it over the gate !
neutral	no apparent damage to the product though , which was a gift for someone .
neutral	i '_ve not had any feedback from the recipient of the gift so i don_'_t know if it is working ( it was a bird '_s nesting box with camera ).
neutral	gives an idea , but comments far too prone to manipulation both by devious users and also by some of the companies being reviewed .
neutral	frento ..... is wonderful hotel .... don_'_t try to another hotel before you it .
neutral	take to long to deliver , and no way of contacting them , when they finally showed_up , the color of the frames were darker than i saw on webite , also the tint is to dark , so glasses have been thrown out .
neutral	in future will pay extra and get them done locally , that way i can see before i pay !!!
neutral	!
neutral	revised review :
neutral	having lost the first diamond , i bought another .
neutral	again it arrived very quickly .
neutral	they were very helpful throughout and have supplied a strnger chain free of charge .
neutral	moral : insure jewellery !
neutral	revised review : having got the replaced chain back it then broke 0 days_later .
neutral	this time we were not so lucky - the diamond pendant is lost .
neutral	we have looked_everywhere .
neutral	i cannot believe that these chains are so weak .
neutral	old review , 0_stars :
neutral	i spent a long time trying lots of diamond sites .
neutral	all the sliders for size , cut , colour etc were an education .
neutral	so i got the best i could for the money and it seemed a little_bit cheaper_than elsewhere .
neutral	ordered the chain and pendant and it arrived within a few_days .
neutral	it was a couple of weeks before i actually gave the present .
neutral	00 days_later the chain broke .
neutral	i was worried that as so much time had passed they might have got nasty , but the didn_'_t .
neutral	i sent the chain back which they replaced with what i am told is a slightly thicker chain !
neutral	and it again happened within a couple of days .
neutral	is it a real diamond with real gold ?
neutral	i have no idea .
neutral	it comes with a certificate and you just have to hope that the site certification means something .
neutral	cheaper pet_food
neutral	a little expensive
neutral	fair quality
neutral	worth the call
neutral	i booked with servicing_stop because of what appeared to be a good overall cost for service and mot , much_cheaper_than with the main dealer .
neutral	the car was also collected and delivered by a local_garage , which saved me a lot of hassle .
neutral	however , after completion of the work , a rather pushy operative from servicing_stop told me that the car had failed the mot because of headlight alignment (" 000_% failure these days "), and that the extra cost would be £_00 for this necessary repair .
neutral	he also " proposed " a series of other jobs , e . g .
neutral	spark plug replacement , brake fluid replacement , pollen filter replacements , etc , all at apparently high cost .
neutral	i agreed to the headlight charge because i needed the car the same evening and required an mot pass .
neutral	i then managed to speak directly to the garage who said that they had charged only 0 . 0 hour (£ 0 ) for the headlight readjustment , and had in fact already done this .
neutral	i then went back to servicing_stop who ' kindly ' reduced the charge from £_00 to £_00 !
neutral	i may have landed the garage in it as a result , but this is clearly an attempt by servicing_stop to bump up prices in an environment where people may feel pressured to agree .
neutral	so i am still happy with their ( final ) overall cost , but will deal directly with the garage in the future .
neutral	beware the call operators !
neutral	i ' m not always on facebook because it is not user_friendly at all .
neutral	i guess the reason people like the site is just because of social networking .
neutral	it is very cumbersome to use and hard to tell what and where i need to be to find things people have sent me .
neutral	i use it just because others do .
neutral	it would be great if it was more user_friendly .
neutral	my daughters ipod had a cracked_screen so i contacted squaretrade .
neutral	got my confirmation right_away along with a ups return_label .
neutral	excellent service and very fast .
neutral	my daughter dropped the package off at ups on a friday , got a very quick response saying that the package was received and being shipped to be fixed .
neutral	once again , the communication was great .
neutral	got home from work today , tuesday and the ipod was waiting on the table .
neutral	talk about very fast service .
neutral	i mean four days and the screen was fixed .
neutral	now here is where the problem popped up .
neutral	my daughter says that all of her aps , music , pictures etc ... had been erased and the shop where the ipod was fixed was now the screen name .
neutral	no_longer my daughters name or any of her information inside of teh device .
neutral	this is the second time we have had the screen fixed and the first time all of the information was erased , just for replacing a cracked_screen .
neutral	to me , it seems like overkill to have to erase everything to replace a screen .
neutral	i know , it '_s not squaretrades fault for the erased information and aps but wth ?
neutral	buying these top end products you would expect the fragrances to last longer than they do , and i think that maybe the perfume content has been reduced , for example the black pepper body wash used to last nearly all day but now i ' m lucky if i can still smell it at lunchtime .
neutral	hair products are very dissapointing and don_'_t smell as good as hotel freebies .
neutral	hand wash products are much_better but at £_00 each they should be .
neutral	bought a bath tap which looks great but at £_00 . 00 for p_& p you can se where they are making their margins !
neutral	i like it but my wife doesn_'_t .
neutral	to be fair , the description on the web_site is limited with no details of the width ........ which is very slim , or the fact that although the branches are realistic plastic , there is also cheap looking tinselly branches filling it out ........ so it was a gamble buying it .
neutral	it '_s easy to put up and looks good in its pot but isn_'_t quite what we were expecting
neutral	if a hotel has any surcharges , such as resort_fee , wireless internet charges , parking fees , etc then after priceline says your price has been accepted they need to say something like : the hotel that accepted your price has a $_00 . 00 / day resort_fee , or a $ 0 . 00 / day wireless fee , or ... do you still wish to purchase this hotel at x - dollars / night ?
neutral	i know there is the fine_print , but nobody expects more_than a few dollars for any fees .
neutral	i wasn_'_t very happy when we were charged an extra $_000 + for the 0 days we stayed at our hotel .
neutral	we have used priceline several_times but only for 0 - 0 nights , and had never had this issue before .
neutral	it didn_'_t begin well with a rather unhelpful telephone conversation with an operator who refused to tell me all the technical questions she was going to ask me about my windscreen even_though i explained that i would have to go out and walk down the road in the rain to check each time i didn_'_t know the answer .
neutral	i was also surprised that a new windscreen could not be fitted for a week , which left me with no car if it was raining as the windscreen wipers could not be used over the cracks .
neutral	however the fitter was punctual , charming and did a great job in the time he said it would take and of course that was the main thing .
neutral	this is my second time purchasing something from this website .
neutral	the first time didn_'_t go so good , so maybe this time i will receive my items .
neutral	la commande est très bien mais trop d ' attente pour savoir quand recevoir le colis , on nous dit 0jours d ' autre s dise 0 jours avant l ' envois mais au résultat on ne sais pas quand il nous livre sauf si on passe sont tant a leur téléphoner bonjours la facture de téléphone pour le numéro 00 .
neutral	ordering is easy and straight_forward .
neutral	prices a little high , but good .
neutral	i was quoyed free shipping for over $_000 ordered and did not get the credit later when buying ?????.
neutral	was a little disappointed .
neutral	thanks , john southwick
neutral	although fb allows me to stay in touch with or find old friends , i really don_'_t like the new format .
neutral	i am also seriously concerned with the lack of privacy with which fb treats my info ,
neutral	i find amazon '_s book selection very good and the prices great , particularly if you buy used books .
neutral	most other products can be found cheaper on other_sites .
neutral	since the advent of the icloud , and ios 0 . 0 , everything relating to my iphone , ipad , and itunes has slowed down dramatically !
neutral	just getting itunes to launch and play music ( neither tethered or syncing via wifi ), is a much slower process .
neutral	very antiquated .
neutral	ordered t shirts all were to be xxxl one t shirt was a small there was no packing_slip , nor info on how to return the wrong item
neutral	don_'_t know if i should have to pay postage for the return
neutral	if it were not for the quality product i would not purchase .
neutral	customer_service is difficult at best .
neutral	restocking_fee when product does not fit !
neutral	that is ridiculous
neutral	website has no option for other than standard ground delivery .
neutral	no overnight it product needed immediately .
neutral	associated stores should give them more product more variety yourself .
neutral	most stores are limited in what they have to offer making going to website more important .
neutral	yet the customer_service working directly with your company is difficult .
neutral	little phone service when attempting to contact directly .
neutral	when i have gotten someone i get a lot of i don_'_t know .
neutral	email reply was also slow and a bit rough .
neutral	finally , sizing charts need work .
neutral	according to you horse blanket chart , my horse needed a 00 .
neutral	when i received the blanket ... way too big .
neutral	delivery is slow .
neutral	took over a week on separate occasions .
neutral	so as i stated in the initial subject line if it were not for the quality of your products i would purchase elsewhere , at_least in the usa .
neutral	i nearly didn_'_t upgrade with you , buymobilephones !
neutral	on my first contact with one of your staff , i was told that i had a credit bar with t - mobile , he couldn_'_t help me and i should contact t - mobile to get an ' agreement number '.
neutral	i waited 00_mins to get throughout t - mobile only to find out there was no such problem and in fact my credit history with them was excellent .
neutral	i then called you back with simultaneously having t - mobile listening in ( 0 phones ).
neutral	your next rep was completely different and very apologetic for what had gone before .
neutral	he quickly completed my order , despite an_hour of my time wasted .
neutral	you very nearly lost a faithful customer !
neutral	bernard brooks
neutral	i want to be able to see the person '_s name the card is sent to and get a tracking_number to see when the order is being delivered .
neutral	great product otherwise .
neutral	i ordered 00 packets of light blue card .
neutral	when the order arrived 0 packet was blue and 00 packets were green .
neutral	i rang customer_service and was given an_apology and told that incorrect card would be collected and replacement delivered .
neutral	the following_day the driver arrived to collect green card and left another 00 packets of green card .
neutral	i rang again and was told that it was probably incorrect items on the shelves so she had asked for a full stock check to be done .
neutral	she rang later in the day to say that it was as she said and that in fact there were only 00 packets of blue which would be sent off that day with the remainder to follow the following week .
neutral	the following_day 00 packets of liliac card arrived .
neutral	i rang again and was given an_apology and told that they would look into the problem .
neutral	she rang back later in the day to say that in fact they have no stock of blue .
neutral	she would ring me back to say when the new stock would arrive .
neutral	she rang on the following_monday to say that my order would be delivered the following_day .
neutral	tueday arrived and went , then wednesday with no delivery .
neutral	i rang again to be told that there had been a problem with deliver of new stock and that replacement would not now arrive until 00th november .
neutral	i pointed_out that my patience was now running out .
neutral	i suggested that perhaps someone in the company was totally incompetent and asked what had happened to the 00 packets which were there when the stock check had been done .
neutral	she was unable to give any explanation for this .
neutral	i said that i was now desperate for the card .
neutral	she said that they had plenty of stock of pale blue in another brand and would send that instead .
neutral	i agreed to this .
neutral	this time my order was delivered as_promised followed by an_email invoice for an additional_charge for the alternative brand .
neutral	i rang back and suggested that i would be ignoring the invoice and perhaps she would be able to deal with it .
neutral	i was not offered any compensation for all my trouble .
neutral	while i am very happy with the blue card i feel very disappointed that the delivery process was such a sequence of basic errors which the customer_service department seemed unable to get to grips with even when they told me on 0 occasions that the issue had been escalated to a higher level .
neutral	it took three_times to finally place the order .
neutral	please mark a field as required , if it is .
neutral	i won '_t be back as there are just too many charges .
neutral	expensive and they can not do any faster then yourself and had no help
neutral	aufgrund der mangelhaften beschreibung brauchten wir viel zeit und schweiss am flughafen nizza , bis wird endlich den autovermieter fanden .
neutral	alles ein bisschen umständlich .
neutral	they had some good offers with guaranteed upgrade .
neutral	reservation process is complicated when you have special requests .
neutral	when i reported my disapointment on a hotel in miami i got no reaction or feedback .
neutral	i will not use this service anymore
neutral	well ......... i '_ve been taking it for a month , working out and watching what i eat and have not lost one pound ... that '_s $_00 i '_ll never see again .
neutral	but pure health did deliver on time but the poduct dosn '_t work .
neutral	: ( dr . oz needs to stop pushing all of this stuff ..........
neutral	while this did a good job with the disabling and told me of many faults it fixed ( i didn_'_t know i had ) so seems to have done me a great service ; however it did not fix the problem i had that i downloaded it to do .
neutral	i have to get in a computer guy to fix that one still .
neutral	so i still can '_t use or access microsoft office or use web_site email addresses .
neutral	comment on the web_site ~ it doesn_'_t tell you the currency you purchase in until after you have committed to buy , and it doesn_'_t tell you how long this is mine to use ~ is it a yearly subscription , is it mine to keep ?
neutral	i don_'_t know .
neutral	i wanted to chose 0 and a half stars , but i had to go in whole stars , so upped it to three
neutral	good selection of products with decent prices .
neutral	be careful with coupon codes however , because the site will accept a code with your order , but then later will void it and charge you the full price !
neutral	i '_ve given 0_stars because more times than not my package arrives on time .
neutral	what i don_'_t like is paying for fedex services and then finding out it '_s been handed off to the usps early in the delivery chain in a program they call " smart post ."
neutral	fedex website says the package has been in the city i live in for 0 days now but still has not been delivered !
neutral	in what world is that considered smart ?
neutral	oh_yeah , they make a boatload of money while actually doing nothing , pretty smart ... hey ups ....
neutral	the price for my hyundai santa fe was excellent but the lack of communication from the time i submitted my order to when i received my package was disappointing .
neutral	no e_- mail confirming my order or tracking_info .
neutral	i wasn_'_t sure if the order had worked but then the mirror showed_up .
neutral	i would order from again , but would recommend they improve their communication with customers .
neutral	the order was for marmox insulation / backing ( 00mm ) boards , which are semi - rigid , but come in a box of 0 .
neutral	delivery was within 00 hours .
neutral	however , the box of boards is marked " do not drop onto corners or edges ", but this had obviously been ignored as there was both edge - damage ( in several places ) and damage to the face of the boards .
neutral	because the box was large , heavy , and on the doorstep , the contents could not be examined at the point of delivery .
neutral	this was mentioned to the delivery man who said that he was unaware that anything untoward had happened to the package , and that i should sign his electronic receipt " contents not examined " - which i did .
neutral	i also sent an e_- mail to tile fix direct ( via their web - site form ) explaining the situation to which , 00 days_later , i have had no response .
neutral	examination of the contents reveals that there is damage to 0 of the 0 boards in the box .
neutral	the food was as expected both very special and very good .
neutral	the wines were so so and not as i expected e . g .
neutral	not always at perfect serving temperature .
neutral	and the service was honestly too caught up in their own hipness hurrying through the course descriptions in broken english and literally running off oftentimes overhearing the questions we had .
neutral	i can see how they are still a ways of the third star ,,,
neutral	i made a reservation in centro sharkah for one night and mony was deducted as shown below :
neutral	a purchase of eur 00 . 00 at olotels . com on 00 / 00 / 0000 at 00 : 00 : 00 sa time on card ending with 0000 limit remaining is sr 00000 . 00
neutral	but unfortunately no confirmation was recieved .
neutral	i urgently need your help to send me the confirmation to my :
neutral	email : waleed . ameen @ aramco . com
neutral	and also send confirmation to centro sharjah
neutral	while they used to be known for great selection and prices , it doesn_'_t seem to be the case any more .
neutral	perhaps my expectations have risen as i '_ve gotten older , but it really seems like there isn_'_t much difference_between them and walmart or sears these days .
neutral	prices are ok , not great .
neutral	staff seems a little young and inexperienced .
neutral	i admit i shop here but not by default .
neutral	if i can wait , i buy online .
neutral	if i ' m willing to drive , i ' d much rather go to fry '_s .
neutral	fry '_s has a far better selection and more knowledgeable staff .
neutral	i would only go to best buy if i wanted something today and didn_'_t want to drive for it .
neutral	i just don_'_t know about this tweet thing , seems a bit too short .
neutral	priceline tooked care of my booking in laughlin but they need to do more researh on the hotel casino i stayed at the river palms .
neutral	the people were rude i had an emergency and had to leave one day early they would not work with me . priceline put there name representing this hotel . yes i would use pricline again but i would also shop around .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	sent me the wrong shoe as they had ran out of the one i ordered ,
neutral	if i wanted another shoe i would have asked for them .
neutral	i then had to travel 0 miles to post them back .
neutral	to top it off i had to phone them to get my postage refunded .
neutral	i '_ll admit i was expecting a better quality cup , one that would at_least keep my coffee hot .
neutral	i am very happy with the size and the pictures , but i think the price was a bit too high for the less - than - excellent quality of the cup .
neutral	i will , however , be back to check out more items and services .
neutral	let me begin by stating that i use priceline frequently to book rooms when traveling , and have gotten some very good rooms at very good prices , including upgrades from 0 - star bids to 0 - star rooms .
neutral	i '_ve only been_disappointed a few_times .
neutral	my concern , however , is that priceline '_s star ratings are overrated , influenced either by hotel chain names , or possibly as the result of payments from those properties .
neutral	a little more transparency might be helpful .
neutral	here '_s my real concern :
neutral	priceline and other hotel booking services need to do a much_better job of disclosing hotel added fees for parking and internet access , which can add $_00 -$ 00 per_night or more .
neutral	travelers to san_diego or san_francisco need to know how much each property charges for parking ($ 00 to $_00 per day for self - parking , higher perhaps for valet ) and internet access ($ 0 . 00 to 00 . 00 per day ).
neutral	why ?
neutral	knowing these charges in advance can help lead folks to properties that either don_'_t charge these fees , have lower fees , or offset these fees with breakfast or other amenities .
neutral	this is especially true when using the " name your_own price " bidding_process .
neutral	additionally , there should be some kind of objective measure of a property '_s " star_rating ".
neutral	a " name_brand " hotel that is rated 0 . 0_stars , but whose rooms are no bigger or no better appointed than a 0 star comfort inn does not deserve a 0 . 0 star_rating based on name alone when it does not offer free internet access or free breakfast , which i can get at comfort inn , best western , and holiday_inn express .
neutral	my most recent priceline booking using the " name your_own price " resulted in a two night stay in san_diego that ended_up being $_00 . 00 more_than i paid to priceline , thanks to parking and internet fees , and i had to buy breakfast off site on top of that .
neutral	i could have booked any of a number of other properties in the same general area that might have charged for parking , but had an equivalent - sized room , and enjoyed free internet and breakfast .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	and paid less total by booking directly with the hotels .
neutral	i ' m just saying .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	my dog is a very picky eater she_loves the duck breast and chicken breast treats , but the chicken wrap sweet potato she hasn '_t eaten yet . fair value on treats but the shipping takes to long . i would give more stars when shipping or price for shipping improves for shipping
neutral	have ordered from this site a couple of times .
neutral	clothes bit hit and miss and sizes very small .
neutral	tried to send something back but no response then by time weekend had gone refund period had passed .
neutral	i use 0 other_sites , and althougt the items i purchased today were cheaper , the shipping negated alot of the savings .
neutral	if your company is so big , you should be able to negoticate better shipping rates .
neutral	will likely use your business again .
neutral	the website is easy to navigate and i saw a 0ft artificial xmas tree which is not an easy size to find .
neutral	it said free delivery over 00 . 00 but delivery charge was added even_though the tree was 00 . 00 .
neutral	the service was great and i could change the delivery date ; however i had to wait in all day till 0pm delivery despite the website saying a text would be sent in the morning with a 0 hour delivery window .
neutral	i would be hesitant to use this website again which is a shame as the product is nice .
neutral	if the delivery was on first try it would have been fast , but as it was not , nor was it the next try but yes it was the on 0rd try .
neutral	i did not enjoy waiting 0 0 / 0 days for my ink .
neutral	yes it was my fault i ran so low on ink .
neutral	i will be a bit more careful next time i buy .
neutral	oh the ink !
neutral	the 0 pots i have used are fine .
neutral	flowers arrived on the date but some of the flowers were going brown awaiting a response from the company which i e mailed yesterday
neutral	we loved the design of our tv cabinet and were prepared to pay the price for it , but were very dissapointed in the quality of the finish .
neutral	the laminate had been over sanded at a join causing it to split , which was unsightly .
neutral	any trained eye would have spotted it before it left the workshop .
neutral	we were offered a replacement , but the hassel of re - arranging another day off work to wait for the item wasn_'_t worth it .
neutral	we are going to pay for it to be professionally touched up .
neutral	they offered a £_00 credit note , after some convincing , which we accepted , but i am relectant to buy any furniture from them again .
neutral	it '_s a great shame as they have some great unique items .
neutral	i hope you do publish this so other customers can get the benefit of my experience and made . com can improve the quality control at the warehouse .
neutral	i thought them charging me for a complete fill up upon return was not ethical seeing there was a 0 / 0 + tank left in the car .
neutral	they still charged for 00 gallons which is the tank size total ........
neutral	when i rented the car and took it they advertised the lower price gas , but did not mention that they would be charging a whole tank regardless of the amount left in it ..
neutral	so , that bummed me out .
neutral	also , it was advertised as a car being at the airport and it was an off location needing shuttle ......... so , that was what it was on your end may be something that should be checked into .
neutral	the last two times i '_ve used priceline there has been a lack of important information .
neutral	first we bought a pet friendly hotel only to find out once there at 00_pm our pet was not welcome unles we paid a non refundable $_000 deposit .
neutral	we only paid $_000 for the room !
neutral	they would not refund our money either so we just lost it .
neutral	this last time , we requested a king bed which they were happy to give us , but had to pay extra for it .
neutral	no where on the priceline info were either of these items stated .
neutral	while the order process and the price were both very pleasant experiences , discovering how the order was progressing proved difficult !
neutral	the website was easy to search , great selection of choices and placing the order was straight_forward .
neutral	i would like to see the customer '_s shipping information tied to the login / password to eliminate duplicate entry of name , shipping address , etc .
neutral	however , other than the order confirmation email there was a total_lack of any updates or status reports .
neutral	nothing was sent that would allow you to plan on when the part would arrive .
neutral	if you do not have your order number handy when you go to inquire about the status you are out of luck unless you fill_out an inquiry form ( no customer_service phone_number ) and wait for a reply .
neutral	again , i believe the order history should be tied to the login / password id .
neutral	open and completed order numbers should be readily_available for review .
neutral	i finally received a shipment delivery alert the day before the part was received .
neutral	the part was accurate and well_packaged so it was ready for installation upon receipt .
neutral	one other concern i found was with their return_policy .
neutral	if the company ships the wrong part to you through no fault of your_own you must pay for the shipping to return the part for correction !
neutral	also , if you want them to then send the right part be ready to pay again since they do not exchange .
neutral	they must refund you for the first order and have you re - order the part while they are processing that refund !
neutral	so , be ready to invest twice the price until the refund posts .
neutral	remember , it was their mistake to begin with !
neutral	in summary , you can get a good part at a good price but you won '_t know when it will arrive and hope it '_s what you ordered !
neutral	i sincerely believe that they could be an excellent online parts source .
neutral	however , they really need to modify their policies to be more customer friendly .
neutral	pleased with quick service from company but had to return the tap as it was defective a broken part .
neutral	i would have thought they would check all stock before sending them out .
neutral	so_far have no confirmation of my credit to barclaycard .
neutral	the booking was for a chrysler_000 or similar car at a rate of 00 bucks a day from budget rentals .
neutral	i asked taylor ( the desk clerk ) if he could advise which vehicle of this category ( premium car ) would be best for a big , tall guy with a sore back ( me ).
neutral	he was like oh sure , no problem ... i have just the car for you !
neutral	i forget what he wanted to give me but he quickly filled_out some forms and handed them to me to sign for a charge on my m /_c of $ 0000 . 00 !!!
neutral	i said , " wait now , how does 00 x 0 = 0000 ???
neutral	he said , " oh i thought you said you needed to upgrade because of your back ."
neutral	i told him yes , but i want a similar vehicle to the chrysler_000 like the booking says ( i was thinking dodge charger , chevy impala or ford taurus ... etc_.)
neutral	he ended_up giving us a volvo s00 which is a beautiful car , no doubt about it .
neutral	but it '_s small and sporty .
neutral	i was alright , we made do but it was not really what i was expecting and it did hurt to get in and out of it ... and he sold us insurance we didn_'_t need at 00 bucks a day and then he asked if pam , my wife , would be driving the car .
neutral	we said .
neutral	" yes , perhaps one of the days she will drive ( she never did ... i did all the driving ) but he charged us an extra 00 bucks a day ($ 00 . 00 just in case pam drove the car one day ) so , i was expecting to pay about 000 bucks but it ended_up being 000 bucks .
neutral	so we paid more money than we expected for a smaller car than we expected .
neutral	don_'_t get me wrong , the volvo s00 is a fantastic piece of machinery but it is not a car for a 000 pound , 0 ' 0 " man with a bad back .
neutral	just getting in and out of it was a painful experience !
neutral	anyways , it '_s done now and i will rent from budget again if they have the best deals found by my travel_agent , which would be booking . com or any number of the other online places like travelocity or whatever .
neutral	but i will be more careful to not get upsold .
neutral	the message here is " be careful " these people are trained to upsell you .
neutral	expedia can be a mixed bag - some itineraries are really good , as when i went to bahrain , and some are silly , like when i flew houston to denver via atlanta ??
neutral	?, which took 00 hours for a normally two hour flight .
neutral	it is very difficult to get the automated system to bring up any logical changes , guess that is what you get for going for the lowest_price .
neutral	so_far as booking hotels , look at the expedia site fist to get a range of hotels , then try contacting the hotels directly - you can often make a better deal yourself .
neutral	my first time experience was that you do not get an instant decision , once approved you then have to either pay a further £_00 to get the cash the same day or wait another 0 days , all in all 0 days from applying i got the money but the amount of interest first quoted was not reduced to reflect the adjustment in the amount of days i actually had the money .
neutral	when you call you give your account number and date of birth to the automated system , which you then have to repeat when you speak to an advisor - increased time on phone .
neutral	customer_service advisors are not quick to pick_up on your query or understand your request .
neutral	i explained i had paid for early morning delivery , only 0 of my 0 items was available for delivery today , i wouldn_'_t have bothered if i ' d have known that .
neutral	but the 0 item had not arrived by 00 . 00 , the advisor was telling_me my item had arrived when i obviously knew it had not , when she finally understood she did give me a refund .
neutral	i do find it frustrating to keep explaining simple things , i would hate to have a complex query !
neutral	the selection of products is good .
neutral	but the check out process was not efficient .
neutral	entered my cc data , then saw the " add card " button to the right , and when clicked it to add the cc data i had just entered , it made me start all over again ... sucked .
neutral	also , i ordered gift code cards for immediate online delivery on christmas_eve , only to receive an_email confirmation that said cards would be shipped on december 00 .
neutral	thanks a lot guys .. i wanted to avoid a trip to the busy mall to get a card by buying for online e_- shipping .. but didn_'_t happen .
neutral	overall , you get a c +.
neutral	a great price compared to what i researched on the internet but the shipping cost is somewhat high .
neutral	let '_s see how long it takes to receive it .
neutral	will post again after receiving it .
neutral	i have used ebay , as a dollhouse collector , for 00 years - and for many of those years it was awesome .
neutral	now , sadly , like so many businesses , they have gotten greedy .
neutral	they not only cater more and more to buyers who have ' remorse ' and want a refund - but ebay is now charging 00 - 00_% to seller '_s of the total price of the item including the shipping .
neutral	that is outrageous .
neutral	i just finished a round of selling and after selling 00 items ( including hummels , etc_.)
neutral	and paying postage , netted about $_00 . 00 total .
neutral	next time , think i '_ll just donate them and let the hospice thrift store get the money .
neutral	greed spoils everything .
neutral	the age categories on your site - lumping everyone over 00 into the same demographic - made me laugh , then made me wonder : maybe i ' m not supposed to be here ( i ' m 00 and wandering central america with an ancient 00 year - old .)
neutral	more troubling : the ten per cent fee you charge , a big hit for a host in comparison to other_sites like airbnb .
neutral	my host lost $_00 .
neutral	since i don_'_t want to ripoff hosts , i '_ll book elsewhere .
neutral	i have booked an airline ticket for my wife from yvr to ams and back .
neutral	the booking process was quite simple and also gave me options to select different days of departure and return flights at different prices on one convenient screen .
neutral	when my wife was checking in for the outbound flight the airline employee ( air transat ) denied her the boarding of the plane as she did not have a valid travel document to netherlands .
neutral	netherlands require the remaining validity of the passport be at_least three months at the last day of stay there and my wife '_s passport would expire in two months .
neutral	obviously we were not aware of such requirement by netherlands otherwise we ' d be quite stupid to book the flight there .
neutral	i am of opinion bravofly should have alerted us that my wife ’_s passport is not valid for the travel to netherlands especially they ask for the passport expiry date during the booking process .
neutral	i have contacted bravofly immediately on their customer_service phone_number .
neutral	after a quite frustrating conversation due to the mutual lack of understanding because of a very poor english of the bravofly customer_service rep , i have been recommended to contact bravofly via e_- mail with my complaint .
neutral	so_far i have sent three messages and to this date i have received no response to any of them .
neutral	i realize it is the traveler ’_s responsibility to check the requirements of the countries that he / she intends travel to .
neutral	i am also convinced that bravofly is partially responsible for the lost airline ticket and i would also expect if they are a truly professional organization , they would respond to the correspondence from their clients / customers .
neutral	based on this very negative experience , i will not book a flight with bravofly again .
neutral	i might use their site to locate suitable flight transportation but will book the flight with the actual airline carrier as they will have the same or very similar price .
neutral	same i would recommend to all of you who read my comment to avoid possible future frustration caused_by dealing_with this organization .
neutral	since i have posted my original comments , there has been a positive action by bravofly that deserves to be published :
neutral	on august 0 , i have been contacted by bravofly via e_- mail and was explained that it is passenger '_s responsibility to be aware of all laws and regulations associated with the travel to a foreign_country .
neutral	therefore bravofly could not reimburse me for the cost of the outbound flight ( vancouver – amsterdam ) however offered a refund for the cost of the return flight which i accepted .
neutral	after exchange of a few e_- mails dealing_with the refund request and confirmation , the money for the return flight has been credited back to my credit_card account on aug 00 .
neutral	i found this to be acceptable and positive enough action to improve my opinion about the company from poor to fair .
neutral	i still would suggest bravofly updates the booking process to incorporate an alert when a passenger '_s passport validity is in a conflict with the regulations of the country where he / she is traveling .
neutral	the room was very clean .. the hotel a little older could use updates , free breakafst nice except you needed a breakfast coupon which i believe they should have told you when checking in .. the bar area was nice as well as swimming pool and jacuzzi .
neutral	staff a little unfriendly but not enough to ruin the stay .
neutral	i would stay here again .
neutral	the usual online ticket experience until my credit_card was rejected due to billing_address not matching card .
neutral	so that caused a snag .
neutral	then i used a different card .
neutral	same problem !
neutral	no way !
neutral	i called my card , they said the fraud dept put a hold due to ' unusual foreign activity '.
neutral	meanwhile i had tried to contact customer_service , i am no xenophobe but was rattled to find the small_print in farsi !
neutral	eventually i filed a contact report and was sent a no reply til 00 hours .
neutral	then they requested , y review and still no ticket !
neutral	i was growing worried , last few seats on the plane , then i happened to visit my spam inbox and there was the long lost ticket - so thanks to fraud alert and spam filters this gave me a bad time .
neutral	either package tracking isn_'_t updated regularly or the components i '_ve ordered have been sitting at the " sortation facility " for the past six days without progress .
neutral	i needed a room in fresno , ca near the university .
neutral	i called the hotel i wanted to stay in and was quoted a price .
neutral	then i checked with easytobook and was able to get the room for less .
neutral	this was my only experience with the company .
neutral	seemed_like it was similar to the other discount travel companies i '_ve used .
neutral	generally good quality print , finishing and despatch .
neutral	online ordering system is a breeze to use , and the updates on despatch are helpful .
neutral	never had a late delivery so_far .
neutral	however over the time we '_ve been using them ( for quite a few jobs ) we '_ve seen the print quality reduce slightly so it '_s not a ' wow ' every time .
neutral	mostly to do with colour balance , but also in one instance the creasing and folding on a 0pp a0 was dreadful and should never have got out the door .
neutral	their system does fall down though when a job is less_than perfect .
neutral	a phone_call to the team will get response of either ' please send photos ' or ' we '_ll get someone to look into it '.
neutral	in every case we '_ve had to chase to follow_up and - unlike the ordering_process - there is no system to update you with progress on any reprint or its delivery .
neutral	had to phone up again today about some vinyl banners on which the printing was very good but the eyeletting was appalling and again should never have been sent out .
neutral	any kind of quality control would certainly have picked this up so you start to wonder if they ' re sending stuff out on the off chance people won '_t bother to bounce it .
neutral	i ' d have thought that getting a reprint done quickly and keeping the upset customer informed was essential ?
neutral	we might not be the usual printed customer in that we ' re design consultants with decades of experience in buying all types of print and display so maybe we ' re more critical , but there does seem to have been some slippage in quality , and problem resolution needs a robust and effective process to match the ordering system .
neutral	customers should not need to chase the supplier like this .
neutral	finally a nag about bill payment which is a frustration i understand is also shared by the accounts department .
neutral	not being_able to pay multiple invoices in a single transaction is a time - wasting nonsense .
neutral	please get this changed !
neutral	thanks
neutral	usually happy but getting a bit concerned as i '_ve ordered two cardigans and am still_waiting for both .
neutral	hoping they arrive next week .
neutral	i do not live in maryborough us but in maryborough victoria australia .
neutral	i '_ve ordered before so why has my address changed and my order possibly gone astray ??
neutral	?
neutral	the first problem was not related to the car ...., we are travelers .
neutral	our schedules are not the normal ones we keep at home .
neutral	i am 00 and on meds , one of which compensates for kidney problems .
neutral	they had a large sign as you entered their office that customers can not use their toilet facilities .
neutral	there were no other options on the street .... a very uncomfortable situation .
neutral	the car proved servicable but was missing a rear wiper blade , which we realized the first rain .
neutral	the next problem was a real problem .
neutral	we had been given a renault clio .
neutral	it was so underpowered that there were times it could not make it up a hill and we had to back down and find another route .
neutral	we were staying in cortona , an italian hill town , and found the car could not make it to our house .
neutral	we contacted you asking to change the car and received the instructions to return to the rental_agency in florence .
neutral	it would have taken us a day to drive up and back .
neutral	we decided to try to manage , parking two blocks from our house and walking .
neutral	the brakes were not sufficient to keep the car from sliding backwards on the hills or when parked .
neutral	again we used creative means to keep the car from rolling down the hills .
neutral	the final problems were with our returning the car .
neutral	their contract has typos in the spelling of their address .
neutral	thus our garmin stated the street they listed did not exist .
neutral	to add to the confusion the agent had used a black pen to draw the route from the office to the a - 0 blacking out part of the street name on the map .
neutral	the end_result was as follows ...
neutral	+ contract states via bognosanti .... actual address borgo ognisanti .
neutral	after driving around in the vicinity of the office i found the church " ognisanti " on our map , aimed for that and found the office .
neutral	they should , must give their customers the correct address .... even if that means reprinting their contracts .
neutral	the final problem was their closing for lunch .
neutral	tourists pick_up / drop_off cars at all times , have connections to make , arrive on public transportation that operates all day .
neutral	we arrived to find they would be closed for 0 hours .
neutral	it is a no parking zone in front of their office .
neutral	across the street is a carabinieri station .
neutral	they agreed not to ticket us saying it happens all the time .
neutral	we parked the car and went to lunch .
neutral	when we got back there was a line of people all waiting like us to drop_off or pick_up cars , all with their luggage and all annoyed .
neutral	it was cold but fortunately not raining .
neutral	i would not recommend this eurocar office in florence to anyone .
neutral	i have only used momondo recently for an upcoming_trip .
neutral	i liked the site , it worked_fine .
neutral	maybe it was just the flight that i was trying to book that lead to what i consider a big problem .
neutral	it pointed me to two booking sites for the purchasing the ticket - one travel and what appears to be a sister , cheapoair .
neutral	perhaps the fault actually lies at the doorstep of those referred sites .
neutral	but one travel was charging a whopping 00_% over the underlying cost of the ticket .
neutral	yes , that '_s right almost 00_% more_than other_sites or directly with the airlines themselves .
neutral	i don_'_t know why momondo didn_'_t find the same flights elsewhere at the " real " price .
neutral	so it may make sense to double_check elsewhere before assuming that momondo has the lowest fare .
neutral	it was a useful website and helped_me make a quick decision when it came to renting a car .
neutral	the only thing that frustrated me was that when i made the reservation , they didn_'_t make it clear how much i was going to have to pay for a booster seat .
neutral	my suddenly great value rental just became more_expensive and wasn_'_t such a great deal after all .
neutral	i would have really appreciated knowing how much it was going to cost , because i would have just brought my daughter '_s booster seat and saved myself the money .
neutral	it was nice to find a good deal , however , i was very disappointed they included no direct contact information with the local rental office , which required me to go through the national office , & resultant voicemail , to get the number .
neutral	i was also given the wrong address , which caused my friend to be delayed in meeting me there .
neutral	website should be more up to date , so that this does not happen , i would not have ordered from them if i had known this item was out of stock .
neutral	i ordered an item and paid £ 0 . 00 for express next_day delivery not realising that if you don_'_t order before a certain time on a sunday then next_day means next working day which in this case was a tuesday as it was calculated from monday .
neutral	so i ended_up paying £ 0 . 00 whereas standard delivery which also would have come on tuesday , would only have been £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	also they did not send me a confirmatory email so i had no idea if my credit_card payment had been accepted or not and whether the order had gone through .
neutral	apart from this , the item arrived ok .
neutral	i ordered a new handbasin for my shower room .
neutral	it was delivered very quickly but when it arrived it was badly cracked on the outside .
neutral	i called the company and they got back to me straightaway .
neutral	they replaced the basin within a matter of a couple of days and the replacement was fine .
neutral	the only word of caution i would add is that this basin was one of their cheaper ones which raises questions about the quality .
neutral	i purchased this protection based on a friend '_s recommendation .
neutral	however , the last alert received is incorrectly stated as my name was totally omitted .
neutral	it appeared as if my husband was the sole owner of our property , which is not correct .
neutral	plan on contacting identity_guard to see why the error and see what results i get .
neutral	not too pleased to read the one review about the young_lady_who tried to cancel the protection and couldn_'_t and the complaint about poor customer_service .
neutral	will need more time to make an accurate assessment .
neutral	i ordered product for a friend who did not have internet connection .
neutral	i found the product i was looking for quickly & the price was good .
neutral	i placed my order on 00 / 00 / 00 , but the order was not even shipped until 00 / 00 / 00 !
neutral	when my fedex tracking_# was emailed i immediately tracked the package to see when my friend could expect his shipment , only to find that it wasn_'_t even scheduled to be delivered by fedex until 0 / 0 / 00 !
neutral	while the products & prices are great , the shipping / delivery leave a lot to be desired !
neutral	newegg has been goign downhill now , since this year they '_ve been slowly deteriorating in terms of quality of customer_service .
neutral	they were a very good company before but now they '_ve continued to go down hill .
neutral	i '_ve gotten 0 defective items in the past with them but they '_ve taken_care of it .
neutral	it ' sju st a hassle now and i might prefer to shop with amazon because i haven_'_t gotten any defective products from them yet .
neutral	if anyone has been to abest buy location , their sales reps are very helpful whenever it comes time to purchase an item .
neutral	they help with the purchase in person but online you get no such luck .
neutral	i made the wrong purchase online and had to return the item in person ... was a little_bit of a hassle .
neutral	unfortunately this website is not very trustworthy .. too many fake reviews .
neutral	product arrived ok and online purchase fine . however , we had to go out urgently the day it was due to arrive and called tu the next_morning .
neutral	the service agent was incredulous , ' didn_'_t you notice the delivery date when you placed the order ?'
neutral	i couldn_'_t get much of a word in edge ways and eventually had to be forceful and stop her mid flow .
neutral	she eventually arranged for it to be delivered the next_day .
neutral	all very unecessary .
neutral	dpd then tried to delivery it to the wrong house , two different address numbers were on the product and order slip .
neutral	probably wont use tu again .
neutral	simply_supplements have an easy to use web_site and ordering online is simple , however they were let_down by using an inefficient courier service called hermes who allegedly tried to deliver the package on the fourth and fifth business day after ordering but failed to do so as there was someone at home to receive it and no card was left - eventually after a lot of prompting by simply_supplements as they were the only people who could track it , it was eventually delivered 0 working days after order - just in time for me to take the glucosamine for my dogs on holiday to scotland , to ensure that their joints would cope with the hills !
neutral	wouldhave given them 0 but they need to kick their sellers in the butt fot their inability to ship faster !
neutral	great car , great value , but if your in a hurry forget it .
neutral	i had to wait for an_hour for the courtesy van to show up . finally got there computers were down , wait , wait .
neutral	got the car , kia soul very impressed .
neutral	the agent did not give me back my licence .
neutral	had to pay to have it sent to me not impressed
neutral	hope if we need to use them they are ok
neutral	i bought a costume and thought i needed to get extra stuff to complete it .
neutral	it turns_out that those pieces were actually included but they did not bother to include them in the description .
neutral	so i ended_up buying extra stuff that i did not need !
neutral	excellent prices , very fast shipping ... but not very good on customer_service .
neutral	my support ticket was opened on the 0th of june -- as of the 00th of june i still_haven_'_t received a response , and i marked my request as " urgent ".
neutral	:(
neutral	most items are as_advertised along with most sellers are honest .
neutral	some game players flock to this site for scams especially the clowns that scam for money to be wired to them .
neutral	untraceable .
neutral	this company always has the latest and greatest products but their shipping_charges are way out of line .
neutral	ie : a previous order that i placed was 0 . 0 lbs to ohio $_00 . 00 .
neutral	expedia uk doesn_'_t seem to play well with expedia us .
neutral	for some things , it was easier to go through expedia us even when i was in the uk .
neutral	uk travel rewards points don_'_t connect to my us account and the guy i spoke to on the phone was a little surly .
neutral	everything else was great .
neutral	this is my experience with viator .
neutral	one experience was very good .
neutral	our tour_guide from naples was great .
neutral	*****
neutral	another experience was not bad and we booked the eifel tower dinner and went to see moulin rouge .
neutral	the ugly , was where do i begin ?
neutral	the food was terrible .
neutral	we had the wine tasting and food experience in umbria , and were left in montepuliciano when our tour_guide had the group find its way back to the drop_off point and we could not find it , since the village was huge and no one we came into contact with for help spoke english .
neutral	when we got into contact with the local police he could not understand us as well .
neutral	after some time he did find someone to translate and help us get back to rome , which took several hours and a lot of money .
neutral	customer_service dropped the ball on this horrible_experience .
neutral	we had left items on the left on the tour bus , and they were not returned to us .
neutral	i was told that we would have to get them and since we were boarding our cruise from rome the next_day we could not fetch them back .
neutral	very dissapointed .
neutral	this was my first order and i loved the fact that they will do price_match / beat with the products .
neutral	my only issue was with the shipping .
neutral	it should either be free at_least with an order of a certain amount or comparable to a company like puritan '_s pride that has a very fair shipping price .
neutral	if they will meet or beat price on the product they should do the same with the shipping .
neutral	i came to this site because my normal supplier was out of stock .
neutral	i was appalled that the cost of shipping was higher_than the product .
neutral	my normal supplier ships usps .
neutral	this company only uses ups .
neutral	shame , the price of product was good .
neutral	i won '_t be back .
neutral	i booke with them often .. unfortunately , i have wasted many hours trying to use their ' 00 %' off deals .. and their insider deals .. but the most discount i have ever_seen is about 00_% and 0 % is the norm .
neutral	when you compare their special deals to other_sites or even their own pricing without the deals .. you will see that there is no difference .
neutral	so i wish they would not have caused me to waste my time on it trying to find an actual good deal .
neutral	i also believe that their reviews of the hotels are bogus .. there are obviously reviewers that are just friends of the hotels ..
neutral	i oktober 0000 fik vi boxer , så vi fik en svensk kanal , tv0 .
neutral	det virkede godt og i 0000 , på_min runde fødselsdag , fik_jeg et_nyt fjernsyn af børnene :)
neutral	meeen sååå bliver det lavet om og man er nødt til at have en fjernsyn fra 0000 eller nyere før at kunne se nabolandenes kanaler .
neutral	meget skidt syns jeg .
neutral	eller så skal_man købe til udstyr for at se kanaler som forhen indgik i det abonnement som tegnedes i 0000 :((
neutral	" my experience was ok .
neutral	the time it took for me to receive my repaired frames took much longer than advertised .
neutral	i sent in my order via overnight mail on oct . 00th and didn_'_t receive the finished_product until the week of nov . 0th !
neutral	one pair of my repaired frames were done very nicely but the second pair came back with a very loose repaired arm but i ' m hesitant to return them because i don_'_t want to wait the length of time i had to wait to get them back .
neutral	very dissapointing especially because of the turnaround time taking much longer than i thought it would .
neutral	i will say that i did speak with a customer_service rep and that experience was pleasant / professional ."
neutral	the program works great - the problem i have is trying to get help !
neutral	there is not a phone_number that you can call .
neutral	they do have live_chat but they cannot help me with my issue ; which is : i got an_email from bitdefender to renew my service at half the price .
neutral	great !!
neutral	so i did that , then on my due date for my service , they charged my card again for twice the amount i already paid 0 days earlier .
neutral	i understand about the automatic renewal , but since i renewed ( through their email ), i assumed ( yea my mistake ) that it was renewing my service .
neutral	long_story short - i now have two license numbers but no service !
neutral	i got online friday to find out i am now not covered !
neutral	i have two lisence numbers , $_000 paid and no coverage .
neutral	i was able to " borrow " service for 00 days from a helpful gentleman in live_chat .
neutral	again , he could only pass my info on so someone could contact my by email .
neutral	that is not a very good way to fix my issue !
neutral	!
neutral	herbies seeds got my order to me very quick in 0 days .
neutral	the second time took only 0 day .
neutral	all i can say is they do the very best they can do and thier coustomers are important to them .
neutral	its clear to see why herbies is one of the leaders in the seed bank business .
neutral	two thumbs_up from me !!
neutral	herbies does " aim to please !!"
neutral	i am experiencing difficulties .
neutral	first , i have satellite internet service which isn_'_t always as fast as it should be .
neutral	second , i am often working on my family_tree and the system freezes up .
neutral	third , despite earlier success , when i am several layers into researching records , the system will suddenly kick me out of the program , back to the sign - in page .
neutral	and lastly , i have attempted to reach a live , breathing person through your 000 numbers , but waiting on hold for 00_minutes isn_'_t something i want to do .
neutral	i '_ve tried twice in the past two_days and gave up both time .
neutral	i am from holland and i know the prices are pretty chiep over there you could have send them a better arrangement for my money thanks but no thanks
neutral	this is the second time i have ordered from giftcards . com and i was so pleased with the service i received that i ordered one for my grandchildren .
neutral	they make to ordering_process easy and the cards come quickly .
neutral	ordered a polly tunnel and vent mesh but the couier delivered it when i wasnt home and left no card , so i was left wondering what was happening .
neutral	i e mail , ed first tunnels and they were amazing .
neutral	gail rang and e mail , ed me within hour , s and spoke to the couier on my behalf and quickly sorted the problem out for me and i had my order soon after .
neutral	first tunnels is a fantastic company and the stuff i ordered was fantastic quality .
neutral	thank_you to gail , a quality member of the staff team .
neutral	i would recommend first tunnels without_hesitation .
neutral	i liked the ease of purchasing the gift_card but on one page in the process it indicated that shipping would be free with the choice i made .
neutral	then on the final page there was no free option .
neutral	perhaps i missed something but this should never happen .
neutral	it is false_advertising .
neutral	booked a full package holiday , flights with thomson airline spot on apart from plane being cold asked numerous_times to turn up but it never happened , carlota apts basic but clean staff very friendly , transfers with resorthoppa a nightmare arrived at las palmas sat on bus for 00mins then visited every resort on the island i think before arriving at my apartments 0 0 / 0 hrs later same coming_back just got through passport control and flight was called will never book a full package holiday again as no info was given at time of booking about length of transfers , will never book transfers with resorthoppa ever again .
neutral	ringede til afdelingen i herning om morgenen om , at jeg_ville hente lot 0000000 .
neutral	da vi ankom kunne man_ikke komme ind i systemet ( og kunne heller_ikke , da_jeg_havde kontakt om morgenen , fik_jeg oplyst ).
neutral	vi kunne ikke betale med dankort og skulle i storcenter for at hæve penge .
neutral	den info burde jeg have fået , da_jeg snakkede med jer om morgenen .
neutral	good way to earn while you search but getting prizes can take weeks , maybe a month or more .
neutral	the good and the bad , i guess .
neutral	good selection of whisky .
neutral	site easy to navigate .
neutral	prices not too bad either considering you are paying for shipping .
neutral	well_packaged .
neutral	i loved the boots i bought .
neutral	unfortunately they were too small !!
neutral	a size 00 is not an 0 a 00 is an 0 so were miles too small and i can '_t afford to send them back .
neutral	veryvery dissapointed this time .
neutral	in did i ' m very satisfied with the staff of cultpens , they were spectacular in care and treatment of my order , about this there ´_s nothing to comment unless one " thank_you for your professionalism "
neutral	the dark side of the process it is the international delivery service ,
neutral	we lose control of where is our order and no idea when we will receive it , it is true that it arrives but i think this process deserves improvements .
neutral	but it is only my modest opinion ,
neutral	thank_you very much .
neutral	jeremy today may 00 , 0000 .
neutral	well prepared , and very polite and higly patient with us .
neutral	thank_you !
neutral	mrs .
neutral	slack
neutral	shame on you for hiding the total including tax in a not so straight_forward way .
neutral	yelp is often good as a starting point but with google now grabbing social links and foursquare using your friends reviews , i am less likely to use yelp .
neutral	newer services like ness may take over in the food / restaurant category .
neutral	the biggest issue with yelp is which reviews are real , what filters / checks are there at yelp and if they are pushing advertising from the same reviewed places then isn_'_t that a conflict ?
neutral	i bought hex penny tiles and carrara marble crown molding for my new bathroom .
neutral	the tile arrived in good condition , and looks good installed .
neutral	however , the pieces of crown molding varied greatly in color - some were very light , some were very gray .
neutral	i would have appreciated more effort on the part of the packers to make_sure the pieces were consistent in color .
neutral	efforts to reach customer_service by e_- mail and phone were unsuccessful .
neutral	i ordered flowers for a friend in n ireland & thought all was okay .
neutral	several hours_later i got an_email_saying i had ordered from the wrong bit of the website & i needed to reorder from the international part !
neutral	ok , they are refunding the payment & i have now reordered the same bouquet at the same price - but really !
neutral	n ireland is uk , not international !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	ps i got confirmation email of the 0nd order from the same email_address & person - what the ....??
neutral	?
neutral	it seems to me that once you have paid for a product , they basically will delivery the product whenever it is convenient for them and not on a specified or pre_- agreed delivery date .
neutral	product was ok ( a bit over priced for the quality ) but customer_service was poor .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t buy from them again nor would i recommend them to a friend .
neutral	your competition is beating you by getting ecodes and physical gc out much_quicker then you are .
neutral	agree with karen m - w .
neutral	when booking it says full car insurance is included but at time of pickup additional charges to make it really full coverage are disclosed .
neutral	car interior was dirty , ashtray full .
neutral	also , take note that additional charges apply for picking_up and returning at airport .
neutral	i was not aware of this at time of booking .
neutral	at return time i had to wait 00 - 00_minutes for employee because there was no one in the rental booth .
neutral	this is not good , since you usually have limited time to catch a flight .
neutral	otherwise it was ok .
neutral	i ordered a mixture of led bulbs with different fittings ( bayonet and edison screw ) and some of the order was filled incorrectly .
neutral	lbs responded quickly to my email about this , arranged for a courier to pick_up the incorrect ones , and redelivered the balance of the correct order , so now i ' m happy !
neutral	i ordered replacement heads for our oral b toothbrushes - we have several types in the house but all with the same fitting .
neutral	unfortunately , i did not check the website and none of the brush heads fit .
neutral	please check your codes properly before you purchase !
neutral	good products but you pay for them .
neutral	if i had a bigger fashion budget , i ' d shop more at monsoon .
neutral	i am not sure their goods warrant the pricing model they employ .
neutral	very old_fashioned .... not necessarily a bad thing .
neutral	too much junk clutters my searches which makes it a less_than positive experience even if i eventually find what i want .
neutral	chose to rent a car for 0 + weeks from argus solely on their attractive price .
neutral	car had the advertised features but was dirty .
neutral	staff member manning the maggiore counter in pisa was curt and not as helpful as we needed since we were new to the area and didn_'_t read italian .
neutral	i asked for a map and he gave me one but he could not give us any directions .
neutral	he was also sarcastic when we had real confusion about where to go get our designated car .
neutral	summary : not a great customer_service experience and car was dirty but the price was right .
neutral	having rented cars for the last 00 plus years i was surprised to find that the ford_focus which i was given ( not a pontiac ) was without a cruise control .
neutral	upon my return of the vehicle the agent was also surprised and was willing to make some accommodation but because of time i refused .
neutral	placed order on may 0rd and the money taken out on the 0th but no updated in on my order number .
neutral	unknown if has shipped so i can '_t review it yet .
neutral	also you can not set_up an account with them only able to check your order status by order number .
neutral	pay attention to your feedbacks .
neutral	actually i filled_out fedback form and was unable to send it .
neutral	i have also made comments on ' rating hostelworld ' that apparently went unnoticed or were unworthy of answer .
neutral	how do you suppose that makes me feel ?
neutral	was very excited to get my 0 water features - however on setting the first one up , i found it was broken and had a sizeable hole in it .
neutral	haven_'_t set the second one up yet - it is a different design and looks to be ok .
neutral	the delivery came when we were out on saturday , so the company re - delivered it yesterday ( monday ).
neutral	all seemed to be packaged ok , so my guess is it was already broken , as no missing piece in the box .
neutral	would love this to be replaced without any inconvenience to us .
neutral	great online pricing but don_'_t think you can stop by the store and get same pricing and any service at all ... buy online and avoid the rude employees .
neutral	ar
neutral	it took us some time to find the rental office by address but actually the office is inside the termini rail station .
neutral	hope they can make clearer description on the paper in the future .
neutral	unfortunately the computer did not work when we arrive at the rental desk .
neutral	i was asked to go to a internet bar outside the rail station to print my rental coupon to paper - it cost me some other time and 0 euro .
neutral	when i came back the agent was on the phone to get the computer fixed .
neutral	after about 00_minutes finally the computer worked and our rental was processed .
neutral	i was thinking i just need to show them my name and coupon number to finish the rental .
neutral	it is hard to understand_why they do not have backup computers .
neutral	our family had to walk for 0 blocks to get the car but we got the car .
neutral	the price is ok but the experience was not that great .
neutral	i love the shoes but don_'_t like the stipulations for free shipping over $_00 .
neutral	it should be free shipping over $_00 period .
neutral	i wanted to buy more_than 0 clearance shoes and the free shipping didn_'_t apply even if i spent over $_00 .
neutral	i ended_up buying 0 shoes and paying $_00 for shipping .
neutral	don_'_t think i '_ll be shopping at this site anymore .
neutral	i order my pets supplies and needs over the internet .
neutral	i have to say they are fast on delivery .
neutral	although the customer_service department does not know what the left hand is doing to the right hand .
neutral	meaning .... they are completely clueless as to the status of orders , full fulfillment , shipping .
neutral	my order was shipped in several shipments .
neutral	no indication on invoices partial shipment , no indication of order being completed .
neutral	called to check on when order would be received on the missing items and they said the order had not even been processed .
neutral	the minute i got off the phone the door bell would ring and there would be the order or the rest of the missing ordered items .
neutral	petsmart needs to train their shipping department .
neutral	i ordered my pet supplies and they put 00 pounds in one flimsy box .
neutral	they did not break up the order to separate the weight .
neutral	products were damaged in shipping and loss of product was missing .
neutral	i ' m surprised ups accepted the package in it '_s un - stable state .
neutral	i won '_t be order from them anymore .
neutral	my last order was canceled without explanation .
neutral	i later found out the entire order was canceled because one item was out of stock .
neutral	there was poor communication on your part .
neutral	however , good prices but steep shipping_costs
neutral	very few models with sleeves .
neutral	did not want jacket .
neutral	stands to reason plus - sized women may not have arms suitable for strapless gowns .
neutral	when i first arrived at the rental location .
neutral	i was told that the car i rented on the internet was " changed ".
neutral	" some times " " that " happens .
neutral	the people at the counter where no help !
neutral	after going outside .
neutral	i spoke with damion .
neutral	he took_care of everything .
neutral	i ' m_glad you hired him .
neutral	then on the return of the car .
neutral	a young_man name troy coming needs a raise and a pat on the back as well .
neutral	a true gentleman .
neutral	please give these_guys , these kind words , as i told them i would let you know how i was taken_care of very well .
neutral	if it were not for these two .
neutral	i would never do business with this company again .
neutral	as to the paper pushers in the office , they were just plain rude .
neutral	both times !
neutral	right_channel radios has a great website with lots of info for people , like me , who are new to cb '_s .
neutral	i ordered everything needed for a cb install off of their website on 0 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	received tracking_info on 0 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	i received the order in two shipments , one on 0 / 00 / 00 and the other on 0 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	not sure why they shipped it in two boxes .
neutral	i had problems installing the cb .
neutral	swr readings were pegged .
neutral	i used the troubleshooting info on the website to diagnose the problem and everything was checking out ok .
neutral	i finally found the problem to be a defective coax .
neutral	the coax was checking out fine with my multimeter but i finally noticed that on one end the wire was not soldered to the center pin .
neutral	i soldered the end and everything worked_fine from there .
neutral	i only hope i did not damage the cb during this process .
neutral	the defective cable was an 00 ' firestik k0a coax cable .
neutral	i had the opportunity to pick my choice from about 0 cars available , which was a plus .
neutral	what miffed me to some extent was the extra_charge at the end of the rental , which was neither disclosed at the time i made the reservation nor explained at the time i turned the car in , full of petrol and without damage , over use , not any other reason_why i was charged more_than agreed upon initially .
neutral	unfortunately i was time pressed to catch my flight and the amount was not exorbitant enough .
neutral	still , leaved me with a bitter taste and spoiled what could have been a good rental experience .
neutral	hence my 0 star review .
neutral	would have been a 0 star were it not for this ...
neutral	for the last 0 years i have been traveling about 000 days per year on my own nickel .
neutral	booking . com has offered the most reliable , broadest , and most helpful customer_service of the others i have tried .
neutral	agoda left me stranded at midnight in a strange country with no assistance .
neutral	hotels . com , travelocity , orbitz just don_'_t offer the breadth .
neutral	and when i have made a mistake that needs to be corrected , booking . com customer_service has also been extremely_helpful in getting to resolution .
neutral	many of the hotels i book also have free cancellation up to a few_days before the reservation is to begin .
neutral	and the selection criterion make it much_easier to get down to a specific set of hotels to decide between .
neutral	there are still some improvements that would help :
neutral	0 .
neutral	show the full price of a hotel , similar to what us airlines are now required to do , price with all charges .
neutral	0 .
neutral	even better , allow me to make selections in the criteria , e . g .. breakfast , wifi , parking , free cancellation and then show me the full price with all of the items i have selected
neutral	0 .
neutral	rate the reviewers .
neutral	show me star , reasonable reviewers differentiated .
neutral	i have 0 chihuahuas and 0 bedlington terrier .
neutral	i ordered spoiled_rotten for my chihuahuas because it only let me list 0 kind of dog , what about us multiple dog owners ?
neutral	and shouldn '_t the deliveries be geared for xsmall dogs ?
neutral	the ordering_process was easy and delivery is fast .
neutral	i feel i got good products for a similar price as my pet_store .
neutral	good initial response when ordering , but when contacted for advice / help there is a pregnant pause ( still not heard anything - has been nearly a week ), although they have confirmed that my email has been received .
neutral	bit disappointed really .
neutral	they have organized a lot of information and it is realy nice but u pay for it and i think the transfer from one tree to another takes a lot of time when hey should give you other options to deal with it .
neutral	such as click on a person and u can copy everything about them to another tree .
neutral	my trees are so big that i need too seperate them and that takes me months to redo that information instead of a click or two .
neutral	if i am wrong a help tutorial giving directions to do this would be verrrryyyyy helpful .
neutral	how do i claim my past vouchers / bonuses .
neutral	order was despatched on thursday and didn_'_t reach us until the following tuesday - tracking said ' delayed in nantgarw '.
neutral	disappointing , but product fine .
neutral	hotel yang berpatutan pada harganya .
neutral	selesa dan aman .
neutral	sesuai untuk beristirahat .
neutral	i was under the impression that the credit scores reflected on my account were accurate .
neutral	however , when i obtained a credit report from the three bureaus in oct 0000 , i noticed they were not .
neutral	i then contacted identity_guard and questioned the disparity .
neutral	i was not happy to discover that identity_guard does not display our actual credit scores from the three bureaus , but have their own formula to calculate them .
neutral	identity_guard reports my scores lower_than that at the three bureaus by as many as 00 points or more .
neutral	i think it is trifling that you put your_own formula on a score and pass it off as a score from another agency .
neutral	because of this misleading information , i will most_likely move to another credit guarding agency in the near_future .

neutral	the facility i ' m using ( in minnetonka , mn ) is nicely laid_out .
neutral	i ' m using an indoor unit and it '_s very easy to drive in to the large , indoor , heated loading area and transfer stuff .
neutral	everything '_s clean and works as it should .
neutral	great !
neutral	facility would be a 0 . 0 star review by itself ( 0_stars would need more dollies and different kinds )
neutral	pricing , while competitive with other_companies in the area , just seems ridiculously high .
neutral	ps insists on this outmoded " cheaper online , higher in person " cost system , which makes it a slog to go down , see what things are like ( there isn_'_t an online preview of specific sites / units ), then be told that it '_s going to be significantly more_expensive than what you ' d investigated online - so back home ( or on to your smartphone ) to sign_up .
neutral	then you still have to show up in - person to sign the many - pages contract and get your ps - mandated lock ( not included in pricing ), and be surprised by the mandatory insurance ( not made clear ahead of time ).
neutral	don_'_t even think of buying packing materials from them unless you ' re desperate - you '_ll get soaked .
neutral	go to your local orange big - box store .
neutral	needed drivers , some times it is only one very important driver .
neutral	although slim drivers may not provide all the drivers you need and u have to manually down load them and it may take some time , i am grateful for thy ' re help .
neutral	although a building is old , there is a tub and it is kind to a bath lover .
neutral	the thing how many_times may be sufficient as whose breakfast from 0 : 00 to 00 : 00 at any time is kind .
neutral	it is kind that it is also on foot 00_minutes to the nearest station .
neutral	tablet sent in 0x to be repaired , returned repaired and couldn_'_t duplicate problem .
neutral	happened 0rd time .
neutral	st agrees to pay off .
neutral	no money in a week so_far and they sent me back my tablet apparently repaired .
neutral	just want my refund
neutral	i needed a 0 passenger car .
neutral	at the time of rental i was told that i was getting a 0 passenger vehicle by a rentalcar employee .
neutral	after receiving my confirmation on the rental i noticed that it said 0 passenger .
neutral	i immediately called and the person that i talked with assured me that that meant 0 passengers and did not include the driver .
neutral	once at advantage we were informed that it was a total of 0 passengers .
neutral	very disappointing since we really needed a vehicle for 0 .
neutral	had to get another car a more_expensive rate .
neutral	the person at the counter was very helpful and very apologetic .
neutral	not sure about using rentalcars . com again .
neutral	the units are clean .
neutral	the staff is friendly and helpful .
neutral	no lighting inside , so it '_s difficult to see .
neutral	the prices are high for the size of the unit .
neutral	i was told 0 rooms of furniture will fit in a 00x00 , this is not true , so now i have a unit and can '_t possibly get all of my stuff stored .
neutral	now i am looking for a bigger unit elsewhere because the price jumps too high per month for a single parent .
neutral	had no problem booking rooms but wanted to change and add a day to one room .
neutral	impossible to do changed the whole reservation and had to go and change back and go to site and add another day to another reservation .
neutral	the change button does not work folks .
neutral	that is a pain and spent a lot of time and called hotel but never got off hold .
neutral	credit scores do reflect banks , auto loan , insurance company '_s searches .
neutral	outstanding balances on cc reported quarterly and not current .
neutral	i have been identity_guard a long time
neutral	shipping is fast .
neutral	i like your site when i need to book a hotel in a location i am not familiar with .
neutral	i find the prices to be very good and the property information to be very thorough .
neutral	however i would really like to get an_email confirmation of my reservation sent immediately to my inbox .
neutral	i have just ordered two replacement thermostat / timers for my kitchen and dining room underfloor systems .
neutral	they were both installed around 0 years_ago and i had been very happy with the ease of installation and the efficiency of operation .
neutral	the failure of both timers just a year out of warranty is therefore somewhat disappointing !
neutral	bought an asus router .. initial eta was 0 - 0 days .. arrived something like 00 days_later .
neutral	annoying it was so slow but the next cheapest price i found was 00 pounds more .
neutral	perhaps for the £_00 i would have got one with a uk transformer rather_than 0 pin .
neutral	?
neutral	?
neutral	overall hard to gauge whether i ' m happy or not .
neutral	okish , but would only repeat the experience if the prices were much lower_than the next cheapest supplier .
neutral	but i was not at all happy with my purchases .
neutral	first i ordered a mrs . claus costume - it was very ill - fitting .
neutral	it was short waisted - actually the waistline was just under my boobs , which was very uncomfortable .
neutral	the apron straps would not stay up and had to be pinned .
neutral	however the kids loved the costume , so that is all that matters !
neutral	but the wig would not fit at all !!
neutral	it would not go on my head , so i had to rush out at the last_minute and buy another one .
neutral	that was my fault - i should have tried it on earlier but who thought an adult wig would be too small for an adult !
neutral	however the shipping was fast ; the prices are reasonable , and maybe it is because i am only 0 ' 0 " that the costume did not fit well .
neutral	as i said before , the kids loved " mrs claus " and said my dress was beautiful , and as long as they are happy , that '_s all that matters .
neutral	would i buy from halloween_costumes again ?
neutral	probably !
neutral	opticsfast carries a wide_range of eyeglasses , including many discontinued models .
neutral	they even check the frames to make_sure they are in a - 0 condition before shipping .
neutral	however , once the order is placed , you will not hear from them for 0 - 00 days .
neutral	for me , that meant 00 day wait , then cancel order since they didn_'_t have the frame , then place a new order ( but they gave me a discount ) and wait another 0 days before the new order shipped .
neutral	i think they should have expedited the new order , especially since i did it through their online_chat system and there was a real_person on the other end .
neutral	i can only give them a average bordering on below average review .
neutral	while they offer " great prices " on their products they more_than make up for it in shipping_charges .
neutral	also the order processing time is a little long in my opinion .
neutral	i placed my order on the 0rd day of the month and received a shipment confirmation on the 0th day of the month .
neutral	counting 0 business days for shipping , this is exceedingly long .
neutral	it '_s worth paying a little more to other distributors of similar products to have lower shipment charges and faster order processing .
positive	they use every kind of language .
positive	an the people don_'_t respect there own self .
positive	that '_s not kool .
positive	i started a tree on facebook it is very large i need to try an move it to ancestry .
positive	but i don_'_t know how .
positive	i have ordered over the past 0 years many items from zazzle .
positive	loved everything , special stamps for bridal showers , weddings , christenings , stickers for gift bags , bridal shower invitations , rehearsal party invitations , christening invitations .
positive	have loved it all !
positive	thank_you for making event in our family just a little extra special .
positive	i have to say after_reading the reviews i was hesitant to order .
positive	but i loved the shoes and boots i looked at so i did and i ' m not sorry !
positive	i ordered my shoes on a monday night and received an invoice the next_day that explained about my order and it had a tracking_number on the invoice .
positive	and 0 day later i received my shoes .
positive	they were just like the pictures and totally awesome !!!!!!!!!
positive	i love them .
positive	i will order from amiclubwear over and over .
positive	if you are looking for a special necklace , go to mynamenecklace . com
positive	i absolutely love this site !!!
positive	it '_s my go to place when we travel ... i tried another site once but was disappointed .
positive	i will always use it .... why ?
positive	because its simply the best !
positive	i am so pleased i found this company !
positive	they do what they say they will and the customer_service is excellent ... and i love the software .
positive	excellent quality books at a good price .
positive	thankyou !
positive	love this site .
positive	great prices and fast shipping .
positive	i ordered the i have a coupon for that mug as a christmas gift .
positive	it came promptly and packaged very well with no chips or cracks .
positive	i will_definitely be back for the hard to buy for people .
positive	thank_you very much a job very well_done !
positive	i have been trying to create a website for quite a while now with varying degrees of success .
positive	perhaps i am easily intimidated but i did not find any of the web - generator sites that i tried to be easily negotiable .
positive	some had more promise for me than others but , in the end , none gave me the ease of use that i was looking for .
positive	and then i found weebly !
positive	the first place that actually delivers on the promise !
positive	i was beyond excited as i launched my beautiful - looking website yesterday .
positive	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you .
positive	after sending my tablet in two separate times repairs for the same thing and my tablet still not working i got my payout .
positive	while it took a few weeks since i ultimately had to send it in three_times , i am definitely happy i had insurance on my tablet .

positive	i have never been_disappointed .

positive	this was my first time booking reservations with bookit . com and my experience was great .
positive	the representative explained_everything to me in detail in order for me to have a full understanding of what i was getting .
positive	i felt very comfortable and the personality behind the phone was great .
positive	thank_you bookit for making this a wonderful experience .
positive	i will bookit again .
positive	prices are unbeatable ;
positive	ease of ordering is incredible ;
positive	variety of products is unmatchable ;
positive	satisfaction with doing_business the best .
positive	i am also amazed at the way priceline can negotiate fantastic deals for hotels .
positive	i used it on my vacation and managed to come out lower_than_expected on hotels on several_occasions during one vacation .
positive	i actually booked the hotel as i went and not in advance ( although i recommend not to do it this way ).
positive	sometimes we only plan what to do wherever as we go around so we don_'_t always know where we ' re going to end up .
positive	priceline shows all the prices on a map , and that '_s what i really like about it .
positive	i '_ve used the negotiate function twice , and have gotten really good deals with it .
positive	the only thing i don_'_t like about negotiating is that it '_s like gambling , i don_'_t know what hotel i will get until after i pay , and then it '_s a done deal .
positive	but so_far i '_ve been lucky .
positive	i '_ve also been denied once with my low negotiating price , but you can always bid and negotiate again .
positive	it seems outrageous though what priceline can get for you .
positive	love it !
positive	my only complaint is that the app on my ipad crashes a lot ( or it doesn_'_t like my bids ;).
positive	it was easy to activate by phone and the website is helpful and easy to navigate .
positive	will_definitely keep this in mind to give as gifts .
positive	hey , you need to check out this site that made it sooooooo easy to send a visa_gift_card that i sent for my granddaughter for her_birthday ....
positive	wasn_'_t thrilled that i had to buy a local boat from a out of state dealer but they made the experience positive for seller and buyer .
positive	made me feel comfortable that they are a trustworthy reputable company .
positive	the one flaw about shopping at sunglasses shop is that is are so many amazing sunglasses to choose from , so it '_s hard to choose !
positive	there are all_sorts of prices points , the prices are reasonably and the quality of the sunglasses is fantastic .
positive	i finally picked out a designer pair , georgio armani in a a dove grey .
positive	and boom , in two_days they were laying in wait on my doorstep .
positive	the quality of the frames is phenom , and i love ' em .
positive	amazon is big for a reason .
positive	you can pretty_much find anything you need here , and get a killer deal .
positive	with the markeplace guarantee , you are assured a money back guarantee if your order arrives defective or in an unsatifactory matter .
positive	comforting when ordering from around the world .
positive	i rely on amazon for household goods , electronics , camera equipment , shoes and clothing , books , and entertainment , everything but husband .
positive	fibers . com is easy to navigate and create your_own designs on t - shirts , sweatershirts , whatever .
positive	i found it super easy to make a custom design for a hoodie , and was surprised by how fast the item arrived in the mail .
positive	no surprise was the excellent quality of the hooded zippered sweatshirt , as fibers . com came highly_recommended from a friend .
positive	quality product , reasonable prices and fast delivery .
positive	i give an all thumbs_up to the whole experience .
positive	i have used this so many_times and i love it still !
positive	really good quick service value for money definately recommend
positive	very good and quick service definitely_recommend to a friend
positive	really good communication from staff , excellent value for money would recommend to a friend , will use again
positive	good quick service
positive	after breaking one tablet just weeks after getting it i was thtilled at how quickly square_trade took_care of the problem and refunded my money .
positive	it was in my paypal in less_than an_hour after i shipped the broken product back .
positive	i will not buy any electronics or phones without this great warranty .
positive	great selection , good prices , prompt service / fast shipping
positive	amazing customer_service and overall great experience !
positive	you can unlock your phone in an easy and fast way .
positive	fantastic selection of items at affordable prices .
positive	very good shopping_experience .
positive	guys this is the best way to make a reservation , very clear , simple and easy .
positive	go_ahead do not think too much .
positive	since the law in most states require supplemental braking .
positive	the danko 00000 rvibrake0 auxiliary braking system works great !
positive	it replaced an older unit .
positive	the danko is lighter and much_easier to setup .
positive	the remote_control is an awesome feature !
positive	american_rv did a great job of package and shipping .
positive	i would order from this firm again without any reservations !
positive	happy day !
positive	!
positive	very good service , will do more business with them in the future .
positive	these slacks are a great fit and wash and dry easily .
positive	there are no wrinkles and the material is comfortable .
positive	the dog_food and the biscuits were delivered promptly !
positive	my dog is very happy eating both products !
positive	he is only 0 months old !
positive	as awlays with d & m tools they are prompt and reliable in every respect .
positive	thanks .
positive	ipostparcels is excellent collection and delivery when specified , no_problems , no_fuss and great value .
positive	i can trust them to do what i need for my customers .
positive	thats what matters good customer_service for me as a customer and for my customers in return .
positive	our local collection guy is a star , come sun , wind , rain and snow he '_s gets the job done . top_marks !
positive	from the moment we placed the order we had online tracking .
positive	the courier sent an_email_stating a time_slot of an_hour .
positive	the package arrived within one minute of the opening of that time window !
positive	what more can we ask , nothing super delivery , excellent comms , and of course excellent product !
positive	thanks
positive	getting an affordable square_trade warranty for my laptop was such a lifesaver !
positive	my laptop is over two years old and all of the sudden i couldn_'_t type any more .
positive	the keyboard wouldn_'_t work at all .
positive	i remembered i had bought a 0 year warranty and got on the website and checked .
positive	i was so happy it was still under warranty .
positive	it was a very simple process to have my laptop repaired .

positive	we used viator to book tours for two major trips in 0000 .
positive	first to hawaii in june then to australia and new_zealand in september & october .
positive	there were no_problems with ticketing or arrangements .
positive	of about a dozen tours for the two trips , there was only bad " tour "; and it wasn_'_t really a tour so i wouldn_'_t blame viator .
positive	( that was the hop on - hop_off tickets in honolulu .
positive	part of the problem is the horrible honolulu traffic & the other was lack of communication regarding bus stop locations by the bus operator .)
positive	will_definitely use viator again when we need to book tours !
positive	have ordered many things from them - love the company .
positive	good bargains and fun to bid on things .
positive	good site to travel around .

positive	saw this lovely dress on line at woolworth for my great niece who will be three , and set about ordering it .
positive	i set_up an account so i can either pay off instantly or pay in installments all great .
positive	i then decided to allocate a shop where i could pick_up my goods ( with working it is easier ).
positive	within a couple of days the parcel was delivered to my home .
positive	i then got an_email_saying they were dropping my goods off at the alloted shop but needed some more info off me as it was my first order .
positive	here i am thinking i have somehow ordered it twice .
positive	after checking my account with woolworth it only held one order but i got numerous_emails saying my goods would be sent back if i didn_'_t pick them up from the shop .
positive	after a few more days i decided to phone woolworth '_s and some young_man in a call_centre somewhere just told me to ignore all these messages as there had been some sort of malfunction .
positive	i did as he said and heard no more until i got my email to remind me of my first payment .
positive	overall if it had not been for this " malfunction " everything would have been spot on .
positive	i would say to anyone do shop with woolworth , you can see for yourselves the quality and price points and the different payment_methods .
positive	i can only hope for you there will be no malfunctions and everything will go smoothly but hey what is life without a few hiccups .
positive	well_done woolworth for sorting it out so quickly
positive	i have used cheap smells a few_times and have always found a quick , easy and cheaper way to buy perfumes etc .
positive	is by buying on line at cheap smells .
positive	i bought perfume last time which i had only smelled on an older lady_who came into the shop where i work .
positive	it is an yves st . lauren perfume , i liked the smell on the lady and bought it without testers etc and i am over the moon .

positive	actually arrived in next days post , fantastic service , and i tried them on my oral - b handle and they fit fine .
positive	i have not used them yet but i am also giving some to a friend who just happened to mention she was waiting until she could see oral - b heads on sale and i of course related my story .
positive	if they work as good as everything else connected to them they should be fantastic .
positive	thankyou !

positive	no gimmick !
positive	best company to deal with in years .
positive	you won '_t be disappointed here .
positive	joyce

positive	i would recommend them to anyone with animals - they are really down to earth and helpful , and interested in their customers .

positive	i have been researching my families for 00 years , and i started out doing this without a computer .
positive	when family_tree maker came out this was how i started , with cd '_s .
positive	i had tried another genealogy site , and was very displeased with it , so i tried ancestry . com .
positive	it was a whole new world opening up for me , and i have never looked back since .
positive	having researched information prior to the computer helped_me because i knew that the information i had was correct , so it helped_me to find what i was looking for on ancestry .
positive	i have found so much information on my families , and i keep finding more and more as i keep researching .
positive	i have learned to watch what i am looking at in different family_trees , and i can pretty_much judge if this is the correct family or not .
positive	having the census reports has been a huge help , as have military enlistment records and / or draft registrations .
positive	the biggest thrill about ancestry is being_able to share photos with others , and finally getting to see what my great - grandmother looked like .
positive	i could never go back to the other genealogy sites because they can not hold a candle to ancestry .
positive	i have been contacted by many people from both my families and my late husband '_s families , and they have not only given us information , but the joy of finding new family_members , no_matter how far down the line they are .
positive	the other great thing about ancestry is the fact that they now have dna testing , and it really does work .
positive	i have been contacted by family through this process , also .
positive	i have been researching a very long time , and i hope to continue doing so for many more years to come .
positive	ancestry has made it possible for me to put_together something that i can pass down to my granddaughter , and she on down to her future family .
positive	thank_you , ancestry .
positive	best prices , prompt delivery and outstanding selection .
positive	highly_recommend this site for all those seeking a healthy lifestyle .
positive	when we go to hawaii we consistently use priceline as our method of selecting hotels .
positive	it '_s the best way to stay at the top hotels at the least expensive price .
positive	but don_'_t tell the other guests .
positive	it will ruin their time !
positive	about a year_ago , i was working with a client writing their website copy .
positive	they got suspended by google adwords , and i had no clue as to exactly why or how get the client reinstated .
positive	it was a nightmare and took hours and hours of my time .
positive	i was so frustrated because google '_s adword policies are really confusing .
positive	it was by sheer luck that i found ppc renegade while doing a google_search for companies that know about reinstating suspended companies .
positive	they explained what had happened so i could hopefully avoid problems in the future .
positive	they got my client reinstated .
positive	since then , anytime i have any question about my content , i pass it through ppc to make_sure that i won '_t jeopardize my clients .
positive	they are a invaluable resource .
positive	i love 000poker !
positive	i don_’ t even miss the free drinks in vegas .
positive	lol !
positive	everything about this place rocks !
positive	i ’ ve tried other on - line poker sites before , but this one is a class act in every way .
positive	i was pleased when i found it was free to register and download .
positive	the graphics are crystal_clear and beautiful .
positive	the deposits and withdrawals are super_fast , and the financial companies they use are reliable and secure .
positive	i haven ’ t had much need to use them , but when i have , the customer_service staff is very friendly and takes care of things pronto .
positive	i like that i almost never have to wait at the tables .
positive	it ’_s cool to get invitations to play with the big dogs , and it ’_s greatly improved my game .
positive	there are so many promotions , and they are all terrific .
positive	one promo is double your money .
positive	poof !
positive	$_000 becomes $ 0000 !
positive	if you “ like ” 000poker on facebook , you can get $ 0000 .
positive	these people really know what they ’ re doing .
positive	i am a very happy_camper !
positive	wide_range of choices on phones and tariffs , in some cases a wider range than the service providers themselves .
positive	if you can '_t find what you want with buymobilephones then you don_'_t know what you want .
positive	used for anti_- malarials .
positive	very efficient and half the price of other_sites .
positive	gizzmo heaven are great for service prices and c ommuncations will buy again from them ron .
positive	last_year i sold my home in a neighboring town and bought a new home in lafayette , la .
positive	i got online to research available security_system options and safemart offered exactly_what i was looking for which was a wireless system independent of a telephone land line .
positive	the only reason i had kept my land line at my old home was for the security_system .
positive	safemart offers a variety of packages from basic to all the bells and whistles .
positive	their online and phone support is really good and their agents are friendly and knowledgable -- you will not be talking to someone in another country reading answers to your questions from a troubleshooting guide .
positive	my system was very easy to install and was pre_- programmed for my specific needs .
positive	i ' m able to check and arm / disarm my system from a remote on my keychain and can access my system from my smart phone ( checking history of sensor events , arm / disarm , etc ).
positive	i get all this along with excellent monitoring service for the price i paid before for just for monitoring and i no_longer have to pay for a phone land line .
positive	i also have the option to upgrade , add sensors , cameras which can be monitored on my smart phone , outdoor sirens , etc .
positive	at any time .
positive	everything works as_advertised and their support is top_notch .
positive	i highly_recommend safemart .
positive	square_trade is the best !
positive	my claim was processed immediately and i received my reimbursement very soon after , for the full_amount the repair .
positive	i could not be_happier with the outcome .
positive	square_trade has made a client for life !
positive	my nephew introduced me to this site .

positive	i bought 00g usb drive for girlfriends pics / vids and music and she is delighted with it .
positive	after using my usual hotel for the past 0 years arranging transfers which included mini bus drop offs at various hotels i did some research and came_across suntransfers offering a far better rate but also in a private cab for our personal use , both journeys to and from the airport were first_class and when we arrange our flights for next year i will certainly book with suntransfers again .
positive	when i need to review a topic , study a subject .
positive	or find a product , i have never gone wrong using google .
positive	it has what i need .
positive	when my local gym started raising the prices of the supplements i was buying from them , i became curious as to what price others were selling the same products .
positive	i went to gnc and checked their prices to find that they were as expensive , if not more_expensive , than my local gym .
positive	i had decided i would just buy from the gym until i ran_across an advertisement for the supplement_warehouse .
positive	their pricing was almost half of what both the gym and gnc were charging .
positive	i ' m no genius , ( haha , i ' m a lifter , remember ) but i figured there had to be a catch .

positive	the boat ride was incredibly enjoyable and even more fun than i had expected !
positive	it started out with feeding the seagulls cheetoes !
positive	they took these right from our fingertips .
positive	kids and adults alike were laughing .
positive	the captain provided a wonderful narrative of the area as we cruised to the island .
positive	the coast of shell island is beyond description in it '_s beauty of the sand and the water .
positive	the trip back included a cruise in a heavily populated cove of dolphins .
positive	we got to see dolphins swimming , playing and feeding .
positive	we got to see babies swimming with their mothers .
positive	the ride back included the opportunity to touch a live horseshoe crab as the crew walked around and showed it to passengers .
positive	the entire trip was one our entire family will never forget .

positive	i '_ve ordered from hobbylinc many_times in the past , and continue to patronize them because i know that i will always get a great price , selection , lightening fast delivery time on items that are in stock .
positive	that last bit is especially important because many of the other online hobby suppliers list items among their inventory that are either not kept in stock , are dropped shipped or seemingly perpetually on back order .
positive	i highly_recommend hobbylinc , and they are a permanent fixture among my top three online hobby suppliers .
positive	i have traveled now in southeast asia for three years a friend told me about agoda and it has been the only way i book my hotels .

positive	not too long ago whenever i purchased electronics i would opt out of any form of protection or insurance .
positive	i thought that this was a waste of money , that the warranty or guarantee from the manufacture or company was enough and anything additional was a waste of money .
positive	then i discovered square_trade .
positive	true coverage at affordable prices .
positive	my first policy was a samsung tv .
positive	it is so comforting knowing that this very valuable part of our family is protected .
positive	we receive most of our entertainment and information from this smart television .
positive	it is more then a television and with this coverage it brings us peace of mind .
positive	since this purchase i have protected many other electronics from printers , to cameras and plan on adding even more .
positive	peace of mind protection .
positive	such an easy process from organising postage_costs dropping off parcrl and fast delivery .
positive	great value for money
positive	its easy to use and always brings up the best deals , i use it regular for flights
positive	i usually google what i ' m looking for and always go to sw becasue they have the lowest_price .
positive	and if not the will match it plus 0 %.
positive	i really love these_guys !

positive	no faxing !
positive	my daughter dropper her htc dna droid and the screen was smashed to pieces .
positive	yea , even_though it is gorilla glass .
positive	called squaretrade .
positive	they sent me a replacement overnight , i sent back the damaged phone .
positive	fast , easy , painless .
positive	this is how a warranty service should work .
positive	i wish all warranty work , like on a car , was this easy .
positive	i have two older motor homes and need parts from time to time .
positive	i was buying from a competitor and had problems with items on back order .
positive	american_rv will be my go to for all my dinasour parts .
positive	sometimes we need parts that are hard to find .
positive	this is the place .
positive	i would truely recommend that you search partsgeek before you do any buying and or shopping for parts .
positive	if you have any questions they will answer your questons .
positive	by the way when you are told a date for delivery .
positive	you can guarantee it will be there .

positive	microdream truly saved me !
positive	i have a five year_old hp iq000 .
positive	it was a $ 0 , 000us priced computer when it was purchased .
positive	when i tried finding a replacement cooling fan i searched high and low and could not find a replacement as the manufacturer of the fan discontinued production of it .
positive	microdream not only had several used cooling fans with warranties but they also carried every piece i could possibly ever need for my pc .
positive	while searching their site i also noticed the sell refurbished systems and their prices are extremely reasonable .
positive	i would not think twice before ordering from microdream in the future !
positive	need to protect your system , then avast is the one for you .
positive	why pay mcafee or norton 00 - 00 dollars a year to get protection , when avast will do it for you for free and has key features included .
positive	like web_site rep , to help prevent you from clicking into a website that has been hijacked or hacked .
positive	shields for your file system , web , mail , network , p0p , im , behavior and scripting .
positive	mcafee and norton tout their " cloud ", but avast gives you this as well .
positive	software updater , certain software are targets of hackers , ( like flash ) and avast software updater monitors this and will alert you when a new update is avallable so you can keep key software secure and up to date .
positive	i just want to say thank_you for the quick delivery of the item that i chose .
positive	it arrived four days before_christmas , and looks great .
positive	the hoodie was a gift for my boyfriend ; he says that it is one of the most comfortable and warmest ones that he owns .
positive	also , the size is perfect , he '_s hard to fit .
positive	i only wish i would have been able to find tee - shirts in the same size .
positive	thanks for making my shopping_experience great ; i will be shopping with you again .
positive	zazzle has dazzle ; you are great !!!
positive	!

positive	on the road working , broke my cheap toshiba satellite wal mart note pad screen .
positive	they fed exed it to the fed_ex center where i picked it up , after watching the video a couple of times i had it finished in 00_minutes .
positive	saved $ and hassles .
positive	i bought some make - up from sephora . com but i didn_'_t use it right_away as i still had some left from the previous bottle .
positive	when i finally went to use it , more_than a month later , there was a problem with it ... it was liquid but with clumps in it .
positive	i contacted sephora via_email , and they made it so very easy !
positive	despite all the time that had gone by , the sent me a replacement right_away and did not make me send the other one back .
positive	very impressive !
positive	that kind of customer_service makes me prefer to buy everything i can through them .
positive	i live a long way from most shops so this makes my life much_easier .
positive	i have always liked them , but now i ' m a fan !
positive	i had been looking for a good green tea supplement for a while , but wanted something easy to take .. i hate taking lots of pills .
positive	and drinking tea all the time is a logistic nightmare .
positive	so when i saw the sports food product with its high concentration , i had to try it .
positive	and i love it !
positive	it gives me energy without the jitters , i ' m getting all the good benefits of green tea without running to the bathroom every 0 minutes , and i just have to swallow 0 pill -- perfect !
positive	plus , i '_ve lost a couple of pounds without doing anything ( i ' m not overweight but did have a little roll that has now disappeared !)
positive	... i guess this is supposed to burn extra fat but i really wanted it for the energy , but i got all the benefits .
positive	i had some questions before i bought it and the sportsfood people where very helpful , quick and thorough .
positive	great company that is really responsive to the customer .
positive	i am totally addicted to the sabon hand sanitizer !
positive	it doesn_'_t have any nasty chemicals in it and i have noticed if we forget to pass it around , someone ends up with a cold !
positive	it '_s great for going out to eat or sneaking a snack in the car .
positive	it smells wonderful and makes everyone smile .
positive	when i share it with friends , they can '_t believe it '_s a sanitizer -- they love it !
positive	i keep a supply around as everyone wants to use it .
positive	the website is great ... my only complaint is that it seems like if they are out of something , the product just disappears -- i wanted the verbena sanitizer but couldn_'_t find it , so had to order another one -- but it '_s great too .
positive	but would have liked to know when more verbena was coming ...
positive	i am a bit obsessed about sun protection .
positive	but most of the clothing is really pretty tacky or just plain frumpy .
positive	finally i have found a great company that makes attractive clothes that i want to wear .
positive	they have some adorable swim shorts that cover a multitude of " sins " as well as protect me from the sun -- and i look great too !
positive	the workout shirts fit great , look good and are comfortable even in the heat .
positive	finally someone is making something attractive that gives the sun protection we all need !
positive	they also have a website that is easy to use and they ship stuff very quickly !
positive	i '_ve already re - ordered more stuff !
positive	whether your friends order or you order for yourself , i ' m pleased with my 00 . 00 a bag savings !
positive	pet best is so convenient , i can '_t understand_why all people don_'_t use this site .
positive	the 0000 lumen light i purchased is by far the best light i have ever used ..

positive	awesome service , great pricing , and a cute thank_you video .
positive	unfortunately the costume i purchased was way , way too small .
positive	too bad to because i liked it .
positive	kinda cheaply made and definitely not the true american size as stated .
positive	when i checked the label for where it was made , i was not surprised to see vietnam .
positive	that explained why it was too small .
positive	i hope i find something else .
positive	great communication , willing to adjust pricing and great work .
positive	i have had coverage on electronics through the places i have purchased them in the past and have had the hassle of it '_s not covered for that or we cant find you in our system .
positive	when i came_across squaretrade i bought the coverage not knowing how they were .
positive	i bought it because it was very inexpensive .
positive	to register my purchase on ; ine with squaretrade was so simple .
positive	then it happened .... i had to file a claim .... that was easy too .
positive	it was covered .
positive	they emailed me a shipping_label .
positive	i boxed up the covered item and mailed it out and bam ... i received the amount of the covered item and purchased a new one .
