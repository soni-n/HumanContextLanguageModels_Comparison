negative	they charged my fiance ' s credit_card for the same booking twice a week ago !!
negative	he called his bank and had bookit fax over the reservation so he could get a refund asap but his bank said after 0 days when they finally did recieve the fax from bookit there was some third - party company working with bookit who charged his card directly .
negative	so his bank said to call them ... when he did he was on hold another hour & they claimed they didn ' t see the charge so he had to call bookit again and be on hold for another hour just to be told he won ' t see his refund 0 - 00 business days !!
negative	what ??!!
negative	this is their mistake and now my entire family has to pay for it !!!
negative	that was his money and we needed it for our wedding !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i am so upset !!!!!!!!!
negative	never book with them they will scam you any chance they get !!
negative	they bank off interest from money they steal from you and use third_party companies to trip up your bank so you can ' t even get a refund from your bank !!!
negative	crusty business !!!!!
negative	worst ever !
negative	!
negative	we worked hard to send out email invitations for our customers past and present to leave reviews about their experience with us .
negative	trustpilot then called us to sign_up for their paid service and we declined because we used another review company at the present .
negative	0 week_later .. the handful of reviews we had on trustpilot were all taken down .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	this website is a scam !!
negative	bankrupt !!
negative	!
negative	since august 0000 i bought 0 bags for 0 . 000 €, which they never sent !!
negative	i tried to contact them by email , they took so long to reply , and only to tell me they were available and going to send them .
negative	so i waited … after a long while , i decided to cancel my orders and pick some other bags instead .
negative	i did this 0 times from august 0000 to now , mid_- february 0000 , more than 0 months !!!!!!
negative	and i ' m a good client , i spent more than 00 . 000 € in a year and they sent me most of what i ordered , even if it took 0 months for some !
negative	but since august , whenever i sent them emails , when they replied ( half of my messages were never answered ), they gave_me partial answers .
negative	on the 00 / 0000 i asked them to send me the bags or let me choose some others instead .
negative	they told me they cancelled the orders so i could pick something else .
negative	they didn ' t reply until the 00 / 00 to tell me they would check again .
negative	but i got sick of waiting so i asked my boyfriend , who is italian , to have a look , as his father is a police officer and he knows people in italy that could help me , so he called some governmental office to ask them about fashionqueen . net , and guess what ?!
negative	fashionqueen doesn ' t exist !!!
negative	it is not registered , the p . iva it00000000000 doesn ' t exist !
negative	!
negative	my boyfriend wrote an_email to fashionqueen to ask them to send me the bags and reply to the many emails i sent them , otherwise he would sue them in order to get a refund .
negative	and guess again ?!
negative	here is the answer :
negative	" dear customer

negative	good morning , i would know how long it will take yet ?
negative	the data regarding purchases are .
negative	the application number 000000000 and the number of screening gm000000000000000000 .
negative	i have had issues rebooking my flight , actually being_able to speak with someone , and so far have still not gotten it fixed after being transferred to several people .
negative	i will never purchase anything through them ever again .
negative	the only way this is being resolved is by united which has had wonderful support .
negative	i would advise to not support priceline .
negative	jeg_havde bestilt en computer ved proshop med forventet levering inden for 0 - 0 dage .
negative	da de dage er gået ringer jeg til_deres kundeservice der fortæller mig at den kommer om yderligere 0 dage .
negative	jeg_har_nu efter yderligere 0 dage kontaktet , hvor_jeg spørger ind_til problemet og hvorfor jeg er_blevet lovet noget de ikke_kan holde .
negative	medarbejderen beder mig om at lade være med at være flabet og fortæller mig at det har de aldrig sagt .
negative	altså er jeg både flabet og en løgner .
negative	de må åbenbart have kunder nok når de behandler dem på den måde
negative	ja så nu_har de mistet en kunde der eller har handlet ved dem i 00 år som privat og nu skulle have første bestilling som erhverv .
negative	men ak ja det_blev så den sidste og varen er nu også afbestilt
negative	boa noite ,
negative	tive ótimas indicações do site , mas já em minha 0ª compra tive problemas .
negative	efetuei uma compra no dia_00 / 00 / 0000 e até agora 00_dias depois , nenhum sinal do meu_produto no planeta terra , o código de rastreio que eles me deram até agora não aparece nada nos correios mundial .
negative	o código de rastreio é : ln000000000us
negative	pedido : 000000000
negative	fiz uma compra ja faz 00_dias e_nao chegou ainda , ja mandei email e ninguem responde , queria uma resposta , comprei varias vezes e gostaria de comprar muitas ainda , mais a gente nao tem uma resposta , to aguardando .
negative	email : alisson_alves0 @_hotmail . com .
negative	ordem 000000000 .
negative	i ordered items on 0 / 0 that i need to receive by 0 / 00 .
negative	i figured that 00 days was plenty of time to receive the order , even with 0 - 0 days of extra processing required .
negative	i have followed up via_email three times to check on the status of this order with no response .
negative	the only response i did receive was from the facebook_page , which assured me that my order would be in the mail by 0 / 0 or 0 / 0 .
negative	it ' s now 0 / 00 and i have yet to receive any communication about my order , even after following up via facebook .
negative	i have attempted to call but have been on hold for over 00 minutes each time , and my job doesn ' t allow me to sit on the phone on hold all day .
negative	i have emailed to ask for a refund and gotten no response .
negative	i am in my mid_- 00s and have never dealt_with a company like this before .
negative	ami clubwear , i have faith that you will respond and make this right , either with a shipping confirmation or a refund today .
negative	after paying for my order with my credit_card , they needed a scan of my id card before they would send me the code .
negative	customer_service was slow in responding , and after my order i asked if there was a way to avoid this hassle if i order from them again in the future .
negative	they did not even reply , though their customer_service emails said to enquire about how to become a verified customer .
negative	will not be buying from them again .
negative	i ' m sick of paypal limiting my and my friends accounts all the time .
negative	they don ' t do stuff like that in a normal bank , so why so much control for these people !
negative	and have you ever tried to call them ?
negative	don ' t , it costs a fortune .
negative	time someone stopped their rampage !!
negative	!
negative	if you want to know how they really are , just ask someone that have bought_simcity 0000 to them .
negative	they were selling bunches of keys of the game on " pre_- order " months before the release_date , promising they would get the key 0 days before the release .
negative	the keys were hungarian ( not multi_- language ) and " unexpectedly " the majority of people didn ' t want to play in hungarian .
negative	what they basically did on the release_date is to ignore all the pre_- orders and continue selling more expensive multi_- language keys to new customers ( who were going to pay more for it ) while lying the pre_- order customers with empty promises and broken deadlines ( around 00 broken deadlines ) about when were they going to get what they paid for months_ago .
negative	today is the release day , i ' m a pre_- order customer , it ' s 00 : 00 and i don ' t have the key i bought to them long ago and should have arrived 0 days_ago .
negative	there are quite a lot of people like me and no explanations .
negative	well , some of the ones that have got theirs say their keys were already used ( and now have kind of a second problem ).
negative	i just recommend you to run away from their services as far as you can .
negative	took them almost 0 weeks to just to send an in stock battery out and refuse to be fair on returning it .
negative	00 days to get it to my house !
negative	by_far the best prices i have seen , they will even beat out anyone_else with a good deal .
negative	but afetr purchasing several_times from the site i have repeatedly received the wrong order , paying for a 00 serving container and getting a 00 when it arrived , then after contacting them , they told me to send it back and they would issue me what i paid for .... yet again sent the wrong_size for what i paid .
negative	then get put on hold for over an_hour trying to reach customer_service , then told that due to their customer_service office being closed i have to call back during their hours of operation .
negative	good afternoon .
negative	about the order 000000000 of 0 / 00 / 00 , did not get the products .
negative	please check in your system if there was any return of the brazilian postal service ( correios ) to the iherb inc .
negative	what should i do in this case ?
negative	i look_forward to returning soon .
negative	000 days have passed
negative	i ' d_rather pay extra at the competitors and receive human like support and treatment .
negative	i ' ve been waiting for over a week for a full answer on how to get the deluxe content for far_cry 0 .
negative	instead i get pointless answers and links that provide no useful info with broken image for screenshots .
negative	at the end of each reply from your support i get a sentence like " i see you no_longer need our assistance ..." what makes you think so if you ' ve never asked if i need further assistance ?
negative	even ea support is better_than what you provide and that should show you how badly you provide support .
negative	at the end you ask me to write a nice review ... well after over a week .. here i am writing a review .
negative	keep out !
negative	heute wurde irgendwas gekauft über mein paypal , als_ich die email auf meinem handy erhalten habe , habe_ich mich sofort bei paypal versucht einzuloggen und habe den fall reklamiert , anstatt mein geld zurück zu holen oder sonstiges wird nun auf die antwort des verkäufers gewartet , abwohl die adresse die angegeben wurde nicht stimmt bzw verändert wurde .
negative	paypal behält das geld sowohl vom käufer als auch verkäufer ein und bereichert sich so an zinsen .
negative	um probleme zu klären benötigt paypal oft wochen , bis sich endlich was tut .
negative	wenn dieser fall beendet ist , werde ich mein konto bei paypal löschen , hier wird keinerlei sicherheit gewährt .
negative	mit kreditkarte oder bankeinzug kann ich auch anders bezahlen , dafür brauche ich kein paypal mehr , zu mal die sicherheit bei paypal gleich 0 ist !
negative	!
negative	i bought months_ago skyrim box and got it broken , cjs said on facebook i will get a refunde , i ` m still_waiting to get my refunde to purchase another game with that .
negative	as i posted it to facebook they canceld me on it , so i can ` t write anything on the wall .
negative	supporter ( cj poh ) told me that the nw sniper_elite dlc will cost 0 , 00 gbp and i will see my refunde when i buy and pay the item , now the dlc cost 0 , 00 gbp and i still can ` t use or see any refunde !
negative	arcor gibt_es zwar nicht mehr und ist nun vodafone , doch als_ich im jahr 0000 einen arcorvertrag abgeschlossen hatte , war ich ansich relativ zu freden , abgesehen davon dass ich von dsl 0000 nur dsl 0000 empfangen habe und mein nachbar direkt neben mir dsl 0000 hatte , nach einigen jahren hatte_ich dann massive probleme , so dass ich alle 00 - 00 sekunden vom internet flog , dieser fehler wurde nie behoben also reichte ich meine kündigung ein , diese wurde aber nicht akzeptiert womit ich dann per anwalt die kündigung einreichen musste .
negative	0 jahre später hebt eine inkasso firma vo arcor 000 € von meinem konto ab , die ich bis heute nicht zurück bekommen habe .
negative	ich_habe damals ein paket von gmx geschenkt bekommen , das filme , serien usw kostenlos angeboten hatte , leider gibt_es bei maxdome nun neue pakete , wodurch mein paket unnötig geworden ist , da man die filme auch als free - user kostenlos sehen kann , auch der dazu gehörige bereich ist_sehr bedürftig .
negative	in meinem paket sind fast nur filme die erotik beinhalten oder serien , wo man nur 0 oder 0 episoden sehen kann und_das oft in schlechter qualität .
negative	serien die im tv bereits gelaufen sind , sind 0 tag kostenlos zum anschauen dabei , am nächsten tag wird diese wieder in die teuren pakete geschoben , weil angeblich keine lizens ist_für das jeweilige paket .
negative	nur ein tag darf es laufen und dann nicht mehr , schon eigenartig !
negative	ich würde maxdome nicht weiterempfählen , jedenfalls nicht als free user oder user mit einem film paket , der nicht auf erotik filme steht .
negative	zugegeben ich_habe mir erst heute , 00 tage nach reservierung für einen transporter , den ich mitte februar brauche , die reservierungsmail durchgelesen .
negative	beim gespräch vor ort wurde mir unter zeugen ( 0 freunde waren dabei ) gesagt , ich hätte bei einem transporter unbegrenzte kilometer , der sei sogar günstiger als ein 0 - sitzer ( den ich auch nehmen hätte können ).
negative	in der reservierungsbestätigung stehen jetzt 000km !!
negative	" sowas gäbe es seit 00 jahren nicht , ich mache das ja nicht erst seit heute ", da mag der gute mann recht haben , aber dann sollte man darauf achten , dass man kompetente mitarbeiter hat , die zumindest die eigenen angebote lesen und dem kunden erklären können .
negative	freundlich geblieben sind die mitarbeiter alle ( vor ort , also ffm west , in der telefonzentrale , da direkter telefonservice besetzt war , und am telefon von ffm west ) dennoch eine unverschämtheit mir zu unterstellen zu lügen .
negative	wie gesagt zwei freunde , also zeugen waren dabei .
negative	ob es das angebot gibt oder nicht , heute oder vor 00 jahren , ist mir egal .
negative	dann sollen sie es mir aber auch nicht anbieten .
negative	war dann wohl das letzte mal europcar , bei anderen anbietern hatte_ich nie probleme , außerdem sind die meist günstiger .
negative	fiz uma compra dia_00 / 00 / 0000 e_ainda não chegou meu_pedido !
negative	!
negative	order 000000000
negative	i decided to use wepay for a surprise birthday_party that i was planning for my fiance in hawaii to collect all of the funds for the group tickets as hawaii airlines allows one point of contact to purchase the tickets only .
negative	wepay seemed to be the most logical choice as it provided transparency of funds for everyone traveling in the group .
negative	i set_up the account in feb 0000 .
negative	at first it was fine , i was able to speak to a live person and they were generally great .
negative	however during the course of the months apparently their policy has changed where you are able to speak to a live person everything is via_email .
negative	they never sent a notification of this policy change .
negative	so noew the trip purchasing date is approaching and ppl are beginning to pay and i check the account and wepay has added a 00 day hold on all funds two_weeks before i have to buy the tickets !
negative	! 0 never mind that i initially had reserves removed when i was able to speak with a live person back in march , but somehow they were added back to the account without me knowing .
negative	i contact them and they ask for more verifying info fb , address etc and they release the funds .
negative	a few_days_later another person pays and again reserves are placed back on the account !
negative	i contact them and now a new person is telling me they need to verify my ss # and so i give them that and i even uploaded the flight contract from hawaiian airlines so that they could see i am not running some fraud event .
negative	i have heard_nothing from them in 0 days and they still have my friends money on hold that he expects to be applied to his ticket which may not occur due to wepay ' s ineptitude in handling online transactions .
negative	they are not better_than paypal , albeit surprisingly worse .
negative	stay far away from this company if you require expediency , transparency and customer_service that involves talking on the phone to a real_person .
negative	ironically they ask for all of this personal_information but you cant event talk to a person ... reeks of shadiness to me and i have placed fraud alerts on my credit_reports as a result as i do not trust this fly by night company that changes policies without informing customers ... a bank or cc company would never do that as you are dealing_with people ' s funds and transparency and information are paramount !
negative	do not use !
negative	!
negative	här är vad som jag har skrivit på deras sida på engelska :
negative	i have booked a flight via this awful company on feb 0st .
negative	since then my flight has been changed several_times because of a problem that the airline was experiencing and they had nothing to do as a third company .
negative	it sounds quite fair in the way they , as a company put it so .
negative	the final change was done , april 00 .
negative	after struggling long enough while asking for earlier flights , i was forced to accept it ..
negative	however i then realised this causes me a night at the airport because of lack of transportations , i called again and asked for a possible change since this was not what i have booked or wanted .
negative	and just then i got informed by them that there are earlier flights ( all of a sudden ) but i need to pay extra for them .
negative	?
negative	?
negative	paying extra for a flight that i have already booked in the very beginning and it has been changed many_times ?
negative	even if i have mentioned in my complaint that i needed an earlier flight which i have already paid for not to sleep in some crappy airport ?
negative	now i am waiting to be contacted again so that i can know how much i need to pay extra for the flight that i have already planned / booked / paid for in the very beginning .
negative	i find this whole policy ugly , careless and rude .
negative	i feel_like i have been fooled .
negative	one does deserve to be treated as a valuable passenger .
negative	not someone that can be milked by some smart company with a careless policy .
negative	please do not use them unless you want priceless anxiety , irritation and waste of energy !!!!!

negative	about a week ago i bought far_cry 0 deluxe_edition .
negative	i received the key via mail and tried to activate it on u play but , the key was invalid .
negative	so i wrote an e_- mail to them and now a week_later still nothing , no response .
negative	i ' m really pissed of about it and just want my money back .
negative	so to all the poeple : don " t buy games at this store
negative	after being told there are cd_keys for battlefield_0 available in stock a second after i purchased 0 cd_keys i was told that now i need to wait up to 00 hours cause there are none any left .
negative	i am sad to inform you that it ' s been almost 0 days now without_any reason given by the company to this shameless behavior .
negative	i paid a lot of money for what i was expecting would be a quality suit , and received a very poorly fit suit of cheap material .
negative	after contacting their support_ticket staff , my conversation with a man named stefano was unhelpful and at times incoherent .
negative	the company refused to correct their mistake , which would do no harm or extra cost to them , and only take mere minutes of their time .
negative	i was hoping to buy more suits and clothing from them in the future , but i no_longer think that i want to do that !!
negative	!
negative	overall , don ' t throw your money away on a suit with this company !!
negative	!
negative	edit_: finally , when i had to leave for business and was going to be unavailable for a few weeks , somebody decided to take over the situation and help me .
negative	because of my leave ( over which i had no choice ), they closed their offer to help .
negative	very unprofessional company .
negative	will update should any changes occur .
negative	yodel was supposed to deliver a phone to me then apparently " attempted " delivery without leaving a calling card .
negative	i rescheduled , they didn ' t deliver and said there was no log of a rescheduling .
negative	this continued for an entire week before they admitted they didn ' t know where my parcel was .
negative	appalling .
negative	these_guys have messed me around big - time .
negative	despite paying a lot of money for air - freight , they allowed my boxes to sit in the uk ( for dispatch to new_york ) for two_weeks , before they sent me an invoice .
negative	despite this delay they have then failed to give me a delivery day or to hurry things along .
negative	no one at their call centres seems to know what ' s going on and no - one seems to want to help either , i am just promised call backs ( some of which i haven ' t received ).
negative	how difficult can it be to put 0 boxes on a plane to new_york from london .....?
negative	in this case it seems nearly impossible .
negative	ola gostaria de deixar aqui a minha reclamacao , gosto muito de coprar na suppz pelo otimo valor dos produtos e as promocaes que sempre tem .
negative	o meu problema e uma compra do mes de dezembro que ate hoje esta no processo e_nao consta como enviado em minha conta entro em contato com a loja e_nao tenho retorno !
negative	!
negative	depois deste problema continuo comprando mais queria resolver esta pendencia
negative	didn ' t even get past the registration stage ......
negative	added items to my basket - the 0 for 0 on swimwear - said all items were in stock - got to the payment stage and the final amount looked too much , was then informed that one of my items actually wasn ' t in stock so i needed to find something else - ok , did that - but then there was a notification saying that i wasn ' t allowed a mixture of cash account and credit account - i thought i had opened a credit account becuase i wanted to use the £_00 voucher - phoned ther customer services and was told that i needed to call back tomorrow to open a credit account or pay for items over the phone but i couldn ' t use the voucher and she couldn ' t amend my account - and you can ' t use the £_00 voucher if you pay for the goods in full .
negative	if i could give this company 0 out of 0 i probably would ..... won ' t be completing my order with isme .
negative	the flowers were of poor_quality .
negative	my complaint was answered , however i was asked to provide photographs as proof .
negative	unfortunately this wasn ' t an option and i couldn ' t take my complaint any further .
negative	they have always been good for me in the past , but this time i don ' t know what went wrong .
negative	so i ordered with them , they took my money .
negative	the flowers didn ' t arrive at all .
negative	so i placed a second order , the service was really poor and then the replacement arrived dead and there were only a few flowers , i did have lots of grass and dead looking trea .
negative	the people from this business are very bad and they tried to bribe me to remove all of my reviews , by stating that i may and i stress " may " be able to have a second discount .
negative	please avoid this really bad flower shop .
negative	avoid avoid .
negative	i had booked a room that slept 0 people .
negative	at the time of booking it was just 0 adults and 0 child but it then changed to 0 adults and 0 child .
negative	i called customer_service as a courtesy to add the 0rd adult .
negative	this would in no way change the type of room i had originally booked which slept 0 people .
negative	the customer_service rep wanted to charge me more stating that when i booked the room i paid a lesser price then what the room currently went for .
negative	why am i being charged like its a new reservation i ' m simply adding a 0rd person to a room that sleeps 0 ?
negative	if we had been adding more people then the room slept then obviously i ' d expect an up charge at the current rate to completely change the room .
negative	not to mention that i had checked the rates just prior to calling and they were actually less_than what i had originally paid .
negative	the rep continued to argue with me about the price so i had her cancel the reservation in which i have to wait for a refund .
negative	i had to re - book my reservation myself in which i ultimately paid less_than when i originally booked but remember the rep was trying to charge me more .
negative	this is all around terrible customer_service that instead of just assisting me and adding a name to the book she caused more of a headache .
negative	i will never use bookit . com again and i will see that others know they will try to screw you over .
negative	don ' t bother calling customer_service instead do their job for them .
negative	booked a trip to disneyworld .
negative	they booked us through delta with a layover in atlanta .
negative	our flight from atlanta to florida was scheduled to leave six minutes after our arrival in atlanta .
negative	thank_god the flight was delayed , otherwise we would have missed our flight to orlando .
negative	the shuttle service desk was closed because we arrived after midnight and the kiosk wouldn ' t scan our vouchers , so we had to pay $_000 to get our family to the hotel , one way .
negative	the agency allowed us to book one bedroom for five people even_though it was against hotel policy .
negative	the hotel had to make an exception in our case because it was already booked .
negative	$_00 a night for a cot .
negative	our itinerary clearly read " 0room 0 beds for 0 people , breakfast included ."
negative	when we tried to redeem our breakfast vouchers the hotel pointed out that they only ever assign two breakfast vouchers per room .
negative	something bookit was completely unaware of .
negative	first day of vacation and i am absolutely livid .
negative	the customer_service representative i spoke with ( after an_hour of transfers and holds ) was completely rude and condescending .
negative	he refused to connect me to his supervisor and would not even repeat his name for me . this agency needs to gather accurate information about the companies they book , present all correct information to their customers , and treat their customers with respect .
negative	do not book with bookitnow .
negative	i will tell all my friends the same thing .
negative	0 days to process order and asked for cancellation ... order sent then !
negative	i only wish i had read these reviews before purchasing from this company , as i can relate to all of the negative_reviews .
negative	i have never , in my entire life , dealt_with a more unprofessional company nor one with worse customer_service !
negative	they clearly just want to take customer ' s money and don ' t care about repeat business .
negative	whatever you do , do not buy from amiclubwear !!

negative	without customers you can go home , you will be an homeless
negative	be very very careful booking from this website .
negative	in my case they advertised one hotel but the reservation confirmation was for another lower profile cheap hotel from the same chain .
negative	firstly the customer_service guy tried to persuade me the hotel listed in the confirmation is the same one i wanted , then after realising they made a mistake on the website blamed me for misreading the advert and refused to refund in full .
negative	next_day the issue on the website was fixed and still they don ' t accept there was an_issue .
negative	can clearly see it on google chached pages though ...
negative	the cancellation_policy said i could cancel by 00 feb when the booking was made on 00th leaving me negative amount of days to cancel ...
negative	rubbish !
negative	still can ' t get my money back !
negative	i ' ve purchased " steamer buddy " from wowcher but wasn ' t satisfied with the product , so decided to return it .
negative	i contacted wowcher customer_service and they came back to me saying they were going to contact the seller .
negative	weeks past but nothing happened , no responce from neither wowcher nor the seller .
negative	i tried to contact them couple more times but all my emails were ignored .
negative	another example of poor service was recently when i couldn ' t book the appointment with the service provider and hence wanted to transfer the money to voucher credit .
negative	no luck contacting wowcher customer services team .
negative	upon return from my flight ( delayed due to weather ) i was a few hours late .
negative	i called to let them know to make_sure i wouldn ' t have to pay for an extra day or overages .
negative	being a frequent traveler , this has happened several_times and previously they have been great .
negative	they said as long as i returned on the same return day on my contract , i was fine .
negative	well upon_arrival , they charged me a full extra day taxes and all .
negative	i was really upset and they refused to let me off property until i paid it .
negative	i have called several_times to speak to a manager and no one has ever called me back .
negative	i will never park here again .
negative	fyi they did this as_well to the 0 other people behind me .
negative	lying thieves .
negative	unacceptable , such a scam .
negative	take me by my word , never ever trust this site !!
negative	they lie and swindle you out of your money .
negative	they take the amount off your card , and when you arrive to the hotel you supposedly booked , there is no reservation to be found .
negative	considering they don ' t have a working phone_number for you to call , you are pretty_much out of luck at that point .
negative	you can email them , but they never get back to you .
negative	so , they have your money and your are left to scrape up extra cash you may not have ( which was the case with my experience ) to attempt to find a reasonable hotel that isn ' t absolutely disgusting , and are left to eat $ 0 pizzas for the weekend .
negative	thank_you olotels for ruining my vacation !
negative	order_#_000000000 from 0 , october 0000 .
negative	never received not a single signal of the item .
negative	fahrer die kein deutsch können , 0 wochen zu spät geliefert obwohl termin stand , angeblich die rechnung nicht beglichen deshalb ständig rechnungen mit mahnkosten , unfreundliche telefontanten , viele streitgespräche in denen der kunde als blöd hingestellt wird , keine ahnung von_dem was sie machen !
negative	total enttäuscht !
negative	leider musste ich ein stern geben um bewerten zu können eigentlich kein stern eher mit minus davor !
negative	at first i was excited to order from parts_geek with all the incentives of fast shipping and great pricing .
negative	once received the part i went to install it and the transmission mount was made incorrectly and caused the bolts to cross thread into my transmission ....
negative	it was a design flaw .... now i not only have the wrong part .... i have to have the threads re - tapped by a machinist .
negative	i sent parts_geek and " customer support_ticket " and a explanation of my situation .
negative	the sent me an ra number with no apology and stated i am responsible for the shipping back .... after trying to contact them by phone ..... " good_luck "!
negative	i would wait 00 min on the phone then the the irv stated i should fill_out a ticket and submit it via internet due to heavy call volume ... hummmm this has been the same response i have received all week .
negative	i would then submit a customer support_ticket .... multiple_times ... no response !
negative	i briefly explained my situation and asked them to please call me in regards .. etc .
negative	and left my contact number .
negative	i have worked for home shopping network customer_service and after having this type of customer_service i will never order from parts_geek again !
negative	i will tell_everyone the same !
negative	horrible horrible horrible customer_service !!!!!!!!!!
negative	for better words .. no customer_service ....
negative	don ' t buy goods from them .
negative	they take_forever to ship .
negative	this is not the first time this has happened .
negative	when you contact them , they give you the same generic response .
negative	this last order is going to take almost 0 weeks to get to me .
negative	it ' s not enough they claim 0 and half weeks .
negative	( which i think is not right ) we ' re a small company of 00 and can manage shipping 0000 orders a day .
negative	добрый день !
negative	покупали на tripsta . ru билеты из иркутска на о . сайпан со стыковкой в сеуле еще в октябре .
negative	через некоторое время авиакомпания сдвинула рейсы на один день и стыковка получилась очень неудобная , т . к .
negative	приходилось оформлять визу в корею .
negative	просили их поменять билет на другое направление , но мне ответили , что авиакомпания , которая выписывала билеты , ничего поменять не может - только вернуть деньги .
negative	поэтому решили отказаться от этой поездки и вернуть полную стоимость .
negative	со мной сразу связалась девушка , сказала что все будет ок , полный возврат сделаем .
negative	00 . 00 . 00 бронь была аннулирована , сказали , что деньги придут в течение 00 дней .
negative	прошло уже 00 дней , а денег я так и не получил - а сумма там совсем не маленькая !!!
negative	по телефону каждый раз говорят , что либо система не работает , либо бухгалтеры разберутся , либо " нужно еще некоторое время , связанное с банковскими операциями "..
negative	по истечении 00 дней связался с авиакомпанией , ответа которой мне достаточно для успешного судебного дела !
negative	в случае отсутствия адекватной реакции со стороны tripsta в ближайшее время , переписка с авиакомпанией будет обнародована и я буду подавать в суд на эту компанию .
negative	так же будут проинформированы все компетентные органы в нашей стране и греции , на территории которой данная компания зарегистрирована .
negative	been promised to have the key before the release_date at max 0 - 0 hours , and as you can see in my opinion , nothing was received and they failed big time , i had to buy it from blizzard store to play it .
negative	i ordered a pair of red shoes in september .
negative	when they arrived , they were pink .
negative	so they said they would correct the issue .
negative	once again , they sent me pink .
negative	so they said they ' d send the correct ones .
negative	now i ' m being told that the red ones are out of stock .
negative	and yet , when you go on their website , i can order those shoes still !!
negative	!
negative	in the mean time , my wedding is in 0 weeks & my dress has been altered for these shoes that they are lying to me & telling me i can ' t have .
negative	i will never order from them again !!
negative	!
negative	bought something .
negative	it did not match the photo on the website .
negative	i asked for a refund and they said i had to send it back to china .
negative	so i paid shipping to send back to china .
negative	they kept the item and refused to refund my money back .
negative	they have not responded to my emails .
negative	no key , no support , no money .
negative	this store should be closed
negative	fatalna obsługa !
negative	zamówiłam sukienkę i okazało się , że jest podarta .
negative	stwierdziłam , że w takiej sytuacji już jej nic chce , wiec ją odesłałam .
negative	do tej pory nie dostałam zwrotu pieniędzy :/
negative	i was sold a invalid battlefield_0 key so i was unable to activate the game to my origin account .
negative	i contacted cjs_cd_keys multiple_times with very little response or help to solve the issue .
negative	so i ` ve got a free domain when they had an offer last_year and now without even suspecting i am forced to pay 00_euros before i can actually cancel my account .
negative	i think they are a money grabber scam hosting " company ".
negative	i don ` t recommend anyone buying from them because the hosting is bad , few options to customise it , and again , very bad and slow as hell .
negative	don ` t get fooled by some promotional offer because you will pay for it whole in the end .
negative	the customer_service cannot do a single thing for you .
negative	they just send your email to some supervisor who apparently responds to one issue a day .
negative	haven ' t been able to use my card in over a week .
negative	customer_service on the phone is full of apologies and no answers .
negative	reporting you guys to the better business buro stop running the company out of your grandmothers basement .
negative	after having tried for two times for my requested refund , i still couldn_’ t get a clear answer .
negative	that ’ s asos for you !
negative	my order for a few shorts and tees were so poorly met , i wondered on what makes them a name in business .
neutral	i wish the website had a decent search feature , and that it didn ' t load all of the pictures one - at - a - time when browsing large categories .
neutral	it was nearly impossible for me to find what i was looking for because the page kept jumping around while the pictures were loading .
neutral	i liked the shopping_experience the last few_times i ' ve_shopped here .
neutral	however , the flats were the only shoes that seemed to not break .
neutral	i got a pair of high heels that broke after the first use .
neutral	i guess as long as you get the flats you ' re good to go .
neutral	synes amazon er en ganske fin hjemmeside , men jeg mener det_er_meget svært_at finde_ud_af hvilke sælgere der sender til dk og hvilke der_ikke gør .
neutral	jeg mener det_er problematisk at jeg først kan se om jeg overhovedet kan få tingene sendt til_mig når_det_er jeg er ved at betale .
neutral	derud over synes_jeg det_er svært_at se hvor afsender kommer fra , dermed er_det svært_at regne ud om man_skal betale told eller ej når tingene kommer til dk

neutral	took a while to receive my key since it was out of stock but in the end i got it after a couple of hours .
neutral	missing items in shipment , website charged me twice , they fixed some issues but it was a frustrating experience .
neutral	will only shop in store from now on , which is great .
neutral	we have many online businesses and refuse to allow any review site to take control of our reputation - if they choose too .
neutral	you are maybe asking for trouble if you sign_up
neutral	*** updated ( after 0 months of usage ) ...
neutral	i ' ve changed our original rating from 0 star to 0_stars .. we ' ve not yet had a negative review and was expecting one or two from known competitors who do this sort of thing .
neutral	if we do receive a fake negative review i am confident now that we can report the review as fake and have it removed without too much aggravation .
neutral	there shipping is to high on some of there stuff
neutral	service is good but abit to slow for me i waited 00 hours before someone replyed at my problem .
neutral	good , but if you comparison shop you can 00 % the time find a better deal be it shipping or more items , amazon is often misleading with the number of items to be sent .
neutral	sipgate ist_für voip ganz gut , allerdings ist die qualität nicht so toll , auch gibt_es immer mal wieder ausfälle oder man hört sich selbst beim telefonieren .
neutral	der preis ist_für 00 . 00_€ für ganz eu ok , allerdings kostet das bei meinem kabel anbieter sogar monatlich nur 0 . 00 €, weshalb ich vermutlich auch kündigen werde .
neutral	das handyapp für android funktioniert fast garnicht , was ich schlecht finde , da man das gut gebrauchen kann unterwegs für festnetzanrufe .
neutral	0 von 0 sternen , weil der preis ok ist und man sipgate überall nutzen kann wenn_man z . b ein laptop hat und_die sipgate telefonsoftware downloadet , unabhängig wo man gerade im urlaub ist .
neutral	( habe es oft in costa_rica , peru und argentinien benutzt und ab einer dsl leitung von 0000 läuft auch die verbindung der gespräche flüssig )
neutral	bei ebay findet man tolle schnäppchen , leider ist ebay nur noch zum kaufen empfählenswert , durch die hohen kosten die ein verkäufer hat lohnt es sich fast nicht mehr etwas anzubieten da man einstellgebühren bezahlt + 0 % vom gewinn abgeben muss , wenn_man als verkäufer paypal anbietet sind es sogar 00 , 0 %+ 00 cent .
neutral	das ebay gebühren von verkäufer nimmt finde ich etwas dreist , der einzige käuferschutz , den man bei ebay wirklich hat ist paypal und durch den hohen betrag bieten immer weniger verkäufer diese option an , so dass bei einem betrug leider nichts mehr helfen kann .
neutral	zwar kann_man bei ebay auf " problem klären " klicken , jedoch bekommt man dann nach einer gewissen zeit die antwort , das ebay nicht helfen kann , weil nicht über paypal bezahlt wurde .
neutral	fazit : da ebay immer teurere gebühren anbietet , werden auch die preise bei ebay teurer von den verkäufern , was schnäppchen nur noch selten macht , aufgrund der hohen paypal kosten , bieten immer weniger verkäufer diese option an und damit ist auch keine sicherheit mehr beim einkauf gegeben .
neutral	daher nur 0 von 0 sternen .
neutral	ich_habe zum ersten mal bei dell was bestellt und_bin recht zufrieden , leider bekommt man kaum treiberupdates für seine geräte und_auch der download ist ziemlich problematisch .
neutral	abwohl ich ein dell pc habe funktioniert der dell downloader nicht , dagegen aber die iso variante oder direktdownload .
neutral	der support ist_sehr hilfsbereit und wenn es wirklich mal eng wird , kann dell sogr auf den pc ( ähnlich wie mit teamviewer ) und so das problem vielleicht beseitigen .
neutral	ich_habe bei dell einen xps 00 mit 0d brille und grafikkarte + bildschirm gekauft , der laptop ist super , die 0d funktion allerdings nicht sehr .
neutral	bestellt hatte_ich ein nvidia 0d kit das den sensor separat dabei hatte , bei dem ansich nämlich auch " duke nukem " kostenlos dabei sein sollte von nvidia , leider bekam ich nur die brille geliefert die für den preis überteuert war , da die brille einzeln nur 00_€ kostet und hingegen das komplette kit 000 €.
neutral	auch scheint die 0d funktion nicht ganz richtig zu sein , wenn_man anvisiert kann_man nie die mitte treffen , man muss mit_dem kurser ziemlich nach links oder rechts gehen .
neutral	ich vergebe dell deshalb nur 0 von 0 sternen .
neutral	man_bekommt bei pearl als kunde sehr oft kostenlose angebote , leider muss man auch bei geschenken 0 € versand bezahlen , unabhängig vom gewicht .
neutral	oft sind die gratis geschenke minderwertig , gehen schnell kaputt oder funktionieren erst garnicht .
neutral	bei einem gratis geschenk , bekam ich sogar einen virus , weil die treiber vom hersteller verseucht waren und dieser deswegen vom markt genommen wurde , leider habe_ich das zu spät bei google gelesen als_ich nach guten treibern suchte .
neutral	als_ich dies dem support mitteilte , kam keine reaktion .
neutral	auch gibt_es erst bei einer ziemlich hohen summe " kostenlose lieferung ", wo viele ab 00_€ schon kostenlos anbieten .
neutral	der_versand dauert je nach bestellung bis zu 0 - 0 wochen und kommt voll gefüllt mit werbung .
neutral	ordered the parts for next_day delivery via_paypal , no e_- mail acknowledgement from gsf only from paypal , parts didn ' t arrive , phone ' d gsf to be told shipment had gone to the wrong depot and they eventually arrived very late the following_day with no appology , was unable to track the shipment .
neutral	i ordered 0 boxes of protein_bars on december_00th .
neutral	it is now december 00rd and i have yet to receive it ( according to fedex probably another day or 0 ).
neutral	the price was unbeatable ( believe me i checked ) however the shipping is way too slow ( 0 weeks is a long time to wait ).
neutral	overall i ' d probably order from pothek again since the savings outweigh the wait time however i recommend ordering far in_advance of when you plan to run out of your stock at home .
neutral	i have ordered off this site before , everything has been fine but i ordered a battlefield bad company 0 cd_key and sadly its not working :(
neutral	awesome service .
neutral	too many ads though .
neutral	some privacy concerns too .
neutral	i was happy to find a goodlooking wood - look skin for my iphone 0 on carbon fibre skins for a very very good price .
neutral	i got it quickly ( live in belgium ) and in good order .
neutral	however , i was a disappointed to see that the skin was not exactly as shown on the site : there are two extra holes on the front of the phone ( i can see why this is necessairy , but i would ' ve like to see these on the picture , since there are more elegant ways to balance them ) and all the ' grain ' of the wood goes in exactly the opposite direction as on the picture .
neutral	this might seem like a detail , i really_liked the horizontal wood grain on the back and got a vertical one instead .
neutral	for real wood , this would be understandable , but not for a vinyl skin ...
neutral	the quality of the skin and the glue is very good , the woodlook is very well done , and the fit on the back and sides is perfect .
neutral	interface is still inferior to airbnb , however .
neutral	also users in brazil generally have no experience with such sites and are very unreliable .
neutral	i chose this company as they supplied the super king sized mattress we needed , had great reviews and their mattresses used coolmax .
neutral	we were worried that a memory foam mattress would make us hot , so coolmax was important to us .
neutral	the purchase was easy , the mattress arrived quickly and rolled up in a way that made it easy to carry upstairs .
neutral	the only glitch was that we sweated like pigs on this mattress , so much so , we need to get a new one !
neutral	this website was cool and full if information , but it has been offline for a while .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	just improve your comunication , confirmation , and updates to customers , im not sure if ill return , i felt very mistreated as a customer who is spending 000 bucks !
neutral	!
neutral	u guys can be better_than that cheers !!!!!
neutral	!

neutral	obrigado .
neutral	clothes : huge_variety of stuff .
neutral	i like how they have a style for everyone , and the pictures are good for inspiration and getting a feel on how they ' ll look .
neutral	but overall , most of the items ( i mostly shop in the <$ 00 category ) are either sized inconveniently or improperly , made of cheap materials , have not been sewn together properly , or they ' ll totally be different from what i had imaged from the pictures .
neutral	i have even bought items from their higher - up selection and from brands like click and dodostyle , but they have not satisfied me either .
neutral	half of the time , i ' ve returned most or all of my order because they didn ' t fit well ( according to the measurements , they should fit ), bad sewing ( the lines aren ' t always straight and sometimes the thread falls out all over the place ), or it just didn ' t feel good due to material ( i once bought a coat that felt like cardboard even_though it was " cotton ."
neutral	overall : a huge_selection that lacks substance .
neutral	customer_service : suburb !
neutral	they ' re friendly , quick , and i have not had any_issues with returning my items or asking about questions .
neutral	shipping and returns : shipping prices are pretty good , given the fact that they ' re shipping from asia , but i still would like to see better shipping rates and choices .
neutral	i ' ve_gotten used to waiting for 0 - 0 weeks for my stuff , so i wouldn ' t mind a few more days and paying for an economy shipping option that ' s going for $ 0 -$ 0 .
neutral	my biggest_complaint is their inability to give you refunds .
neutral	i don ' t mind using credits for physical stores where i can walk in and try the clothes on , but for an online store , it is really inconvenient .
neutral	after my first purchase here , i was so displeased with my items , that i didn ' t want to continue shopping here .
neutral	but alas , i thought i ' d be happy with everything and ordered even_though i was weary about their return_policy .
neutral	now it ' s my 0th time ordering , and i ' m still trying to use up all my credits because i keep having to return stuff .
neutral	if their return_policy was better , i ' d give it an extra star .
neutral	overall : good shipping , but inconvenient return_policy .
neutral	overall : yesstyle has a lot of variety (+) that varies in quality and fit (-).
neutral	their customer_service is good (+) but their shipping rates and return_policy could be better (-).
neutral	would i recommend this to my friend ?
neutral	maybe , but on the verge of probably not .
neutral	although they have styles i wouldn ' t be able to find in an american mall , i just haven ' t been satisfied with all of my attempts here .
neutral	i needed to contact priceline in order to add another name to my hotel reservation since i had been delayed by weather and the other person was at the hotel but couldn ' t be admitted to the room .
neutral	i called priceline on my cell_phone to make the change and found that i needed to use a touch tone phone rather_than my cell_phone to navigate the menu .
neutral	i was at an airport terminal building and had to locate a touch tone phone in order to complete the call .
neutral	this makes no sense to me .
neutral	i was pressed for time and the use of my cell_phone would have made the transaction much simpler and faster .
neutral	i was also talking to a non - english speaking person_who never did get things right .
neutral	i needed information faxed to circus circus at reno nevada and i think it went to las_vegas since it never reached the reno location .
neutral	its cheap , you shoud go there .
neutral	i ordered top secret nutrition ' s 000_% whey and received a free thing of astravar .
neutral	also there are alot of free_gifts that you can pick_up if you want to which is awesome .
neutral	the only problem is that the shipping was 00 dollars and only got more expensive with the free items you choose .
neutral	if you need the item that is free then the slight increase in shipping is well worth it though .
neutral	overall , i think if you find one of the deals ( like free astravar ) it is well worth it .
neutral	but if the price of the product is only a little_bit cheaper_than another site and they have free shipping then it is probably a better bet .
neutral	i am going to keep my eye out for more of the deals and i can almost guaruntee i will be shopping here again
neutral	vous aurez un vaste choix de produits sur spartoo .
neutral	il met à votre disposition un service client .
neutral	i ordered a deep dish pizza from them along with the new jalapeno / cheese bread .
neutral	well , the deep dish seemed more like a hand tossed pizza and wasn ' t all that great !
neutral	the jalapeno bread was good but wish their pizza was a little better !
neutral	i bought a oakley frogskin , the order was done fine , the delivery within the days provided but the frame on the sunglasses had two scratches one of them being right in front of the frame and quite deep / noticeable .
neutral	im a bit disappointing with the product because i noticed the plastic box where the glasses came didn ' t have any sealed plastic or sticker on it so i presume it has being opened before .
neutral	it took about 0 weeks to get in , broke the first day .
neutral	i am keeping it on for now without the main charm .
neutral	this website is just ok .
neutral	it doesnt always give you the best prices availabe , but its not the worst either .
neutral	i ' ve gotta say , if you ' re looking for rare game products or even old gems from the ps0 era play - asia is the site you wanna visit .
neutral	if it ' s an international order it ' ll be slow like a month approx .
neutral	but otherwise reliable .
neutral	your package will come to you !
neutral	when i got my vpn account with them it was kind of slow , then i try wittopia and the same it was even worst , found [_link_removed_] and so far so good good vpn speed and service .
neutral	best prices on the net for supplements !
neutral	the only kicker is that the shipping tends to be pretty high ...... overall though not bad .
neutral	the fast shipping is the best thing .
neutral	my pugs got very sick from the treats that i ordered .
neutral	petflow didn ' t really do anything to look into the issue .
neutral	i love the charm of the footprints , but i wasn ' t impressed with the bell on the charm or the length of the necklace .
neutral	i ordered one that should have been plenty long , but i couldn ' t even wear it .
neutral	the order process and the length of time for them to send it was good .
neutral	i would definitely_recommend this website to unlock the iphone , but the time needed to unlock it is way off .
neutral	it took them almost like a week for them to do it while they said only 0 day at max to unlock .
neutral	the coincidence is that they unlocked the iphone right after i opened the dispute with paypal .
neutral	i ordered two fancy_dress outfits from here .
neutral	one was a roman tunic that was a good fit with good accessories .
neutral	i also ordered a red riding hood outfit that i was very disappointed in .
neutral	the black corset element was padded with foam making it quite bulky .
neutral	it only extended around the front of the outfit and look terrible on and off .
neutral	the mesh underneath the skirt gave it a lumpy , ill - fitting appearance rather_than adding volume to the skirt .
neutral	delivery was fairly fast but a day later than the stated delivery date .
neutral	the website had a large range of outfits however i would be skeptical about buying future outfits from this site as some products are not as good quality as suggested by the pictures and description
neutral	i am always happy how much you can save on supplements on this site , but it took 0 weeks to even ship out my $_000 order , and i didn ' t receive it for another 0 weeks .
neutral	it is vitally important to ship out apo orders as_soon as possible , because after it ships it takes at_least 0 to 0 weeks more than domestic orders to get to its destination .
neutral	plus , spending that much should qualify for free shipping as_well .
neutral	i was very happy to receive my rab summit jacket from the outdoor shop , but when it arrived it looked grubby / dirty .
neutral	i phoned the shop immediately to inform them and they said that it may be the down feathers showing through the jacket .
neutral	fair_enough , but a little strange that no one noticed before sending it out .
neutral	anyway , arranged to return the item in exchange for a replacement ( different colour ) and was told that this would be a ' goodwill gesture ' and that i would not get a refund on my postage .
neutral	as the jacket was worth £_000 i had to send it special delivery at a cost of £_00 !
neutral	the new jacket has arrived and i am pleased with it , although i have a bit of a sour taste in my mouth that they sent me a substandard item to start with then i had to fork out to send it back and get it changed .
neutral	i know i haven ' t shopped here in a while , but i guess i ' ll just take them out completely and unsubscribe to email .
neutral	my order had everything price reduced to beat out some other_websites and so i placed it .
neutral	received confirmation_email with lowered total and then see the next_day a higher total is taken out from them .
neutral	no email or heads up , so canceled my order .
neutral	from the total i think i ' ll just stick with my previous supplier from the last time i reviewed who also has a flat_rate shipping of $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	they have a huge_selection , and lots of great items to great prices .. but my first impression with them ruined my experience with them a bit !
neutral	i tried to contact customer_service , first by trying their live_chat ..
neutral	i had the chat window open for hours - even left it open when i went to bed , but there was no reply in the morning either !
neutral	i ' ve also tried emailing them , but i still_haven ' t got a reply - weeks after .
neutral	this is not acceptable from a shop that has been around for years .. a friend of mine finally got a reply by sending email , but not until she had to be a bit rude !
neutral	!
neutral	they are slow on sending your items out , the tracking system is a bit weird and clumsy .
neutral	but that doesn ' t change the fact that their items are good .
neutral	i had a better experience with customer_service the last time i ordered something .
neutral	i bought a pair of shorts , and was waiting for them to be shipped , when i got an_email from someone - saying it was out of stock .
neutral	i was bummed out because of this , of course , because it clearly said they had it in stock on the site !
neutral	the cs person_who emailed me told me that they had tried to get more from the manufacturer , but to no luck .
neutral	they offered me my money back , or i could change my order if i wanted .
neutral	j ai commende une mercedes et au bout du compte je me retrouve avec_un golf parceke je_suis en retard

neutral	vi boede i tre nætter på hotellet , og det_var udemærket .
neutral	rent og pænt .
neutral	fin morgenmad .
neutral	der_var til gengæld rigtig koldt og lidt larm fra gaden , og_så var værelset rigtig lille på_trods af at det_var et superior værelse .
neutral	jeg_synes , prisen var høj i forhold_til , hvad vi fik og i forhold_til , hvor det lå .
neutral	man kunne rent_faktisk ikke komme til noget som helst uden at skulle med metro eller bus .
neutral	det lå til gengæld tæt på .
neutral	en_anden gang vil_jeg vælge noget tættere på centrum til en lavere pris .
neutral	however i feel they should aloud customers to use more colors n patters .
neutral	after all youre paying like almost 000 bucks for them in some cases .
neutral	great flowers , my mum loved them .
neutral	however , what i didn ' t love was getting a phone call from my mum when she got home from work saying her flowers hadn ' t arrived ( i ' d already told her they were coming )... in the end they did arrive , at 0pm , as noted on my " delivery receipt " sent to my inbox .
neutral	i dutifully called my mum to see how she liked the flowers and she had no_idea they had arrived .. it was now 0 . 00pm .
neutral	my dad , who had been sitting in the front room when the delivery was supposed to have taken place says he heard_nothing , no knock at the door , and certainly no bell .
neutral	so there they were , my mothers flowers sitting in - 0c on the doorstep for an_hour and a half , or what could have been the entire night had i not noticed the email and rang to see how they were .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	your products are always of a high_quality and delivery is fast and efficient however if an item has to be returned i don ' t feel the customer should have to pay for it .
neutral	i shop online a lot and yours is the only company that asks the customer to pay for returns .
neutral	it means that as a customer you lose money despite getting a refund for your item .
neutral	i would seriously consider rethinking your returns_policy as , despite my love of your products i would think_twice about ordering an item of clothing again in case it has to be returned .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	they provide a variety of services that help with cpc and cse and good customer_service .
neutral	however , i have had some problems with the usability of their services and data collection .
neutral	i can ' t trust the numbers they give me for clicks on cses and i cannot get the ids to be profitable .
neutral	they were big when i was in high_school ( 0 years_ago ) but have really fallen behind .
neutral	they seem to try to do what facebook does , but not as_well .
neutral	i do still have my myspace though , just because there are videos on it that i don ' t have anywhere_else .
neutral	i would say overall i would use their service again but they could improve
neutral	on calling customers back , making the ring within the time they say it will be done and understanding what adjustments you are describing to them in the ring renderings .
neutral	they are very friendly and helpful and the overall product turned_out vary good though .
neutral	and the price is right !
neutral	!
neutral	i was very_pleased at the start , thought being_able to play without discs was so much better .
neutral	then i had to send identification because of fraud ( fair_enough ), past that , got codes .... my last one didnt work !
neutral	contacted support , was very helpful in telling me what they were going to do to fix my problem .
neutral	since then i ' ve had lack of communication !
neutral	emails telling me to do something but not how to do it !
neutral	i was then for some reason sent my old code !
neutral	i dont understand how thats going to fix my problem .... time will tell as the sims0 . com site is down for maintenance at the minute .
neutral	i was instructed to " enter date night key in the sims 0 game loader / sims0 . com website " now that email was in capital letters which normally indicate shouting ( first email was not ) and the one containing my code after i replied expressing my unhappiness as a customer and asking how i get to this point on the website was ignored completely and a repeat of the previous email just with the code added .
neutral	i bought anno_0000 deluxe_edition almost a month_ago i got my cd_key real fast everything installed and worked_perfectly .
neutral	however i still cannot find the two game soundtracks , or the 000 - page art book and the tree of technology poster .
neutral	all the extra in game features are there but nothing more .
neutral	i have emailed them about this with no response .
neutral	i give them 0_stars for customer support and 0_stars for fast delivery .
neutral	pleased with the service , prompt and efficient .
neutral	a couple pound more than my regular supplier , but i ' m sure a 0 %_discount will bring it in line :- p
neutral	i have mixed feeling regarding paypal .
neutral	i comes sometimes handy .
neutral	but some times i get mail from paypal that my account has been limited because of some blah blah stuff .
neutral	printer dont work well it knows it not the right ink that its not epson ink replacement
neutral	i have had some good experience with yesstyle .
neutral	they have had some shipping problems but always follow through with what ever fix they give me over the phone .
neutral	cuando vaya por dinamarca , y este , te lo diré .
neutral	gracias
neutral	i very happy from the purachase .
neutral	bra pris , fick mina grejor och hemsidan funkade fint så mycket mer att säga !
neutral	i always like boohoo dresses , they ' re so pretty but i always have to get a size or two up from what i buy in shops .
neutral	why so skinny boohoo ?
neutral	?
neutral	the item was a good price and delivered quickly .
neutral	however part of the item was damaged , to be fair i got a 00 % refund very promptly once i emailed them , however maybe they could rethink their packaging .
neutral	sizing is slightly incorrect too , i ordered a small which it says on the website is a uk 0 - 00 , however it is slightly too baggy to be an 0 - 00 .
neutral	i gave the site a go today and was really impressed with the beautiful bouquets on offer !
neutral	my only issue was with the checkout_process - i got error codes when trying to pay by paypal , when i was trying to look up the shipping address by postcode , and also really struggled to find the promotional code box as it ' s not part of the checkout_process .
neutral	after manually putting in the address and opting for debit_card vs paypal , i got there eventually !
neutral	i ' m editing my review to reflect what my experience has been since our case was taken up by michael , the president of nsc .
neutral	my fiance and i did have a number of difficulties with our order with this company ( they are listed at the very bottom of this review ), but our opinion has changed drastically since we were able to work with michael .
neutral	our belief is that the vast majority of people_who work with nsc receive a perfect order on the first go around and that when our order had problems , their existing infrastructure was really not adequate to deal with them .
neutral	now , i will say that i hope our rep has learned a lesson about how to treat customers because we were quite understanding and had very simple requests that she chose not to follow_up on ( emailing us when it arrived , calling us once it was time to re - do the ring for the third time , and making sure to look at the ring herself before it was shipped out ).
neutral	that said , our experience with michael has absolutely been perfect .
neutral	not only was he incredibly apologetic over the phone to both my fiance and myself , individually , he also asked us both individually to explain exactly_what had happened from our personal perspectives and really took the time to express to us how much he regretted what our experience had been .
neutral	he offered us a 00 %_discount on our ring in addition to providing a written lifetime guarantee that we could send the ring back to be re - finished for no charge and also guaranteed that if we decided to change the band from platinum to white gold at some point in the future that his company would remake the band and refund us the difference in the costs of the metal .
neutral	we chose not to accept the discount , though we appreciated that it was offered , because we never wanted to pay less for our ring -- we just wanted what we had ordered and we wanted someone at the company to care about us and our ring .
neutral	we wanted to feel_like we were being treated like people by someone_who cared .
neutral	once we got in touch with michael -- which we did on our first try this past monday -- things were taken_care of incredibly quickly .
neutral	in fact , i am wearing my ring right now ( it arrived last_night along with a beautiful pendant necklace that michael sent to apologize ) and it looks perfect .
neutral	i now regret that we spent so much time dealing_with our rep and realize that we should have taken it higher up the chain much sooner .
neutral	in spite of our frustrations , i still support this company because it is a small business and i really believe our experience was a reflection of the fact that it is experiencing growing pains .
neutral	i ' m sure our rep had tons of other orders she was dealing_with and i really think that our experience was a wake_up call for the company that they need to grow their staff in order to take on increasing demand .
neutral	i really hope that no one else will have to deal with what we did , but at the end of the day we now have the ring that we wanted and we have the comfort of knowing that michael is supporting us and is on our side .
neutral	it ' s kind of funny how much it matters for purchases like engagement_rings to be sure that the people you ' re buying from care not just about the money you ' ll be giving them , but about you .
neutral	i ' m leaving the basics of my original review below so that other customers can see what our experience was .
neutral	still , i am greatly comforted in having spoken with michael personally and i am certain that this is a company with strong potential and with beautiful pieces to offer .
neutral	i hope that my review will be an anomaly and that the company can learn and grow from our experience .
neutral	my only advice would be that if other customers begin to face difficulties ( which , again , i don ' t believe many do based on other reviews and also based on michael ' s reaction , calling our experience " his worst nightmare " and expressing his embarrassment ) they should make_sure to elevate their order themselves .
neutral	0 .
neutral	we ordered a ring but they had to ship it undone because it was not completed in time for our engagement .
neutral	we understood and sent it back to be finished an re - sized .
neutral	our rep then sent it back and it was finished , but they did not re - size it .
neutral	frustrated , we sent it back again .
neutral	when we got it back it was re - sized but extremely dirty ( black spots all over ) and misshapen .
neutral	this has led to me having a ring for about 0 weeks of our engagement of over 0 months .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	0 .
neutral	our rep was generally quite dismissive .
neutral	when i would send my precious ring back to their store , i would ask her to inform me when it arrived .
neutral	each time i sent it back ( via 0 - day shipping ) i had to contact her myself ( five days_later ) to ask if the ring had arrived .
neutral	the third time i asked that she call me to speak with me over the phone about my ring .
neutral	she agreed she would .
neutral	she never did .
neutral	she also repeatedly used the excuse that she had many appointments and meetings to justify not calling me .
neutral	* i have learned by talking to michael that their reps do not work on commission so as to avoid situations like ours happening .
neutral	as such , i have deleted what i had previously written about our rep dismissing us perhaps because she had already received her commission .
neutral	its not up to my expected but still trustworthy !
neutral	!
neutral	the website is easy to navigate , and it ' s awesome that the provide measurements for their clothes , especially for international costumers .
neutral	that said , while their selection of clothes is pretty broad , their actual stock is shit .
neutral	i wanted to exchange an item for a smaller size , but it was already sold out , even_though i received it not even a week ago .
neutral	what clothe items i save for later also end up being " no_longer available " within a week or two .
neutral	costumer_service isn ' t the best either .
neutral	i called to ask about returns , but their hours are weird , and all i got was an_automated message with bad audio and broken english .
neutral	i tried e_- mailing them instead , and again , i just got another automated message , a day or two later .
neutral	i was buying battlefield_0 .
neutral	the website said 00 . 00 .
neutral	so i put 00 . 00 on my paypal .
neutral	but it wasn ' t enough .
neutral	when i clicked ideal , i saw that the prize was 00 . 00 .
neutral	but besides that , i guess they are ok . and cheap !
neutral	i like that !
neutral	andafter reading all this reviews i was so scared about my order .
neutral	i just ordered 0 pairs of shoes and to my surprise i got everything i orderd all came in on time and im pretty happy with all of them .
neutral	so i would say give it and see what happens
neutral	always been happy with myprotein ' s service and products .
neutral	however , on my last order i was sent " mega green_tea " instead of " mega cissus ".
neutral	not the end of the world i grant you , however considering i ' ve been a regular customer for many years i was not particularly pleased with the service i received to rectify the situation .
neutral	i could either keep the green_tea ( worth £_00 less_than the cissus ) and get 00 % of my next order
neutral	or return the green_tea and get the cissus sent when my protein receive the green_tea .
neutral	again not ideal ; without trying to sound too arrogant , time is money , i ' m very busy and don ' t want to be going to the post_office to buy a jiffy envelope , printing out my free postage sticker etc .
neutral	it wasn ' t my error , yet i have to make the effort to rectify everything .
neutral	just send me a new cissus !
neutral	you ' ve made thousands off me over the years .
neutral	yes i ' m making a fuss over nothing , however ; as a loyal_customer who needs his supplements asap ( like every meathead worth his weight ) i expected better service .
neutral	a good company , with excellent products but with a universal returns_policy that doesn ' t suit everyone .
neutral	easy to find the product you want , but having to send my personal data ( photo ' s of id ) twice , once in april and now again , after being told that my account was safe ... not very fun .
neutral	i needed a key for a friends birthday_gift and am still_waiting for my email to be answered .
neutral	time is passing , and i am getting mad .
neutral	bonjour on moffre de reservez sans frais pour une periode de semaine ensuite on m appelle et on me dit que_je doit payer immediatement par carte de credit pour que ma reservation soit effective cela ma un_peu surpris merci
neutral	the key i received from them is working .
neutral	the anti_- fraud_check thing is bullshit , such a terrible system .
neutral	i requested a pin to be sent for my phone_number twice and didn ' t receive anything yet the system still claimed that i have successfully received the pin , that ' s not correct however .
neutral	and there is no live support , how is this a successful company without live support - _ - ?
neutral	then i had to wait a full night to receive a reply to get my key .
neutral	i wouldn ' t buy anything else off this website though , prices aren ' t that attractive anyhow .
neutral	i ' ll stick to [_external reference ], more efficient , no fraud bs !
neutral	we had leaned on partsgeek to get a hard to find part .
neutral	after_placing the order , the order was cancelled due to availability .
neutral	i bet the part is still listed as in stock .
neutral	would have been better if they would go the extra_mile to cross the part into another brand or try to outsource .
neutral	i have good and bad_experience with them .
neutral	they ripped me off on shipping once - but the rest like 00 times all good !
neutral	ok , now i cannot complain with cdkeywarehouse ' s prices and doubt anyone could however i had a good amount of trouble buying battelfield 0 : le from them .
neutral	firstly when i bought it i received the key the next_day ( which was brilliant speed however ) but when i put it into origin it accepted that it was bf0 : le but it wouldn ' t accept it because it was used .
neutral	later that day i received a replacement though store_credit only to get a site error .
neutral	an online representative later fixed this and gave_me another key which wouldn ' t work .
neutral	i actually ended_up giving the representative my login due to me never owning anything on origin and he sorted it out .
neutral	great service and prices in all but just had a few hiccups ( which nobody else seemed to have mind you , could have been me ... or origin )
neutral	this is all !
neutral	!
neutral	bom dia !!

neutral	tempos atrás fiz a primeira compra , e de acordo como recomendado o produto chegou no prazo e a mercadoria intacta e com isso peguei confiança no site , então resolvi fazer fazer outro pedido , só que dessa vez não fui tão feliz por isso , já faz um mês que fiz o pedido e até agora a minha encomenda não chegou .
neutral	agora eu fico pensando , será que são atencioso só na primeira compra ? o prazo de 0 a 00_dias úteis é só na primeira compra ?
neutral	gostaria que vocês desse uma olhada em meu_pedido pois até nessa momento eu não recebi meu_pedido , o numero da ordem é #_000000000 , fico no aguardo de uma resposta com uma solução ,

neutral	though yesstyle isn ' t the best in customer_service , they ' re probably one of the better sites out there to order fashion from asia .
neutral	they just need better customer_service and more variety to gain five_stars .
neutral	i personaly really like there clothing but i feel that there deliverary takes_forever even_tho it it express it still take quite some time to ship and process the order cause i ordered a few shirt from there and they still didn ' t process my order yet so yeah .
neutral	i hope everything goes well and i get my clothing soon :_d
neutral	i thought my envelopes would be delivered from ireland and would take 0 - 0 business days but were from the u . k and took 0 business days to deliver .
neutral	the postage and packaging was too pricey for that delivery service .
neutral	but i was very happy with the product and was delighted that they had a great selection to choose from .
neutral	got the item fairly quickly which was a top , it ' s a shame it didn ' t fit me what - so - ever , i called them to return it which was fine and they gave_me a reference number .
neutral	i expected a refund a few_days_later which they gave_me as store_credit ( i guess i should have read the fine_print before i ordered ), i rang them to sort out a refund which they said i ' d get after about 00 minutes of explaining that i couldn ' t fit into any clothes on the site which i actually wanted , 0 weeks_later and still didn ' t receive it .
neutral	in the end i gave up and just bought 0 hats i didn ' t really want just to burn the credit which was now useless to me .
neutral	fast delivery gets a +
neutral	tracking your order is another +
neutral	easy returns was a +
neutral	no refunds and store_credit only was a -
neutral	make_sure anything you ordered will fit you and you ' ll have a pleasant_experience , if you ' re like me though and can ' t fit into the clothes then you ' ll have lost your money .
neutral	well the item i ordered was instock status on website ... five days passed and it hadn ' t shipped out .
neutral	i called customer_service left a message never got a call .
neutral	i called back and the service rep was very rude and made it seem like my call was bothering her ... she_said my order would ship the next_day which was a friday ...
neutral	the order didn ' t ship , i called back monday and the new customer_service rep was amazing .
neutral	she apologized for the whole experienced then over nighted my order .
neutral	without her i would have never used the site again .
neutral	she fixed my issue , but im still a little unsure about ordering again .
neutral	it is true you cant_beat their prices but their shipping is a rape job
neutral	i have seen a number of unique shoes that i would like to purchase but they did not offer large sizes which are standard in the usa .
neutral	i decided to shop with bestbuy . com for cyber monday because they had a few really good deals .
neutral	i opted to do in store pickup because i thought it would be easy .
neutral	the ordering itself was simple .
neutral	however , i did not get a confirmation_email or even a pick_up email .
neutral	i called the store later in the day to find out about the order and i was put on hold for 00 minutes .
neutral	when i got to the store it was nothing but issues and annoyances .
neutral	in the end i got the items at a really great deal ( half the price of amazon which is saying something ) so i guess it wasn ' t a total loss .
neutral	however , i have done site to store with several other stores and never had this many issues .
neutral	hi , if someone ask me to say something good about this website , i ' m going to say that i really love the way they deliver things .
neutral	they have been honest , like if they say they going to make it in five days and that will happen .
neutral	i really_appreciate that .
neutral	they don ' t really have as many thing as i want to buy but at_least i enjoy_shopping here .
neutral	i have been shopping here once but i feel_comfortable to shop here .
neutral	they get a cheap shipping , that is soo great ,,,.
neutral	anyway , they are the best !!
neutral	<_0
neutral	i loved ebay but they keep changing the layout and it is just getting to be to much !
neutral	topcashback has been getting gradually worse over the past_year .
neutral	merchants were failing to track , then they stopped paying out with no means of reversing the decision , then topcashback started making you pay for their service & most recently , they decided to change , in the face of established consumer laws , the terms & conditions on one of their cashback offers .
neutral	at the time of redemption , the offer was tracked , but a day later a message was sent out to all customers saying that the cashback was not valid unless the subscription was carried over into a second month , incurring a cost of £_00 .
neutral	the cashback was for £_00 & as such was of no interest to me .
neutral	topcashback have flaunted advertising law by refusing to honour what they originally advertised & i for one will steer well clear of these crooks now .
neutral	update_: topcashback have done a 000 on this recent gaffe & appear to be honouring the original advertised offer .
neutral	i am cautiously raising my rating back to 0_stars & will see how things progress .
neutral	there has certainly still been a drop_off in service since i originally signed_up for this site but hopefully things are improving .
neutral	jeg_købte 0 charles eames stole og_fik dem leveret som lovet .
neutral	dog er der en fejl på som de har sagt de gerne vil starte en reklamation på .

neutral	ive purchased two tickets for tomorrowland first weekend and receive an_email from you guys saying " in may you will receive an e_- mail containing a pdf file with your ticket to tomorrowland .
neutral	you need to print this ticket and bring it with you to tomorrowland , on the day of the event , you will need to exchange your printed ticket for a wristband at the festival ’ s box office located at tomorrowland ’ s main entrance ."
neutral	this now june , still i have not receive any email nor pdf files at all .
neutral	i am very concern about this , ive also booked my flight and needs some answers .
neutral	ive read some of the answer that you posted on the reviews , you mentioned that the seller are the one who will sent out the tickets to us directly .
neutral	however , in the email you mentioned that we would need to print out the pdf files and exchange it for a wrist band at the festival ' s box office .
neutral	im very much confuse of how this would work .
neutral	wish they had more translated visual novels .
neutral	along with all of the other american flight carriers , delta has gone to hell in a hand - basket in the past decade .
neutral	i purchased an international ticket on delta in april leaving in december .
neutral	they changed my flight details at_least four times between april and december .
neutral	now i was flying through a different city and arriving at a different time .
neutral	i said , " hey , if delta can change my ticket without cost , so can i ."
neutral	i called delta and had them change the details of my ticket - without the usual $_000 charge .
neutral	also , when i bought my ticket , they swore up and down there would be no international transaction fee .
neutral	guess what - i was hit with a $_00 international transaction / currency exchange fee !
neutral	i called delta and received a $_00 credit towards my next flight with them .
neutral	yup ,,,,,, easy and fast ,,, recomended to all booking to holiday ,,,
neutral	en effet il est pas mal fait ce site après dommage qu il n y ai pas de google map ou carte interactive .
neutral	i expected to get a cheaper rate as i was buying online i have just reliesed the prices are just like the ones at tesco and when it is getting delivered the price increase even more .
neutral	but the range of product and the speed of delivery was really good !
neutral	!
neutral	not happy with the price increase as had to go else where now .
neutral	could do with a larger amount of the hurricane evo .
neutral	also would be good if u had a creatine , g - glutamine , tuarine and beta - alanin all in one miss that you could add to ur whey
neutral	they are now selling so many things other than books , via other sellers around the world like ebay , which is not good and causing problems .
neutral	the toy i ordered in the us site , shipped by a seller from the uk , looks different than the photo being shown .
neutral	i am very disappointed .

positive	planning a 0 week honeymoon in various parts of europe was made easy with viator !
positive	large , respected company with many good reviews .

positive	i will have more to say when we return !
positive	great prices !!
positive	and the fact that they will match other_companies is awesome !!
positive	i will never order anywhere_else again !
positive	i ' ve made two purchases on cj ' s for fallout : new vegas and the elder_scrolls v : skyrim .
positive	i have been satisfied by both , being extremely cheaper_than the steam versions .
positive	the autokey_system that cj ' s uses is genius .
positive	i recommend this site to anyone_who is a pc_gamer !
positive	great stuff and great prices
positive	good products , nice sales .
positive	the games come , no_worries , they are reputable .
positive	also , they responded quickly to my queries .
positive	the site has a simple process to book the hotels , i think the other site has some complicated process .
positive	for example , i saw the price $_00 for one room , but when i clicked the booking the price changed to $_000 due to service fee or something ...
positive	i ' m traveler from korea so i ' m not good in english and booking american hotel in online ...
positive	but the hostelbookers . com has a simple process .
positive	if the price is $_00 , that price keep $_00 , does not changed :_d i don ' t need to be confused .
positive	and the hostelbookers . com has the most cheap price as i searched online .
positive	every time i make a purchase i know i will get it on a reliable basis .
positive	very nice very good
positive	seriously coffee and books .. what is not to love ?
positive	the prices vary but are generally fair and so far i have never had a major issue with online or in store purchases .
positive	i really_liked using indeed since it grabs jobs from lots of different places and you can sort by date , positions etc .
positive	my only_gripe was not really their fault , since it ' s a job aggregate if the companies listing online have auto - renewal for listings it will say a job is new when it is actually just a re - posted one ... but again that is not indeed doing it .
positive	so one magical day my friend told me where i can find absolutely adorable clothes without_having to sell my soul to buy them .
positive	i looked yesstyle . com up and fell in love with the quirky fashion .

positive	i cant_wait_till i get my new pullover !
positive	i absolutely_love yesstyle .
positive	everything about this site is pleasing , from the selection and quality of the clothes , to the organized and easy - to - use website .
positive	i can browse for exactly_what i need when i need it and even usually get a great deal or find something on sale that ships super quickly , or i can shop around and find something i absolutely_love for a great price .
positive	i can ' t get enough of this site !
positive	purchased an_engagement_ring in the summer of last_year .

positive	this is why i ' m coming_back to brilliance again this time of year to also get our wedding_rings , because this company and its staff know how to deliver the product and treat their customers .
positive	excellent service , i have only found a cheaper price elsewhere once , and i used there low price guarantee and they beat it !

positive	i bought a few things from the company a while back through yesasia , but never really took the time to visit yesstyle when it opened .
positive	the site does appear on many banner links and ads , so normally i become disinterested in it since things of those nature looks to be spam .
positive	a few_days_ago , i saw a banner ad again , and just went_ahead and checked out the site .
positive	yesstyle has a large_variety of choices for men to cater to different_styles .
positive	i was honestly only browsing , but ended_up purchasing a good amount of items .
positive	website ui was easy to use , ordering process didn ' t take too long ( my complete purchase button did take a little while to finalize the order , although i didn ' t really notice since i was alt tabbed ).
positive	i give yesstyle 0_stars since i could not think of anything bad about any processes dealing_with this site .
positive	i , of course , won ' t mind / probably will shop here again .
positive	apparel deals is one of my favorite vendors .
positive	i have ordered a couple of times from them already and i will_continue to do so .
positive	they do have a smaller selection than some other vendors .
positive	however , almost all of the products i ' ve ordered have been good quality and exactly described and pictured on their site .
positive	even when i have had to return something , it was hassle_free and they were quick to respond .
positive	what i really like is that they are always courteous and they will always find a way to work something out with you if there ' s a problem .

positive	the painting i ordered for my living_room was delivered today .
positive	though i am not a big_fan of reproductions in general , i decided to go for the dance at bougival ( artist , pierre auguste renoir ) reproduction since i absolutely_love that piece of art .
positive	i was a bit unsure earlier but now that i see it , i realize that this is a beautifully done piece and i really wish to congratulate the artist on his immaculate attention to detail .
positive	i will order a graffiti piece for my teenager ’ s room next .
positive	i first came_across some supplements from sports_food on amazon . com while idly browsing for some weight_loss options for myself .
positive	i googled them and sure enough , i found their site .
positive	after a few_minutes into browsing the site , i decided to try out their green_tea since it is one of the safest products available for weight_loss and nowadays everyone seems to be using it .
positive	i was not exactly expecting great results but it worked for me .
positive	not only did i lose 0 . 0 pounds in the first two_weeks , more importantly it made me much more alert and energetic which is a big thing for a mother of 0 young kids .
positive	since the product was moderately priced it was perfect for a trial and when it worked for me , i also introduced my husband to it .
positive	once he had lost a few measly pounds , he took the big plunge and decided he would go head - on into dieting and muscle building so that his flab can once again faintly resemble a stomach .
positive	accordingly , he is planning to order few muscle building supplements once he has lost some more weight and settled into a good gym routine .
positive	we also tried their fat burner which was on a special offer .
positive	though it did not suit me much since my digestive system could not take it , my husband found it to be extremely effective .
positive	me ?
positive	i am happy with the slow and steady green_tea and would recommend sports_food products to anyone_who is looking to lose_weight .
positive	their website is easy to browse and their selection of products just perfect – not too few , yet not so many that you get lost in the details .
positive	the product are usually dispatched the same_day and reaches within 0 - 0 days .

positive	my buddy referred me to supplementwarehouse . com about 0 years_ago and it has remained a constant source of muscle building power for me since .
positive	i , too , have been a customer of gnc for many years .
positive	i still go there , in case , i need to re - up at the snap of the finger , but supplementwarehouse blows gnc out of the water in comparison .
positive	the retail prices are nearly cut in half , if not more , and i usually get everything within a couple days .
positive	the shipping_costs are always an eyesore but overall , this site is the best around .
positive	fantastic selection of brands ( even if it ´ s an outlet ), very good quality - a real german quality - and the prices are unbeatable !
positive	right , a delivery from the continent may take a little_bit but it is always worth waiting !
positive	dress for less also give you a voucher to sign_up for their newsletter , so i was able to save a few money .

positive	ciao
positive	this cream is an excellent one .
positive	it is not greasy and made my skin very soft .
positive	after a week of using it i saw big changes on my eyes and face .
positive	i am love with it
positive	by_far the most convenient and fastest cd - key seller i ' ve purchased from .
positive	from creating the account to purchasing my cd - key i spent less_than 0 minutes .
positive	no phone_verification hassle involved and i was able to pay via_paypal .
positive	no_longer_than 00 minutes after i had paid , the cd - key was in my e_- mail inbox and was redeemed without problems !
positive	00 / 00 service
positive	when i first stumbled_upon this site i was browsing the gamespot internet forum ; in this forum a member was asking whether or not this site was to be trusted , other members confirmed that it could indeed be trusted .
positive	i was curious as to why they were asking this , i followed the link to the site , where i was met by ( i hope you don ' t mind me saying ) quite an ugly site .
positive	my immediate reaction was that the site did look a little suspect , as i am used to buying from large companies with flashier websites .
positive	however i decided to look a bit further and discovered that the prices on display seemed too good to be true .
positive	after looking around for a while and debating whether to try purchasing something , i decided to give it a go , after all people have stated it is legitimate .
positive	the serial key i purchased arrived within a minute of payment , and worked_perfectly when entered into steam .
positive	what more can i say .
positive	the price was unmatched and i could not have asked for the serial to arrive any faster !
positive	so what are you waiting for !
positive	this has taught me not to judge a book by its cover !
positive	i have recommended this site to several people_who have all followed up with successful purchases .
positive	i have ordered from supplement_warehouse man times before , and as far as i ' m concerned will_continue to do so .
positive	i always get what i ordered in a timely_fashion , and price is always the best anywhere !
positive	quick and easy !
positive	their website was very easy to navigate , offered lots of selection & had fair prices .
positive	also fun to get freebies with our order .
positive	self explanatory .
positive	i ' ve purchased squaretrade warranties for the last three or four years based on positive_reviews and recommendations , but i ' d never actually had to file a claim .
positive	well in the last 0 weeks or so i ' ve had to file two different claims ( one on a dropped tablet , one for a failing laptop battery ) and both of those experiences could not have gone more smoothly .
positive	they give you all_kinds of options for repairs / resolution , and their phone support during the process is amazing .
positive	i know for a fact that i will_continue to use squaretrade in the future - i just bought two new warranties this week .
positive	never knew much about the company and when i found a motocaddy hybrid bag with £_00 off the rrp and a further £ 0 with sale discount ...
positive	i thought there had to be a catch .
positive	bag came today ( monday ) after only
positive	ordering on friday .
positive	bag is the real_deal and i am very happy .
positive	no_complaints !
positive	used gak to buy a couple of fenders now .
positive	price is very competitive , delivery was prompt and the communication and customer_service and offer and availability for after sales service has been second to none .
positive	they prices are outstanding ..
positive	if you find the same product cheaper they will not only match their price but also beat it by 0_%.
positive	this is my first time but i plan on coming_back for more ..
positive	i already than refered six customers an so far we all are waiting to recieve or products in the mail .. to me there shipping prices are a bit high but when you are recieving the product for a low amount how can you go_wrong with that .
positive	i believe that i will recieve the same progress if i went an spend $_00 . 00 on the same product .
positive	i just ordered from sw for the 0th time , and every time they offer value and quick delivery .
positive	the one time there was an_issue it was fixed and the correct supplement was at my door in less_than 0 days time .
positive	no online venue is 000_% perfect all the time , what sets sw apart was their quick_turnaround in fixing the mistake .
positive	i would definitely order from them again !
positive	im shocked to hear anyone say anything bad about football fanatics !
positive	i love football fanatics been a customer for two years and have never had a problem with them they make returns so simple i really dont ordering from anyone_else !
positive	listen to me football fanatics rules !
positive	i love this site .
positive	they offer great deals on their products .
positive	i highly_recommend them for all your toner needs .
positive	i just got my bo0 steam key .
positive	mind you i live in the united_states .
positive	now at first i had some troubles getting my key because it was stuck at processing .
positive	but i hopped on live_chat and my issue was fixed in a mere 00 minutes !
positive	now if i had to say one thing the customer_service is absolutely amazing and the best !
positive	but don ' t believe those reviews that say negativly on the site .
positive	if you want proof of my my success email me : codymcleod @ outlook . com
positive	g0a thank_you !
positive	i have been using supplement_warehouse for several years and continue to return .
positive	on the rare_occasion that i find a product for cheaper_somewhere_else they always beat it and automatically adjust their price .
positive	i haven ' t ever tried to find somethgin i wanted and not been able to find it here .
positive	words cannot describe_how good this website is !!!
positive	i refuse to shop for supplements anywhere_else .
positive	not only are the products priced cheaper_than anywhere_else , but the freebies are the best !!
positive	honestly , their shaker_bottle is the best thing in the world .... i dont even drink out of the cups in my house anymore lol
positive	when i thought i couldn ' t find the part for my 00 mitsubishi diamante .
positive	i found parts_geek .
positive	i not only found my part , but it was cheap and delivered to my door in about 00 hours .
positive	i love this site .
positive	i purchased a key for fifa00 and received it within 0 minutes .
positive	that kind of turn_around service should be the norm these days ....
positive	the big retailers should take a lead from ultimatum .
positive	so , i get my key in an_email , and try to stick it into origin and it won ' t work ....
positive	i tried 0 times to get it to take ... no dice ....
positive	so i am totally flustered so i go to contact customer support ...
positive	i get through within 0 minutes and after chatting with the rep for 00 seconds , i realized i was trying to put both codes in at the same time like a moron .
positive	after laughing it up with the rep , i was on my way to playing ... great first experience , and i will_definitely be back ...
positive	thanks again !
positive	always fast shipping , and very reasonable for the price !
positive	couldn ' t ask for a better site !
positive	i had bought a 0s from a friend .
positive	for some reason , at & t did not have it in their system and after several calls to customer_service , 0 trips to the store , they told me that i would have to wait for 00 months till it was eligible to be unlocked .
positive	i was about to put it on craigslist , but stumbled onto this website .
positive	i was very hesitant to give it a shot , but after extensive checks on the web for indications of a scam , i didn ' t see any .
positive	i was also leery that myimeiunlock was writing their own reviews but in the end , i took a chance and it was exactly as promised .
positive	the directions were simple as_well as quick turn_around .
positive	do it !
positive	truly an amazing option to buy trendy_clothes from anywhere in the world .
positive	i ' ve been using supp_warehouse for 0 years .
positive	now that they ' ve upgraded their shipping i ' m definitely now going anywhere .
positive	always great prices and the price_matching is unrivaled .
positive	i ' ve called with questions and the staff is always courteous and responsive .
positive	keep_up the great work !
positive	comparecards . com does just what it sounds_like it compares cards !
positive	easily see the cards you want and compare their interest rates , annual fees , and if that card is offering any bonuses which is always nice to get some money back !
positive	i got to comparecards . com first before i apply for any new credit_card and so should you !
positive	i really recommend lightinthebox !
positive	i bought a few things and it was totally_worth waiting 00 workingdays for .
positive	what a quality !
positive	i adoore the makeup - brushes i bought and my new iphone case .
positive	gotta buy more cases from there !
positive	been there done that - i promise you i ' ll visit the page again !
positive	i love yesstyle !!
positive	so many of their items ship the next_day , they have amazing deals , and everything is so cute !
positive	i ' ve tried many other_websites that sell clothing from asia , and they ' ve all turned_out to be flops .
positive	yesstyle is everything i could ' ve ever wanted in a clothing website !
positive	i recommend yesstyle to the moon and back .
positive	happy shopping !
positive	i follow a bunch of shows , some of which are on hulu , while others are scattered at various places all over the web .
positive	watch . io makes it easy to find the episodes i want and go straight to the player .
positive	i also like that they do no have any advertisements and the site loads quickly
positive	made several purchases from this shop and couldn ' t point at any little thing going wrong even if my life depended on it .
positive	always the best prices !
positive	i have bought from there since i ' ve found this online store .
positive	cheap and reliable .
positive	one of the best things is that they always have all in store !
positive	they by_far have the best prices around and also the best service around .
positive	i love when you check out they also give you the extra deals :)
positive	i haven ' t bought a single supplement from anywhere_else in the last four years .
positive	with the 0 percent price_match there isn ' t a better price on any supplement you can think of !
positive	their shipping is fast and priced fairly and i haven ' t had any_problems whatsoever in four years , and to top it off the products are always fresh unlike some other internet stores !
positive	arrived on time
positive	order_#_000000000
positive	had no_problems with the product
positive	recieved the item fast and the price was the best i could of found
negative	for those_who are looking to shop better , i guess fsession is actually a better choice .
negative	although they are just about five years old , i loved the quick shipping and packaging , plus no_complaints for the products sent !
negative	honestly , i shopped so much on asos that i am surprised at their poor services .
negative	it ’ s fsession for me all the way !
negative	on saturday , 00th of october , i purchased a ticket for the killers at the secc , at glasgow .

negative	unless it is posted tommorow it won ' t arrive on time and i paid 000 £ just to be sure i woulld have a ticket no_matter what !
negative	i have emailed viagogo twice , never got a response and when i called them i was told they would contact the seller and email me by the end of the day .
negative	still no email .
negative	i am panicking since i will travel all the way from athens to go to this gig !
negative	!
negative	orderid :_0000000
negative	update_: unbelievable !
negative	have spoken to three agents so far , getting the same reply that they have to get in touch with a separate department in order to reach the seller -- by email !
negative	!
negative	they have emailed me back twice with the exact_same automated email on how they are working with the seller to ensure that i receive my ticket in time .
negative	they obviously never read my actual email !!!
negative	!
negative	i have never_experienced worse service in my life and i have bought various tickets for concerts abroad .
negative	steer_clear .
negative	the most_important thing in a business is to keep the client satisfied .
negative	you failed miserably to keep_up to your promise of delivering the cd - key on release time .
negative	please read your terms & conditions again and rethink them , don ' t try to easy things by offering a " special bonus " or " gift "...
negative	it ' s not about the compensation it ' s about the service .
negative	the compensation it ' s a sign that you failed .
negative	i book a ticket paris to ny , the money was taken from my bank_account but i never received the flight ticket , bravofly took flight ticket from my account plus some charges that was not expected unbelievable to see that - i spent 0 hours on the phone with my bank and bravofly agency at the ned of the day i am still out of pocket of $ 0000 with no flight ticket , worse company ever especially there travel_agent useless
negative	i ordered an $_000 prom_dress from this site , and never got it .

negative	wish is a bunch of scam artists , never shop on the this website !
negative	i bought this beautiful prom_dress from aoisos , and never got it .
negative	they also never responded to any of my attempts to contact them about it .
negative	what a waste of $_000 !
negative	i ' m making a formal report to the fbi for internet scam , and hopefully this website gets shut down .
negative	jeg_havde fået en trådløs udløser i gave , som skulle passe til mit kamera .
negative	da_jeg åbner pakken bliver jeg dog hurtigt klar over at den er fejlpakket , da stikket ikke passer i mit kamera .
negative	i butikken finder de den rigtige frem til_mig , åbner kassen og tjekker , og det_er rigtigt nok .
negative	men så stopper det også .
negative	jeg_kan_ikke få_den byttet uden at vise en kvittering .
negative	fair nok hvis jeg_ville have haft pengene tilbage , men da der_er tale om en reklamation og en gave synes_jeg det_er for dårligt .
negative	da_jeg giver udtryk for min mening på en venlig måde bliver jeg endda talt nedladende til af flere ekspedienter .
negative	en_anden gang spurgte jeg ind_til om de havde cf - kort , og der stillede ekspedienten sig bare op som et stort spørgsmålstegn .
negative	man burde kunne forvente bare et minimum af viden når_det nu er en decideret fotobutik .
negative	i hvert_fald ikke et_sted jeg_handler igen ...
negative	this company has the worst business_practice and customer_service of any company i have had the displeasure of dealing_with .
negative	danielle , a representative of optics_fast , refused to refund my money when i cancelled my order because the glasses i wanted were on back order and it was going to be weeks before they could be shipped .
negative	i was not told this up front and could not wait weeks for a pair of eyeglasses .
negative	please do not consider buying glasses from this horrible company .
negative	world rugby shop is a sham .
negative	hidden charges everywhere .
negative	they deliver outside the u . s through an external company who charge much more than you agree for delivery .
negative	also , the import duties for deliveries to addresses outside the u . s are ridiculous .
negative	you think its a bargain but its not .
negative	stay_away !
negative	i bought an item from cash generator on the website .... it arrived and the items software had already been used and would not let me register it .
negative	i contacted the store and they advised the would contact the original seller to try and resolve this ... i never_heard from them again .
negative	in total i sent another 0 emails after this with no response .
negative	i then tested the item on a friends computer who has the software and the item is completely fault !!!!
negative	i have then since sent 0 other emails and have just been ignored ..!

negative	they don ' t have games in stock but they are promoting it on their website .
negative	i need to wait over 00 days to get a payback from paypal .
negative	they are not replying tickets , they just told me lies on paypal ' s request cancelling panel .
negative	think_twice before purchasing games from this store .
negative	be_aware !
negative	i ' ve tried to contact them numerous_times but have been unsuccessful .
negative	i ' ve submitted a ticket to see what has been going on .
negative	it ' s almost a week since i submitted my first order , so that ' s one more week without my supplies .
negative	this is the last time i ' ll try ordering something from them , if my issue doesn ' t get resolved by the end of the week , i ' ll look somewhere_else for my supplies because i ' ve never had any order issues with the vitamin_shoppe .
negative	i purchased a sunpak pz00x flash at b_&_h in nov 0000 .
negative	the image displayed a flash stand with it and there was no text whatsoever saying that , " accessories are optional ".
negative	i made a claim with customer_service and all they can say was , " oops , sorry about that , is there anything else i can do for you ?"
negative	worst customer_service ever !
negative	on top of that i got different answers from phone reps , which have 0 knowledge on products ... basically , this is the last time i would purchase anything at b_&_h .
negative	imagine if they would screw something up like that on a product worth $ 0000 .
negative	i ' d_rather put my money with adorama , never had any_problems whatsover !
negative	if i could rate this a cero i would , but i only have a 0 option ...............

negative	sucha bad help from the customer sider
negative	habe am 0 .
negative	aug bestellt .
negative	mehrere e_- mails bekommen um den status meines bestellung anzugeben ; das letzte war am 00 .
negative	aug dass sagte dass der sendung in detschland beim zollamt eingegangen ist .
negative	seit dann haben wir nichts von der firma gehoert , und kriegen auch kein anwtwort zu meiner e_- mails .
negative	the shoes was collapsed after 0 day of wearing .
negative	the store is " heng ji fashion ".
negative	store no . 000000
negative	the flowers i ordered for my mum came on great time for mothers_day but look nothing like the picture , deluxe opinion was extra money for nothing and the card i picked was a different card .
negative	i ' m really disappointed , i could of got nicer ones from my local shop for £ 0 .. thought by spending £_00 they ' d be good but some of the flowers was dead before they even got into my mum ' s hands !!!
negative	only_thing right was the mothers_day balloon .
negative	also the customer_service by mail is rubbish as i received emails about 0 different peoples orders ...
negative	totally unprofessional .
negative	since i really needed to get my iphone 0 unlocked from a foreign_country , i had to do it via internet .
negative	i found this service , even_though it was really expensive , i thought it would be quick , like 0 days , since that was stated as the average time .
negative	during the time i was waiting , i got no status_updates , which i would really wanted .
negative	the order was all the time in " order being processed ", which literally could mean anything ...
negative	after exactly two_weeks , i finally received the confirmation e_- mail , saying that my phone has been unlocked .
negative	ik kwam ergens een poster tegen waarop je een sms kon sturen om 00_euro korting te krijgen .
negative	mooi een vlucht uitgezocht , korting toegepast en het resultaat was dat er nog allerlei kosten bij kwamen zodat de prijs hoger uitviel dan van te voren aangegeven .
negative	het mooie is ook nog , de vlucht was zelfs goedkoper op_de website van_de vliegtuigmaatschappij zonder de 00_euro korting , dat is echt belachelijk .
negative	mijn advies luidt ; gebruik de website van cheaptickets om vluchten uit te zoeken en boek deze vervolgens bij de vliegtuigmaatschappij zelf .
negative	some summery in point form .
negative	full review below .
negative	- unethical business .
negative	- empty promises for past 0 days .
negative	- awful communication .
negative	- deletes legit complains on their facebook .
negative	pre_- ordered my cd_key on the 00th feb . been promised we will be getting a key everyday for the past 0 days .
negative	yet , every time there ' s a new batch of keys comes in , they gave a tiny portion of the keys to people_who paid higher price and sell the rest at the higher price .
negative	we all understand sometime stuff happens , but cjs is not doing their best at handling this situation .
negative	instead of acting like a ethical business by fulfill the " pre_- order " request ( some of the order has been placed months prior the release ), they use those new keys to sell it at higher price .
negative	and basically told the pre_- order customers that their choice are : keep waiting , pay higher price or getting a refund .
negative	that is not how you treat your customers , it is totally unacceptable , especially when cjs is intentionally withholding keys from pre_- order customers .
negative	they also have been deleting facebook comments too .
negative	pretty_much all the legit complains were deleted .
negative	it ' s looks like cjs are intentionally delaying the pre_- order request , so we can all get a refund and they can sell their keys at much higher price to cover their loss over that bad batch of the bad cd_keys they got from hungary .
negative	after being jerked around by the customer servers for 0 days i finally got a refund from them and got my key from someone_else .
negative	i sent an_email to you on the 00 / 00 but did not get a reply .
negative	our internet_connection has been down for 00 hours today .
negative	they should have told me that the router would need to be reconfigured once the switch was processed .
negative	i am extremely angry as it has cost me £ 0000 ' s in lost productivity , not to mention stress .
negative	i am disgusted with xln and the service i get , time after time .
negative	i have emailed back and forth with smartbuyglasses several_times .
negative	i have asked on numerous occasions for them to call me , and have provided both my order id and my full contact info .
negative	i even emailed the servicemanager @ smartbuyglasses . com address , and still have not received a phone call .
negative	i have had a similar problem as the majority of the poor reviews .
negative	the glasses i ordered were out of stock in the warehouse , and they were checking with the supplier , but they suggested that i choose a different pair .
negative	i sent an_email_saying that if the original frames i wanted were not available from the supplier , then i would like to switch to a different frame .
negative	after no response for 0 days , i checked my order status .
negative	it said the stock of my original pair had been confirmed .
negative	whew .
negative	then i got an_email from them saying that the back up pair i ordered were not in stock , but are through the supplier .
negative	wait ... what ?
negative	so i immediately went back to my order status page .
negative	they have now added the second pair of glasses to my order .
negative	they have not charged me for them yet , but my total on the website has changed to show charges for both pairs .
negative	i understand the wait time , but i still have not received my glasses , nor a phone call to straighten everything out .
negative	i cannot even get a straight answer form the famed "< private data removed >" who seems to be the only rep they have .
negative	all i want is to have my original order , and a phone call .
negative	i ordered my 0 year_old the blue mermaid costume and it says it fits a 0 - 0 year_old .
negative	i couldn ' t even get it over her head and she is skinny .
negative	i measured it and looked at what they said their measurements were and they were half the size they stated .
negative	customer_service sent me an_email_saying sorry you opened it and we don ' t except products that have been opened .
negative	wow , i unsnapped the bag , very bad practice .
negative	good thing i didn ' t pay more than $_00 .
negative	it was also very cheaply_made .
negative	the shower enclosure and tray that i purchased from bath empire resulted in me having to replace a large part of my kitchen ceiling !
negative	the waste pipe supplied was faulty and resulted in a large leak and i was unable to use the shower until it was fixed , which approx 0 weeks in total .
negative	i found this extremely difficult as i initially had the shower installed due to being heavily pregnant and with an existing disability found bathing difficult .
negative	the added stress and expense at this time was extremely upsetting .
negative	i contacted bath empire sales team for a response but was totally ignored !
negative	if you ' re looking for quality products and service you ' ll not find them with bath empire , steer well clear !
negative	!
negative	got the key within a few_minutes .
negative	whole_process was smooth and straight_forward just as it should be .
negative	good job !
negative	edit_: the key i received was already registered with another account .
negative	just lost £_00 .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	i don ' t like how i order something and not get it till next month .
negative	disgusting , disgusting , disgusting !
negative	the worst customer_service ever .
negative	i tried_calling the supervisor few_times no one is calling me back .
negative	i ordered bathing suits based on their size_chart which is completely incorrect and they run so small .
negative	nothing was specified and they don ' t want to exchange for a bigger size .
negative	i have no words to say how disappointed i am with their customer_service and their treatment to the customers .
negative	they are liers .
negative	every time i called they would say supervisor is out of her desk which is complete bs .
negative	not only that their size_chart is way off .
negative	and they are only nice to grab customers money .
negative	the worst ever in my online ordering experience .
negative	da un momento all ' altro ti bloccano il conto e ti ridanno i soldi dopo 000 giorni chiedendo decine di documenti che anche se inviati non vengono nemmeno guardati .
negative	da evitare
negative	worst experience ever trying to buy cat_food .
negative	my prescription didn ' t verify so i talked to my vet to make_sure that it would .
negative	i sent in my information again and heard_nothing from petflow .
negative	i called them , and they said the product had changed to a different bag , and if i ' d like to order that ( like thanks for letting me know ?).
negative	i said yes .
negative	a few_days_later i heard_nothing on my order .
negative	i checked my account and nothing was there .
negative	i called again , and they said there was no record of my order changing .
negative	i took my business elsewhere .
negative	such unenthusiastic customer support .
negative	usually when you call someone should say " hi this is ___ , how can i help you ?".
negative	all i got was an awkward " hi " then silence .
negative	i ordered roses to be delivered today .
negative	it is now 0 pm and i have not received them .
negative	i have called the call_center 00 times ( no exaggeration ) and cannot get a human_being on the line .
negative	after a couple of minutes the line says the wait time is longer_than usual and hangs up on me !
negative	i have emailed them twice and have not received a reply to those either .
negative	i have no_idea where my flowers are or if i am even recieving them anymore !!
negative	this is not okay for the amount of money i spent on them !!
negative	still_waiting !!!
negative	beyond upset !
negative	i will never order from avas again !
negative	they have cheap products but offer no quality control .
negative	if you are one of the unlucky souls that get a bad camera ( as i was on my first try ) their customer_service department is horrendous .
negative	its been a week now and i ' ve called and emailed them every day , every day they have a new excuse as to why they can not address my problems this time .
negative	i recommend never buying from this company .
negative	also their advertising tactics are very shady , just one example :
negative	they send out an_email asking if they have done a good job , 0 options if you ' re happy , or if you are unhappy .
negative	if you click happy it takes you to this site ( trustpilot ) if you are unhappy you never know that the other link was to rate them .
negative	this is why they have such skewed reviews on this site .

negative	i ordered from supplementmarket . com , and received the supplements in a timely_fashion .
negative	however , when the shipment came , i noticed that one of the products was not the same as the one i ordered .
negative	i called them , and somehow their " answering message " girl picked_up , told me that the office people might be busy so the call got diverted to their answering service .
negative	i told her my problem , and she took down my name and number , to forward it to the " office " staff , and they would call me back .
negative	waited a day , and no call back .
negative	the next_day i called again , and surprise , the " answering " girl picked_up , with the same line " give me your contact info " and we will get back to you .
negative	i explained to her it was my second time calling , and gave her the info again .
negative	0 hours go by , its coming close to end of business day , and still no call back .
negative	i called them again a third time , and surprise , surprise , the answering girl picks_up with the same line .
negative	i got fed - up with trying to reach them , cc company will be notied for a swift dispute .
negative	they hire answering_machine people just to take messages ??
negative	would it be easier , and quicker if the answering_machine operators took_care of consumer problems ??
negative	i suspect that they have a very poorly run operation with one person answering phones , and the other shipping items .
negative	they communication and customer_service is the lowest .
negative	i gave them not0 , not 0 but 0 chances to make it right , but they will not listen .
negative	i am an active member of several fitness and bodybuilding boards , and i will make my reviews about this company known to their customer base .
negative	i thought i was ordering a pair of gloves .
negative	boo , on me for not reading the fine_print .
negative	when i looked back on the page where i made the order , it did state one spot that the order was for one glove .
negative	boo , on halloweencostumes . com for being misleading .
negative	the " one glove " fine_print should have more apparent .
negative	who orders only one glove ?
negative	could you imagine ordering only one shoe ?
negative	also , there is no where to indicate if someone wants a right or left glove .
negative	this would have been a fair indicator / notice that i would only get one glove .
negative	i decided to go to local costume store to avoid getting another right glove .
negative	i take online ordering seriously because companies easily rip people off with fees , misleading descriptions , and restocking fees .
negative	i tell_everyone about how halloweencostumes . com is misleading .
negative	ordered some auto parts through amazon , after a month i get nothing .
negative	0 request ' s later they issue me a refund , only to get the refund wrong .
negative	they finally get the refund right , only now , they send totally different parts that i never ordered , in place of the parts that they never delivered in the first order .
negative	at_least they did not ship me an assault rifle like they did to someone in dc .
negative	i bought yellow and gold wigs .
negative	i got red and brown on top of brown and some more brown .
negative	i emailed still no response .
negative	i called nobody is there on a work day and hours .
negative	i answering_machine i can barely understand .
negative	if they did not have the color they should have just said so , not send me left overs .
negative	let me tell you another time i ordered some shoes .
negative	the heel was hammered to death and the glue melted in a heart beat .
negative	a shirt i bought before that was sewed up completely crooked .
negative	one shoulder was wider than the other and the neck was slanted .
negative	i thought it was brand related so i ordered from a different brand recently to see if anything changed newer from the hair colors .
negative	hopefully this is an last opportunity .
negative	if that one is wrong too .
negative	i ' m never coming_back .
negative	did not received 0 orders .
negative	i was very disappointed in the product i received .
negative	it was not what i had ordered .
negative	i had ordered a " decorative line border " locket with text block engraving on the back .
negative	what was sent to me was the " greek key " design with text script engraving .
negative	also , it stated that the locket was 0in by 0 . 00in but the width alone was barely . 00in !
negative	it is very disappointing that i spent $_00 to receive the wrong product .
negative	there is no excuse for this , as the site clearly_states which locket is which and the catalogid on my order detail matches the one on the site for the " decorative line border ."
negative	i suppose it was foolish of me to even give this company my business after i read the reviews online , but i figured i would give them a chance .
negative	and when i emailed them about all of this , i didn ' t even get a response with an_apology , let_alone one that tried to make amends .
negative	honestly , how hard is it to pay_attention to detail ?
negative	i ' m thoroughly frustrated and disappointed in this company .
negative	the product is still acceptable enough to give as a gift - but to pay close to $_000 and have almost every detail neglected , and for it to be on the wrong item entirely , and to not even get an_apology ?
negative	i have lost all faith in this company .
negative	i gave them a shot in spite of what i read online , but they only proved those critics correct .
negative	now i am unfortunately just another critic .
negative	but what do they care , they got their money ...
negative	pathetic
negative	bought a russian key of rage from them , and it ' s not working because they only sent me the sewers dlc key and not the actual game key .
negative	they issued a statement in facebook that their supplier mixed up the keys .
negative	also they advertise that they send actual photo scans of the boxes , which is not true , because i haven ' t received it , only an_email with the key .
negative	without the photo scan , i don ' t have any proof that the key is legit or not .
negative	they are still selling the game on their website without_warning potential_customers that there aren ' t keys available for the game .
negative	until my issue with rage is fixed , i leave a poor rating .
negative	i have made an order with this company and they have taken the payment but will not send my order !!
negative	after 0 weeks the order status remains on ' pending ' without_any explanation .
negative	have written a bunch of e_- mails to this company without reply !
negative	!
negative	company sucks .
negative	so i ordered two different dresses from amiclubwear for my boyfriend birthday .
negative	i was so excited when i received theses two dresses in the mail .
negative	but when my boyfriend and i opened it the two dresses looked nothing like what i ordered what so ever .
negative	so i went back to the web site to make_sure i ordered was what i wanted , my boyfriend and i did a comparing to the dress to the website .
negative	it ' s not at all the same i ' m very disappointment .
negative	don ' t think i will order from this place again .
negative	placed an order on the 00th , chased on the 00st only to be told it had not been shipped and would be with me in 0 working days .
negative	chased a second time on 00st where they still couldn ' t tell me if it has been dispatched .
negative	waste of time on all accounts .
negative	great products , socially inept staff .
negative	didn ' t appreciate the comments about wives and women while i stood next to my husband .
negative	it was offensive ...
negative	especially as we were spending our money at your store .
negative	had we not been in severe need of a the lap top , we would have immediately left your store .
negative	will we recommend the store , depends on an_apology and if there will be change .
negative	i have ordered some wooden blinds and i was first told i would get them 0 days after i ordered them , so i booked the day off , i then was told on the working day before that they wasnt go to be me until the tuesday , so i booked the tuesday off of work , and i have sat in all day waiting for them and i thought something was right , so i phoned up and i have found out that they gave_me the wrong day and that i will get them tomorrow , but this isnt for sure as it is an ' eta '.
negative	i have now used up 0 days holiday waiting in for my blinds .
negative	i am really not happy about this .
negative	i am rather upset about this as i was planning to buy a lot of blinds from this company , but i cant take 0 days holiday everytime i decorate a room .
negative	love the item that i purschase !
negative	shipping took forever though .
negative	and cusomer service rep doesn ' t have the idea how long my item will arrive .
negative	christmas_present that became a new year ' present .
negative	very dissapointed !
negative	on my way to holiday i rented a car via rentalcars . it was a disaster ! they have charged my credit_card imiediatly all two_weeks fare . despite this at hertz company at airport they didnt give me the car becouse they said there was problem with credit_card for deposit . despite i offered cash i didnt recived car .
negative	people at rentalcars phoneline didnt want to help me .
negative	so i rented the car directly at anyother dealer . but now rentalcars that is the broker not rental company !
negative	doesnt want to give my money back they sent me email that i have nonseeng status . i intend to go to court !
negative	i placed my order 00 days_ago and still have received nothing after the first 00 days that they told me would take a something the email and they told me that it would take up to another 00 days but they would do everything possible to get it done as quickly as possible as now been the other nine days and i sent them another email_saying it still has not been completed yet their response was there doing everything they can do but it might take another 0 to 00 days but if i want to spend $_00 i have a rush and i can be done within 0 to 0 why would i pay to have it completed over twice as long as it originally was supposed to be
negative	when i bought diablo_0 i was under the assumption that i had the global eu version , even for that price .
negative	but instead , what i got was a russian limited version where i can only play in russian .
negative	now i have to buy a new gamecode to be able to play the game in english .
negative	i have contacted the website but no response yet
negative	they thought i was a fraudulent customer because my paypal was linked to a different email than my log in , so when it came to buying and receiving a key , they put me through a maze of security_checks that lasted 0 hours before finally giving me the key .
negative	this included sending them a picture of a hand written code , as_well as my drivers licence and other id .
negative	the whole ordeal was incredibly inconvenient and made me very angry .
negative	i ' m still_waiting for my tickets for the upcoming concert this wednesday for beyonce i ' m very nervous because it only 0 days away i bought the tickets 0 months_ago why aren ' t they here by now ..?
negative	i need answers now !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	if you like getting_ripped_off , never allowing any sort of communication , having your account suspended when ever they feel_like it .
negative	paying extremely high fees .
negative	forced repayment when it clearly_states in the ebay posting item is " sold as it ".
negative	getting random emails from them saying they have had a " security risk " and your account info may have been stolen but we are not responsible for any thing .
negative	then by all means use this rip_off of a company .
negative	placed an order for fm0000 ... they charged my card in a few_seconds , and after 0 minutes instead of key they sent me an rejection email . contacting the support , he did not answer my question , and told me to wait for refund . i say ok , i place a seconde order again the same problem .... result = charged 00_euros for nothing .... find another store ... i repeat do not buy from them ... still wiaitng for refund .
negative	i don ' t know if it ' s just my bad luck , but wiggle customer_service has been a nightmare to deal with .
negative	they sent me a scratched wheel – i contacted them about getting a return authorization for it and there was no response for at_least 0 days ( they claim " within 00 hours ").
negative	so i stayed up late ( i ' m based in california ) and finally managed to contact them through their flaky , usually " busy " live_chat , and the person i chatted with said he couldn ' t solve my problem , he could only relay my case to someone_else .
negative	that second person then emailed me and said he / she_said " bear with me while i contact my returns team to arrange a collection for your order ."
negative	after yet another couple of days without a response , i had grown really tired of the ridiculous lack of communication , and was able to sell the wheels locally .
negative	i asked only that they refund the priority dispatch i had paid for , and they confirmed that they did , though after a week it has still not showed_up on my account .
negative	either wiggle has some serious infrastructure issues in their help ticketing software , or customer_service is clearly not in their vocabulary .
negative	i bought tablet pipo m0 pro 00gb .
negative	delivery was ok , although the vat tax in netherlands was not counted in so i had to pay that extra ( 00 eur ) when it went through customs in netherlands .
negative	i ordered a case but it had opening for camera on the wrong side .
negative	i cannot verify specification of the tablet but it barely seems to have the advertised properties .
negative	the display quality is good but the system is sluggish ( slower than my smartphone ), waiting for opening apps too often for too long unless they are already in memory .
negative	still trying to figure_out batery life but so far it isn ' t very good .
negative	orientation of camera in skype is mixed - not rotating properly , always upside down unless rotation is turned on and in horizontal position .
negative	camera quality is poor .
negative	once the device got stuck while opening the google play market . completely unresponsive and no combination of any keys helped .
negative	i had to wait_until batery died out and then turned it on .
negative	i requested a return or compensation for bad quality device but so far no response .
negative	i do not recommend buying from them .
negative	rather pay a bit extra somewhere_else .
negative	i think it is chinese company ( although in usa ) and their customer_service is very poor once the stuff is sold .
negative	the company i work for needed to get some things through paypal and i attached their bank_account and credit_card to my account so they could take_care of some things .
negative	the very next_day my account was limited .
negative	they immediately associated my account with a paypal_account i had 0 years_ago with a negative balance .
negative	because of this , the business is now unable to have their own paypal_account because their bank and card is attached to mine .
negative	after speaking with liz who ' s paypal badge number is 000000 she told me in a recorded conversation that there is no - one at paypal who would be willing to take action and remove the business information so they can have their own account .
negative	even_though their information was on my personal account .
negative	they would not let them take their own bank_account and credit_card off my account .
negative	in short , paypal limited an account after it had been opened for over a year immediately after this business had their information attached to the account .
negative	they immediately found a reason to go after a person by taking advantage of a company .
negative	they could have limited this account any time within a 00 month period but they suddenly choose to limit it today ?
negative	needless to say , i paid my balance and removed the limitation but only because the company needed to have their bank and card back so they could create their own paypal_account .
negative	paypal uses other people ' s money to their advantage , they can limit accounts on the fly , and they do what they want with their users .
negative	paypal is an unsafe system for the business owner to utilize in the terms of they have full control , you do not *
negative	unfortunately their are not that many alternatives to paypal on the market today which paypal uses to their advantage .
negative	they make interest on their account balances and they make a lot of money .
negative	it ' s like they ' re greedy enough to make others suffer .
negative	bravo right , i say this is a poor business_practice and the company needs to think about the way they do business with their users .
negative	i also think ebay needs to think about using another alternative to paypal .
negative	it ' s up to you what you want to use , but frankly i ' d_rather work with a company that works with me like payza , escrow . com , and moneybookers or skrill .
negative	the fact that i take the time to review this experience should be enough for you to not use their selfish and greedy service .
negative	i was also told by liz that i could get a copy of the call since " they record all their calls ".
negative	once i got to the right department , they said i needed to call their legal number at 000 - 000 - 0000 and i ' d have to subpoena to get the call .
negative	my guess is they will destroy the evidence now and say no such call happened .
negative	god the whole company upsets me and what ' s hard is you can ' t get mad at their reps , they are just doing their job which the beast has trained them to do .
negative	i hope this helped some of you make the right decision .
negative	it ' s a gamble , sometimes you ' ll be ok , sometimes not .
negative	when i paid for sniper_elite i expected to be able to play it on the day of release , i thought wrong despite their assurance .
negative	a game being out of stock due to unexpected high demand is somewhat out of their control and is understandable .
negative	however , to be continually lied to and being told " tomorrow ", " full re - stock monday " and then not receiving your cd_key is beyond frustrating .
negative	they lie to you so you don ' t get a refund and go elsewhere , had i have known how long it would of taken , i would of just got it somewhere_else .
negative	edit to their reply : ok then , so you get them " fully restocked " - and then what , i ' m supposed to guess my cd_key ?
negative	?
negative	after a month of emails i received a key to a version that is not even what i wanted so i can sum it up as the worst purchase ever !
negative	i ordered a bag for £_00 an instead of recieving the bag they sent me a £ 0 mug , after ringing up i arranged to have the mug collected and a new bag sent out ( that i had to wait another 0 weeks for after already waiting 0 weeks for the one i was meant to recieve ) they charged me again for the second bag an said i wouldnt be refunded for the first one til they had recieved the wrong item back an even then would take up to 00 days , 00 days after sending back the mug back i still had not recieved my refund , which took ringing up again an to see there was nothing there about even getting a refund back !
negative	got it in the end but certainly wont be using very again , terrible service , avoid

negative	não tem por que passar por esse risco , se existem outras empresas que enviam de forma mais segura !
negative	deixo aqui a recomendação pra healthdesigns , que é a que todos os revendedores de_suplementos atualmente tem utilizado pra importar .
negative	e na healthdesigns tem alguns cupons de desconto que são especiais e valem para todas as compras , não apenas na primeira .
negative	segue o_que tenho usado :_0000000
negative	i am writing this review to help future or current customers .
negative	trust me , do not use this company .
negative	there are so many other_sites that i trust to sell , rent , and buy textbooks from .
negative	textbooksrus claims that they did not quote me prices for my books before i mailed them all in .
negative	you have to be out of your mind to think that i would send in books that were worth ( literally ) hundreds of dollars if i wasn ' t sure i would receive a check !
negative	isn ' t that common_sense ?!
negative	then , textbooksrus says that they only received one or two of my books ... i sent about 00 .
negative	they just " didn ' t receive " them .
negative	i do a ton of online shopping , sales , etc_., and have never had this happen .
negative	the few they received apparently " did not match " the ones i said i was sending .
negative	moral of the story : spread the word , this company is a joke and they will lose your books , say they didn ' t quote you prices online that they did , and claim they never received your books .
negative	it makes me sick to think these bitches are making a profit .
negative	run , as fast as you can !
negative	i will be brutally honest .
negative	booking my hotel was no problem but when it came to changing my reservation it was a nightmare .
negative	i went to my account with my reservation details where i should have been able to change my reservation from 0 rooms to 0 rooms .
negative	no_matter how many_times i refreshed the website or hit the buttons to change it , nothing happened .
negative	so then out of frustration i tried to cancel my reservation by hitting the cancellation button ..... many_times .... again nothing happened .
negative	the next_day i called their customer_service .... not much better .
negative	the connection was terrible and because the reservation technically went through expedia my customer_service person had to call them and call me back to cancel one of my rooms .
negative	this only took a few_minutes but i never received an_email receipt or confirmation code .
negative	the next_day i look at my account and it still has me listed as being reserved for 0 rooms .
negative	so now i try calling back .... and after calling about 00 times with no answer or answering_machine to leave a message i just went straight to the source and called expedia .
negative	expedia took_care of my immediately and sent me confirmation code and email .
negative	will never use this service again .
negative	and the nightmare continues .
negative	a week after being promised a full_refund i still had not received it and decided to call easybook again .... kill me now .
negative	when you call easybook not only do you have to wait forever but you have to listen to the most god awful sound while waiting .
negative	it sounds_like a broken alarm clock .
negative	after waiting for ten_minutes to finally talk to someone i was answered by a girl who couldn ' t hear me due to a bad connection .
neutral	fik dog fejllevering af halvdelen af ordren , hvilket ikke er ok .
neutral	men god service i forbindelse med henvendelsen omkring de fejlleverede varer .
neutral	dog kun 0 *, da den vigtigste ting ved nethandel er , at alt skal være som bestilt .
neutral	ellers ryger fidusen ved det .
neutral	the designs are great got what i ' m looking for , price so - so can ' t say perfect but still great
neutral	upon contacting the rental check - in , they had my paperwork and reservation available .
neutral	there was evidentally an upgrade available for my vehicle which sounded like a decent deal so i took it .
neutral	i then got flooded with paperwork , charges , insurance , and fees not to mention getting precharged for them to fill the gas tank upon return .
neutral	i asked what it was all about and she showed me the paperwork which was ver hard to understand as she pointed out areas that would get refunded upon return split into several categories as_well as charges split into numerous categories as_well .
neutral	all this on top of pre paying online and then trying to figure_out price conversions from us to pounds on the spot .
neutral	this is really my only major complaint as the vehicle itself was nice , clean , and drove well .
neutral	i could say that she seemed helpful but i did not appreciate getting blindsided with all these extras when i had already booked and paid online .
neutral	check in upon return was quick and easy but they took my only paperwork with the breakdown of charges so now i need to request another reciept .
neutral	ons weekendje londen was een ervaring , maar wel erg vermoeiend .
neutral	de heen - en terugreis duurde wel heel erg lang en het afscheidsdiner had zeker een uur korter gemogen .
neutral	ook de in onze ogen te strakke tijdsplanning voor_de dagen in londen had flexibeler gekund .
neutral	een half uurtje meer speling voor het ontbijt was niet erg geweest .
neutral	als laatste minpuntje : een hotel iets dichter bij het centrum zou zeer gewaardeerd worden door menigeen .
neutral	grote respect voor_de chauffeuse en de manier waarop zij ons door het zeer drukke londen reed !
neutral	de gids ( annemarie ) voor_de tour was in onze ogen een groot succes .
neutral	met veel enthousiasme en humor vertelde zij over het heden en verleden van_de stad en het land .
neutral	veel plezier aan beleefd .
neutral	vet inte vad jag ska tycka ännu , bra beställningstid , fyllde i mitt recept som jag har helt korrekt , men_det känns som att det gungar när jag går med mina solglasögon , ska det vara så ?
neutral	känns nog inte som om styrkan är helt korrekt , den matchar inte riktigt den synkorren som jag har på mina nuvarande glasögon , vet inte om jag ska lämna tillbaka dem just nu för något verkar ha gått snett ?
neutral	when i purchased something so expensive , expected much better communication on when it would be delivered & how long it would take .
neutral	it took more than the 00 business days stated to arrive , and they kept giving me the wrong dates when i asked when it would ship .
neutral	this should have been much more transparent , and affected my proposal plans .
neutral	also , once the ring arrived , she tried it on it was far too big , took it to a local_jeweler and found out it was a full half size larger than i ordered .
neutral	value - wise , they can ' t be_beaten offline though , got the ring looked at by someone local and they valued it at nearly 00 % more than what i paid ( pre_- tax ).
neutral	however , i think some of their online competitors like bluenile offer similar prices .
neutral	order date : 00th aug 0000
neutral	today : 0th sep 0000
neutral	this order is marked as awaiting shipment
neutral	however , my money has been refunded before one week , i am not sure the " awaiting shipment " is true , and i think maybe i will never got it .
neutral	and i did not receive the notify of cancel , please give me a reply as_soon as possible .
neutral	key delivery should have been instant , instead i received key 00h later .
neutral	company made a mistake by telling that keys are in stock .
neutral	that ' s not professional .
neutral	on the other hand , they have great prices .
neutral	i ' ll definitely give them a second chance !
neutral	have to wait for a long time for shipping .
neutral	but the products are nice and good material .
neutral	the prices are the best , why i go through them .
neutral	but i did get hit with fraud on both my credit_cards in feb 00 for over 0 grand in fraud charges on each .
neutral	my bank reimbursed the money after a month , it was proven something happened from their site , don ' know if someone sold peoples information or what , happened to a boat load of people at the same time .
neutral	fast forward to now and everything has been ok so far , but what bugged me about that before was trying to get a hold of someone .
neutral	no one answered emails or phone_calls , was a pain .
neutral	the clothes are really cute and somewhat affordable , although quality - wise , there is still a way to go .
neutral	case in point : i first ordered two sweaters from yesstyle last_year .
neutral	one of the sleeves ( it was a knit jumper ) was undone , to my great disappointment , as i unpacked it !
neutral	the sweater itself was made of the weirdest ( cheapest ) knit material ...
neutral	also , the whole 0 - 00 days wait thing is annoying .
neutral	most websites these day don ' t make you wait for so long .
neutral	their shoes are for an asian market , so any woman with feet bigger than a us 0 won ' t find a thing !
neutral	such a shame !
neutral	very very high shipping cost , however prices are actually low .
neutral	customer_service sucks
neutral	i need a working contact number i ordered two tickets to ultra music festival weekend 0 and they haven ' t even been picked_up by ups yet .
neutral	the concert is on fri march 00 and that is only a few_days away
neutral	trans :_0000000
neutral	trans :_0000000
neutral	i need these tickets !
neutral	and a working customer_service number !
neutral	----
neutral	update_:_0000000 has been shipped but what about 0000000 ?
neutral	?
neutral	i purchased 00m ^ 0 of " stadium turf " from onlineturf .
neutral	it was delivered on time , however several ( approximately 00 ) of the rolls were torn and the turf itself was of very poor_quality ( thin and listless grass ) when compared to turf i bought from a local farm last_year .
neutral	i bought 0 tyres in october 0000 for my mercedes - the prices were great , and i found the site very easy to use .
neutral	however , upon visiting the " premier partner " to have the tyres fitted , everything broke_down .
neutral	the garage staff were unfriendly , they didn ' t confirm any of my details , they didn ' t explain the pre inspection process ( the wheels should be checked for damage before fitting ).
neutral	when i returned after 00 minutes to collect the car , the fitter expected me to sign the post inspection form before i viewed the car , and when i pointed out this made no sense he just walked out !
neutral	not what i ' d expect from a " premier partner ".
neutral	i bought a dozen roses bouquet with fillers and a vase .
neutral	everything arrived on time , but the flowers were not as in the picture .
neutral	they were small and the never opened .
neutral	its my first time shopping on this site .
neutral	so many things to choose from .
neutral	i really hope that the clothes fit me and i hope its good quality
neutral	i ' ve purchased some wonderful clothing for my husband , but shipping seemed bit_slow .
neutral	one of the items wasn ' t in stock and i didn ' t realize it when checking_out .
neutral	i like the way you train and work to gain money / fame / items .
neutral	kind of set_up for if you want to spend a lot of time or a little .
neutral	the problem with how games are set_up is , there really is no point to the teams so far , basically it is build you team to be the top_rated team , no league games , championships , etc .
neutral	i can see myself getting bored of this game after i get my player better_than he is now as there won ' t be much more to do .
neutral	it is good most of the time , but occasionally it gets too biased for my taste .
neutral	the cjs staff needs to be more careful about scanning their cd_keys .
neutral	my costume was great .
neutral	a star_wars storm trooper .
neutral	but seriously , no way to go to the bathroom without taking the whole thing off ?
neutral	this was a $_00 costume that i had to cut my own fly .
neutral	these are pretty good and fast delivery but they shouldn ' t charge for delivery should be free
neutral	i bought_simcity 0 or 0 days_ago , paid instantly , and they are still_waiting for payment , even if i got an_email from paypal about that i paid .
neutral	wrote to them on twitter , on facebook , and on their support site , got no response at all .
neutral	this site is so bad now ( i didnt say it is cant be good , just for real ...), i need my key or my money back ...
neutral	edit_: just got my key , working flawlessly , so i ' d give 0 star now , ' couse we seriously cant talk to them , but they will do their stuff .
neutral	so i wanted to change my address of delivery and found it very difficult .
neutral	i was constantly in panic as they stated that if i didn ' t go to my other address and pick the tickets up the next_day they would be destroyed !
neutral	it took me a good 0 hours or so to get the delivery place changed because their customer support is in one word - awful .
neutral	i kept on being confronted by automated messages and i became very irritated .
neutral	in the end i managed to talk to an actual_person and get the delivery details changed , the tickets then appeared early the next_day and i was overjoyed .
neutral	apart_from that , there were no_problems at all and i had a great music festival .
neutral	i am healthy and slim with a waist of 00 inches , my lower belly is 00 inches and underbust is about 00 .
neutral	i had got a size 00 inch corset and it is way too_tight .
neutral	even when i lace to 00 inches , i feel_like i ' m gonna die .
neutral	these corsets are not made for grown women .
neutral	:( the corset i had gotten is " my - 000 - green brocade underbust " it is cute though
neutral	the clothes are usually great , however the shipping options and speed ( my order wont ship out for 00 days ) can be a bit of a hassle
neutral	i am a loyal french connection fan and have always enjoyed their fashion forward lines .
neutral	recently , i was a bit disappointed in the fabric quality on a recent website purchase .
neutral	i ordered 0 articles of clothing , and i was disappointed with two of the articles .
neutral	the fabric was quite thin , and the colors were not as vibrant as how the website depicted them .
neutral	this was a first for me - i have always thought that french connection quality was superior to other competitor brands .
neutral	i will_continue to shop french connection , but only in their bricks and mortar stores !
neutral	bought a ghd straightener for 00 pounds , got a free ghd brush with it .
neutral	good deal / price .
neutral	but the packaging was horrible .
neutral	box was smashed up and only a few pieces of paper surrounding the ghd box .
neutral	i was honestly surprised the straightener worked from the condition of the box .
neutral	i wrote about this on my review for the straightener but hqhair removed this part .
neutral	i was just trying to help them for future shoppers .. international customers please be_aware of bad packaging !
neutral	just think a bit more marketing and products for younger generations of makeup users would be helpful .
neutral	have always had the image of my grandma using these products .
neutral	seems like they ' re trying to do elderly posh .
neutral	i ' ve heard good things about the products just wouldn ' t ever go buy them .
neutral	when reviewing some sites , you can see obvious bogus ratings and ratings from other_sites which aren ' t explained or anything .
neutral	this gives a very unprofessional feeling about the site .
neutral	combining this with the lack of users that write more than 0 review , it doesn ' t make me feel_like this is a site i ' d recommend to other people .
neutral	on the other hand , the site has a pretty good looking but simple layout .
neutral	great game , but the company censors bad posts on their forums and tends not to listen to their ( paying ) users when it comes to deleting or adding content .
neutral	it wasn ' t until after i bought my tickets to see bruno mars that i saw how much bad_reviews viagogo a gotten .
neutral	i ' m really tatting to get worried and i was also curious to why they deliver so close to the event date .
neutral	i like the store and i like the products , but the quality of their website is sub par .
neutral	very slow and overwhelmed ... just needs a lot of improvement before i go thru 00 minutes of processing time to order one product again ... and it wasn ' t my connection speed ...
neutral	it took ages to sign_up , and the website asks for a lot of personal_information , and even a driver ' s license and / or facebook confirmation ( i don ' t put real info on facebook so i had to scan my dl in ).
neutral	it was lengthy , but secure .
neutral	the starting limit ' s pretty low ( after verification , i could only buy $_000 in one day and only about 000 monthly ?)
neutral	so i assume it ' ll eventually increase with more business .
neutral	onto the most annoying part .
neutral	i thought visa only called to make_sure the transaction was authorized for overseas websites but nooooo , visa called and woke me up at 0 am to have me verify the transaction was legit .
neutral	if this happens every_single time i decide to buy $_000 in gift_cards , i ' m just going back to walking down to 0 - 00 and buying the physical cards - because that is a wake - up call i don ' t enjoy having .
neutral	all in all , okay , but super lengthy time .
neutral	required tons of personal_information and resulted in visa giving me a wake_up call to make_sure that i actually did buy this .
neutral	ugh .
neutral	albero modello oregon de luxe , con il cesto copri base .
neutral	l ' albero è bello e di grande effetto , ma ha problemi di stabilità , tende ad oscillare e a stortarsi .
neutral	mi aspettavo un prodotto più robusto .
neutral	la base di sostegno è oggettivamente troppo piccola per un albero di queste dimensioni ( 000 cm di altezza per 00 di ampiezza ).
neutral	inoltre il cesto acquistato ( pubblicizzato con l ' albero ) è troppo piccolo rispetto alla base ( manca circa 0 cm e mezzo ).
neutral	share your opinions , be heard and shop with knowledge .
neutral	with your input , online shopping gets easier by the minute .
neutral	.
neutral	i like yesstyle , but my first order was placed and there was no response for over two_weeks , and then they informed me that they would not be receiving any more stock any time soon , then they cancelled my order .
neutral	just make_sure that your product is in stock before you buy anything .
neutral	i seriously had my doubts about this site and weather i was going to recieve my order .
neutral	i ordered an iphone clone ( hero h0000 ), 0 pairs of fake apple earphones , and a lazer pointer .
neutral	after payment is made , you get a confirmation_email stating that the order will be shipped within 0 days .
neutral	i thought wow , no one told me about this !
neutral	as i had ordered express_shipping for $_00 extra .
neutral	so on the 0th day i still had not recieved my products i think oh no i just got scammed of $_000 .
neutral	i send them an_email explaing what has happened .
neutral	after this they tell me that it is out of stock , when on the site it says in stock .
neutral	oh well .. i wait a week and email again , now seriously worried if my package will ever come .
neutral	support sends me something completely random about texting someone and that i should wait a few more days .
neutral	after waiting 0 days i recieve an_email with a tracking_number plus my shipping info .
neutral	i am very relieved at this point because now theres a greater chance it will arrive , and so it did .
neutral	they pacakaged everything into the phone box which i found incredibly odd .
neutral	the phone comes with 0 batteries and a european / us charger however the us adapter was broken so useless for me , thankfully it is a usb and i used my ipod charger .
neutral	earphones only fit this phone and they were also broken .
neutral	the lazer i got was also broken , and came with no batteries .
neutral	earphones get uncomfortable if worn for more than 00_mins , sound avarage , but they look almost exactly like the original .
neutral	overall experiance is that dont expect great quality , you get what you pay for .
neutral	however this is not a scam site and i did recive my products to the right price .
neutral	i was expecting my iphone_0s skin to arrive in the 0 - 0days i had ordered but was disappointed to know that i was going to get it a while longer , although this is a minor problem ..
neutral	it still should be recognised .
neutral	still_waiting for my skin to arrive !
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	fast , clear and convenient
neutral	i ordered a lot of stuff but its weeks and still not all in stock .
neutral	as regards a previous delivery i would have liked to have been given the option to collect at the delivery depot instead of getting it delivered when im not home
neutral	first order came without a hitch .
neutral	great prices , great deal , and express_shipping for $_000 or more was free .
neutral	a couple things though , returns are not free , no exchanges unless for size .
neutral	luckily there is a return address in mississauga but still , i paid $_00 to ship back 0 pairs of shoes .
neutral	also because of the bogo_deal , i was not able to get two out of the three pairs back .
neutral	yeswalker sends you a $_00 coupon , yes , but you cannot use it with the bogo_deal .
neutral	so i just paid to return two other pairs of shoes for no reason ... sucks ..
neutral	item came quickly , packed in bubble envelope .
neutral	but for £ 0 . 00 this charge for light package of two knobs is really too much .
neutral	priceline is the cheapest hotel site i ' ve found .
neutral	i love the express_deals - i can normally narrow it down to what hotel is available by using location , amenities and the star_rating .
neutral	it ' s well worth it , and a lot easier to guess than simply using name your_own price , where i ' ve been screwed over before .
neutral	the issue i notice though is that if i try to save a buck , i can ' t ever get out of a hotel_room .
neutral	for example , i had a death in the family three_days before a trip .
neutral	they called the hotel who refused to cancel it , and instead would only rebook it .
neutral	incredibly insensitive and i now have a hotel_room for a year in_advance i don ' t think i ' ll use .
neutral	i get that that ' s the hotel saying no , but at the same time does it matter ?
neutral	they barely cancelled a motel i booked when every detail in the express summary was wrong .
neutral	it was stared 0 . 0 / 0 - it was a motel that didn ' t have a lobby and was tended to by people in pjs and no shoes behind bullet proof glass .
neutral	it had 0 / 00 rating - it dropped to beneath 0 before we went , and had reviews of hookers using it .
neutral	the " breakfast " it had didn ' t exist at all - it wasn ' t even like there were danishes .
neutral	there was just nothing .
neutral	the doors didn ' t have bolt locks even_though it was a motel .
neutral	they had to get permission from the hotel which to me is a line of bull .
neutral	i ' ll still use the express to save 00 %, getting $_00 dollar hotel_rooms for $_00 , but i won ' t ever get a non - chain again .
neutral	hi , this is my first time to buy with sky_tours and must_admit , they offer cheap tickets and bookings was made easy and quick .
neutral	however it ' s been 00_mins since i got my confirmation_email and i have not received my e_- ticket yet ...
neutral	it says that my e_- ticket is still under process .
neutral	is this supposed to be like this ?
neutral	how long is the wait_until e_- ticket arrive ?
neutral	i ' m getting a bit nervous .
neutral	i ' ve tried many different domain sellers and as a matter of fact , go daddy hasn ' t exactly been on the top of my list .
neutral	it isn ' t that bad compared to some of the other domain sellers but i wouldn ' t recommend this to anyone , to be brutally honest .
neutral	i won ' t go into detail but i ' m sure anyone_who has experiencing their service would be able to find out .
neutral	i love all the clothes here on yesstyle . com .
neutral	whatever style i ' m looking for is on this website .
neutral	however , the sizing options are so limited that i rarely buy anything because i know the thing i ' m looking for won ' t fit .
neutral	am dat comanda duminica si luni am_fost sunat ca marti ajunge coletul .
neutral	coletul a ajuns joi dupa pranz .
neutral	desi am mentionat ca dorest sa fie montata memoria ram primita bonus , ea a fost atasata coletului .
neutral	nu a fost deloc dificil sa ii montez singur , dar macar nu oferiti un serviciu pe_care nu il onorati .
neutral	cele 0 stele sunt doar pentru pret ( cea mai buna oferta pe_care am gasito la momentul respectiv ), in rest nimic special .
neutral	p . s .
neutral	: ar fi utile mai multe informatii tehnice la produse ( de exemplu layout -_ul tastaturii ).
neutral	laptop -_ul comandat a venit cu tastatura layout uk .
neutral	din nou , nu e capat de lume , dar putina informatie in plus nu ar fi stricat .
neutral	after_placing numerous orders before at over $_000 per order and being a customer for quite some time , i was unable to speak to a manager and no accommodations were made when their staff made an error .
neutral	no measly $ 0 . 00 credit no expedited_shipping no extra samples no nothing .
neutral	after contacting lisa via_email and asking to speak with a manager because i was dissatisfied , i was refused and no attempt was made to go above and beyond for me due to their mistake .
neutral	disappointed and you can even get a manager to speak to you .
neutral	amazed .
neutral	would be great if you guys can tell me how long this will take as i need my iphone unlocked pretty soon .
neutral	waited 00 hours at the moment .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	company sent me a cd_key that was bound to be banned , i contacted them and they gave_me a new cd_key which is working for now , i hope it will stay that way , next time i just start a dispute with paypal for not offering the item description which was 000_% valid and legal cd_key .
neutral	one thing i should add is that their customer support is very good if you catch them online that is , all i asked the customer support representative was why was my cd_key banned and he immediately gave_me a new one , sure it made me wonder whether they were expected this to happen , but still they were very prompt .
neutral	i have had some great prices for pc_games on the site .
neutral	but at time their delivery time is later then advertised and getting a refund is nearly impossible .
neutral	customer_service ignore my request for 0 days ( they kept on saying keys were in stock instead of refunding me .)
neutral	after using a paypal_dispute i got my refund within a day .
neutral	i did the name your_own price thing and got a great deal on the minivan i was going to be using for a couple weeks .
neutral	after i had that van for a couple of week i realized i needed an_additional car for awhile for a daily driver ( i am military and my car had not caught up with me after moving ) so i again went to priceline and got an ok deal on a car .
neutral	the problem came when i went to the airport to pick_up the second car .
neutral	after having already paid though priceline for the second car the car company ( alamo ) told me they couldn ' t rent me a second car while i still had the van .
neutral	after talking with priceline and alamo neither one would refund the difference in the cost or offer an acceptable option that would work with my situation .
neutral	it ended_up costing me about $_00 in all which is why they get three stars .
neutral	i ordered a necklace on 00 / 0 for a christmas_gift and have yet to receive it !
neutral	i have sent a total of 0 emails and 0 voicemail messages but nobody has returned my email or call .
neutral	it is a bit_suspicious that they do not have a legit contact # and do not provide tracking #' s but , i have ordered from there before and was very_pleased .
neutral	i would hate to change my mind due to poor customer_service .
neutral	please provide me a tracking # so i can give my neice a merry christmas .
neutral	thank_you ,
neutral	~ madea
neutral	the range of products is fantastic , with heaps of stuff you can ' t find in stores .
neutral	but be_careful of the images !
neutral	the images are heavily photoshoped , so colours can come out very differently ie something that looks white can turn out to be yellow .
neutral	and fabrics will often be cheap less durable fabrics .
neutral	really inspect the photos , and if in doubt , don ' t get it !
neutral	all that being said i have had some really good buys , with super_fast shipping and usually decent customer_service ( they accept returns for faulty goods , but not colour or appearance variances )
neutral	comprar foi fácil , o único problema é_que eu nunca recebi os_produtos .
neutral	fico muito triste com isso pois , já passaram mais de três meses , e_nada .
neutral	o pior de tudo é_que o número de rastreio não funciona , eu coloco para rastrear no site dos correios a mensagem que tenho é_que_não há dados da compra , e coloco no site muambator , aparece como pacote não rastreável , e pior de tudo é_que fiquei sabendo pelo correio que se a encomenda não é rastreável , eles vem em casa com tres tentativas de_entrega , mas como nao dá para rastrear , a encomenda volta , e_nao tem como eu saber se vieram ou nao , pois eles nao deixam aviso para esse tipo de encomenda .
neutral	é uma grande pena , pois eu faço uso de_suplementos , mas infelizmente fiquei no prejuizo , e_nao tem como comprar_mais , pois nao sei se vou receber , e também nao quero mais perder dinheiro .
neutral	i just ordered my first 00 pound bag of serious mass from them , i was recommended by a friend .
neutral	if all goes well , i will_definately use sw , and serious mass again .
neutral	jeg_har handlet_hos elounge et_par gange efterhånden og jeg er ganske tilfreds_med deres priser , som ofte er_meget lave i forhold_til andre sider .
neutral	de har dog en tendens til ikke at levere til den tid de lover .
neutral	jeg_bestilte to varer ( en hardback tegneserie og en box med fire paperbacks ) som havde en forventet levering på hh . v .
neutral	d . 0 / 0 og d . 00 / 0 ( jeg_bestilte bøgerne d . 0 / 0 ).
neutral	dagen_efter modtager_jeg en email med beskeden om at hardbbacken først kan leveres d . 00 / 0 , hvilket var fint at_vide , men i praksis betød det ikke_noget , da_jeg_ikke havde bedt om , at få_dem tilsendt hver for sig .
neutral	det_var altså stadig d . 00 / 0 , der_stod som seneste leveringsdato .
neutral	d . 00 / 0 modtager_jeg så en besked om , at varerne er sendt af sted og jeg modtager et track ' n ' trace - nummer ( som ikke virkede før tre dage_senere , men_det må vist være det kære postvæsen , der står for dén detalje ).
neutral	jeg_modtog varerne d . 00 / 0 , tre dage_efter leveringsdagen og dette var uden besked fra elounge .
neutral	jeg_vil fortsat handle hos elounge , grundet det store udvalg og de billige priser , men er_det en hastesag , vil_jeg nok vælge at gå til en_anden forhandler .
neutral	i dette tilfælde var det ren hyggelæsning , så den sene levering gjorde ikke den store skade .

neutral	jeg_bestilte to par sko på uksportshoes . co . uk hvor_jeg_fik min varer ca .
neutral	0 - 0 dage_efter .
neutral	kvaliteten_er som den skal være og varen blev sendt som en vareprøve dvs .
neutral	der_ikke kommer told / moms på .
neutral	dog har jeg haft problemer_med den service de tilbyder .
neutral	de tager lang_tid om at svare på mails , og i starten ville jeg annullere ordren , men de skrev bare udenom i besvarelserne .
neutral	desuden bliver skoene sendt fra kina .
neutral	jeg_kan_ikke kalde denne hjemmeside helt fake da de besvarer ens mails og bruger paypal til betaling .
neutral	i enjoy facebook very much , i on the other hand do not like all the changes that have occured .
neutral	i will still be an_avid facebook user , just wish they would slow down all the changes and let the techology paused catch up .
neutral	very competitive prices , but tricky to add 0 flowers arrangements so ended_up doing 0 seperate orders .
neutral	a little time consuming in comparasion to other shopping sites .
neutral	the flowers turned up on mother ' s day as requested and both mums seem pleased with their bouquets .
neutral	i used their web for several_times to book bunch of tickets , it was ok but still needs more improvements in terms of costumers service and their schedule is really tight specially here in us with time differential after certain hours you can not reach any buddy . i hope they will extend it at_least midnight .
neutral	i was really pleased with trips - ta supervisor over in greece matina kalyva she is did really good job .
neutral	the good : 0 % pricematch , tough to beat that .
neutral	the misleading : tons of free crap to choose from .
neutral	i never choose the free_stuff , not even the shaker , adding the shaker to the order increases shipping cost by just over $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the bad : sales_tax in wi .
neutral	shipping is usually more expensive than bodybuilding . com .
neutral	i couldn ' t find a working promocode to enter , i have never had that problem with bodybuilding . com .
neutral	for very heavy orders bodybuilding . com blows sw out of the water on shipping charges .
neutral	overall i keep_coming_back because i live in wi , so i recieve the order very fast .
neutral	the price ( including shipping + tax ) is usually a couple dollars cheaper_than bodybuilding . com , and that is using the pricematch feature .
neutral	not sure if this has any significance but ; i ordered some lg sciences lipotropic protein from bodybuilding . com , taste amazing .
neutral	ordered it from sw ( twice ), taste horrible .
neutral	i spend over $_000 on yesstyle items .
neutral	the only items that i liked were the bb_cream and circle lens .
neutral	i ordered many different scarves from this website , but they either have a funky smell to them or the color is really off .. like really off .. don ' t know about their clothing so i can ' t comment on them but try to stay_away from their scarves .. they might look nice on the website but they might be disappointing when they arrive in the mail .
neutral	champion search_engine .
neutral	but i don ' t like google ' s new privacy policy though .
neutral	they shouldn ' t have done it .
neutral	good just wish it was a little more user_friendly .
neutral	hello my order has not arrived please check gm000000000000000000
neutral	good would that can change the form of payment that is not always euro ...
neutral	think ....
neutral	i loved avast in old days , but it just changed , avast need to be more advanced in these days .
neutral	their virus data base is not up - to - date , it seems lacking most time .
neutral	for me , i switched into avg and kis , they lead in these days .
neutral	the autokey_system is fantastic , but the anti_- fraud system however , is slow , sluggish and dumb .
neutral	if you could speed up the sms feature it ' d be fantastic .
neutral	certainly not the nicest place in the world but overall the service was good .
neutral	the walls are pretty thin and don ' t do much to block the sounds from neighbors or outside .
neutral	i ordered from ami for a couple years a long time ago .
neutral	not surprisingly , after a long absence from online ordering ( aka 0 years ), my account was deleted , but i wasn ' t worried .
neutral	i ' d always received quality items that looked like the pictures on the site .
neutral	as i was going through my email and wondering what kind of dress to get for my little sister ' s sweet 00 , i saw an ad for ami for 00 %_off .
neutral	i decided to order from them again .
neutral	i found a few items that i liked , mainly a lovely teal dress and some sexy pleather like pants .
neutral	i was nervous that i wouldn ' t receive the items in time , so i checked their shipping faq to see how long it took for them to ship , since my sister ' s party was fast approaching .
neutral	luckily it said 0 - 00 days , which was on the cusp , but i felt i could relax .
neutral	unfortunately , it was 0 weeks before i received them .
neutral	which isn ' t horrible , i was just disappointed that the site had been wrong and that i hadn ' t been able to wear the dress to my sister ' s birthday .
neutral	but one the quality , except for the shoes , was horrible .
neutral	the pants turned_out to be hardly anything more than tights , the pink " bandage " dress was just that ... unyielding fabric bandages that was most definitely not the dress pictured .
neutral	it gave absolutely no body hugging ...
neutral	i was very disappointed .
neutral	but the teal party dress i ' d ordered was the worst .
neutral	it was far too long ; even with five inch heels it dragged on the ground and i ' m 0 ' 0 ", so it ' s not like i was too short .
neutral	it was snagged all up and down , there were threads sticking up everywhere , and even had a hole in the side .
neutral	i ' m a crafty person , so i just got some teal thread and patched the hole up and hemmed it myself , but i was still very disappointed .
neutral	especially since i ' ve always had a lot of trust invested with ami .
neutral	now , i just ordered two more outfits and all i can say is i really hope these items are better .
neutral	it seems like it ' s shipping a whole lot faster , except one item hasn ' t shipped with the rest and that makes me nervous .
neutral	i still have faith in you ami , but this next one is a make or break .
neutral	please don ' t disappoint !
neutral	i wish the order came on time .
neutral	my first order from yesstyle got held back for near a month ...
neutral	i know they ship from china but when they say express_shipping i expect it to be fast , oh well , i ordered again for my birthday hopefully it will come faster this time
neutral	good and confiable site .
neutral	but too slow to respond e_- mail or facebook if you need contact .
neutral	i initially requested a saturday delivery .
neutral	the coming saturday was a bank_holiday weekend and was advised there was a chance it would be the following weekend .
neutral	this was reasonable .
neutral	i then got a call the following week asking if i was free to accept the delivery that afternoon , i said no as i was in work .
neutral	i said i requested a saturday delivery .
neutral	i then recieved no call or update and the bed was not delivered .
neutral	it wasn ' t until the following week the delivery slot was booked , with you company not having any record of the previous weeks call .
neutral	the bed was delivered as promised , but your process isn ' t great .
neutral	the delivery company only called me on the day of delivery at 0am .
neutral	surely you could arrange a delivery time during the week instead of waking someone up at 0am to advise them their bed will be delivered later on .
neutral	took very long to arrive , but at_least all my items were there this time
neutral	this site will only post review if they are positive , any complaints at all and they will not post it .
neutral	items usually arrive in a timely_manner and mostly i have been happy with them , but not being honest about the reviews have deterred me from using them again .
neutral	i had a good time there .
neutral	and i could improve my english .
neutral	the only bad thing was the wifi which contaminated me around the clock .
neutral	there are at_least 0 wifi transmitter at every floor .
neutral	and the students use the internet with their mobile phones all the time .
neutral	being there for a longer time might be quite harmful !!
neutral	!
neutral	i bought the " video game princess wig " and it was terrible .
neutral	zero_stars .
neutral	a lot of hair came off of it as_soon as i took it out of the package , and there weren ' t much hair on it in the first pace .
neutral	if you go look at the picture they provide , the hair that is on the model ' s left shoulder is all the hair that this wig includes .
neutral	it was a terrible mullet looking thing .
neutral	just don ' t buy it .
neutral	the " sexy pink princess costume " was awesome .
neutral	five_stars .
neutral	surprised by the quality actually .
neutral	didn ' t look super wrinkly out of the package like a lot of the costumes usually do .
neutral	the costumes came about 0 days ahead of estimated time which was great because it gave_me time to replace the terrible wig .
neutral	i was looking for ipod touch 0 in 0 chargers for my kids ipod ' s for christmas and even_though the ' sellers ' advertised ' free shipping ' or ' shipped in time for christmas ' when i got to check out every time , there was either a $ 0 . 00 shipping charge for a $ 0 charger , or there was some outrageous shipping date like shipped by december_00th .
neutral	i settled for paying the extra cost for shipping to get it here on time , but may just stick to craigslist , ebay , or half . com for my next purchase .
neutral	on two occasions i have ordered products and paid extra for one day or two day shipping .
neutral	on both occasions the products did not arrive on the " recieive item by " date .
neutral	when i contacted amazon they told me that they would ship new orders by next_day air but didn ' t refund the extra money i paid .
neutral	i have flown on delta dozens of times and have been disappointed recently .
neutral	specifically , i took a flight where i had to make a connection and we were stuck because of the weather .
neutral	the individuals tasked with providing information and assistance hated their jobs and made their frustration very clear .
neutral	i saw them speaking to customers in an antagonistic and confrontational manner .
neutral	i was not even offered assistance or information without escalating the issue to a manager .
neutral	first time iflorist user here , but i had the same concern as fellow user jason who said , " will update my score and comments on the 00th of feb
neutral	i have placed an order for delivery on the 00th of feb for the mixed roses , they should be delivered to my place of work so i will post back here on the quality and arrival date , from what i have been reading most of the deliveries make it on the right date but im worried as mine state ' s delivery will be the " week commencing the 00th of feb " and not " will be delivered on the 00th feb " which is what i requested .... i guess time will tell on this one "
neutral	i also requested that my flowers arrive on the day of feb 00th , but it shows up as " week commencing the 00th of feb " as_well .
neutral	i chose free shipping , but prior to purchasing i talked to the online customer_service in chat and they told me that if i selected the 00th that it will arrive on the 00th , which led to my purchase .
neutral	i took a screenshot of the conversation as_well .
neutral	i will be thoroughly disappointed if my flowers don ' t arrive on that date and will update my review after valentine ' s day ...
neutral	the ' price_match ' wasn ' t exactly as they insisted on factoring in the price of mounting .
neutral	i also didn ' t get the ' internet package ' price on the balancing but i didn ' t scrutinize the invoice .
neutral	i still saved $_000 over invoice for the tires .
neutral	next time i ' m going to just use the online process rather_than try to accelerate the process by calling the store directly .
neutral	prices are about the same as anywhere_else but they price_match and take 0 percent off if they are not
neutral	simplyhired comes up with great results and i love how you can sort the result by distance and date posted .
neutral	sometimes though it can be complicated to apply to a posting .
neutral	some of the posting you click on the apply button and it takes you to an outside website that wants you to make a new account or doesn ' t actually show you the full job posting .
neutral	some postings take you to the ziprecuiter website to apply which makes it very easy , but then i find myself going straight to ziprecuiter and cutting out the middle man of simplyhired .
neutral	i understand that you have different levels of partnerships with companies , so the applying process probably won ' t always be the same .
neutral	i will_continue to use simplyhired but it is slightly frustrating at times .
neutral	i ordered a shirt on sunday the 00th selecting the dhl 0 - 0 day priority mail .
neutral	spent the whole day monday being picked , packed but not shipped .
neutral	checked again tuesday_morning which said it shipped on the monday but there was no email notification of this and also no tracking_number provided in the order details .
neutral	emailed and posted a message on the facebook_page to get a tracking_number but no response .
neutral	i would just like confirmation of shipment and a tracking_number so i no when it will arrive .
neutral	order number 00000000
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	would like to see my report updated more often .
neutral	im not to happy with the service thinking about canceling .
neutral	ebay has come in handy so many_times - dress up parties , last_minute furniture ..
neutral	i ' ve only had minimal road bumps with it in the past but overall - pretty good .
neutral	booking on viator is like playing russian roulette .
neutral	you never know if you ' ll win fabulously or get that horrific bullet .
neutral	most of my experiences have either been incredibly fantastic or desperately awful .
neutral	as you do not know who the provider of the tours are , there is no way to check reviews elsewhere to see if these tours are good or not , as many groups offer similar tours with similar itineraries .
neutral	the ones that are really good are amazing !
neutral	great tours guides , great itineraries , etc .
neutral	however , the really awful ones seem to falsely advertise the tour on viator .
neutral	those are the tours where what they promise on viator is not what actually happens on the tours .
neutral	i wish viator would screen tour companies more carefully before offering them to others .
neutral	or have some recourse for unhappy customers to get compensated .
positive	thanks alot
positive	supplementwarehouse . com is the best place to buy your supplements from .
positive	great prices , price_matching , free_stuff and check out and great customer_service !
positive	totally recommend !
positive	i was very_pleased with the easy navigation of hostelbookers ' website , and the fact that i didn ' t have to pay a booking_fee !
positive	it ' s also really awesome that i can cancel up to 0 days in_advance free of charge !
positive	will_definitely continue to use hostelbooker for my travels in europe !
positive	i was a bit afraid at first .
positive	it was 00 of may and my diablo key still was nowhere to be seen .
positive	but i was just being paranoid .
positive	later that day the key arrived as promised and now i can enjoy a great game 0 / 0 .
positive	i enjoyed that they offered so much free_stuff and that they had what i wanted for a cheap price .
positive	they also offer a way to match prices .
positive	i spent a year overseas ordering from bodybuilding . com until a buddy of mine told me he could get the same exact thing i ordered for much less at supplementwarehouse . com .
positive	i didnt believe him until i compared everything i order monthly and realized i was paying wayyyyy too much money .
positive	i ' ll never order from another site again .
positive	i have ordered many tickets through ticket club and not only have i saved in service fees , but they have great customer_service as_well !
positive	i did not get my e_- tickets right after i purchased them , was a little concerned , so i emailed ticket club and they were quick with a response that the tickets were sold before the on sale so i would have to wait_until the person i bought the tickets from actually had the tickets and sent them to me .
positive	i thought it was so cool that i could buy the tickets before they went on sale through ticket master .
positive	i ' m am completely_satisfied with my ticket club experiences !
positive	very good price and fast
positive	this site has such a huge_selection of clothing starting at 00 $.
positive	my go to store for the new seasons , good style and good quality , what ' s no to like !
positive	when my garmin gps sports watch & gopro action camera stopped_working properly .
positive	i was glad i had the foresight to purchase insurance for them using squaretrade .
positive	i called them & they made it very easy & painless .
positive	they took_care of me and made sure my devices were fixed no_hassle .
positive	supplement_warehouse has the best products with the best deals on the internet .

positive	easy to order , quick to come and returned easy with fast payment
positive	i bought black_ops_0 from cjs_cdkeys and had no trouble whatsoever doing it .
positive	autokey had a bit of friction with my phone service provider regarding their verification key , and i had to borrow my roomate ' s phone ( it ' s because mine is a prepaid ).
positive	other than that everything went nicely and took like 0 minutes to get my key activated on steam .
positive	price wasn ' t lowest on market , but i ' d_rather pay a couple bucks extra to make_sure my key is a legit key from a legit source and not some russian black market key that might get banned any day .
positive	would buy again , recommend to people_who want a fast & reliable key site .
positive	this has to be the most reputable key site there is .
positive	all keys are gathered at lower prices and sold to us better_than even steam or origin can .
positive	i feel very comfortable and trust cj ' s with my purchase .
positive	thanks !
positive	use it everyday !
positive	was hoping to use this site for my cd_key purchases but the site says isntant delivery .. never got it .
positive	update

positive	i needed a new engine for my astra twinport engine they had 0 to choose from when no - one else had one .
positive	i learnt a little too .
positive	will spread the word - thanks .
positive	i would say its the most reasonable protein around especially the 0kg bag and its good quality - try it , there ' s lots of flavours to chhose from ...
positive	i ordered a new canon eos 0d from digitalrev .
positive	their security department hit a very small delay in the verification_process , but this was not enough to deter me from enjoying ordering from dr .
positive	they had supurb customer_service throughout the process of payment and shipping .
positive	speaking of shipping , it was blazing fast .
positive	two_days from hong_kong to san_diego .
positive	with their great prices , fast shipping and excellent customer support , i highly_recommend shopping at digitalrev !
positive	very good indeed
positive	denifitely buy again .
positive	alot of my games are from cdkeyhouse and ive gotta say that they are probably the most reliable keystore out there !
positive	these_guys have the best products with the best prices in the industry !!
positive	just got done placing my latest order and when i got the total i was amazed thwt i had some more money left that i could actually order some extras !!
positive	anybody with goals should really use this site
positive	when you order something late on a sunday_night you don ' t expect to see it for a while .....
positive	even_though the thought of that is really sad as you can ' t wait !!!
positive	i was soooo happy then to get my stuff tuesday_morning .
positive	squealing and bouncing was involved .
positive	have to say the whole experience was pleasurable .
positive	the website is split into easy to navigate categories and the checkout_process is simple .
positive	i defy anyone not to find something that they have to buy ...
positive	immediately !
positive	you have been warned !!
positive	:)
positive	very good service and the flowers were very impressive .
positive	delivery always on time , best price in the market and have been using them for over 0 years_now .

positive	they are great , use them all the time .
positive	shipping is very expensive .
positive	they can do better !!
positive	!
positive	excellent service as usual , fast delivery even with the huge demand for me0 in launch day .
positive	i ordered a shirt and a coffeemug on my children ' s behalf , for my husband .
positive	he is never very surprised or enthused about gifts and he was so excited and overwhelmed by his shirt and mug with his babies on them that he got all teary eyed and even wore the shirt to work and to visit friends and family just to show it off .
positive	thank_you so much the pictures and captions turned_out beautiful and very clear .
positive	i was so surprised i thought that because they were so - so quality photos to begin with , that they might be fuzzy but it is crystal clear .
positive	thank_you !
positive	!
positive	i don ' t know if 0_stars is enough for brilliance .
positive	when i purchased an_engagement_ring for my fiancee , i knew very little about diamonds or rings in general .
positive	the website gave_me an in depth knowledge of everything , and the customer_service was fantastic !
positive	it was great to actually talk to a gemologist on the phone .
positive	not only was the service great , but i was able to get a very high_quality ring at a much lower_price than any retail store .
positive	i highly_recommend this site to everyone !
positive	if you are new to shopping online then don ' t worry .
positive	best thing about yesstyle that i love is the huge_variety they have for a bunch of things ( shoes , clothes , bags , beauty_products ).

positive	i will_definitely consider them for any future cell_phone - related purchases i make !
positive	supplement_warehouse is the best in the supplement business , i used to get my supplements here locally from gnc , complete nutrition and even vitamin world until i found supplement_warehouse .
positive	the prices and the supplement choices were unbelievable !!

positive	that ' s including shipping !!
positive	i ' m never going back to gnc or any of them again .

positive	jeg_købte_en stol for ca .
positive	0½ uge siden .
positive	jeg_kunne_ikke umiddelbart finde leveringstiden nogen steder , og derfor ringede jeg til kundeservicen , som orienterede mig om , at jeg_ville have min stol indenfor 0 uger , på det grundlag , at det_var en stol som de havde på lageret .
positive	jeg_modtog så min stol igår i bedste stand .
positive	det_er bestemt_ikke_sidste_gang eg benytter mig af norr00 .
positive	love the gps function -- really set my mind at ease , being_able to make_sure that my family is always where they say they will be .
positive	not to mention that with all of the cyber bullying nastiness going on these days , it is really cool to be able to monitor my son ’ s facebook_page and skype activity and make_sure he ’ s safe .
positive	for me , mspy is worth the money .
positive	very skeptic at first to book through this kind of site .
positive	wasn ' t quite sure what i would get or where .
positive	very easy to find and book hotel reservations .
positive	not to mention an awesome deal !!!
positive	all my expectaions were met .
positive	very worth it and will definetely use again .
positive	i am super pleased with pc_game supply after purchasing a prepaid nintendo eshop card from them .
positive	their verification_process was a lot easier than other_websites i ' ve used in the past ( they send you a pin number via text_message ), and their email delivery of the eshop code was almost_instant .
positive	i highly_recommend them , and will_definately be using them again in the future .
positive	super_fast delivery and well_packaged .
positive	bought me my keys and got them within 0 minutes !
positive	cjs_cd_keys always delivers my keys to email works like a charm just got my 0th key from ther shop no_problems at all
positive	i ' ve searched time and time again to find a cheaper price for supps online , but supplement_warehouse beats any in store and online price available plus even if you did find it cheaper elsewhere they will match the price , can ' t beat it .
positive	shipping takes a bit longer_than i ' d hope for but i just order a few weeks out so it gets here by the time i need it .
positive	i ordered the parts , got them , they work well , and i will come_back to order from partsgeek .
positive	simple and easy
positive	was not sure at first so many online gimmicks that just take your money but this works and i will be back again
positive	if you think this place is full of cheap rubbish , then you haven ' t been in for a while .
positive	only bad thing is the packing checkout thing a bit strange you have to unpack and then repack trolly then move over to another part to pack in bags - fine , saves money but you have to buy bags at checkout !
positive	so how you know how many you need before ?
positive	still , that ' s just a daft problem .
positive	loads of good stuff in there - try it out
positive	who else is waiting for the release of the iphone 0 ?
positive	i can ' t wait although i ' m not sure if it will be bigger ?
positive	thats what they say .....
positive	great place to meet new friend !
positive	cute product !
positive	and it fits the iphone 0 perfectly :) exactly as i expected it to be
positive	definitely the best option to buy asian goodies online , all my orders were send perfectly and the payment_method is really secure .
positive	you ' re doing a great job !
positive	thanks .
positive	this site is excellent
positive	it gives us a feeling of having traveled : traveled through the world ( seoul , hong - kong , taichung , tokyo ...) and traveled through the stores ( clothing , bags , mobile accessories , shoes ...).
positive	thanks to some useful advice ( mix and match , or similar items ), one can definitely find what they ' re looking for !
positive	and the yesstylis blog also brings an added value .
positive	the website design is beautiful and it ' s also easy to use .
positive	the clothes have unique designs and their price can be very affordable ( but some are expensive ).
positive	the only_thing to deplore is that i don ' t have enough money to buy every_single item that ' s tempting me .
positive	hopefully one can create a list of items , " saved for later "...
positive	after remodelling our guest bathroom , we needed our large mirror resized to fit between the new light fixture and the sink .
positive	ryan made it fast and easy .
positive	he trimmed our old mirror down , saving us a lot of money , and hung it the next_day !
positive	i would absolutely recommend ryan !
positive	we will_definitely be calling him again for future projects .
positive	:)
positive	my order was fulfilled within the hour without_any hassle whatsoever .
positive	i used paypal method to pay for my order .
positive	but i didnt have paypal_account so i used the credit xard payment meyhod .
positive	but i only hve debit_card will this be okay ?
positive	will paypal gives out my bank informations ?
positive	and will paypal charges me more money ?
positive	or paypal will just takes out my money without_any reason or notice ?
positive	i wa sunsure but i paid for it anyway but yesstyle is agreat shopping online service .
positive	just awsome !!!
positive	i am very happy for every purchase i have made so far from lightinthebox !
positive	great service and super quality !!!
positive	thank_you lightinthebox
positive	i really love ordering from this site because everything is easy to understand and navigate .
positive	yesstyle is very trustworthy and my items arrive in perfect_condition in a timely_manner .
positive	sometimes i feel_like i would like to ask questions about the product though because ordering something online without being_able to touch or try it on first is a little scary .
positive	the boots that yesstyle has are really pretty .
positive	they have such a variety amount of boots , it ' s like boot heaven .
positive	navigation is really easy and it ' s not hard at all to find exactly_what you ' re looking for .
positive	i definitely_recommend anyone to purchase from yesstyle .
positive	definitely recommending to friends .
positive	there is always a sale or two and the website is user_friendly with many options on how to filter what you can / want to buy .
positive	aside_from the stylish clothing , there are a lot of pictures ( of every angle ) for each item which helps the buyer decide whether they wish to make a purchase or not .
positive	... and it won ' t be my last !
positive	you guys had a great deal going for the latest metro game , and i jumped on it as_soon as i was able , and i ' m extremely happy i did !
positive	autokey was a breeze , and checkout was easy too !
positive	i ' ll be sure to tell friends about the site , there are alot of good deals !
positive	this is a great american company - filled with architectural experts that take the time to make it right .
positive	they worked on hand finishing and antiqueing my door plates .
positive	each was a work of art .
positive	i highly_recommend them .
positive	wow fantastic baby , hello guys out there , if you ' re going to have a date soon then you should get some asian swag .
positive	the gurls love it holla at yesstyle . com <_0
positive	yesstyle is extremely versatile , very reliable , and reasonably_priced ... especially on shipping !
positive	they ' re usually in my price range as a college_student with only so many funds .
positive	plus they make it easy to find what you ' re looking for , suits , sweatshirts , dresses , frills , studs , skulls , roses , you name it they probably have it !
positive	i also really like the fact that they show models_wearing the product and what you see is actually what you ' re buying .
positive	on top of that they usually give you a couple ideas on what to mix and match with the item and i really_appreciate that as i prefer to know how my clothes are actually going to fit which is why before yesstyle i was always really skeptical about purchasing online .
positive	i don ' t shop from other online stores for clothes or accessories ever , not even u . s . stores , because yesstyle has never let me down when it comes to their product .
positive	also the shipping is great !
positive	i ' ve ordered from japanese / korean / chinese / thai stores and i can ' t tell you how frustrating it is to buy something and wait nearly 0 weeks and it ' s still not there .
positive	but yesstyle doesn ' t do that , they tell you when they ' ll be able to ship , and the longest i ' ve_seen 0 - 00 days , but you can always narrow your search to " ready to ship " and it ' ll get to you in about 0 - 0 days after order if you pay the 0 . 00 for 0 day shipping .
positive	the longest i ' ve_seen is five , but that was once and five days isn ' t even that bad .
positive	p . s .
positive	the 0 . 00 0 day shipping is highly_recommended , it ' s a couple dollar difference , but if you live in the states , it can take a while before ems finally decides you can whatever you bought .
positive	no fault of yesstyle , that ' s just my personal experience with ems .
positive	tl_; dr they ' re you ' re favorite store even if you haven ' t shopped with them yet .
positive	if you wanna buy anything related to gaming online , pc_game supply is the site .
positive	amazing , instant and prompt service and easy to use instructions .
positive	absolute delight .
positive	service rapide je recoit toujours mes clé en 0 minute
positive	good job
